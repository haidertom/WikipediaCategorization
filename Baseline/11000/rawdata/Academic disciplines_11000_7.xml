      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2865">'''Aberrant crypt foci (ACF)''' are clusters of abnormal tube-like glands in the lining of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and [[rectum]]. Aberrant crypt foci form before [[colorectal polyps]] and are one of the earliest changes  seen in the colon that may lead to [[cancer]]. ACF are, as opposed to normal epithelial cells, [[apoptosis]] resistant. When looking for aberrant crypt foci with microscopy, [[methylene blue]] is used as a [[staining]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The relevance of ACF as a surrogate endpoint biomarker for cancer is controversial. Recently, several alternative precancerous lesions have been described (namely MDF, BCAC, and flat ACF), which might be better biomarkers than ACF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tumor.free.fr/ACF-BCAC-MDF.html |title=ACF-MDF-BCAC |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19109">The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] defines '''aging in place''' as "the ability to live in one's own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably, regardless of age, income, or ability level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Places Terminology|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/terminology.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental gerontology ==
Research in environmental [[gerontology]] indicates the importance of the physical and social environment of [[housing]] and the [[neighborhood]] (public space), as well as its implications for aging in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sánchez-González, Diego |author2=Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Vicente|title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America.

== Preference ==

Most adults would prefer to age in place—that is, remain in their home of choice as long as possible. In fact, 90 percent of adults over the age of 65 report that they would prefer to stay in their current residence as they [[Ageing|age]].&lt;ref name="A Report to the National Livable Communities: Creating Environments for Successful Aging"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/il/beyond_50_communities.pdf |title=A Report to the National Livable Communities: Creating Environments for Successful Aging |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-third of American households are home to one or more residents 60 years of age or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cronin, Anne |author2=Marybeth Mandich|title=Human Development and Performance Throughout the Lifespan|year=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1133951193|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Technology]] can be an enabler for aging in place—there are four categories of technology that acts as an enabler—Communication and Engagement, Health and Wellness, Learning and Contribution, and Safety and Security.&lt;ref&gt;See Market Overview for Technology for Aging in Place 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caregiving]] technologies help those who care for older adults provide that care in the most effective way—and include new technologies for [[Smartphone|smart phones]] and [[Tablet_computer|tablets]], as well as [[Website|websites]]—such as Caring.com or AARP.org/Caregiving.

== Home modifications ==

There exist many risks for injury to older adults in the common household, therefore impacting upon their capability to successfully age in place. Among the greatest threats to an ability to age in place is falling. According to the CDC, falls are the leading cause of injurious death among older adults. Therefore, engagement in fall prevention is crucial to one's ability to age in place. Common features in an everyday household, such as a lack of support in the shower or bathroom, inadequate railings on the stairs, loose throw rugs, and obstructed pathways are all possible dangers to an older person. However, simple and low-cost modifications to an older person's home can greatly decrease the risk of falling, as well as decreasing the risk of other forms of injury. Consequently, this increases the likelihood that one can age in place.&lt;ref name="Aging in Place at Home: The Definitive Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thehelpinghome.com/aging-in-place-at-home-definitive-guide-part1/ |title=Aging in Place at Home: The Definitive Guide |accessdate=2017-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of home modifications include: increased lighting, accessible switches at both ends of the stairs, additional railings, grab bars, nonskid flooring, a hand-held flexible shower head, walk-in bathtubs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therapytubs.com|title=Premier Walk In Tubs from TherapyTubs.com|website=www.therapytubs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the removal of throw rugs and clutter.&lt;ref name="Aging in Place at Home: The Definitive Guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modification"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.homemods.org/directory/nrcshhm/index.htm |title=The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modification |publisher=Usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, home modifications can be simple and cost-effective, while simultaneously offering substantial benefits to the individual. Other modifications to the home – especially those that require retrofitting – are a little more costly due to increased complexity of installation. These can include: ramps for accessible entry and exit, walk-in shower, sliding shelves, stairlifts, or even home elevators. Many homes are built or retrofitted with the [[Universal design]] model in mind, which makes everything in the home accessible to all people with or without functional limitations.&lt;ref name="The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modification" /&gt;

==Resources in the community==
Naturally occurring retirement communities, also known as NORCS, are another source of support for older adults wishing to age in place.  A NORC, though not built specifically for a certain age demographic, occurs where a congregation of residents 60 and older live cooperatively.  Some offer recreational activities, preventative health and social services for the community.  This model can be supported by local, state, and federal dollars as well as community businesses, neighborhood associations and private foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NORC|url=http://www.philanthropicgroup.com/giaaip050409v2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological changes==
In some cases, the [[caregivers]] of people who are aging in place seek to persuade them to adopt new technology, which may include learning new skills and changing their daily routine to incorporate the technology.&lt;ref name="Peek 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peek|first1=Sebastiaan T.M.|last2=Wouters|first2=Eveline J.M.|last3=van Hoof|first3=Joost|last4=Luijkx|first4=Katrien G.|last5=Boeije|first5=Hennie R.|last6=Vrijhoef|first6=Hubertus J.M.|title=Factors influencing acceptance of technology for aging in place: A systematic review|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|date=April 2014|volume=83|issue=4|pages=235–248|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2014}}, there is research about how people aging in place try to use new technology when persuaded, but not much research about the extent to which they continue to use it after trying it for some time.&lt;ref name="Peek 2014"/&gt; Factors which contribute to the decision to try to technology are the anticipated benefits of the technology, the difficulty using it, the extent to which the user feels that harm will come from not using it, the availability of alternatives, support from others in their social circle, and their own personal attitudes and disposition.&lt;ref name="Peek 2014"/&gt;

==Biological reasons==
Many elders have difficulties with everyday functioning that require modifications to the houses or apartments they live in. There are several reasons why these changes happen:
*Motor functioning: In a 2002 study by Min Soo Kang, it was reported that of the elder population in America, 18% will have a disability. This calculates to 51 million Americans who have difficulties in functioning every day. 32% over age 65 will have difficulty walking, which may require use of walkers, wheelchairs and canes. To make life easier for the elder, some modifications that can aid them are wider entrances, grab rails, elevator chairs on stairs, etc.
*Fine motor functioning: Elders may have difficulty using their fingers, which can be problematic. As a result, modifications to handles, bathroom fixtures, etc. can aid with this problem.
*Cognitive functioning: It was reported in Kochera (2002) that 1 out of 5 people over the age of 55 will have a mental health disorder.  Due to the deterioration, the five senses and cognitive capability decrease and cause slower responses.  As a result, fire hazards may not be noticed, which can be very important when setting up fire alarms, exits, etc.

==Examples==
Aging in place can be further defined by:

# Aging in place without urgent needs: This group includes individuals who want to stay in their current home, are not experiencing immediate health/mobility issues, and prefer aging in place.
# Aging in place with progressive condition-based needs: This group is made up of those with chronic or progressive conditions that will require special modifications for aging in place. These individuals are usually aware of their needs but meeting them is not necessarily urgent. Many have chronic conditions such as diabetes and lung/heart disease that challenge them.
# Aging in place with traumatic change needs: This group includes those who experienced an abrupt or immediate change that demands adjustments in the living environment for aging in place such as home modifications or universal design.

==Careers in the field==
By working with a person's regular [[physician]] and other doctors, an [[Occupational therapist|Occupational Therapist]] (OT) can suggest changes to be made to a person's home in order to uniquely compensate for that particular patient's capabilities and disabilities.&lt;ref name="Occupational Therapy: Helping America Age in Place"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aota.org/News/Centennial/40313/Aging/Aging-in-Place.aspx |title=Occupational Therapy: Helping America Age in Place |format=website |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making an appointment and meeting with an Occupational Therapist, a patient is getting a one-on-one based session where the therapist is focused solely on that patient's limitations and is making strategies in order to modify the patient's home, making it safer and letting them keep their independence. OT's will work with contractors and occasionally local groups and volunteers to make home modifications ranging from small changes like better lighting to more extreme changes such as chair lifts instead of stairs. An OT will typically try to make low-cost adjustments in the initial stages, but once again this is based on each individual.&lt;ref name="REMAINING IN YOUR HOME AS YOU AGE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aota.org/-/media/corporate/files/aboutot/consumers/adults/aginginplace/remaining-in-place-aging.pdf |title=REMAINING IN YOUR HOME AS YOU AGE |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; OT's also provide services to older adults in community based scenarios focusing in health promotion.

== Initiatives worldwide ==

=== In Canada ===
In Ontario, Canada, aging in place is known as aging at home, and has received considerable financial support from the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care.

=== In United States ===
According to the [[United States Census]], 46 million people age 65+ lived in the United States in 2014 and this same segment of the population will grow to 74 million in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Older Americans 2016: Key Indicators of Well-Being|url=https://agingstats.gov/docs/LatestReport/Older-Americans-2016-Key-Indicators-of-WellBeing.pdf |date=2017-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Websites and organizations have sprung up all across the nation, in individual communities, states and nationwide to help people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. Aging in Place is an initiative of Partners for Livable Communities and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. It was developed to help America's communities prepare for the aging of their population and to become places that are good to grow up, live in and grow old. They have been working directly with nine laboratory communities to assist them in advancing policies, programs and services to promote Aging in Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=e Communities for All Ages Partners for Livable Communities|title=Aging in Place Initiative|url=http://livable.org/program-areas/livable-communities-for-all-ages-a-aging-in-place/the-aging-in-place-initiative|accessdate=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar network is the [[Elder Village]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/ppi/liv-com/fs177-village.pdf The Village: A Growing Option for Aging in Place], Fact Sheet 177, AARP Public Policy Institute, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart homes are also another development to help promote aging in place by integrating a range of monitoring and supportive devices. These homes have technology for physiological monitoring, functional monitoring for emergency detection and response, safety monitoring and assistance, security monitoring and assistance, social interaction monitoring and assistance and cognitive and sensory assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icaa.cc/wef/Global-Population-Ageing-Book.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122065922/http://www.icaa.cc/wef/Global-Population-Ageing-Book.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia Institute of Technology has developed a smart house. This house would help to address issues older adults face when living alone, such as physical and mental decline as well as awareness for family members. The house includes technology such as pendants which understand commands in the form of hand gestures. It could open and lock doors, close blinds, turn on lights, and more. There is also an in-home monitoring system that can inform family members about an older relative's daily activities, health status, and potential problems. This would allow older adults to remain in their own home while still maintaining their independence without their families having to worry about their well being. This is not the only smart house that has popped up.
The University of Florida has created one as well. It has smart refrigerators and pantries which can detect food consumption and expired products. Their smart laundry machines can coordinate with the smart closet to notify the resident when it is time to do laundry as well as aid in sorting the laundry. Every room is specially designed with these and many more smart features to aid their living situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Mynatt ED, Melenhorst AS, Fisk AD, Roger WA |title=Aware Technologies for Aging in Place:  Understanding User Needs and Attitudes|url=http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/~qmahmoud/teaching/fall2006/pervasive/aging.pdf|work=Georgia Institute of Technology|publisher=PERVASIVE computing|accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar technology has been done at the Washington State University, University of Texas, University of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Missouri, as well as in Osaka, Japan.

In December 2011,  AARP Policy Institute and the National Conference of State Legislatures released a report entitled, "Aging in Place:  A State Survey of Livability Policies and Practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting Aging in place: Policies and Practices that work|url=http://www.aarp.org/home-garden/livable-communities/info-11-2011/solutions-forum-aging-in-place.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; to foster aging in place by giving state legislators examples of how laws, policies and programs can support this goal.  In addition to such governmental initiatives, livability can be optimized through the incorporation of universal design principles, telecare and other assistive technologies. Assistive technologies include communications, health and wellness monitoring, home safety and security.  Semico Research published a report in July 2013 claiming the health and wellness monitoring market for Aging in Place will reach $30 billion by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://semico.com/content/aging-place-internet-things-golden-years|title=Aging in Place:  The Internet of Things for the Golden Years - Semico Research|website=semico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly]] (PACE) model was created in the early 1970s in order to meet the chronic care needs of older people through their community. As an assistance program, one must be at least 55 years of age, certified by their state to need nursing home care, are able to live safely in the community at the time of enrollment, and live in a PACE service area. The goal of the PACE program is to care for the chronic care needs of older individuals while providing them with the ability to live independently, or age in place in their homes, for as long as possible. In order to make independent living possible for this population, the PACE program provides services, such as physical therapy, respite care, prescription drugs, social services, nutritional counseling, and much more. Since 2011, PACE has 82 operational programs in 29 states, and is continuing to expand today.&lt;ref name="National PACE Association"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npaonline.org/website/article.asp?id=12 |title=National PACE Association |publisher=Npaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Middle Eastern and Asian countries ===
For many countries in the Middle and Far East, it is part of the cultural beliefs for older adults to age in place. Many children believe it to be their duty to care for their parents as they age and therefore will move in with their parents when their assistance is needed. In many Middle Eastern countries, nursing homes are just recently coming into existence due to cultural and generational shifts towards Western values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegland|first=Mary Elaine|title=The Cultural Context of Aging: Worldwide Perspectives|year=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport CT|isbn=978-0-275-99288-0|pages=303–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bio21 Institute of Molecular Science and Biotechnology''', abbreviated as the '''Bio21 Institute''', is an Australian scientific research [[research institute|institute]] focuses on the study of basic science and applied biotechnology. The Bio21 Institute is based at the [[University of Melbourne]] on [[Flemington Road, Melbourne|Flemington Road]] in {{VICcity|Parkville}}, [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

The Institute is managed by the University of Melbourne and is supported by funding from the Victorian Government.

==History==
Established in 2002 and officially opened in 2005, the research centre conducts interdisciplinary learning and houses research groups specializing in biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, and other life sciences. Bio21 accommodates over 500 research scientists, students and industry participants, making it one of the largest biotechnology research centres in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/about-bio21 |title=About Bio21 |date=2015 |accessdate=13 September 2016 |website=www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095837/http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/about-bio21 |archivedate=2 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}}

In September 2006, Bio21 formed a partnership with Australian-based global bio-pharmaceutical company [[CSL Limited]]. 50 scientists from CSL were relocated to participate in activities at the Bio21. The goal of the partnership was for Bio21 to gain the expertise of industry professionals and for CSL to gain access to state-of-the-art equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CSL scientists move to Melbourne Uni |work=NineMSN |agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |date=2006 |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=65820 |accessdate=1 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920095034/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=65820 |archivedate=20 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Rebecca |title=Bio21 Inst to host CSL scientists |journal=UniNews |volume=15 |number=17 |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |date=2006 |url=http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/news/3671/ |accessdate=1 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912023818/http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/news/3671/ |archivedate=12 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biomimetics''' or '''biomimicry''' is the imitation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex [[human]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=Julian F. V.|title=Biomimetics: its practice and theory|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=3|issue=9|pages=471–482|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/9/471|accessdate=7 April 2015|doi=10.1098/rsif.2006.0127|pmid=16849244|pmc=1664643|date=22 August 2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "biomimetics" and "biomimicry" derive from {{lang-grc|βίος}} (''bios''), life, and μίμησις (''[[mimesis|mīmēsis]]''), imitation, from μιμεῖσθαι (''mīmeisthai''), to imitate, from μῖμος (''mimos''), actor. A closely related field is '''[[bionics]]'''.&lt;ref name=McCarty/&gt;

Living organisms have [[evolution|evolved]] [[adaptation (biology)|well-adapted]] structures and materials over geological time through [[natural selection]]. Biomimetics has given rise to new technologies inspired by [[biological]] solutions at macro and nanoscales. Humans have looked at nature for answers to problems throughout our existence. Nature has solved engineering problems such as self-healing abilities, environmental exposure tolerance and resistance, [[hydrophobicity]], self-assembly, and harnessing solar energy.

== History ==

One of the early examples of would-be biomimicry was the study of [[birds]] to enable [[human flight]]. Although never successful in creating a "flying machine", [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was a keen observer of the anatomy and flight of birds, and made numerous notes and sketches on his observations as well as sketches of "flying machines".&lt;ref name="Romei 2008 56"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Romei | first=Francesca | title=Leonardo Da Vinci | publisher=The Oliver Press  | year=2008 | location=| page=56 | isbn=978-1-934545-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wright Brothers]], who succeeded in flying the first heavier-than-air aircraft in 1903, allegedly derived inspiration from observations of pigeons in flight.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book | last=Howard | first=Fred | title=Wilbur and Orville: A Biography of the Wright Brothers | publisher=Dober Publications | year=1998 | location=| page=33 | isbn=978-0-486-40297-0 | quote = According to Wilbur, he and his brother discovered the birds' method of lateral control one day while observing a flight of pigeons. [...] 'Although we intently watched birds fly in a hope of learning something from them,' [Orville] wrote in 1941, 'I cannot think of anything that was first learned in that way.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Flight|design for a flying machine]] with wings based closely upon the structure of bat wings.]]During the 1950s the American [[biophysicist]] and [[polymath]] [[Otto Schmitt]] developed the concept of "biomimetics".&lt;ref name="Vincent2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vincent |first= Julian F.V. |author2= Bogatyreva, Olga A. |author3= Bogatyrev, Nikolaj R. |author4= Bowyer, Adrian |author5= Pahl, Anja-Karina |title= Biomimetics: its practice and theory |journal= Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date= 21 August 2006|volume= 3|issue= 9|pages= 471–482|doi= 10.1098/rsif.2006.0127 |pmid= 16849244 |pmc= 1664643}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his doctoral research he developed the [[Schmitt trigger]] by studying the nerves in squid, attempting to engineer a device that replicated the biological system of [[nerve impulse|nerve propagation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Otto H.

{{quote|Biophysics is not so much a subject matter as it is a point of view. It is an approach to problems of biological science utilizing the theory and technology of the physical sciences. Conversely, biophysics is also a biologist's approach to problems of physical science and engineering, although this aspect has largely been neglected.|Otto Herbert Schmitt|In Appreciation, A Lifetime of Connections: Otto Herbert Schmitt, 1913 - 1998}}

In 1960 [[Jack E. Steele]] coined a similar term, ''[[bionics]]'', at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where Otto Schmitt also worked. Steele defined bionics as "the science of systems which have some function copied from nature, or which represent characteristics of natural systems or their analogues".&lt;ref name="McCarty"&gt;Mary McCarty. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604025951/http://www.daytondailynews.com/o/content/oh/story/opinions/columns/2009/01/29/ddn012909mary.html?cxntlid=inform_sr "Life of bionics founder a fine adventure"]. ''Dayton Daily News'', 29 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vincent-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vincent|first= Julian F. V. |title= Biomimetics -- a review |journal= Journal of Engineering in Medicine |date= November 2009|volume= 223 |series= Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

{{quote|Let us consider what bionics has come to mean operationally and what it or some word like it (I prefer biomimetics) ought to mean in order to make good use of the technical skills of scientists specializing, or rather, I should say, despecializing into this area of research|Otto Herbert Schmitt|In Appreciation, A Lifetime of Connections: Otto Herbert Schmitt, 1913 - 1998}}

In 1969 Schmitt used the term “biomimetic“ in the title one of his papers,&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt O. Third Int. Biophysics Congress. 1969. Some interesting and useful biomimetic transforms. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1974 it had found its way into [[Webster's Dictionary]], bionics entered the same dictionary earlier in 1960 as "a science concerned with the application of data about the functioning of biological systems to the solution of engineering problems". Bionic took on a different connotation when [[Martin Caidin]] referenced Jack Steele and his work in the novel ''Cyborg'' which later resulted in the 1974 television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and its spin-offs. The term bionic then became associated with "the use of electronically operated artificial body parts" and "having ordinary human powers increased by or as if by the aid of such devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary |year=2008 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-19-953296-4|last1=Soanes |first1=Catherine |last2=Hawker |first2=Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term ''bionic'' took on the implication of supernatural strength, the scientific community in [[english language|English]] speaking countries largely abandoned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Vincent | first =JFV | title =Biomimetics — a review | journal =Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.| volume =223 | issue=| pages=919–939 | year=2009 | url=| issn=| doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''biomimicry'' appeared as early as 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Merrill | first=Connie Lange | title=Biomimicry of the Dioxygen Active Site in the Copper Proteins Hemocyanin and Cytochrome Oxidase  | location=Rice University  | year=1982  | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomimicry was popularized by scientist and author [[Janine Benyus]] in her 1997 book ''Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature''. Biomimicry is defined in the book as a "new science that studies nature's models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems". Benyus suggests looking to Nature as a "Model, Measure, and Mentor" and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry.&lt;ref name="Benyus 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benyus |first=Janine |title=Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature |year=1997 |publisher=[[William Morrow &amp; Company]] |location=New York, USA |isbn=978-0-688-16099-9 |ref=Benyus97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bio-inspired technologies ==
Biomimetics could in principle be applied in many fields. Because of the diversity and complexity of biological systems, the number of features that might be imitated is large. Biomimetic applications are at various stages of development from technologies that might become commercially usable to prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhushan|first1=Bharat|date=15 March 2009|title=Biomimetics: lessons from nature-an overview|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1893/1445.full|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=367|issue=1893|pages=1445–1486|doi=10.1098/rsta.2009.0011|pmid=19324719}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray's law]], which in conventional form determined the optimum diameter of blood vessels, has been re-derived to provide simple equations for the pipe or tube diameter which gives a minimum mass engineering system.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Hugo R.|author2=Trask, Richard S.|author3=Weaver, Paul M.|author4=Bond, Ian P.|year=2008|title=Minimum mass vascular networks in multifunctional materials|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/18/55.full|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=18|pages=55–65|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1022|pmc=2605499|pmid=17426011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and architecture ===
Researchers studied the [[termite]]'s ability to maintain virtually constant temperature and humidity in their [[termite mound]]s in Africa despite outside temperatures that vary from 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C (35&amp;nbsp;°F to 104&amp;nbsp;°F).  Researchers initially scanned a termite mound and created 3-D images of the mound structure, which revealed construction that could influence human [[building design]].

Analysis of the elastic deformation happening when a pollinisator lands on the sheath-like perch part of the flower [[Strelitzia reginae|''Strelitzia reginae'']] (known as [[Strelitzia|Bird-of-Paradise]] flower) has inspired architects and scientists from the [[University of Freiburg]] and [[University of Stuttgart]] for the creation of hingeless shading systems that can react to their environment. These bio-inspired products is sold under the name Flectofin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lienhard|first=J|last2=Schleicher|first2=S|last3=Poppinga|first3=S|last4=Masselter|first4=T|last5=Milwich|first5=M|last6=Speck|first6=T|last7=Knippers|first7=J|date=2011-11-29|title=Flectofin: a hingeless flapping mechanism inspired by nature|journal=Bioinspiration &amp; Biomimetics|volume=6|issue=4|pages=045001|doi=10.1088/1748-3182/6/4/045001|pmid=22126741|issn=1748-3182}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyLR_-fW0aA]

=== Structural materials ===
There is a great need for new structural materials that are light weight but offer exceptional combinations of [[stiffness]], strength and [[toughness]].  

Such materials would need to be manufactured into bulk materials with complex shapes at high volume and low cost and would serve a variety of fields such as construction, transportation, energy storage and conversion. In a classic design problem, strength and toughness are more likely to be mutually exclusive i.e., strong materials are brittle and tough materials are weak. However, natural materials with complex and hierarchical material gradients that span from [[Nanoscopic scale|nano]]- to macro-scales are both strong and tough. Generally, most natural materials utilize limited chemical components but complex material architectures that give rise to exceptional mechanical properties. Understanding the highly diverse and multi functional biological materials and discovering approaches to replicate such structures will lead to advanced and more efficient technologies. [[Bone]], [[nacre]] (abalone shell), teeth, the dactyl clubs of stomatopod shrimps and bamboo are great examples of damage tolerant materials.&lt;ref name="materials"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wegst|first=Ulrike G.

However, numerous processing techniques have been proposed for producing nacre like materials.&lt;ref name="materials" /&gt;   

[[Biomineralization|Biomorphic mineralization]] is a technique that produces materials with morphologies and structures resembling those of natural living organisms by using bio-structures as templates for mineralization.

=== Adhesion ===

==== Wet adhesion ====
Some amphibians, such as tree and [[Torrent frog|torrent frogs]] and arboreal [[Salamander|salamanders]], are able to attach to and move over wet or even flooded environments without falling. This kind of organisms have toe pads which are permanently wetted by mucus secreted from glands that open into the channels between epidermal cells. They attach to mating surfaces by wet adhesion and they are capable of climbing on wet rocks even when water is flowing over the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhushan|first=Bharat|date=2009-04-28|title=Biomimetics: lessons from nature–an overview|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1893/1445|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=367|issue=1893|pages=1445–1486|doi=10.1098/rsta.2009.0011|issn=1364-503X|pmid=19324719}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tire]] treads have also been inspired by the toe pads of [[Tree frog|tree frogs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/19/37/376110 Tire treads inspired by tree frogs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine [[Mussel|mussels]] can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater under the harsh conditions of the ocean. Mussels use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of [[amino acid]] residues which has been adapted specifically for [[adhesive]] purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seo|first=Sungbaek|last2=Das|first2=Saurabh|last3=Zalicki|first3=Piotr J.|last4=Mirshafian|first4=Razieh|last5=Eisenbach|first5=Claus D.|last6=Israelachvili|first6=Jacob N.|last7=Waite|first7=J.

==== Dry adhesion ====
Leg attachment pads of several animals, including many insects (e.g. [[Beetle|beetles]] and [[Fly|flies]]), [[Spider|spiders]] and [[Lizard|lizards]] (e.g. [[Gecko|geckos]]), are capable of attaching to a variety of surfaces and are used for locomotion, even on vertical walls or across ceilings. Attachment systems in these organisms have similar structures at their terminal elements of contact, known as [[Seta|setae]]. Such biological examples have offered inspiration in order to produce climbing robots,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientisttech.com/channel/tech/mg19025526.500.html Gecko-like robot scampers up the wall – tech – 23 May 2006 – New Scientist Tech]&lt;/ref&gt; boots and tape&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/mota/education/Physics%2087N%20Final%20Projects/Group%20Gamma/gecko.htm|title=Gecko Tape|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; . [[Synthetic setae]] have also been developed for the production of dry adhesives.

[[Biomimetic material]]s are gaining increasing attention in the field of [[optics]] and [[photonics]]. There are still little known [[Bio-inspired photonics|bioinspired or biomimetic products]] involving the photonic properties of plants or animals. However, understanding how nature designed such optical materials from biological resources is worth pursuing and might lead to future commercial products.

The [[Bombardier beetle]]'s powerful repellent spray inspired a Swedish company to develop a "micro mist" spray technology, which is claimed to have a low carbon impact (compared to aerosol sprays). The beetle mixes chemicals and releases its spray via a steerable nozzle at the end of its abdomen, stinging and confusing the victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedishbiomimetics.com/biomimetics_folder.pdf Swedish Biomimetics: The &amp;mu;Mist Platform Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213022851/http://www.swedishbiomimetics.com/biomimetics_folder.pdf |date=December 13, 2013 }}.

Most [[virus]]es have an outer capsule 20 to 300&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter. Virus capsules are remarkably robust and capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 60&amp;nbsp;°C; they are stable across the [[pH]] range 2-10.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; Viral capsules can be used to create nano device components such as nanowires, nanotubes, and quantum dots. Tubular virus particles such as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) can be used as templates to create nanofibers and nanotubes, since both the inner and outer layers of the virus are charged surfaces which can induce nucleation of crystal growth. 

This was demonstrated through the production of [[platinum]] and [[gold]] nanotubes using TMV as a template.&lt;ref name="Dujardin"&gt;Dujardin E., Peet C. "Nano Letters" 2003. 3:413.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mineralized virus particles have been shown to withstand various pH values by mineralizing the viruses with different materials such as silicon, [[Lead(II) sulfide|PbS]], and [[Cadmium sulfide|CdS]] and could therefore serve as a useful carriers of material.&lt;ref name="Shenton"&gt;Shenton W. Douglas, Young M. "Advanced Materials" 1999. 11:253.&lt;/ref&gt;  A spherical plant virus called [[cowpea chlorotic mottle virus]] (CCMV) has interesting expanding properties when exposed to environments of pH higher than 6.5.  Above this pH, 60 independent pores with diameters about 2&amp;nbsp;nm begin to exchange substance with the environment.  The structural transition of the viral capsid can be utilized in [[Biomineralization|Biomorphic mineralization]] for selective uptake and deposition of minerals by controlling the solution pH.  Possible applications include using the viral cage to produce uniformly shaped and sized quantum dot [[semiconductor]] nanoparticles through a series of pH washes.  This is an alternative to the [[Ferritin|apoferritin]] cage technique currently used to synthesize uniform CdSe nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;Ischiro Yamashita, Junko Hayashi, Mashahiko Hara. "Bio-template Synthesis of Uniform CdSe Nanoparticles Using Cage-shaped Protein, Apoferritin." Chemistry Letters (2004). Volume: 33, Issue: 9. 1158–1159.&lt;/ref&gt; Such materials could also be used for targeted drug delivery since particles release contents upon exposure to specific pH levels.

Early developers on the project included Jeff Chang, Andrew Dalke and Brad Chapman, though over 100 people have made contributions to date.&lt;ref name="Contributors"&gt;{{Citation |title=List of Biopython contributors |url=http://biopython.org/SRC/biopython/CONTRIB |accessdate=11 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140911121354/http://biopython.org/SRC/biopython/CONTRIB |archivedate=11 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a similar [[Python (programming language)|Python]] project, namely '''PyCogent''', was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The initial scope of Biopython involved accessing, indexing and processing biological sequence files. While this is still a major focus, over the following years added modules have extended its functionality to cover additional areas of biology (see [[#Key features and examples|Key features and examples]]).

As of version 1.62, Biopython supports running on Python 3 as well as Python 2.&lt;ref name="Installation"&gt;{{Citation | first = Brad | last = Chapman |title=Biopython Installation |url=http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Wherever possible, Biopython follows the conventions used by the Python programming language to make it easier for users familiar with Python. For example, &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt; objects can be manipulated via [[Array slicing#1991: Python|slicing]], in a manner similar to Python’s strings and lists. It is also designed to be functionally similar to other Bio* projects, such as BioPerl.&lt;ref name="Chapman2004"/&gt;

Biopython is able to read and write most common file formats for each of its functional areas, and its license is permissive and compatible with most other software licenses, which allow Biopython to be used in a variety of software projects.&lt;ref name="lists"/&gt;

== Key features and examples ==

=== Sequences ===
A core concept in Biopython is the biological sequence, and this is represented by the &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;ref name="Tutorial"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chang |first=Jeff |last2=Chapman |first2=Brad |last3=Friedberg |first3=Iddo |last4=Hamelryck |first4=Thomas |last5=de Hoon |first5=Michiel |last6=Cock |first6=Peter |last7=Antao |first7=Tiago |last8=Talevich |first8=Eric |last9=Wilczynski |first9=Bartek  |title=Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook |url=http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html |date=29 May 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Biopython &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; object is similar to a Python string in many respects: it supports the Python slice notation, can be concatenated with other sequences and is immutable. In addition, it includes sequence-specific methods and specifies the particular biological alphabet used.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script creates a DNA sequence and performs some typical manipulations
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Seq import Seq
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Alphabet import IUPAC
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence = Seq('AGGCTTCTCGTA', IUPAC.unambiguous_dna)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence
Seq('AGGCTTCTCGTA', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence[2:7]
Seq('GCTTC', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence.reverse_complement()
Seq('TACGAGAAGCCT', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence = dna_sequence.transcribe()
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence
Seq('AGGCUUCUCGUA', IUPACUnambiguousRNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence.translate()
Seq('RLLV', IUPACProtein())
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Sequence annotation ===
The &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt; class describes sequences, along with information such as name, description and features in the form of &lt;code&gt;SeqFeature&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Each &lt;code&gt;SeqFeature&lt;/code&gt; object specifies the type of the feature and its location. Feature types can be ‘gene’, ‘CDS’ (coding sequence), ‘repeat_region’, ‘mobile_element’ or others, and the position of features in the sequence can be exact or approximate.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script loads an annotated sequence from file and views some of its contents.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record = SeqIO.read('pTC2.gb', 'genbank')
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.name
'NC_019375'
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.description
'Providencia stuartii plasmid pTC2, complete sequence.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.features[14]
SeqFeature(FeatureLocation(ExactPosition(4516), ExactPosition(5336), strand=1), type='mobile_element')
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.seq
Seq('GGATTGAATATAACCGACGTGACTGTTACATTTAGGTGGCTAAACCCGTCAAGC...GCC', IUPACAmbiguousDNA())
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Input and output ===
Biopython can read and write to a number of common sequence formats, including [[FASTA format|FASTA]], [[FASTQ format|FASTQ]], GenBank, Clustal, PHYLIP and [[Nexus file|NEXUS]].  When reading files, descriptive information in the file is used to populate the members of Biopython classes, such as &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt;.  This allows records of one file format to be converted into others.

Very large sequence files can exceed a computer's memory resources, so Biopython provides various options for accessing records in large files.  They can be loaded entirely into memory in Python data structures, such as lists or [[Associative array|dictionaries]], providing fast access at the cost of memory usage.  Alternatively, the files can be read from disk as needed, with slower performance but lower memory requirements.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script loads a file containing multiple sequences and saves each one in a different format.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; genomes = SeqIO.parse('salmonella.gb', 'genbank')
&gt;&gt;&gt; for genome in genomes:
...     SeqIO.write(genome, genome.id + '.fasta', 'fasta')
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Accessing online databases ===

Through the Bio.Entrez module, users of Biopython can download biological data from NCBI databases.  Each of the functions provided by the [[Entrez]] search engine is available through functions in this module, including searching for and downloading records.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script downloads genomes from the NCBI Nucleotide database and saves them in a FASTA file.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import Entrez
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; output_file = open('all_records.fasta', "w")
&gt;&gt;&gt; Entrez.email = 'my_email@example.com'
&gt;&gt;&gt; records_to_download = ['FO834906.1', 'FO203501.1']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for record_id in records_to_download:
...     handle = Entrez.efetch(db='nucleotide', id=record_id, rettype='gb')
...     seqRecord = SeqIO.read(handle, format='gb')
...     handle.close()
...     output_file.write(seqRecord.format('fasta'))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Phylogeny ===

[[File:Phylo.draw graphviz.png|thumb|Figure 2: The same tree as above, drawn unrooted using Graphviz via Bio.Phylo]]

The Bio.Phylo module provides tools for working with and visualising [[phylogenetic tree]]s.  A variety of file formats are supported for reading and writing, including [[Newick format|Newick]], [[Nexus file|NEXUS]] and [[phyloXML]].  Common tree manipulations and traversals are supported via the &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Clade&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Examples include converting and collating tree files, extracting subsets from a tree, changing a tree's root, and analysing branch features such as length or score.&lt;ref name="Talevich2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Talevich |first=Eric |last2=Invergo |first2=Brandon M |last3=Cock |first3=Peter JA |last4=Chapman |first4=Brad A |date=21 August 2012 |title=Bio.Phylo: A unified toolkit for processing, analyzing and visualizing phylogenetic trees in Biopython |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/209 |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=13 |issue=209 |accessdate=9 September 2014 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-13-209 |pmid=22909249 |pmc=3468381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooted trees can be drawn in [[ASCII art|ASCII]] or using [[matplotlib]] (see Figure 1), and the [[Graphviz]] library can be used to create unrooted layouts (see Figure 2).

=== Genome diagrams ===

[[File:PKPS77.png|thumb|300px|Figure 3: A diagram of the genes on the pKPS77 plasmid,&lt;ref name="NC_023330.1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_023330.1 |title=Klebsiella pneumoniae strain KPS77 plasmid pKPS77, complete sequence |date= |website= |publisher=NCBI |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; visualised using the GenomeDiagram module in Biopython]]

The GenomeDiagram module provides methods of visualising sequences within Biopython.&lt;ref name="Pritchard2006"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pritchard |first=Leighton |last2=White |first2=Jennifer A |last3=Birch |first3=Paul RJ |last4=Toth |first4=Ian K |title=GenomeDiagram: a python package for the visualization of large-scale genomic data |journal=Bioinformatics |date=March 2006 |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=616–617 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btk021 |pmid=16377612}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sequences can be drawn in a linear or circular form (see Figure 3), and many output formats are supported, including [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]].  Diagrams are created by making tracks and then adding sequence features to those tracks.  By looping over a sequence's features and using their attributes to decide if and how they are added to the diagram's tracks, one can exercise much control over the appearance of the final diagram.  Cross-links can be drawn between different tracks, allowing one to compare multiple sequences in a single diagram.

=== Macromolecular structure ===

The Bio.PDB module can load molecular structures from [[Protein Data Bank (file format)|PDB]] and [[Crystallographic Information File|mmCIF]] files, and was added to Biopython in 2003.&lt;ref name="Hamelryck2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamelryck |first=Thomas |last2=Manderick |first2=Bernard |date=10 May 2003 |title=PDB file parser and structure class implemented in Python |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/17/2308 |journal=Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=19 |issue=17 |accessdate=10 September 2014 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btg299 |pages=2308–2310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &lt;code&gt;Structure&lt;/code&gt; object is central to this module, and it organises macromolecular structure in a hierarchical fashion: &lt;code&gt;Structure&lt;/code&gt; objects contain &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Chain&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Residue&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Atom&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Disordered residues and atoms get their own classes, &lt;code&gt;DisorderedResidue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DisorderedAtom&lt;/code&gt;, that describe their uncertain positions.

Using Bio.PDB, one can navigate through individual components of a macromolecular structure file, such as examining each atom in a protein.  Common analyses can be carried out, such as measuring distances or angles, comparing residues and calculating residue depth.

=== Population genetics ===

The Bio.PopGen module adds support to Biopython for Genepop, a software package for statistical analysis of population genetics.&lt;ref name="Rousset2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rousset |first=François |date=January 2008 |title=GENEPOP'007: a complete re-implementation of the GENEPOP software for Windows and Linux |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01931.x/abstract |journal=Molecular Ecology Resources |publisher= |volume=8 |accessdate=11 September 2014 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01931.x |pages=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows for analyses of [[Hardy–Weinberg principle|Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium]], [[linkage disequilibrium]] and other features of a population's [[Allele frequency|allele frequencies]].

This module can also carry out population genetic simulations using [[coalescent theory]] with the fastsimcoal2 program.&lt;ref name="Excoffier2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Excoffier |first=Laurent |last2=Foll |first2=Matthieu |date=1 March 2011 |title=fastsimcoal: a continuous-time coalescent simulator of genomic diversity under arbitrarily complex evolutionary scenarios |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/9/1332 |journal=Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=27 |issue=9 |accessdate=11 September 2014 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btr124 |pages=1332–1334 |pmid=21398675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wrappers for command line tools ===

Many of Biopython's modules contain command line wrappers for commonly used tools, allowing these tools to be used from within Biopython.  These wrappers include [[BLAST]], [[Clustal]], PhyML, [[EMBOSS]] and [[SAMtools]].  Users can subclass a generic wrapper class to add support for any other command line tool.

'''''Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge''''' ({{lang-es|Emporio celestial de conocimientos benévolos}}) is a fictitious [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of animals described by the writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his 1942 essay "[[The Analytical Language of John Wilkins]]" (''El idioma analítico de John Wilkins'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | page = 231 | contribution = John Wilkins' Analytical Language | others = Eliot Weinberger, transl. | title = Selected nonfictions | first = Jorge Luis | last = Borges | editor-first = Eliot | editor-last = Weinberger | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | ISBN = 0-14-029011-7}}.  The essay was originally published as {{Citation | contribution = El idioma analítico de John Wilkins | title = [[La Nación]] | date = 8 February 1942 | place = Argentina | language = Spanish}}, and republished in ''Otras inquisiciones''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[John Wilkins|Wilkins]], a 17th-century philosopher, had proposed a [[universal language]] based on a classification system that would encode a description of the thing a word describes into the word itself—for example, ''Zi'' identifies the genus ''beasts''; ''Zit'' denotes the "difference" ''rapacious beasts of the dog kind''; and finally ''Zitα'' specifies ''dog''.

In response to this proposal and in order to illustrate the arbitrariness and cultural specificity of any attempt to categorize the world, Borges describes this example of an alternate taxonomy, supposedly taken from an ancient Chinese encyclopædia entitled ''Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge''.

The list divides all animals into 14 categories:
* Those that belong to the emperor
* [[Embalming|Embalmed]] ones
* Those that are trained
* Suckling pigs
* Mermaids (or [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s)
* Fabulous ones
* Stray dogs
* Those that are included in this classification
* Those that tremble as if they were mad
* Innumerable ones
* Those drawn with a very fine [[camel hair brush]]
* ''[[Et cetera]]''
* Those that have just broken the flower vase
* Those that, at a distance, resemble flies

Borges claims that the list was discovered in its Chinese source by the translator [[Franz Kuhn]].&lt;ref&gt;A slightly different English translation is at: {{Citation | first =Jorge | last = Luis Borges | url= http://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/language/johnWilkins.html | title = The Analytical Language of John Wilkins | others = Lilia Graciela Vázquez, transl. | date = April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = esen&gt;{{Citation | first = Jorge Luis | last = Borges | url= http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/wilkins.html | title= El idioma analítico de John Wilkins | date =April 8, 2006 | language = Spanish, English| publisher = Crockford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = RJ Ohara | url = http://rjohara.net/darwin/logs/1996/9609a | title = Darwin-L | type = mailing list archive | contribution = Borges | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences of the list ==
This list has stirred considerable philosophical and literary commentary.

[[Michel Foucault]] begins his preface to ''[[The Order of Things]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Michel Foucault | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title=The Order of Things : An Archaeology of Human Sciences | publisher=Vintage | year= 1994 | origyear = 1966 | page=XVI|isbn=0-679-75335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |This book first arose out of a passage in Borges, out of the laughter that shattered, as I read the passage, all the familiar landmarks of thought—''our'' thought, the thought that bears the stamp of our age and our geography—breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame the wild profusion of existing things and continuing long afterwards to disturb and threaten with collapse our age-old definitions between the Same and the Other.}}

Foucault then quotes Borges' passage.

[[Louis Sass]] has suggested, in response to Borges' list, that such "Chinese" thinking shows signs of typical schizophrenic thought processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Louis Sass | first = Louis | last =Sass | title = Madness and Modernism: Insanity in the Light of Modern Art, Literature and Thought | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1994 | origyear = 1992 | isbn= 0-674-54137-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the linguist [[George Lakoff]] has pointed out that while Borges' list is not possibly a human categorization, many categorizations of objects found in nonwestern cultures have a similar feeling to Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = George Lakoff | first = George | last = Lakoff | title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1987 | isbn=0-226-46804-6 | url = http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/SocialConstruction/LakoffWomenFireDanger.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Windschuttle]], an Australian historian, cited alleged acceptance of the authenticity of the list by many academics as a sign of the degeneration of the Western academy&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author-link=Keith Windschuttle |first=Keith |last=Windschuttle|title=Absolutely Relative |publisher=National Review |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/15sept97/windschuttle091597.html |contribution=Academic Questions |date=September 15, 1997 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308191710/http://www.nationalreview.com/15sept97/windschuttle091597.html |archive-date=March 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a terminal lack of humor.

== Attribution ==

Scholars have questioned whether the attribution of the list to [[Franz Kuhn]] is genuine. While Kuhn did indeed translate Chinese literature, Borges' works often feature many learned pseudo-references resulting in a mix of facts and fiction. To date, no evidence for the existence of such a list has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/7/7-1446.html |title=LINGUIST List 7.1446: Borgesian joke |publisher=Linguistlist.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borges himself questions the veracity of the quote in his essay, referring to "the unknown (or false) Chinese encyclopaedia writer".&lt;ref name=esen/&gt;

'''Chromium dioxide''' or '''chromium(IV) oxide''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the formula CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a black [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[magnetism|magnetic]] solid.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}} &lt;/ref&gt;  It once was widely used in [[magnetic tape]] [[emulsion]].&lt;ref name=ullmanns&gt;{{Ullmann | author = Gerd Anger, Jost Halstenberg, Klaus Hochgeschwender, Christoph Scherhag, Ulrich Korallus, Herbert Knopf, Peter Schmidt, Manfred Ohlinger | title = Chromium Compounds | doi =10.1002/14356007.a07_067}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing popularity of [[compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s, the use of chromium(IV) oxide has declined. However, it is still used in data tape applications for enterprise-class storage systems. It is still considered by many oxide and tape manufacturers to have been one of the best magnetic recording particulates ever invented.

==Preparation and basic properties==
CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was first prepared by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] by decomposition of [[chromyl chloride]].  [[Crystal habit|Acicular]] chromium dioxide was first synthesized in 1956 by Norman L. Cox, a chemist at [[DuPont|E.I. DuPont]], by decomposing [[chromium trioxide]] in the presence of water at a temperature of 800 K and a pressure of 200 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]]. The balanced equation for the [[hydrothermal synthesis]] is:
:3 CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   5 CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The magnetic crystal that forms is a long, slender glass-like rod — perfect as a magnetic pigment for recording tape. When commercialized in the late 1960s as a recording medium, DuPont assigned it the tradename of ''Magtrieve''.

CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adopts the [[rutile structure]] (as do many metal dioxides).  As such each Cr(IV) center has [[octahedral coordination geometry]] and each oxide is trigonal planar.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E/&gt;

==Uses==
The crystal’s magnetic properties, derived from its ideal shape such as  [[anisotropy]] which imparted high [[coercivity]] and remanent magnetization intensities, resulted in exceptional stability and efficiency for short [[wavelengths]], and it almost immediately appeared in high performance audio tape used in [[compact audio cassette|audio cassette]] for which treble response and hiss were always problems. Unlike the spongy looking [[ferric oxide]]s used in common tape, the chromium dioxide crystals were perfectly formed and could be evenly and densely dispersed in a magnetic coating; and that led to unparalleled low noise in audio tapes. Chrome tapes did, however, require a new generation of audiocassette recorders equipped with a higher [[tape bias|bias]] current capability (roughly 50% greater) than that used by iron oxide to properly magnetize the tape particles. Also introduced was a new equalization (70 [[µs]]) that traded some of the extended high-frequency response for lower noise resulting in a 5–6 [[Decibel|dB]] improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over ferric-oxide audio tapes. These bias and EQ settings were later carried over to “chrome-equivalent” cobalt-modified tapes introduced in the mid 1970s by [[TDK]], [[Maxell]], and others. Later research significantly increased the coercivity of the particle by doping or adsorbing rare elements such as [[iridium]] onto the crystal matrix or by improving the axial length-to-deprecated{{huh|date=August 2017}} ratios. The resulting product was potentially a competitor to metallic iron pigments but apparently achieved little market penetration.

===Problems===
Until manufacturers developed new ways to mill the oxide, the crystals could easily be broken in the manufacturing process, and this led to excessive [[print-through]] (echo). Output from a tape could drop about 1&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] or so in a year's time. Although the decrease was uniform across the frequency range and noise also dropped the same amount, preserving the dynamic range, the decrease misaligned [[Dolby]] noise reduction decoders that were sensitive to level settings. The chrome coating was harder than competitive coatings, and that led to accusations of excessive head wear. Although the tape wore hard [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] heads faster than oxide based tapes, it actually wore softer [[permalloy]] heads at a slower rate; and head wear was more a problem for permalloy heads than for ferrite heads. The head wear scare and licensing issues with DuPont kept blank consumer chrome tapes at a great disadvantage versus the eventually more popular Type II tapes that used cobalt-modified iron oxide, but chrome was the tape of choice for the music industry's cassette releases. Because of its low [[Curie temperature]] (approximately {{convert|386|K|F}}), chrome tape lent itself to high-speed [https://web.archive.org/web/20150403010618/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1063031 thermomagnetic duplication] of audio and video cassettes for pre-recorded product sales to the consumer and industrial markets.

==Producers==
DuPont licensed the product to [[Sony]] in Japan and [[BASF]] in Germany in the early 1970s for regional production and distribution. Japanese competitors &lt;!--of Sony resented payment of licensing fees to it for use of the pigment, they--&gt; developed cobalt-adsorbed (TDK: ''Avilyn'') and cobalt ferrite (Maxell: ''[[Epitaxial]]'') "chrome equivalent" Type II audio cassettes and various videotape formats as substitutes. Added to that was the problem that the production of CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yielded toxic by-products of which Japanese manufacturers had great difficulty properly disposing. BASF eventually became the largest producer of both the chromium dioxide pigment and chrome tapes, basing its [[VHS]] &amp; [[S-VHS]] video tape, audio cassettes, and 3480 data cartridges on this formulation. Dupont and BASF had also introduced chrome-cobalt "blended" oxide pigments which combined about 70% cobalt-modified iron oxide with 30% chrome oxide into a single coating, presumably to offer improved performance at lower costs than pure chrome. Many high grade VHS tapes also used much smaller amounts of chrome in their formulations because its magnetic properties combined with its cleaning effects on heads made it a better choice than [[aluminium oxide]] or other non-magnetic materials added to VHS tape to keep heads clean. Dupont discontinued its production of chromium dioxide particles in the 1990s. In addition to BASF, which no longer owns a tape manufacturing division, Bayer AG of Germany, Toda Kogyo and Sakai Chemical of Japan also do or can produce the magnetic particles for commercial applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10057">The '''Clean Air Society of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]''' ('''CASANZ''') is a non-governmental, non-profit organization formed in the 1960s to bring together people with an interest in clean air and the study of [[air pollution]]. Its focus has since grown to include broader [[environmental management]] affairs, but with special emphasis on air quality and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.casanz.org.au/ Official CASANZ website]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2005, the society had 836 members (683 in Australia, 140 in New Zealand, and 13 in other countries). In September 2007, CASANZ hosted the 14th [[International Union of Air Pollution Prevention and Environmental Protection Associations|IUAPPA]] World Congress in Brisbane, Australia.

==Activities promoting environmental protection==
CASANZ promotes the protection of the environment by a variety of activities, including:
*Advancement of knowledge and practical experience of [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[air quality]] management. 
*Providing an organization which gathers and distributes the experience and knowledge of its members. 
*Providing lectures, exhibitions, public meetings and conferences that expand knowledge of environmental matters and, in particular,  air quality — including causes, effects, measurement, legislative aspects and control of [[air pollution]]. 
*Liaison with organizations having similar interests in other countries. 
*Providing scholarships, monetary grants, awards and prizes to encourage the study of relevant subjects.

==The operation and governing of CASANZ==
CASANZ operates through autonomous branches which determine their own programs of activities, including technical meetings, seminars, workshops, conferences, training courses, etc. Details of these activities are circulated to branch members and posted on the society's online web site.

CASANZ is governed by an Executive Committee consisting of:
*An elected Executive Director
*Other officers and representatives nominated by the branches.

The Executive Committee manages the day-to-day activities of the society and directs the work of the Executive Director.

==Special Interest Groups (SIGS)==
As of September 2013, CASANZ has eight Special Interest Groups (commonly referred to as SIGs), each of which is briefly discussed in the following subsections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Default.aspx The eight SIGs of CASANZ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614033919/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modelling Special Interest Group===
The objective of the '''''Modelling Special Interest Group''''' is to bring together CASANZ members who have an interest in the development and/or application of [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to exchange ideas, identify common problems, inform members of new developments, and establish, as appropriate, a 'ModSIG view' on issues of relevance.

Dispersion modelling is becoming more and more a part of licensing emissions to the atmosphere throughout Australia, and there is growing awareness of the role that air quality modelling can play in areas such as air resource management, [[risk assessment]] and land-use planning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/modelling.aspx The Modelling SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035243/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/modelling.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Odour Special Interest Group===
The '''''[[Odour Special Interest Group]]''''' is an important forum for the exchange of information, and in encouraging improved practices in [[odour]] measurement, modelling, assessment, control, management and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/odour.aspx The Odour SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614031539/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/odour.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor Air Special Interest Group===
The '''''Indoor Air Special Interest Group''''' promotes discussion and debate on the state of knowledge and the quality of indoor air, and on related environmental health concerns. The group encourages research, education, community awareness and management of issues related to this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035113/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/indoorair.aspx The Indoor Air SIG page on the Casanz website].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenhouse Special Interest Group===
The purpose of the '''''Greenhouse Special Interest Group''''' is threefold:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035109/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/greenhouse.aspx The Greenhouse SIG page on the CASANZ website].&lt;/ref&gt;

*To identify the research and development work being done at national and international levels on the science of greenhouse and global climate modelling as well as the developments being undertaken to assess and quantify the impact of climate change.
*To inform CASANZ members and the broader community on greenhouse gas emissions, emission scenarios, regional contributions and economic and technological developments.
*To provide response to government policies and initiatives in the area of energy reform and greenhouse abatement so as to stimulate debate amongst members and the broader community.

===Measurement Special Interest Group===
The primary objective of the '''''Measurement Special Interest Group''''' is to ensure that atmospheric pollutants in the ambient air and industrial source emissions are measured utilising methods that are fit for that purpose.

The objective is to be achieved by: conducting workshops, developing decision trees to assist in selecting appropriate air pollution measurement test methods and developing source emission and ambient air quality test methods in cooperation with Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/measurement.aspx The Measurement SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035227/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/measurement.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport Special Interest Group===
The '''''Transport Emissions and Fuel Consumption Modeling Special Interest Group''''' (or simply the '''''Transport Special Interest Group''''') focuses on the quantification and modelling of air pollutant and greenhouse gas impacts from all forms of transport and their support equipment. The Transport Special Interest Group is intended to be a platform for information sharing, discussion of emerging issues and coordination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Transport/Default.aspx The Transport SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035221/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Transport/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk Assessment Interest Group===
The '''''Risk Assessment Interest Group''''' exists to be knowledgeable and supportive of governmental policy developments involving risk assessment, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035058/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Riskassessment/Default.aspx The Risk Assessment SIG page on the Casanz website].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''National Air Quality Standards (Air NEPM)'' which were developed with the help of risk assessment.
* Variations to the State of Victoria's ''Environment Protection Policy for Air Quality Management'' to incorporate formalised risk assessments. 
* The ''National Environmental Health Strategy'', which includes risk assessment as a basis for decision making.
* The Australian Standard for ''Risk Management (AS4360-1999)''.
* The proposal to develop a coordinated national strategy for ''air toxics''.

===Air Policy Special Interest Group===
The purpose of the '''''Air Policy Special Interest Group''''' is to bring together CASANZ members interested in advancing air policy development and contributing to responsible air quality related risk communication by:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/airpolicy/Default.aspx The Air Policy SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035103/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/airpolicy/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exchanging ideas, and informing members of new air policy related developments and air quality issues of significant public concern.
* Coordinating and communicating science-based inputs for air policy, legislative and regulatory development processes.
* Collating and communicating science-based information to communities and decision makers on pressing air quality related issues, including official inquiries

The detergent is rendered inactive by cleavage, usually under [[acid]]ic conditions, in order to make the sample compatible with a following procedure or in order to selectively remove the cleavage products.

Applications for cleavable detergents include [[protease]] [[digestion]] of [[protein]]s such as [[in-gel digestion]] with [[trypsin]] after [[SDS PAGE]] and [[peptide]] extractions from [[electrophoresis]] gels. Cleavable detergents are mainly used in sample preparations for [[mass spectrometry]].

==PPS==
PPS, available as PPS Silent Surfactant from [[Expedeon]], is the abbreviation for sodium 3-(4-(1,1-bis(hexyloxy)ethyl)pyridinium-1-yl)propane-1-sulfonate. This [[acetal]]ic detergent is split under acidic conditions into [[hexanol]] and the [[zwitterion]]ic [[3-acetyl-1-(3-sulfopropyl)pyridinium]].

==ProteaseMAX==
ProteaseMAX'is the brandname of [[Promega]] for sodium 3-((1-(furan-2-yl)undecyloxy)carbonylamino)propane-1-sulfonate. This cleavable detergent is sensitive to heat and [[acid]] and is degraded during a typical trypsin digestion into the uncharged [[lipophilic]] compound [[1-(furan-2-yl)undecan-1-ol]] and the [[zwitterion]]ic [[3-aminopropane-1-sulfonic acid]] (homotaurine), which can be removed by C18 [[solid phase extraction]] during sample work-up.

==RapiGest SF==
RapiGest SF, the brand-name for sodium 3-[(2-methyl-2-undecyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy]-1-propanesulfonate, is an acid-cleavable anionic detergent marketed by [[Waters Corporation]] and [[AOBIOUS INC]].

==Others==

[[MALDI matrix]] compounds such as [[alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid|α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid]] have been linked through a linker consisting of an unsymmetric [[formaldehyde]] [[acetal]]s to [[dodecanol]].&lt;ref name="NorrisPorter2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norris|first1=Jeremy L.|last2=Porter|first2=Ned A.|last3=Caprioli|first3=Richard M.|title=Combination Detergent/MALDI Matrix:  Functional Cleavable Detergents for Mass Spectrometry|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=77|issue=15|year=2005|pages=5036–5040|issn=0003-2700|doi=10.1021/ac050460g}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of cleavable detergent is inherently compatible with [[MALDI]] and does not have to be removed prior to analysis.

[[UV light]]- or [[fluoride]]-cleavable surfactants have also been developed but are not in current use.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42102">The '''conservation and restoration of fur objects''' is the preservation and protection of objects made from or containing [[fur]].  These pieces can include personal items like fur clothing or objects of cultural heritage that are housed in [[museum]]s and [[collection (artwork)|collection]]s.  When dealing with the latter, a [[conservator-restorer]] often handles their care, whereas, for the public, professional [[wikt:furrier|furriers]] can be found in many neighborhoods.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

== Definition of Types of Fur Objects ==

=== Pelts ===
[[File:Puma fur skin.jpg|thumb|Puma Pelt|375x375px]]Pelts are defined as the skin of an animal that still has the hair or fur intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=|title=Pelt|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pelt|journal=The Free Dictionary|page=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pelt|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals used for traditional fur objects alternate between a winter and summer [[Coat (animal)|coat]].  The winter coats of animals are normally more desirable because they are thicker and fuller than the summer coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_l/L101.pdf|title=How to Prepare Pelts|last=College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences|first=|date=October 2012|website=How to Prepare Pelts|publisher=New Mexico State University|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pelts are removed from the animal in a process of [[skinning]] and fleshing that removes all the tissue from the skin and pelt.  The pelts are then [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] and [[Tanning (leather)|tanned]] to kill bacteria and create a stable material.  Pelts are traditionally used to create clothing and home accessories like rugs, they can be mounted to create trophies or taxidermy specimens, or they can be sold and kept as is.

==== Differences between hair and fur ====
The only difference between [[hair]] and [[fur]] is semantics.  Technically, both are made from [[keratin]], which is also the protein that makes up [[skin]], [[feather]]s, [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]], [[Hoof|hooves]], [[claw]]s, and [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/58251/whats-difference-between-hair-and-fur|title=What’s the Difference Between Hair and Fur?|website=Mental Floss|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;blockquote&gt;"The way I think a lot of people understand fur versus hair is in the density of follicles," says Ross McPhee, Curator of the Department of [[Mammalogy]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. "So for fur-bearing animals—which were converted into coats and so-forth—people always wanted it to be something that was very dense, so there’s the idea therefore that fur is dense, and it certainly is in [the] kinds of fur-bearers that we use for this purpose. Whereas hair is not so dense. There's less of it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;This remains untrue however, because the human head has as the same "follicle density" as a mouse, but it just so happens to be genetically predisposed to stop at the head and not continue down the body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There are three types of hair: ground hair, guard hair, and [[whiskers]].  "Ground hair is used primarily as insulation and is soft, while guard hair is for protection from the elements and tends to be coarse."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Both ground hair and guard hair are classified as fur.  Because human hair acts as both, it can technically be called "fur".  In reality, the keratin fibers that are described variously as [[hair]], [[wool]], or [[fur]], depending on the animal type, are all referring to the same thing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation of leather : and related materials|last=Kite|first=Marion|last2=Thomson|first2=Roy|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2006|isbn=9780750648813|location=Oxford, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Taxidermy section - Kunming Natural History Museum of Zoology - DSC02419.JPG|thumb|Taxidermy Animals at the Kunming Natural History Museum of Zoology]]

=== [[Taxidermy|Taxidermy Specimens]] ===
Taxidermy has been around since the times of the [[Ancient Egyptians]].  While more mummification than traditional taxidermy, the Egyptians still preserved animals in their form by removing the innards and drying the carcass with salts from the [[Nile]] to [[dehydrate]] and preserve.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ravishingbeasts.com/a-short-history-of-taxidermy/|title=taxidermy - A Short History of Taxidermy|website=www.ravishingbeasts.com|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest known pieces of modern taxidermy are from the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the development and perfection of taxidermic techniques were linked to Western Europe’s fascination with the natural world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Through the ages, taxidermy has progressed.  During the Victorian era, taxidermy became closer to what is seen in museums today.  There was a transition from using [[straw]], [[paper]], and other materials to create the mountings for the hides to using internal structures with rods and the actual animal skulls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Taxidermy is still used in museums and collections today.  Most notable is the work of [[Carl Akeley]], who modernized the idea of including taxidermied specimens in recreations of their natural habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/carl-akeley|title=Carl Akeley|last=admin|date=2011-11-29|website=The Field Museum|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Fur clothing|Clothing and Accessories]]  ===
Human beings have been wearing fur since the beginning of time.

==== [[Modern art|Modern Art]] ====
There are several notable instances of pieces of Modern Art in museums and collections made from, in part, of fur.  The most famous is a piece of [[Surrealist Art]] made by [[Méret Oppenheim]] called ''[[Le Déjeuner en fourrure|Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)]]'' or ''Luncheon in Fur'', which is in the permanent collection at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] (see Notable Example below).  Inarguably, it is the most famous piece of art containing fur that is not a piece of furniture.  Oppenheim once wrote of the spirit of her piece, "fur combined with a teacup evokes such a surprising mix of messages and associations. The fur may remind viewers of wild animals and nature, while the teacup could suggest manners and civilization. With its pelt, the teacup becomes soft, rounded, and highly tactile.  It seems attractive to the touch, if not, on the other hand, to the taste: Imagine drinking from it, and the physical sensation of wet fur filling the mouth." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/meret-oppenheim-object-paris-1936|title=MoMA {{!}} Meret Oppenheim.

She became so synonymous with the medium, she was known as "the artist that works with fur;" a label which she refused to embrace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/91443/talking-about-meret-oppenheim-an-interview-with-lisa-wenger/|title=Talking about Meret Oppenheim: An Interview with Lisa Wenger|date=2013-12-06|website=Hyperallergic|language=en-US|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was nonetheless known for.

Furniture is another highly collected area of Modern Art that features fur.  Artist, [[Alvar Aalto]] is famous for representing [[Finland]] in the Modern [[Scandinavian design]].  His chair, Armchair 400 made with reindeer fur is a great example of this.  The MFA in Boston houses another famous [http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/chairchair-35134 chair] with fur made by [[Richard Artschwager]].

==== [[Contemporary art|Contemporary Art]] ====
Contemporary artists are starting to embrace the use of fur as a medium as well.  In 2014, an opera singer and artist named Mateo Blanco, gained notoriety for creating celebrity portraits out of dog fur, which are housed at the [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Orlando Odditorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ripleys.com/blog/mateo-blanco-dog-fur/|title=Fluffy Portraits Made with Dog Hair|date=2014-12-10|website=Ripley's Believe It or Not!|language=en-US|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   And, in 2015, [[Danny Rozin]] debuted a piece entitled "[https://vimeo.com/128375543 PomPom Mirror]" as part of a new artist's exhibition at [[Bitforms gallery|bitforms]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2015/05/an-interactive-fur-mirror-by-daniel-rozin/|title=An Interactive 'Fur' Mirror by Daniel Rozin|date=2015-05-26|website=Colossal|language=en-US|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece uses faux fur and an [[Xbox]] [[kinect]] system to make the fur balls move and create a mirror effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bitforms.com/rozin-2015/pompom-mirror|title=bitforms gallery  » PomPom Mirror|website=www.bitforms.com|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leather.jpg|thumb|Leather]]

=== [[Leather]] ===
Leather is the "skin of an animal, with the hair removed, prepared for use by tanning or a similar process designed to preserve it against decay and make it pliable or supple when dry".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/leather|title=the definition of leather|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While technically not fur, leather is a byproduct and the skin on the reverse side of pelts suffer the same kind of damage as leather products which include [[acid hydrolysis]], [[Redox|oxidation]], metals and salts from the [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] process, heat, and [[humidity]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These issues also affect fur objects.

==== Dealing with Leather Objects ====
While closely related, the [[Conservation and restoration of leather objects|Conservation and Restoration of Leather Objects]] is a separate specialty.

== Causes of Deterioration of Fur Objects ==
[[File:Anthrenus flavipes larvae adult wool.jpg|thumb|Carpet beetles eating wool]]

=== Insects  ===
"Furs are among the most exquisite delicacies for critters...&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;"  "Fiber-feeding insects need the vitamins and amino acids found in their scavenger diet.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;"  "Clean fur lacks these supplements and must be contaminated with a certain amount of soilage like perspiration, body oils, airborne micro-organisms before insects become and issue.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The only "clean" fur is one that has been sterilized through conservation efforts.  The most common insects that infest fur objects are [[moth]]s and [[Dermestidae|carpet beetles]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Most pests will lay eggs on or inside the object and the larvae will actually cause the most damage as they grow to adulthood.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Infestation is evidenced by small piles of dust, the [[frass]] and [[Moulting|casts]] of the insects in shedding in their growth cycle.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Evidence of previous infestations on fur objects include the bodies of dead insects and their [[Moulting|casings]] on the surface of the object and "concave scars" with a "scalloped" appearance from their round [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Rodents and other small mammals may also be attracted to fur objects as a food source.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  This kind of infestation would be visible in droppings and larger areas of damage.

=== Temperature and Humidity ===
Temperature is vital for the long-term care of fur objects.  Store rooms should be kept at a relative humidity level of between 45% and 55%, with fluctuations to be expected, but 65% would critical for mold growth,&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conservation.myspecies.info/node/32|title=standards in the care of skins and taxidermy collections {{!}} Conservation and Collections Care|website=conservation.myspecies.info|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which skin items are highly susceptible to.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  This may require the use of a humidifier or dehumidifier depending on the institution.  Temperature should be kept as stable as possible between 10&amp;nbsp;°C and 22&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  "Warm environments can cause the release of residual fats in skins resulting in hair loss.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;"  Excessive heat causes shrinkage in the fibers, it makes the skin brittle and more prone to tears.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Whereas excess moisture leads to swelling, distortion, putrefaction (if not properly cured) and mold growth.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The combination of both cause the collagen to break down and threaten the physical integrity of the piece.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Chemical ===
Some insecticides used as pest prevention like, [[Camphor]], [[Naphthalene|napthalene]], and [[para-dichlorobenzene]] (PDB) can be harmful to some colors if used with dyed fur objects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In general, hair fibers are "difficult to destroy" because keratin is such a strong fiber.  Strong acids will not break down the fiber and strong bases "will do no more than soften or possibly bleach" the fur.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, if a fur object is subjected to that kind of treatment, the hair will become brittle and break off.

=== Improper Storage ===
If fur objects have not been protected from the environment around them then they are susceptible to dirt and dust.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Motes settle between the fibers and create a dirty appearance.  Light exposure is also an issue.  Exposure to ultraviolet light in daylight and artificial light causes pigments in specimens to fade.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icon.org.uk/what-is-conservation/caring-your-collection|title=Caring for your collection {{!}} Icon|website=icon.org.uk|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Light should be kept at between 50 - 100 lux for display and no light in storage.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;      
[[File:Wild cat fur coat, front.jpg|thumb|259x259px|Normal wear and tear]]

=== Handling ===
Fur objects are made from organic materials which are soilable.  For clothing and accessories, the objects are subjected to the wear and tear of everyday use may include, soiling and staining made by food, make-up, sweat, odor, or skin grease that can leave permanent marks on the fur altering both its color and texture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Make-up and oils can cause the hairs to stick together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/community/chi-ugc-article-why-a-fur-coat-needs-cleaning-and-storage-2016-03-30-story.html|title=Why a Fur Coat needs Cleaning and Storage|last=UGC|first=Chicago Tribune|website=Daily Southtown|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wearing can also result in physical damage to the object through overuse.  Friction at the joints, like the armpits, elbows, and collar of a coat can cause bald areas.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Stitching unraveling and rips are also common issues that arise from wearing a fur object.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Nitrile rubber|Nitrile]] gloves should be worn when handling fur objects to prevent and transfer.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Taxidermy Issues ===
Older specimens were filled with straw and paper to recreate the musculature of the animals.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/13067/11-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-taxidermy|title=11 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Taxidermy|website=Mental Floss|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the physicality of the animal was changed in mounting, the pelt would have become stretched or distorted to fit the new shape.  A prime example of this was a rhinoceros that belonged to Louis XIV and Louis XV.  "Its skin was varnished and stretched over a frame of wooden hoops.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;"  The skin is now on display at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Museum national d’Histoire naturelle]] in Paris, but is it unlikely it could be remounted.

== Cleaning ==
The care and cleaning of fur objects should always be undertaken by a trained [[Collection manager|collections manager]] or [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]].

=== Dry Cleaning ===

==== Brushing and Vacuuming ====
[[File:Filbert brush.jpg|thumb|205x205px|Natural hair brush]]
Provided there is no shedding issue, brushing is the first step in cleaning fur objects.  Light brushing, using a paintbrush,&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://squirrel.adobeconnect.com/_a751959191/p18c8t9f0v5/?launcher=false&amp;fcsContent=true&amp;pbMode=normal|title=HP C2C Seminar_30|website=squirrel.adobeconnect.com|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; will help dislodge any particulate soiling, surface dust, and insect frass.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Stiffer natural brushes can be used if the dirt is stubborn but metal brushes should never be used.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  A variable speed vacuum with brushes and other attachments works on most surface dirt as well as removing the remnants of an insect infestation.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The vacuum should be set to low and a muslin or net should be placed over the nozzle to protect the object.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  HEPA filters should be used if arsenic preservation is suspected.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Sponging ====
Greasy dirt can be removed with a vulcanized rubber&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; sponge known as "soot sponges," because they are also great at removing smoke and soot, which are often the residue of museums or collections that were heated with coal heat in the past.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Cosmetic sponges can also be in conjunction with the vacuum to remove even more surface dirt.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Wet Cleaning ===
Wet cleaning is incredibly harmful to protein materials.  Processes like dry-cleaning [[solvent]]s, [[oil]], [[wax]]es, lubricants, and [[saddle soap]]s actually can remove the natural protective oils causing further drying that can lead to [[embrittlement]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|last=Bachmann|first=Konstanze|publisher=Smithsonian Books|year=1992|isbn=978-1-56098-174-9|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When solvents are absolutely necessary, they should be spot tested before overall use to ensure there is no harmful dyeing or bleaching.  If it was determined safe, the solvent should be applied with a swab going in the direction of the fur.  If possible, absorbent paper should be placed under the strands being treated to separate them from unnecessarily getting solvent on the rest of the object.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Fur objects can often become stiff or distorted, but steaming or spraying water directly on the object can cause damage.  The solution for misshapen objects is increased humidity as a restorative tool.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Freezing ===
The only sure way of removing pest infestation on fur objects is through freezing.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Objects should be placed inside a clear polyester bag, the excess air should be removed and it should be heat sealed.  An alternative is a polyethylene bag with parcel tape.  The bag can be placed in a domestic freezer for at least 14 days at a temperature of -18&amp;nbsp;°C or for 72 hours at -30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  It is important to note that if the atmosphere is maintained at a high humidity point in very low temperatures, the moisture will form frost on the object and with too little humidity, the object will absorb what little moisture there is and dry out, so it is vital to maintain the proper environment even in freezing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Cold storage, at 10&amp;nbsp;°C is recommended at all times to inhibit insect activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pool|first=Marilen|date=Spring 1997|title=Preliminary Analysis of the Effects of Cold Storage on Fur Garments and Mammal Skins|url=http://www.spnhc.org/media/assets/cofo_1997_V13_N1_new.pdf|journal=Collection Forum|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repair and Restoration ==
Conservation efforts must take into account the properties of both the fur and skin.  The objects have already been through the stresses of "fur-skin processing,"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which can weaken the object.  Physical damage that happens during the skin processing may only become evident with the passage of time.  If the skin was pared too deeply during fleshing, the result would be eventual hair loss.  It will also become evident, over time, if the fur was removed from the animal too early in the season.  This means that the bulbs of the hair had not fully completed the growth process and the hair will fall out, leaving a sparse pelt.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  While, "[m]ost dry animal fiber can be extended or stretched up to 30 percent of its length before break occurs,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/analyzingfurdama541penc|title=Analyzing fur damage with a microscope|last=Pence|first=Roy J. (Roy James)|date=1966-01-01|publisher=[Berkeley, Calif.] : Division of Agricultural Sciences, University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;" it is unclear the object has been through before entering the collection.

=== Filling/Patching and Dyeing ===
Generally, fur objects are fragile and, for a variety of reasons, they can experience loss.  The process of filling is a common practice.  Filling is a standard procedure in which synthetic fur, most commonly made of white [[nylon]] with a "four-way spandex stretch backing.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-010.html|title=SYNTHETIC FILL MATERIALS FOR SKIN, LEATHER, AND FURS|last=Nieuwenhuizen|first=Linda|date=1998-01-01|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  There are three standard fur lengths that include short (2.5–5.0&amp;nbsp;cm); medium (8.0–10.0&amp;nbsp;cm); and long (10.0–15.0&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The use of white synthetic fur allows for tinting or dying before application.  It is recommended that nylon furs "can be dyed with acid or premetalized dyes according to the manufacturer's directions at pH 5.5 and pH 7 or slightly above, respectively. The dyed fabric must be subjected to an after-scour at 140°F.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;"

The first step in the physical filling is creating a backing that is applied to bridge the area of loss and the fill material.  The "most commonly used materials for backings are inert fabrics coupled with either resins, starches, or cellulose ethers with evaporative solvents, or resins or systems requiring the use of a heat-seal process.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;"  The next step is creating a template of the area of loss.  That template is then transferred to the fur and cut to size.  The patch should be applied to the object with "Acryloid F-10 in acetone" by applying the adhesive directly to a substrate inserted in the hole and placed the edged of the fill directly adjacent sides of the existing fur.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The full should then be cut and textured to match the surrounding fur.  As with all conservation efforts, it should be fully documented and reversible.

Of course, real fur can also be used to patch.  Like fur is often available for common repairs like [[rabbit]] and [[fox]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Preventative Care, Maintenance, and Storage ==
"Of all the items made from natural materials, those derived from animal skins are some of the most versatile and durable found in collections.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-skinandskinProducts_000.pdf|title=Skin and Skin Products (Leather)|last=Minnesota Historical Society|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  However, all fur is subject to damage from light and temperature, therefore care should be taken to mitigate their effects.  Also, an [[Museum integrated pest management|integrated pest management system]] must be employed because organic materials are especially susceptible to pests.

=== Pelts ===
Skin garments and hides should be stored on flat mounts which supports the item when it is in storage and facilitates movement of the object without undue flexing and handling.  If the object needs to be stuffed to maintain shape, unbuffered [[Acid-free paper|acid-free tissue]] should be used.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Taxidermy Specimens ===
The height of taxidermy in the Victorian Age brought forth the invention of "arsenical soap.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marte|first=Fernando|last2=Pequignot|first2=Amandine|last3=Endt|first3=David W. Von|date=2006-01-01|title=Arsenic in taxidermy collections: History, detection, and management|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237749788_Arsenic_in_taxidermy_collections_History_detection_and_management|volume=21|issue=1|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  French [[pharmacist]] and [[Conservation movement|naturalist]], [[Jean-Baptiste Bécœur|Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur]], invented a type of paste in 1738 to prevent pest infestation in taxidermy specimens, preserve skin and prevent the decay of remaining flesh.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.examiner.net/article/20090926/news/309269913/?Start=1|title=Arsenic and old mounts – be careful|last=Fox|first=Gene|website=Examiner|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He came up with a mixture of ground [[Arsenic trisulfide|arsenic]], [[camphor]], [[potassium carbonate]], powdered [[calcium hydroxide]], and soap which kept pests at bay.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  He was renowned for his specimens and treatment of them but, in his lifetime, he refused to disclose his exact recipe.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 1820, French taxidermist [[Louis Dufresne]], determined the formula and popularized it,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; making it the standard until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Taxidermist then opted for [[Borax]] because it is nontoxic though, ultimately less effective in pest prevention.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The use of arsenical soap leaves a does not compromise the actual specimen, but is hazardous to both museum workers and guests.  Arsenic can sometimes be detected visually as the compound usually crystallizes into white "arsenic dust" that normally creates deposits at the base of hairs, feathers, around the eyes, in or at the base of ears, around mouths or bills, and on foot pads.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   However, the lack of arsenic dust does no preclude specimens from having previous treatment with the compound.  The most efficient way to test is with the ''Arsenic Paper Test'' kit manufactured by the Macherey-Nagel Corporation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The test involves rubbing cotton swab, moistened with distilled water, and rubbing it on the contaminated specimen.  The tip is then cut off and placed in a flask with water, then after an hour, it is added to concentrated [[Hydrochloric acid|chlorydric acid]] and around [[Zinc oxide|zinc]] powder.  A test strip is then introduced and, determining the color, it can be assessed whether the object is contaminated or not.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  "It is safer to assume that all mammal and bird specimens collected and prepared before the 1980s may be contaminated with arsenic, and to follow proper handling guidelines.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8776130/Care_of_Arsenic-Contaminated_Taxidermy_and_Ethnographic_Collections|title=Care of Arsenic-Contaminated Taxidermy and Ethnographic Collections|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

If the object is contaminated with arsenic, proper steps must be taken to remit the toxin and keep the environment safe.  Specimens that test positive must have "Arsenic Contaminated" clearly visible on their label and be separated from other specimens.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1255&amp;context=theses|title=Poisonous Heritage: Pesticides in Museum Collections|last=Omstein|first=Leslie|date=2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nitrile rubber|Nitrile]] gloves and a protective apron, as well as a [[respirator]], should be mandatory when dealing with these specimens.  The specimen should be vacuumed with a [[HEPA|HEPA filter]] in a well-ventilated space.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  These objects should be continuously tested every two or three years because arsenic was usually applied to the inside of the specimen as well, and can migrate from the inside to the outside of the specimen.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Arsenic was commonly used among [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] specimens as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic35-01-003.html|title=A HISTORY OF PEST CONTROL MEASURES IN THE ANTHROPOLOGY COLLECTIONS, NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION|last=Goldberg|first=Lisa|date=1996-01-01|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mounted specimens should be kept on their original bases for storage purposes and encased in custom [[Ethafoam]] cases.  The Ethafoam should be secured to the mount with cotton twill tape or [[polyethylene]] covered twist ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn14/wn14-2/wn14-205.html|title=Storage Methods for Taxidermy Specimens|last=Fuller|first=Tamsen|date=1992-05-01|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This limits damage due to handling the fur object.

=== Clothing and Accessories ===
Fur, by nature, is heavy, therefore care should be taken when storing these objects.  When storing fur clothing, well-padded hangars should be employed and no furs should be packed so close to each other that they can crush of flatten one another.  [[Cotton]], [[silk]], or [[Tyvek]] bags should be used to enclose each fur, making sure the weave of the bag is fine enough to keep out insects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saving Stuff: How to Care for and Preserve Your Collectibles, Heirlooms, and Other Prized Possessions|last=Williams|first=Don|last2=Jagger|first2=Louisa|publisher=Fireside/Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2005|isbn=9780743264167|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Straps should never be used to support objects, even if that is their given function.  The piece should either be stored flat or a support should be supplied at the base, allowing the straps or handles to be supported in a natural, unstressed, position.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Display Issues ==
For display, the piece should have adequate support for the weight and fragility of the object so it is not wrinkled or under stress.  In reference to garments, [[mannequin]]s should be tailored appropriately to fit the intended piece and custom mounts should be made for accessories.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Acrylic paint|Acrylic]] mounts provide the best support for heavy materials.  They also can be heated to conform to an object's exact surface shape.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Padding should be applied so the object is not stressed by the hard [[Plexiglas]].  Large pelts should be displayed on tiled boards covered in a "coarse textile to help grip the item.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;"  Metal hangars, pins, or clips should never be used to display fur objects because the metal can react with the oils in the skin and stain the object,&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; known as [[verdigris]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Exhibitors must be aware of the agents of deterioration.  Heat, light, and humidity should be carefully monitored in whatever environment is created for the display of the objects.  Fur objects should not be exposed to more light than 5 footcandles - 18&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  The exhibitor should also plan on rotating pieces during a long exhibition due to fading and physical damage that may occur.  The exhibit space must also be routinely inspected for rodents and other pests.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

[[File:Samson the gorilla (23547597554).jpg|thumb|Samson at the Milwaukee Public Museum]]

=== [https://www.mpm.edu/plan-visit/exhibitions/permanent-exhibits/first-floor-exhibits/samson Samson] at the [[Milwaukee Public Museum]] ===
Samson was a [[Gorilla|Silverback Gorilla]] that lived at the [[Milwaukee County Zoo]] from 1950 to 1981.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taxidermy.net/forum/index.php?topic=163318.0|title=Tribute To "Samson"|website=www.taxidermy.net|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a crowd favorite for his size and frequent acts of banging on the glass of his enclosure.  After his death of a heart attack, Samson's remains were given to the Milwaukee Public Museum like his brother, Sambo's, had been in 1959 for taxidermy purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Samson's bones were re-articulated sometime after and displayed in the museum's exhibit paying tribute to [[Victorian era]] museology, "The Sense of Wonder," next to an upright human skeleton and a smaller ape.

In 2006, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his death, the Milwaukee Public Museum planned to mount an exhibit in his honor with a taxidermy specimen of Samson taking center stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpm.edu/plan-visit/exhibitions/permanent-exhibits/first-floor-exhibits/samson|title=Samson {{!}} Milwaukee Public Museum|website=www.mpm.edu|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "[w]hen curators went to mount his hide, they found his freeze-dried hide had deteriorated too much to use in a taxidermy mount.”&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/29228414.html|title=Samson comes alive!|website=www.jsonline.com|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His pelt was determined to be unsalvageable, to it fell to staff taxidermist, Wendy Christiansen-Senk, to recreate Samson from scratch.

Because Samson was a frequently documented local hero, Christiansen-Senk had a lot of material to work with.  The most invaluable research she had was the insight of former zookeeper and Samson caregiver, Sam LaMalfa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoosociety.org/Education/FunStuff/SamsonMemories.php|title=Memories of Samson the Gorilla {{!}} Zoological Society of Milwaukee|website=www.zoosociety.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During her recreation, she consulted Samson's bones, videos of him at the zoo, photographs, his death mask (which is also part of the [[Milwaukee Public Museum|MPM]] collection), and LaMalfa.  "In conventional taxidermy we would use the real skin, tailoring the mannequin to fit the real skin. In this case I had to come up with hair and textures and colors, and try to match the hair on the body of one animal. It's a lot more challenging method.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;" said Christiansen-Senk in 2006 regarding the effort.  Christiansen-Senk molded a [[silicone]] face using Samson’s death mask and thousands of photographs.  She then purchased a replica gorilla skeleton and yak and synthetic hair.  She spent more than a year implanting individual hairs into Samson's silicone face.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/taxidermy/christy-text|title=Still Life|last=Christy|first=Bryan|website=National Geographic|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christiansen-Senk matched the coloring and patterning on Samson so convincingly that LaMalfa said, upon seeing the completed model, "That's him. I'm waiting for him to move so I can talk to him.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The result was so amazing, Christiansen-Senk entered her recreation in the 2009 World Taxidermy Championship, where she won first prize for the best recreation and the Judge's Choice Best in Show against real animal taxidermy entries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Samson remains on permanent exhibit at the Milwaukee Public Museum.     
     
=== ''[[Le Déjeuner en fourrure|Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)]]'' at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]  ===
In 1936, [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.|Alfred H. Barr Jr.]], the young director of New York's Museum of Modern Art approached Méret Oppenheim to negotiate purchasing ''Luncheon in Fur''.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/02/09/466061492/luncheon-in-fur-the-surrealist-tea-cup-that-stirred-the-art-world|title='Luncheon In Fur': The Surrealist Teacup That Stirred The Art World|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oppenheim expressed a willingness to sell and Barr paid $50 to make history. ''Luncheon in Fur'' was the first work by a woman the museum acquired and Oppenheim is dubbed the First Lady of MoMA.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  As the First Lady, Oppenheim reportedly gave instructions for the conservation of her piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/surrealismandmagic/exhibition/seer/bibliophile.html|title=Surrealism and Magic|website=rmc.library.cornell.edu|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those instructions have not been made public, but the piece has been on display in a "Plexiglas [[Display case|vitrine]]" since 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mortality Immortality?: The Legacy of 20th-century Art|last=Corzo|first=Miguel Angel|last2=Getty Conservation Institute|publisher=Getty Publications|year=1999|isbn=9780892365289|location=|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as "balding.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;"

It is assumed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-1010/art-between-wars/surrealism1/a/meret-oppenheim-object-fur-covered-cup-saucer-and-spoon|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Oppenheim glued the cream-and-tan pelt of a Chinese [[gazelle]]&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; to her now famous china.  The adhesive dates from the creation of the object in 1936, so may be breaking down.  Also, the lighting and the fact it is on exhibit so frequently cause conservation concerns.  Ideally, the object would be conserved in accordance with today's standards, but the directive Oppenheim left may speak more towards her intent as an artist and any attempt to conserve the piece could alter its "original state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|last=Appelbaum|first=Barbara|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7506-8274-9|location=Oxford|pages=173–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11683">The '''conservation and restoration of woodblock prints,''' is the process of caring for and repairing images made from a specific printing process involving using wooden reliefs to stamp or imprint an image onto paper. The process of creating [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] as Asian examples are known, or [[woodcut]]s as Western examples are called, has been known for many centuries, and many older prints have experienced aging and deterioration of the paper and colorants used.

== Common materials ==
=== Japanese woodblock prints ===
Woodblock prints from Japan are commonly printed on ''[[Japanese tissue|kozo]]'', paper made from mulberry tree fibers. Many pigments were derived from organic materials. For example, some blue hues were derived from [[dayflower]] petals. Other inorganic colorants, such as red lead, were also used.  &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Museum of Fine Arts|title=Conservation and Care of Museum Collections|date=2011|publisher=MFA Publications|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese woodblock prints ===
Fibers of Chinese woodblock prints come from five different plant groups: hemp, bark, rattan, bamboo, and grass. Fibers from these different groups were often combined, based on which plants were locally available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/mci/downloads/RELACT/chinese_prints.pdf|title=Technology, treatment, and care of a Chinese wood block print|last=Tsai|first=Fei Wen|date=1997|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European woodcuts ===
European woodcuts such as Italian [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s, were generally made of three materials: paper, pigment, and a pigment binder. Paper was generally thin, because woodcuts were made in larger batches, and were relatively cheap. The pigments were composed of both light-stable inorganic materials such as metals and earth compounds as well as organic colorants such as indigo. Both of these respond to environmental conditions different, and require different conservation treatments depending on the chemical composition. Binding agents for the pigments were oil-based and used to dry the inks more quickly. They were made from materials such as linseed oil and conifer resin.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morenus|first=Linda Stiber|last2=Eng|first2=Charlotte W.|last3=Takahatake|first3=Naoko|last4=Rambaldi|first4=Diana C.|date=2015-11-01|title=16th- and 17th-Century Italian Chiaroscuro Woodcuts: Instrumental Analysis, Degradation, and Conservation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1179/1945233015Y.0000000008|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=54|issue=4|pages=238–271|doi=10.1179/1945233015Y.0000000008|issn=0197-1360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of deterioration ==
[[File:Joshu, Ushibori, Hetachi Provinces LACMA 46.38.12 (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|Joshu, Ushibori, Hetachi Provinces LACMA 46.38.12]][[File:Joshu, Ushibori, Hetachi Provinces LACMA 46.38.12 (2 of 2).jpg|thumb|Print shows signs of fading. Joshu, Ushibori, Hetachi Provinces LACMA 46.38.12]]
=== Light ===

Light has been known to fade pigments in woodblock prints, such as the colorant dayflower blue, found in many Japanese woodblock prints. [[Ultraviolet]] is the most damaging wavelength, yet even [[infrared]] can cause damage, especially because it also heats up prints when they are exposed to infrared waves. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2006|title=Conservation of Japanese Woodblock Prints: Display, Storage, and Treatment|jstor=42597791|journal=Impressions|volume=28|pages=60-75|last1=Fiske|first1=Betty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humidity ===

Paper and pigments are both very sensitive to changing humidity levels. If [[relative humidity]] falls lower than 35 percent, the paper can dry out and become brittle. If it reaches higher than 65 percent, the paper can become distorted. Furthermore, certain pigments can become more translucent in higher relative humidity. High fluctuations in relative humidity may cause the paper to experience stresses that could cause it to crack. Humidity can also aid the growth of pests and mold. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Heat ===
Heat can accelerate the rate of mechanical stresses in organic materials and cause the structure to become brittle or unstable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Pollutants ===
Pollutants found in the air can interact with materials on woodblock prints and cause them to deteriorate at a quicker rate. For example, when exposed to sulfur-containing gases, red lead pigments will turn a metallic brown/black color.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== Pests ===
Insects and pests can destroy woodblock prints by eating through the paper or leaving droppings that stain the paper. A common cause of holes in Japanese woodblock prints is the deathwatch beetle (''[[Deathwatch beetle|Xestobium rufovillosum]]''). These beetles were commonly found in wood used to build furniture in the [[Edo period]]. Woodblock prints that were stored on bookshelves, or other furniture infested with these beetles, also became infested themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Valérie|last2=Kamba|first2=Nobuyuki|last3=Tsuchiya|first3=Yuko|last4=Lin|first4=Huan-Shen|date=2013-09-01|title=A new approach to the conservation and presentation of ukiyo-e prints|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19455224.2013.828632|journal=Journal of the Institute of Conservation|volume=36|issue=2|pages=186–194|doi=10.1080/19455224.2013.828632|issn=1945-5224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kabuki Theatre Kawarazakiza LACMA M.2000.105.36a-c (2 of 3).jpg|thumb|Print shows holes caused by Deathwatch beetles. Kabuki Theatre Kawarazakiza LACMA M.2000.105.36a-c]]
== Preventative Conservation ==
Preventative conservation, or [[collections care]], is a way of preventing deterioration of materials by reducing agents of deterioration. A good integrated pest management system as well as an HVAC system that filters for common pollutants have been known to reduce the damage woodblock prints receive. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Storage ===
The paper of woodblocks are often made of wood fibers and may react to non-archival quality storage materials. For example, if stored in paper folders, the prints can become acidic. Using acid-free storage materials can prevent these acidic processes. Storage materials such as folders or boxes can also prevent light from reaching the print, and further reduce damage to light-sensitive materials.

=== Display ===
Ultraviolet-filtered, Plexiglas-glazed frames do little to protect woodblock prints from light damage over time. Museums often limit the display of woodblock prints, such as not exposing them to light for more than three weeks at light levels of 50 [[lux]] and keep relative humidity at 50 percent ± 5 percent. It is recommended to slowly acclimate prints to any difference in temperature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Restoration and Treatment ==
=== Spots and Stains ===
One method, called a blotter wash, can help to remove stains. This process involves applying a solution (such as a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water) onto the areas affected by stains, spray rinsing the print in order to rinse off the solution, and then [[Blotting paper|blotting]] it dry. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awjg5IhVX-Y|title=blotter wash of woodcut on thin paper|last=Owen|first=Bryan|date=2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many processes for removing stains could be highly detrimental to the paper, the pigment, or both. Water washing techniques such as immersion, floating, or suction table may cause the ink to run. Some organic colorants may even dissolve when exposed to water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Holes and Losses ===
Holes should be repaired using infilling. This is the process of adhering a separate piece of paper over the holes. Oftentimes adhesives are added that can be easily removed.

=== Stripping and Demounting ===
Demounting is the process of removing a print from the mounting material. This is often done because older mounts were usually made from acidic paper materials that can deteriorate the paper or fade colorants. Mounts are usually adhered to prints through adhesive agents that can cause yellow distortions on the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/annualmeeting/5-characterizationoftraditional.pdf|title=Characterization of traditional Japanese colorants in woodblock printing using multispectral imaging|last=Edwards|first=Gwenanne|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Flattening ===
Dry flattening the paper of a print can sometimes remove signs of [http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Cockling cockling], [http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Crease creasing], or wrinkling, In this process, the print is laid flat on a surface, and the weight of another object is used to add even pressure across the print. Sometimes flattening can be unnecessary, such as when storing items in a folder may be suitable instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=Stephanie|date=2002|title=Practical Considerations for Humidifying and Flattening Paper|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v21/bp21-15.pdf|journal=The Book and Paper Group Annual 21|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humidity flattening techniques often involve using humidity to help flatten paper objects; however, this technique can cause further damage to prints that have [[water-soluble]] colorants.

== Restoration Projects ==

=== Antonio da Trento's ''Martyrdom of Two Saints'' ===
[https://unframed.lacma.org/2016/02/04/examination-and-conservation-antonio-da-trento%E2%80%99s-martyrdom-two-saints The Martyrdom of Two Saints] from the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] is an Italian chiaroscuro woodcut by [[Antonio da Trento]] that had cuts in the support. When conservators looked more closely at this artwork in 2016, they also saw unusual discolorations that proved that newer materials were used to conserve the piece in the past, and the added colorants faded at a much slower rate than the original colorants, leaving much darker stains. In order to restore da Tento's print, conservators infilled the support with new paper and masked the newer overpaint with pigments that more closely matched the rest of the print's colors as seen today.

=== Torii Kiyonaga's ''Two Beauties under a Cherry Tree'' ===
[https://www.loc.gov/preservation/conservators/japanesepillar/index.html Two Beauties under a Cherry Tree] is a pillar print, a tall and narrow print used to hang in front of traditional Japanese pillars. It is housed at the Library of Congress, and underwent conservation in 2012 for the exhibit, [https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/cherry-blossoms/ Sakura: Cherry Blossoms as Living Symbols of Friendship.] This print was brittle, acidic, discolored, and tearing due to light and pollutants exposure as well as a previous restoration with acidic materials. When it underwent conservation treatment, the print's previous mount was stripped. The print was washed in a calcium solution that reversed some yellow discoloration. In addition, an oxidizing solution was added to red lead colorants that had turned black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/conservators/japanesepillar/index.html|title=Conservation Treatment of a Japanese Pillar Print|last=Karnes|first=Cyntia|date=2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[building design]], internal equipment, occupants, and outdoor weather conditions may affect the cooling load in a building using different [[heat transfer]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt; The [[SI unit]]s are [[watt]]s.

== Overview ==
The cooling load is calculated to select [[HVAC]] equipment that has the appropriate [[cooling capacity]] to remove heat from the zone. A zone is typically defined as an area with similar heat gains, similar temperature and humidity control requirements, or an enclosed space within a building with the purpose to monitor and control the zone's temperature and humidity with a single sensor e.g. thermostat.&lt;ref name=ashrae901&gt;{{cite journal|title=Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings|date=2013|publisher=ASHRAE|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooling load calculation methodologies take into account heat transfer by [[Thermal conduction|conduction]], [[convection]], and [[radiation]]. Methodologies include heat balance,&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt; radiant time series,&lt;ref name=RTS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spitler|first1=Jeffrey D.|last2=Fisher|first2=Daniel E.|last3=Pedersen|first3=Curtis O.|title=The Radiant Time Series Cooling Load Calculation Procedure|journal=ASHRAE Transactions|date=1997|volume=103|issue=2|pages=503–515}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cooling load temperature difference calculation method|cooling load temperature difference]], transfer function,&lt;ref name=TFM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitalas|first1=G.P.|title=Transfer function method of calculating cooling loads, heat extraction, and space temperature|journal=ASHRAE Journal|date=1973|volume=14|issue=12|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sol-air temperature]]. Methods calculate the cooling load in either steady state or dynamic conditions and some can be more involved than others. These methodologies and others can be found in [[ASHRAE Handbook|ASHRAE handbooks]], [[ISO]] Standard 11855, [[European Standard]] (EN) 15243, and EN 15255.&lt;ref name=FengD&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feng|first1=Jingjuan|title=Design and Control of Hydronic Radiant Cooling Systems|date=May 2014|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6qc4p0fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASHRAE recommends the heat balance method and radiant time series methods.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt;

== Differentiation from heat gains ==
The cooling load of a building should not be confused with its heat gains. Heat gains refer to the rate at which heat is transferred into or generated inside a building. Just like cooling loads, heat gains can be separated into sensible and latent heat gains that can occur through conduction, convection, and radiation. Thermophysical properties of walls, floors, ceilings, and windows, [[lighting power density]] (LPD), [[plug load]] density, occupant density, and equipment [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]] play an important role in determining the magnitude of heat gains in a building.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt; [[ASHRAE]] handbook of fundamentals refers to the following six modes of entry for heat gains:&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt;

# Solar radiation through transparent surfaces
# Heat conduction through exterior walls and roofs
# Heat conduction through ceilings, floors, and interior partitions
# Heat generated in the space by occupants, lights, and appliances
# Energy transfer through direct-with-space ventilation and infiltration of outdoor air
# Miscellaneous heats gains

Furthermore, heat extraction rate is the rate at which heat is actually being removed from the space by the cooling equipment.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HCB /&gt; Heat gains, heat extraction rate, and cooling loads values are often not equal due to [[thermal inertia]] effects. Heat is stored in the mass of the building and furnishings delaying the time at which it can become a heat gain and be extracted by the cooling equipment to maintain the desired indoor conditions.&lt;ref name=HCB /&gt; Another reason is that the inability of the cooling system to keep dry bulb temperature and humidity constant.

== Cooling loads in air systems ==

'''Cre-Lox recombination''' is a [[site-specific recombinase technology]], used to carry out [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]], [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]] and [[Chromosomal inversion|inversions]] at specific sites in the DNA of cells. It allows the DNA modification to be targeted to a specific cell type or be triggered by a specific external stimulus. It is implemented both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. The Cre-lox recombination system has been particularly useful to help neuroscientists to study the brain in which complex cell types and neural circuits come together to generate cognition and behaviors. NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research has created several hundreds of Cre driver mouse lines which are currently used by the worldwide neuroscience community.

The system consists of a single enzyme, [[Cre recombinase]], that [[Genetic recombination|recombines]] a pair of short target sequences called the ''Lox'' sequences. This system can be implemented without inserting any extra supporting proteins or sequences. The Cre enzyme and the original ''Lox'' site called the ''LoxP'' sequence are derived from [[bacteriophage]] [[P1 phage|P1]].

Placing Lox sequences appropriately allows genes to be activated, repressed, or exchanged for other genes. At a DNA level many types of manipulations can be carried out. The activity of the Cre enzyme can be controlled so that it is expressed in a particular cell type or triggered by an external stimulus like a chemical signal or a heat shock. These targeted DNA changes are useful in cell lineage tracing and when mutants are lethal if expressed globally.

The Cre-Lox system is very similar in action and in usage to the [[FLP-FRT recombination]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turan |first1=S. |last2=Galla |first2=M. |last3=Ernst |first3=E. |last4=Qiao |first4=J. |last5=Voelkel |first5=C. |last6=Schiedlmeier |first6=B. |last7=Zehe |first7=C. |last8=Bode |first8=J. | year = 2011 | title = Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE): traditional concepts and current challenges | url = | journal = J.

==History==
Cre-Lox recombination is a special type of [[Site-specific recombinase technology|site-specific recombination]] developed by Dr. [[Brian Sauer]] that operated in both mitotic and non-mitotic cells, and was initially used in activating gene expression in mammalian cell lines ([[DuPont]]).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, researchers in the laboratory of Dr. [[Jamey Marth]] demonstrated that Cre-Lox recombination could be used to delete loxP-flanked chromosomal DNA sequences at high efficiency in specific developing T-cells of transgenic animals, with the authors proposing that this approach could be used to define endogenous gene function in specific cell types, indelibly mark progenitors in cell fate determination studies, induce specific chromosomal rearrangements for biological and disease modeling, and determine the roles of early genetic lesions in disease (and phenotype) maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orban | first1 = P.C. | last2 = Chui | first2 = D. | last3 = Marth | first3 = J.D. | year = 1992 | title = Tissue– and site–specific recombination in transgenic mice | url = | journal = Proc.

Shortly thereafter, researchers in the laboratory of Prof. Klaus Rajewsky reported the production of pluripotent embryonic stem cells bearing a targeted loxP-flanked (floxed) DNA polymerase gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gu | first1 = H. | last2 = Zou | first2 = Y.R. | last3 = Rajewsky | first3 = K. | year = 1993 | title = Independent control of immunoglobulin switch recombination at individual switch regions evidenced through Cre–loxP–mediated gene targeting | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 1155–1564 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(93)90644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Combining these advances in collaboration, the laboratories of Drs. Marth and Rajewsky reported in 1994 that Cre-lox recombination could be used for conditional gene targeting in developing T-cells in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gu | first1 = H. | last2 = Marth | first2 = J.D. | last3 = Orban | first3 = P.C. | last4 = Mossman | first4 = H. | last5 = Rajewsky | first5 = K. | year = 1994 | title = Deletion of the DNA polymerase beta gene in T cells using tissue-specific gene targeting | url = | journal = Science | volume = 265 | issue = | pages = 103–106 | doi=10.1126/science.8016642}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observed ~50% of the DNA polymerase beta gene was deleted in T cells based on DNA blotting. It was unclear whether only one allele in each T-cell or 50% of T cells had 100% deletion in both alleles.  Researchers have since reported more efficient Cre-Lox conditional gene mutagenesis in the developing T cells by the Marth laboratory in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hennet | display-authors = etal   | year = 1995 | title = T-cell specific deletion of a polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase gene by site-directed recombination | doi =  10.1073/pnas.92.26.12070 | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 12070–74 | pmc = 40298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incomplete deletion by [[Cre recombinase]] is not uncommon in cells when two copies of floxed sequences need to be targeted due to efficiency problems, which is discussed in the Efficiency of Action section below. 

Independently, [[Joe Z. Tsien]] has pioneered the use of Cre-loxP system for cell type- and region-specific gene manipulation in the adult brain where hundreds of distinct neuron types may exist and nearly all neurons in the adult brain are known to be post-mitotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2016.00019 | volume=7 | title=Cre-Lox Neurogenetics: 20 Years of Versatile Applications in Brain Research and Counting… | journal=Frontiers in Genetics| year=2016 | last1=Tsien | first1=Joe Z. | pmid=26925095 | pmc=4759636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsien and his colleagues demonstrated Cre-mediated recombination can occur in the post-mitotic pyramidal neurons in the adult mouse forebrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsien | display-authors = etal   | year = 1996 | title = Subregion- and cell type-restricted gene knockout in mouse brain | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 87 | issue = 7| pages = 1317–26 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81826-7| pmid = 8980237   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments have led to a widespread use of conditional mutagenesis in biomedical research, spanning many disciplines in which it becomes a powerful platform for determining gene function in specific cell types and at specific developmental times.  In particular, the clear demonstration of its usefulness in precisely defining the complex relationship between specific cells/circuits and behaviors for brain research,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsien | first1 = JZ. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1996b | title = The essential role of hippocampal CA1 NMDA receptor–dependent synaptic plasticity in spatial memory | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 87 | issue = 7| pages = 1327–38 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81827-9| pmid = 8980238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has promoted the NIH to initiate the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research Cre-driver mouse projects in early 2000.&lt;ref&gt;NIH blueprint for neuroscience: Cre driver network. http://www.neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/factSheet/CreDriver.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GENSAT brain project, http://www.gensat.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research Cre projects have created several hundreds of Cre driver mouse lines which are currently used by the worldwide neuroscience community.

==Overview==
Cre-Lox recombination involves the targeting of a specific sequence of [[DNA]] and splicing it with the help of an enzyme called [[Cre recombinase]]. Cre-Lox recombination is commonly used to circumvent embryonic lethality caused by systemic inactivation of many genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shen | first1 = J | display-authors = etal   | year = 1997 | title = Skeletal and CNS defects in Presenilin-1-deficient mice | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 4| pages = 629–39 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80244-5| pmid = 9160754 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Y | display-authors = etal   | year = 1994 | title = Whisker-related neuronal patterns fail to develop in the trigeminal brainstem nuclei of NMDAR1 knockout mice | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 76 | issue = 3| pages = 427–37 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90108-2| pmid = 8313466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Cre–Lox recombination provides the best experimental control that presently exists in transgenic animal modeling to link genotypes (alterations in genomic DNA) to phenotypes (the biological outcomes).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feng | first1 = R | display-authors = etal   | year = 2001 | title = Deficient neurogenesis in forebrain-specific presenilin-1 knockout mice is associated with reduced clearance of hippocampal memory traces | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 32 | issue = 5| pages = 911–26 | doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00523-2| pmid = 11738035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cre-lox system is used as a genetic tool to control site specific [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] events in genomic DNA. This system has allowed researchers to manipulate a variety of genetically modified organisms to control gene expression, delete undesired DNA sequences and modify chromosome architecture.

The [[Cre recombinase|Cre]] protein is a site-specific DNA recombinase, that can catalyse the recombination of DNA between specific sites in a DNA molecule. These sites, known as ''loxP'' sequences, contain specific binding sites for Cre that surround a directional core sequence where recombination can occur.

[[Image:Cre Lox71-66 Recombination Method.png|800px|thumb|A diagram describing how Lox71 and Lox66 sites can be used to combine two plasmids into one contiguous plasmid.]]

When cells that have ''loxP'' sites in their genome express Cre, a recombination event can occur between the ''loxP'' sites. Cre recombinase proteins bind to the first and last 13 bp regions of a lox site forming a [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]. This dimer then binds to a dimer on another lox site to form a [[tetramer]]. Lox sites are directional and the two sites joined by the tetramer are parallel in orientation.  The double stranded DNA is cut at both ''loxP'' sites by the Cre protein. The strands are then rejoined with [[DNA ligase]] in a quick and efficient process. The result of recombination depends on the orientation of the ''loxP'' sites. For two lox sites on the same chromosome arm, inverted ''loxP'' sites will cause an inversion of the intervening DNA, while a direct repeat of ''loxP'' sites will cause a deletion event. If ''loxP'' sites are on different chromosomes it is possible for [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] events to be catalysed by Cre induced recombination. Two [[plasmid]]s can be joined using the variant lox sites 71 and 66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hastie | first1 =  | last2 = Pruitt | first2 =  | year = 2007 | title = Yeast two-hybrid interaction partner screening through in vivo Cre-mediated Binary Interaction Tag generation | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/AAV84941.1 | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 35 | issue = 21| page = e141 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkm894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cre recombinase===

The Cre protein (encoded by the locus originally named as "'''C'''auses '''re'''combination", with "'''C'''yclization '''re'''combinase" being found in some references)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/AAV84941.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 =  | last2 = Hamilton | first2 =  | year = 1981 | title =  Bacteriophage P1 site-specific recombination| doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(81)90375-2 | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 467–486 [468] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  consists of 4 subunits and two domains: The larger carboxyl ([[C-terminal end|C-terminal]]) domain, and smaller amino ([[N-terminal end|N-terminal]]) domain. The total protein has 343 [[amino acid]]s. The C domain is similar in structure to the domain in the [[Integrase]] family of enzymes isolated from [[lambda phage]]. This is also the [[catalytic site]] of the enzyme.

===''loxP'' site===

''loxP'' (locus of X-over P1) is a site on the bacteriophage P1 consisting of 34 [[Base pairs|bp]]. The site includes an asymmetric 8 bp sequence, variable except for the middle two bases, in between two sets of symmetric, 13 bp sequences. The exact sequence is given below; 'N' indicates bases which may vary, and lowercase letters indicate bases that have been mutated from the wild-type. The 13 bp sequences are palindromic but the 8 bp spacer is not, thus giving the loxP sequence a certain direction. Usually loxP sites come in pairs for genetic manipulation. If the two loxP sites are in the same orientation, the floxed sequence (sequence flanked by two loxP sites) is excised; however if the two loxP sites are in the opposite orientation, the floxed sequence is inverted. If there exists a floxed donor sequence, the donor sequence can be swapped with the original sequence. This technique is called [[recombinase-mediated cassette exchange]] and is a very convenient and time-saving way for genetic manipulation. The caveat, however, is that the recombination reaction can happen backwards, rendering cassette exchange inefficient. In addition, sequence excision can happen ''in trans'' instead of a ''in cis'' cassette exchange event. The loxP mutants are created to avoid these problems&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite journal

==Holliday junctions and homologous recombination==
During genetic recombination, a [[Holliday junction]] is formed between the two strands of DNA and a double-stranded break in a DNA molecule leaves a 3’OH end exposed. This reaction is aided with the endonuclease activity of an enzyme. 5’ Phosphate ends are usually the substrates for this reaction, thus extended 3’ regions remain. This 3’ OH group is highly unstable, and the strand on which it is present must find its complement. Since homologous recombination occurs after DNA replication, two strands of DNA are available, and thus, the 3’ OH group must pair with its complement, and it does so, with an intact strand on the other duplex. Now, one point of crossover has occurred, which is what is called a Holliday Intermediate.

The 3’OH end is elongated (that is, bases are added) with the help of DNA Polymerase. The pairing of opposite strands is what constitutes the crossing-over or Recombination event, which is common to all living organisms, since the genetic material on one strand of one duplex has paired with one strand of another duplex, and has been elongated by DNA polymerase. Further cleavage of Holliday Intermediates results in formation of Hybrid DNA.

This further cleavage or ‘resolvation’ is done by a special group of enzymes called Resolvases. RuvC is just one of these Resolvases that have been isolated in bacteria and yeast.

For many years, it was thought that when the Holliday junction intermediate was formed, the branch point of the junction (where the strands cross over) would be located at the first cleavage site. Migration of the branch point to the second cleavage site would then somehow trigger the second half of the pathway. This model provided convenient explanation for the strict requirement for homology between recombining sites, since branch migration would stall at a mismatch and would not allow the second strand exchange to occur. In more recent years, however, this view has been challenged, and most of the current models for Int, Xer, and Flp recombination involve only limited branch migration 1–3 base pairs) of the Holliday intermediate, coupled to an isomerisation event that is responsible for switching the strand cleavage specificity.

==Site-specific recombination==
{{main article|Site-specific recombination}}
Site-specific recombination (SSR) involves specific sites for the catalyzing action of special enzymes called recombinases. Cre, or cyclic recombinase, is one such enzyme. Site-specific recombination is, thus, the enzyme-mediated cleavage and ligation of two defined deoxynucleotide sequences.

A number of conserved site-specific recombination systems have been described in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In general, these systems use one or more proteins and act on unique asymmetric DNA sequences. The products of the recombination event depend on the relative orientation of these asymmetric sequences. Many other proteins apart from the recombinase are involved in regulating the reaction. During site-specific DNA recombination, which brings about genetic rearrangement in processes such as viral integration and excision and chromosomal segregation, these recombinase enzymes recognize specific DNA sequences and catalyse the reciprocal exchange of DNA strands between these sites.

'''Mechanism of action'''
[[Image:CreLoxP experiment.png|500px|thumb|A model experiment in genetics using the Cre-lox system: the premature stop sequence present in floxed mice is removed only from cells that express Cre recombinase when the mice are bred together]]

Initiation of site-specific recombination begins with the binding of recombination proteins to their respective DNA targets. A separate recombinase recognizes and binds to each of two recombination sites on two different DNA molecules or within the same DNA strand. At the given specific site on the DNA, the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine in the recombinase attacks a phosphate group in the DNA backbone using a direct [[transesterification]] mechanism. This reaction links the recombinase protein to the DNA via a phospho-tyrosine linkage. This conserves the energy of the phosphodiester bond, allowing the reaction to be reversed without the involvement of a high-energy cofactor.

Cleavage on the other strand also causes a phospho-tyrosine bond between DNA and the enzyme. At both of the DNA duplexes, the bonding of the phosphate group to tyrosine residues leave a 3’ OH group free in the DNA backbone. In fact, the enzyme-DNA complex is an intermediate stage, which is followed by the ligation of the 3’ OH group of one DNA strand to the 5’ phosphate group of the other DNA strand, which is covalently bonded to the tyrosine residue; that is, the covalent linkage between 5’ end and tyrosine residue is broken. This reaction synthesizes the [[Holliday junction]] discussed earlier.

In this fashion, opposite DNA strands are joined together. Subsequent cleavage and rejoining cause DNA strands to exchange their segments. Protein-protein interactions drive and direct strand exchange. Energy is not compromised, since the protein-DNA linkage makes up for the loss of the phosphodiester bond, which occurred during cleavage.

Site-specific recombination is also an important process that viruses, such as bacteriophages, adopt to integrate their genetic material into the infected host. The virus, called a ''prophage'' in such a state, accomplishes this via integration and excision. The points where the integration and excision reactions occur are called the attachment (att) sites.  An attP site on the phage exchanges segments with an attB site on the bacterial DNA.  Thus, these are site-specific, occurring only at the respective att sites. The [[integrase]] class of enzymes catalyse this particular reaction.

'''Efficiency of action'''

Two factors have been shown to affect the efficiency of Cre's excision on the lox pair.  First, the nucleotide sequence identity in the spacer region of lox site. Engineered lox variants which differ on the spacer region tend to have varied but generally lower recombination efficiency compared to wildtype loxP, presumably through affecting the formation and resolution of recombination intermediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = G | last2 = Saito | first2 = I | year = 1998 | title = Role of nucleotide sequences of loxP spacer region in Cre-mediated recombination | url = | journal = Gene | volume = 216 | issue = 1| pages = 55–65 | pmid = 9714735 | doi=10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00325-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor is the length of DNA between the lox pair. Increasing the length of DNA leads to decreased efficiency of Cre/lox recombination possibly through regulating the dynamics of the reaction.&lt;ref name="stars"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = S-z | first1 = Wang | last2 = B-h | first2 = Liu | last3 = Tao | first3 = HW | last4 = Xia | first4 = K | last5 = Zhang | first5 = LI | year = 2009 | title = A Genetic Strategy for Stochastic Gene Activation with Regulated Sparseness (STARS) | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 1| page = e4200 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004200 | pmid=19145242 | pmc=2615212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zheng | first1 = B | last2 = Sage | first2 = M | last3 = Sheppeard | first3 = EA | last4 = Jurecic | first4 = V | last5 = Bradley | first5 = A | year = 2000 | title = Engineering Mouse Chromosomes with Cre-loxP: Range,Efficiency, and Somatic Applications | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 648–655 | doi=10.1128/mcb.20.2.648-655.2000| pmid = 10611243 | pmc=85158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiuGenesis"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1= J | last2 = Willet| first2 = SG| last3=Bankaitis| first3=ED| year =2013 | title = Non-parallel recombination limits Cre-LoxP-based reporters as precise indicators of conditional genetic manipulation | journal = Genesis | volume = 51 | issue = 6  | page = 436-42| doi=10.1002/dvg.22384 |pmid = 23441020 | pmc=3696028}}&lt;/ref&gt;Genetic location of the floxed sequence affects recombination efficiency as well probably by influencing the availability of DNA by [[Cre recombinase]]&lt;ref name="LiuGenesis"/&gt;.The choice of Cre driver is also important as low expression of [[Cre recombinase]] tends to result in non-parallel recombination. Non-parallel recombination is especially problematic in a [[fate mapping]] scenario where one recombination event is designed to manipulate the gene under study and the other recombination event is necessary for activating a reporter gene (usually encoding a fluorescent protein) for [[cell lineage]] tracing&lt;ref name="LiuGenesis"/&gt;. Failure to activate both recombination events simultaneously confounds the interpretation of cell [[fate mapping]] results.

'''Temporal control'''

Another variant that aids in the control of the expression of the gene in terms of its timing is the tamoxifen-inducible system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walrath | first1 = CJ | last2 = Hawes | first2 = JJ | last3 = Dyke | first3 = VT | last4 = Reilly | first4 = MK | year = 2010 | title = Chapter 4 - Genetically engineered mouse models in cancer research | url = | journal = Advances in Cancer Research | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 113–164 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-230X(10)06004-5 | pmc = 3533445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;This is done through the addition of a ligand binding domain(estrogen receptor) on the Cre recombinase which is specifically activated by tamoxifen. Once both sequences of the mutated Cre and the loxP genes are located in one mouse, the absence of tamoxifen will result in the shuttling of the mutated recombinase into the cytoplasm. The protein will stay in this location in its inactivate state until tamoxifen is given. Once tamoxifen is introduced, the mutated recombinase is shuttled back into the nucleus and is able to cleave the lox sites, resulting in a loss of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kristianto | first1 = J | last2 = Johnson | first2 = MG | last3 = Zastrow | first3 = RK | last4 = Radcliff | first4 = AB | last5 = Blank | first5 = RD | year = 2017 | title = Spontaneous recombinase activity of Cre-ERT2 in vivo | url = | journal = Transgenic Research | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 411–417 | doi = 10.1007/s11248-017-0018-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural function of the Cre-lox system==
The [[P1 phage]] is a [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] phage that causes either a [[Lysogenic cycle|lysogenic]] or [[lytic cycle]] when it infects a bacterium. In its lytic state, once its viral genome is injected into the host cell, viral proteins are produced, virions are assembled, and the host cell is lysed to release the phages, continuing the cycle. In the lysogenic cycle the phage genome replicates with the rest of the bacterial genome and is transmitted to daughter cells at each subsequent cell division. It can transition to the lytic cycle by a later event such as UV radiation or starvation.

Phages like the [[lambda phage]] use their site specific recombinases to integrate their DNA into the host genome during lysogeny. P1 phage DNA on the other hand, exists as a [[plasmid]] in the host. The Cre-lox system serves several functions in the phage: it circularizes the phage DNA into a plasmid, separates interlinked plasmid rings so they are passed to both daughter bacteria equally and may help maintain copy numbers through an alternative means of replication.&lt;ref name=Lobocka2004&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1128/JB.186.21.7032-7068.2004| issn = 0021-9193| volume = 186| issue = 21| pages = 7032–7068| last = Łobocka| first = Małgorzata B.|author2=Debra J. Rose |author3=Guy Plunkett |author4=Marek Rusin |author5=Arkadiusz Samojedny |author6=Hansjörg Lehnherr |author7=Michael B. Yarmolinsky |author8=Frederick R. Blattner | title = Genome of Bacteriophage P1| journal = Journal of Bacteriology| date = November 2004| pmc=523184|url=http://jb.asm.org/content/186/21/7032| pmid=15489417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The P1 phage DNA when released into the host from the virion is in the form of a linear double stranded DNA molecule. The Cre enzyme targets loxP sites at the ends of this molecule and cyclises the genome. This can also take place in the absence of the Cre lox system&lt;ref name=Hoess1983&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1146/annurev.ge.17.120183.001011| volume = 17| issue = 1| pages = 123–154| last = Sternberg| first = N|author2=R Hoess| title = The Molecular Genetics of Bacteriophage P1| journal = Annual Review of Genetics| accessdate = 2012-03-26| year = 1983| url =  http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ge.17.120183.001011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the help of other bacterial and viral proteins. The P1 plasmid is relatively large (~90Kbp) and hence exists in a low copy number - usually one per cell. If the two daughter plasmids get interlinked one of the daughter cells of the host will lose the plasmid. The Cre-lox recombination system prevents these situations by unlinking the rings of DNA by carrying out two recombination events (linked rings -&gt; single fused ring -&gt; two unlinked rings). It is also proposed that rolling circle replication followed by recombination will allow the plasmid to increase its copy number when certain regulators (repA) are limiting.&lt;ref name=Lobocka2004/&gt;

==Implementation of multiple loxP site pairs==
Multiple variants of loxP,&lt;ref&gt;Editor's Summary (1 November 2007) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7166/edsumm/e071101-01.html Over the brainbow]. ''Nature.'' Accessed 15 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular lox2272 and loxN, have been used by researchers with the combination of different Cre actions (transient or constitutive) to create a "[[Brainbow]]" system that allows multi-colouring of mice's brain with four fluorescent proteins.

Another report using two lox variants pair but through regulating the length of DNA in one pair results in stochastic gene activation with regulated level of sparseness.&lt;ref name="stars"/&gt;

A '''drabble''' is a short work of fiction of one hundred words in length.&lt;ref name="WRR"&gt;[http://www.therecord.com/print/article/602546 "Winners named in WLU drabble competition"], ''[[Waterloo Region Record]]'', October 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Flash fiction: 'Intense, urgent and a little explosive'", ''[[The Irish Times]]'', October 26, 2011, copy available [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-29941178.html here] from [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Womer, [https://archive.is/20130210041029/http://www.yumasun.com/news/story-75397-place-staff.html "AWC professor impressed by short story entries"], ''[[Yuma Sun]]'', December 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Flash Fiction |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/flash_fiction |encyclopedia=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |date=21 December 2011|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the drabble is brevity, testing the author's ability to express interesting and meaningful ideas in a confined space.

==History==
The concept is said to have originated in [[United Kingdom|UK]] science fiction fandom in the 1980s; the 100-word format was established by the [[Birmingham University]] SF Society, taking a term from [[Monty Python]]'s 1971 ''[[Monty Python's Big Red Book|Big Red Book]]''.&lt;ref name="WRR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; In the book, "Drabble" was described as a word game where the first participant to write a [[novel]] was the winner. In order to make the game possible in the real world, it was agreed that 100 words would suffice. 
 
In drabble contests, participants are given a [[Theme (literary)|theme]] and a certain amount of time to write.  (For example, [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] conducted a "100 Words Centennial Drabble Contest" in commemoration of its 100th anniversary in 2011, in which contestants were asked to write about "inspiration, leadership or purpose".&lt;ref name="WRR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liz Smith, [http://thecord.ca/articles/47813 "Laurier launches literary competition to commemorate Centennial year"]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Cord Weekly]]'', September 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) Drabble contests, and drabbles in general, are popular in [[science fiction fandom]] and in [[fan fiction]].  Beccon Publications published three volumes, ''The Drabble Project'' (1988) and ''Drabble II: Double Century'' (1990), both edited by Rob Meades and David Wake, and ''Drabble Who'' (1993), edited by [[David J. Howe]] and David Wake.

==Examples==
Published science fiction writers who have written drabbles include [[Brian Aldiss]] and [[Gene Wolfe]] (both of whom contributed to ''The Drabble Project''),&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; [[Lois McMaster Bujold]] (whose novel ''[[Cryoburn]]'' finishes with a sequence of five drabbles, each told from the point of view of a different character),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2011/09/review_cryoburn_a_miles_vorkosigan_novel_by_lois_mcmaster_bujold/ |title=REVIEW: ‘Cryoburn (A Miles Vorkosigan Novel)’ by Lois McMaster Bujold |author=T K Kenyon |date=22 September  2011 |publisher=SF Signal |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Science fiction books |author=Fred Cleaver |url=http://www.denverpost.com/rss/ci_16651750 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |date=21 November 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jake Bible]] (whose novel ''Dead Mech'' was written entirely in drabble format).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jakebible.com/whats-a-drabble/|title=What’s A Drabble?|date=2010-01-10|work=Jake Bible Fiction|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''100 Word Story'' is an online literary journal that was co-founded in 2011 by [[Grant Faulkner]] and Lynn Mundell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thereviewreview.net/interviews/flash-fiction|title=Flash! Fiction!  - The Review Review|website=www.thereviewreview.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes stories that are exactly 100 words long.

The web has also enabled a rapid spread of the genre, with publishers such as [[The Third Word Press]] using the web to collect drabble stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.third-word.com/|title=The Third Word Press |access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==55 Fiction==
One example of drabble is 55 Fiction, which is a form of [[microfiction]] that refers to the works of fiction that are either limited to a maximum of 55 words or have a requirement of exactly 55 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ron Wiggins|title=PAPER CHALLENGES WRITERS TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&amp;p_theme=pbpb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF3F22AEE950D98&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Palm Beach Post|date=October 11, 2001}} {{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of ''55 Fiction'' can be traced to a short story writing contest organized by ''New Times'', an independent alternative weekly in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], in 1987.&lt;ref name=fff&gt;{{cite news|title=Mini- és maxiregények|url=http://www.nyest.hu/hirek/mini-es-maxiregenyek|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Nyelv és Tudomány|date=June 27, 2011|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was proposed by ''New Times'' founder and publisher [[Steve Moss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NEW TIMES PUBLISHER DIED OF EPILEPSY|newspaper=The Tribune|date=May 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria===
A literary work will be considered ''55 Fiction''{{cn|date=November 2015}} if it has:
# 55 words or fewer, however some publishers actually require exactly 55 words – no more and no less;
# A setting;
# One or more characters;
# Some conflict; and
# A resolution. (''Not limited to the moral of the story'')
The title of the story is not part of the overall word count, but cannot exceed seven words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1075">A '''duodrama''' is a theatrical [[melodrama]] for two [[actor]]s or singers, in which the spoken voice is used with a musical accompaniment for heightened dramatic effect. It was popular at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.

Closely related to [[opera]], the most famous example were the 1775 works ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos (Benda)|Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' and ''[[Medea (Benda)|Medea]]'' by [[Georg Benda]]. [[Mozart]] admired Benda's work and used similar techniques in ''[[Zaide]]'' (1780) and ''[[Thamos, König in Ägypten]]'' (c. 1773-1780). He considered writing a duodrama himself, to be called ''Semiramis''. [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'' (1805-1814) and [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) also contain duodramas. The style is also used in [[lieder]] and song. &lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', 782 pages,  {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Linces1.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Iberian lynx]] (''Lynx pardinus''), an endangered species.]]
An '''endangered species''' is a [[species]] which has been categorized  as very likely to become [[Extinction|extinct]]. E&lt;!--Capital "E" as this is a specific IUCN category--&gt;ndangered (EN), as categorized by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List]], is the second most severe [[conservation status]] for wild populations in the IUCN's schema after [[Critically endangered|{{allow wrap|Critically Endangered}}]]&amp;nbsp;(CR).

In 2012, the IUCN Red List featured 3079 [[animal]] and 2655 [[plant]] species as endangered&amp;nbsp;(EN) worldwide.&lt;ref name="iucn 2012.2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/summarystatistics/2012_2_RL_Stats_Table_2.pdf |title=IUCN Red List version 2012.2: Table 2: Changes in numbers of species in the threatened categories (CR, EN, VU) from 1996 to 2012 (IUCN Red List version 2012.2) for the major taxonomic groups on the Red List |accessdate=2012-12-31 |publisher=[[IUCN]] |year=2012 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures for 1998 were, respectively, 1102 and 1197.

Many nations have [[Environmental law|law]]s that protect [[conservation-reliant species]]: for example, forbidding [[hunting]], restricting [[land development]] or creating preserves. Population numbers, trends and species' conservation status can be found at the [[lists of organisms by population]].

The [[conservation status]] of a [[species]] indicates the likelihood that it will become [[extinct]].  Many factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura/Lnsstatus.htm |title=NatureServe Conservation Status |date=April 2007 |publisher=NatureServe |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |title=Red List Overview |date=February 2011 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527175928/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |archivedate=May 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though labelled a list, the [[IUCN Red List]] is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes "Data Deficient"&amp;nbsp;(DD) species&amp;nbsp;– species for which more data and assessment is required before their status may be determined&amp;nbsp;– as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species assessment process. Those species of "[[Near-threatened species|Near Threatened]]"&amp;nbsp;(NT) and "[[Least concern|Least Concern]]"&amp;nbsp;(LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms "endangered species" and "threatened species" with particular meanings: "Endangered"&amp;nbsp;(EN) species lie between "[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]"&amp;nbsp;(VU) and "[[Critically Endangered species|Critically Endangered]]"&amp;nbsp;(CR) species, while "Threatened" species are those species determined to be Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered.

== Endangered species in the United States ==
There is data from the United States that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species. Using species data from the Database on the Economics and Management of Endangered Species (DEMES) database and the period that the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) has been in existence, 1970 to 1997, a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Shogren|editor1-first=Jason F.|editor2-last=Tschirhart|editor2-first=John|title=Protecting Endangered Species in the United States: Biological Needs, Political Realities, Economic Choices|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521662109|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endangered Species Act===
[[File:Status ESA LE.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|"Endangered" in relation to "threatened" under the ESA.]]
Under the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] in the [[United States]], species may be listed as "endangered" or "threatened". The [[Salt Creek tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela nevadica lincolniana'') is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species, and adding a particular species to the list can be a long, controversial process (Wilcove &amp; Master, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;414).

Some endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include: criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and criteria for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered; whether restrictions on land development constitute a "taking" of land by the [[government]]; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their lands; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from [[hunting|hunters]] and various industries like the [[petroleum industry]], [[construction]] industry, and [[logging]], has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the [[Obama administration]], this policy has been reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/news/newsreleases/showNews.cfm?newsId=EE78C309-C119-D9DC-042421265ACD62A4|title=FWS.gov|author=|date=|website=fws.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Courchamp |first=Franck |author2=Elena Angulo |author3=Philippe Rivalan |author4=Richard J. Hall |author5=Laetitia Signoret |author6=Leigh Bull |author7=Yves Meinard |title=Rarity Value and Species Extinction: The Anthropogenic Allee Effect |publisher=PLoS Biology |url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040415 |accessdate=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is potentially reducible, such as in China where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dharmananda |first=Subhuti |title=Endangered Species issues affecting turtles and tortoises used in Chinese medicine |publisher=Institute for Traditional Medicine, Portland, Oregon |url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040415 |accessdate=2006-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the "shoot, shovel, and shut-up" method of clearing endangered species from an area of land. Some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it. They have allegedly opted to silently kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat, thus removing the problem from their land, but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/34933.html |title=Shoot, Shovel and Shut Up |work=Reasononline |publisher=Reason Magazine |date=2003-12-31 |accessdate=2006-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]]&amp;nbsp;– which coined the term "endangered species"&amp;nbsp;– has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool. Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/DelistingReport.do |title=USFWS Threatened and Endangered Species System (TESS) |publisher=U. S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service |accessdate=2007-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728035106/http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/DelistingReport.do |archivedate=2007-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 93% of listed species in the northeastern United States have a recovering or stable population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esasuccess.org/reports/|title=ESA Successes|author=|date=|website=www.esasuccess.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law.&lt;!--Too vague: &lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 2006 (webpage).&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws as the Endangered Species Act. According to [[NatureServe conservation status|NatureServe's global conservation status]], approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.&lt;ref name="WM2008"&gt;Wilcove &amp; Master 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpages|415|16}} Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.&lt;ref name="WM2008"/&gt;{{refpage|416}} This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.

[[File:2010-bald-eagle-kodiak.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Bald eagle]]
[[File:American bison k5680-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|American bison]]
Ever since mankind began hunting to preserve itself, over-hunting and fishing has been a large and dangerous problem. Of all the species who became extinct due to interference from mankind, the [[dodo]], [[passenger pigeon]], [[great auk]], [[Tasmanian tiger]] and [[Steller's sea cow]] are some of the more well known examples; with the [[bald eagle]], [[grizzly bear]], [[American bison]], [[Eastern timber wolf]] and [[sea turtle]] having been hunted to near-extinction.  Many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport. However, due to major efforts to prevent extinction, the bald eagle, or ''[[Bald eagle|Haliaeetus leucocephalus]]'' is now under the category of Least Concern on the red list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Bald Eagle)|url = http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/22695144/0|website = www.iucnredlist.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced. Large whales like the blue whale, bowhead whale, finback whale, gray whale, sperm whale and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt reduction in whaling and increase population sizes, including prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).  But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as [[Japan]] continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of "scientific purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=Bill |title=Endangered species |journal=Gale |year=2008 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list and could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future.

== Invasive species ==
{{main|Introduced species}}

The introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered. Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chiras |first=Daniel D. |title=Invader Species |url=http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3753825|journal=Grolier |year=2011 |series=Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[File:Dhole.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[dhole]], Asia's most endangered [[top predator]], is on the edge of extinction.]]

===Captive breeding===
{{main|Captive breeding}}
Captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos and other conservation facilities. Captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilize the population of the species that it will not disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/EndangeredSpecies/CapBreedPops/default.cfm |title=Captive Breeding Populations - National Zoo |publisher=Nationalzoo.si.edu |accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique has worked for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers, an example being the [[Père David's deer]]. However, captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. [[hilsa]]). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced [[gene pool]] and reduce [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].

In 1981, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) created a [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP) in order to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding.  With over 450 SSP Plans, there are a number of endangered species that are covered by the AZA with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population, created by Taxon Advisory Groups.  These programs are commonly created as a last resort effort. SSP Programs regularly participate in species recovery, veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks, and a number of other wildlife conservation efforts.  The AZA's Species Survival Plan also has breeding and transfer programs, both within and outside of AZA - certified zoos and aquariums.  Some animals that are part of SSP programs are [[giant pandas]], lowland gorillas, and [[California condors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|archive-url =https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090803071836/http://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|dead-url =yes|archive-date =2009-08-03|title =Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Programs|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private farming===
[[File:Ostafrikanisches Spitzmaulnashorn.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Black rhino]]
[[File:Thmac u0.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Southern bluefin tuna]]
Whereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations, legal, for-profit, private farming does the opposite. It has substantially increased the populations of the southern [[black rhinoceros]] and southern [[white rhinoceros]]. Dr Richard Emslie, a scientific officer at the IUCN, said of such programs, "Effective law enforcement has become much easier now that the animals are largely privately owned... We have been able to bring local communities into the conservation programmes. There are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather than simply poaching: from Eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit. So many owners are keeping them secure. The private sector has been key to helping our work."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/hes-black-and-hes-back-private-enterprise-saves-southern-africas-rhino-from-extinction-848482.html He's black, and he's back!

In 2009, researchers in Australia managed to coax [[southern bluefin tuna]] to breed in landlocked tanks, raising the possibility that [[fish farming]] may be able to save the species from [[overfishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1945379_1944416_1944425,00.html The Top 10 Everything of 2009: Top 10 Scientific Discoveries: 5.

'''Evolution of metal ions in biological systems''' refers to the incorporation of metallic ions into living organisms and how it has changed over time. Metal ions have been associated with biological systems for billions of years, but only in the last century have scientists began to truly appreciate the scale of their influence. Major ([[iron]], [[manganese]], [[magnesium]] and [[zinc]]) and minor ([[copper]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[molybdenum]], [[tungsten]]) metal ions have become aligned with living organisms through the interplay of [[Weathering#Biogeochemical weathering|biogeochemical weathering]] and [[metabolic pathway]]s involving the products of that weathering. The associated complexes have evolved over time.

Natural development of chemicals and elements challenged organisms to adapt or die. Current organisms require [[redox]] reactions to induce [[metabolism]] and other life processes. [[Metal]]s have a tendency to lose [[electron]]s and are important for redox reactions. &lt;blockquote&gt;“Metals have become so central to cellular function that the collection of metal-binding proteins (referred to as the [[metallome]]s) accounts for over 30% of all proteins in the cell. Metals are known to be involved in over 40% of enzymatic reactions, and metal-binding proteins carry out at least one step in almost all [[biological pathway]]s”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/10.5822/978-1-61091-221-1|title=Evolution in a Toxic World - Springer|last=Monosson|first=Emily|language=en|doi=10.5822/978-1-61091-221-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Metals are also toxic so a balance must be acquired to regulate where the metals are in an organism as well as in what quantities. Many organisms have flexible systems in which they can exchange one metal for another if one is scarce. Metals in this discussion are naturally occurring elements that have a tendency to undergo [[oxidation]]. Vanadium, molybdenum, cobalt, copper, chromium, iron, manganese, nickel, and zinc are deemed essential because without them biological function is impaired.

==Origins==

[[File:Oxygenation-atm-2.svg|thumb|The Great Oxygenation Event. The upper red and lower green lines represent the range of the estimates.|300x300px]]

The Earth began as an iron aquatic world with low oxygen. The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] occurred approximately 2.4 [[Gya|Ga]] (billion years ago) as cyanobacteria and photosynthetic life induced the presence of [[dioxygen]] in the planet’s atmosphere. Iron became insoluble (as did other metals) and scarce while other metals became soluble. Sulfur was a very important element during this time. Once oxygen was released into the environment, [[Sulfate minerals|sulfates]] made metals more soluble and released those metals into the environment; especially into the water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Incorporation of metals perhaps combatted oxidative stress.

The central chemistry of all these cells has to be [[Organic redox reaction|reductive]] in order that the synthesis of the required chemicals, especially [[biopolymers]], is possible. The different [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]], [[Autocatalysis|autocatalysed]], reductive, metabolic pathways seen in the earliest known cells developed in separate energised vesicles, [[protocell]]s, where they were produced cooperatively with certain bases of the nucleic acids.&lt;ref name="Russel2003"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypotheses proposed for how elements became essential is their relative quantity in the environment as life formed. This has produced research on the origin of life; for instance, [[Leslie Orgel|Orgel]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] hypothesized that life was extraterrestrial due to the alleged low abundance of molybdenum on early Earth (it is now suspected that there were larger quantities than previously thought{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}). Another example is life forming around [[Hydrothermal vent|thermal vents]] based on the availability of zinc and sulfur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In conjunction with this theory is that life evolved as [[Chemotroph|chemoautotrophs]]. Therefore, life occurred around metals and not in response to their presence. Some evidence for this theory is that inorganic matter has self-contained attributes that life adopted as shown by life's compartmentalization.&lt;ref name="Russel2003" /&gt;

[[Transition metal]] ions, due to their multiple oxidation states, were the only elements capable of controlling the oxidation states of such molecules, and thus were selected for.&lt;ref name=Kleczkowski&gt;

===Prebiotic (anaerobic) conditions===

Around 4 [[Gya|Ga]] , the acidic seawater contained high amounts of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] and thus created a reducing environment with a [[Reduction potential|potential]] of around -0.2 V.&lt;ref name=Williams2006/&gt; So any element that had a large negative value with respect to the [[reduction potential]] of the environment was available in its free ionic form and can subsequently be incorporated into cells, i.e. [[Magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] has a [[reduction potential]] of -2.372 V, and was available in its ionic form at that time.

===Aerobic conditions===

Around 2 [[Gya|Ga]], an increase in atmospheric [[oxygen]] levels took place, causing an oxidation of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] in the surroundings, and an increase in the pH of the sea water. The resulting environment had become more oxidizing and thus allowed the later incorporation of the heavier metals such as [[copper]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name=Williams2012&gt;

  |doi=10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2012.01.004
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irving-Williams series==

Another factor affecting the availability of metal ions was their solubilities with [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]]. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] was abundant in the early sea giving rise to [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] in the prebiotic acidic conditions and HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in the neutral ([[pH]] = 7.0) conditions. In the series of metal sulfides, insolubility increases at neutral pH following the [[Irving-Williams series]]:

Mn(II) &lt; Fe(II) &lt; Co(II) ≤ Ni(II) &lt; Cu(II) &gt; Zn(II)

So in high amounts of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]], which was the [[Prebiotic world|prebiotic]] condition, only [[Iron|Fe]] was most prominently available in its ionic form due to its low insolubility with [[sulfides]]. The increasing oxidation of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] into [[Sulfate|SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}}]] leads to the later release of Co&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, and Zn&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; since all of their [[sulfates]] are soluble.

In the series of metal sulfides, insolubility increases at neutral pH following the [[Irving-Williams series]]:

Mn(II) &lt; Fe(II) &lt; Co(II) ≤ Ni(II) &lt; Cu(II) &gt; Zn(II)

So in high amounts of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]], which was the [[Prebiotic world|prebiotic]] condition, only [[Iron|Fe]] was most prominently available in its ionic form due to its low insolubility with [[sulfides]]. The increasing oxidation of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] into [[Sulfate|SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}}]] leads to the later release of Co&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, and Zn&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; since all of their [[sulfates]] are soluble.

==Metal ions==

===Magnesium===
[[Magnesium]] is the eighth most abundant element on earth. It is the fourth most abundant element in vertebrates and the most abundant divalent cation within cells. The most available form of magnesium (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) for living organisms can be found in the hydrosphere. The concentration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in seawater is around 55 mM. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is readily available to cells during early evolution due to its high solubility in water. Other transition metals like calcium precipitate from aqueous solutions at much lower concentrations than the corresponding Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; salts.&lt;ref name=Maguire2002&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since magnesium was readily available in early evolution, it can be found in every cell type living organism. Magnesium in anaerobic prokaryotes can be found in [[Adenosine triphosphate|MgATP]]. Magnesium also has many functions in prokaryotes such as [[glycolysis]], all kinases, NTP reaction, signalling, DNA/RNA structures and light capture. In aerobic eukaryotes, magnesium can be found in [[cytoplasm]] and [[chloroplasts]]. The reactions in these cell compartments are glycolysis, [[photophosphorylation]] and [[carbon assimilation]].

ATP, the main source of energy in almost all living organisms, must bind with metal ions such as Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to function. Examination of cells with limited magnesium supply has shown that a lack of magnesium can cause a decrease in ATP.&lt;ref name=Gout2014&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; MgATP can be found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes cells. However, most of the ATP in cells is MgATP. Following the [[Irving–Williams series]], magnesium has a higher binding constant than the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the dominant ATP in living organisms is MgATP. A greater binding constant also given magnesium the advantage as a better catalyst over other competing transition metals.

===Manganese===
[[File:Photosystem-II 2AXT.PNG|thumb|Magnesium Center in Cyanobacterial photosystem II. Incorporation of manganese sparked evolution of complex plant life.|300x300px]]

Evidence suggests that manganese (Mn) was first incorporated into biological systems roughly 3.2 - 2.8 billion years ago, during the [[Archean|Archean Period]]. Together with calcium, it formed the manganese-calcium oxide complex (determined by [[X-ray diffraction]]) which consisted of a manganese cluster, essentially an inorganic cubane (cubical) structure. The incorporation of a manganese center in [[photosystem II]] was highly significant, as it allowed for [[photosynthetic]] oxygen evolution of plants. The [[oxygen-evolving complex]] (OEC) is a critical component of photosystem II contained in the [[thylakoid membranes]] of chloroplasts; it is responsible for terminal [[photooxidation]] of water during [[light reactions]].&lt;ref name=Williams2007&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incorporation of Mn in proteins allowed the complexes the ability to reduce reactive oxygen species in Mn-[[Superoxide dismutase|superoxide dismutatse]] (MnSOD) and [[catalase]], in electron transfer-dependent catalysis (for instance in certain class I [[ribonucleotide reductases]]) and in the oxidation of water by photosystem II (PSII), where the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances is decreased. This is due to manganese's ability to reduce superoxide anion and [[hydroxyl radicals]] as well as its chain-breaking capacity.&lt;ref name=Salomon&gt;

===Iron===

[[Iron]] (Fe) is the most abundant element in the Earth and the fourth most abundant element in the crust, approximately 5 percent by mass. Due to the abundance of iron and its role in [[biological systems]], the transition and mineralogical stages of iron have played a key role in Earth surface systems. It played a larger role in the geological past in [[Marine geology|marine geochemistry]], as evidenced by the deposits of [[Precambrian]] iron-rich sediments. The [[redox]] transformation of Fe(II) to Fe(III), or vice versa, is vital to a number of biological and element cycling processes. The [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of Fe(III) is seen to oxidize sulfur (from H{{sub|2}}S to SO{{sub|4}}{{sup|-2}}), which is a central process in marine sediments. Many of the first [[metalloproteins]] consisted of iron-sulphur complexes formed during [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Taylor2011&gt;

  |doi=10.2113/gselements.7.2.83
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron is the main redox metal in biological systems. In [[proteins]], it is found in a variety of sites and cofactors, including, for instance, [[Haem|haem groups]], Fe–O–Fe sites, and iron–sulfur clusters.

The prevalence of iron is apparently due to the large availability of Fe(II) in the initial evolution of living organisms, before the rise of photosynthesis and an increase in atmospheric oxygen levels which resulted in the precipitation of iron in the environment as Fe(OH){{sub|3}}. It has flexible redox properties because such properties are sensitive to [[ligand]] coordination, including geometry. Iron can be also used in enzymes due to its [[Lewis acid]] properties, for example in nitrile hydratase. Iron is frequently found in mononuclear sites in the reduced Fe(II) form, and functions in dioxygen activation; this function is used as a major mechanism adopted by living organisms to avoid the kinetic barrier hindering the transformation of organic compounds by O{{sub|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron can be taken up selectively as ferredoxins, Fe-O-Fe (hemerythrin and ribonucleotide reductase), Fe (many oxidases), apart from iron porphyrin. Variation in the related proteins with any one of these chemical forms of iron has produced a wide range of enzymes. All of these arrangements are modified to function both in the sense of reactivity and the positioning of the protein in the cell. Iron can have various redox and spin states, and it can be held in many stereochemistries.&lt;ref name=Williams1985&gt;

===Nickel and cobalt===

[[File:Cobalamin.png|thumbnail|Coenzyme B12- Theorized as the first occurrence of cobalt in a biological system]]

Around 4-3 [[Gya|Ga]], [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[prokaryotes]] began developing metal and organic [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for light absorption. They ultimately ended up making [[chlorophyll]] from Mg(II), as is found in [[cyanobacteria]] and plants, leading to modern [[photosynthesis]]. However, chlorophyll synthesis requires numerous steps. The process starts with uroporphyrin, a primitive precursor to the [[porphyrin]] ring which may be [[Biotic component|biotic]] or [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] in origin, which is then modified in cells differently to make [[Magnesium|Mg]], [[Iron|Fe]], [[Nickel|nickel (Ni)]], and [[Cobalt|cobalt (Co)]] complexes. The centers of these rings are not selective, thus allowing the variety of metal ions to be incorporated. Mg porphyrin gives rise to chlorophyll, Fe porphyrin to [[heme]] proteins, Ni porphyrin yields factor [[Cofactor F430|F-430]], and Co porphyrin [[Coenzyme B12]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, S. et al.

===Copper===
Before the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], copper was not readily available for living organisms. Most early copper was Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu. This oxidation state of copper is not very soluble in water. One billion years ago, after the great oxidation event the oxygen pressure rose sufficiently to oxidise Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, increasing its solubility in water. As a result, the copper became much more available for living organisms.

Most copper-containing proteins and enzymes can be found in [[eukaryotes]]. Only a handful of [[prokaryotes]] such as aerobic bacteria and cyanobacteria contain copper enzymes or proteins. Copper can be found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [[superoxide dismutase|superoxide dismutase (SOD)]] enzyme. There are three distinct types of SOD, containing Mn, Fe and Cu respectively. Mn-SOD and Fe-SOD are found in most prokaryotes and mitochondria of the eukaryotic cell. Cu-SOD can be found in the cytoplasmic fraction of the eukaryotic cells. The three elements, copper, iron and manganese, can all catalyze superoxide to ordinary molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. However, Cu-SOD is more efficient than Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD. Most prokaryotes only utilize Fe-SOD or Mn-SOD due to the lack of copper in the environment. Some organisms did not develop Cu-SOD due to the lack of a gene pool for the Cu-SOD adoption.&lt;ref&gt;

  |doi=10.1016/0303-2647(83)90029-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zinc===

[[Zinc|Zinc (Zn)]] was incorporated into living cells in two waves. Four to three [[Gya|Ga]], anaerobic prokaryotes arose, and the atmosphere was full of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] and highly reductive. Thus most zinc was in the form of insoluble [[Zinc sulfide|ZnS]]. However, because seawater at the time was slightly acidic, some Zn(II) was available in its ionic form and became part of early anaerobic prokaryotes’ external [[proteases]], external [[nucleases]], internal [[synthetase]]s and [[dehydrogenases]].&lt;ref name="Williams2012"/&gt;

During the second wave, once the Great Oxygenation Event occurred, more Zn(II) ions were available in the seawater. This allowed its incorporation in the single-cell eukaryotes as they arose at this time. It is believed that the later addition of ions such as zinc and copper allowed them to displace iron and manganese from the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). Fe and Mn complexes dissociate readily (Irving-Williams series) while Zn and Cu do not. This is why eukaryotic SOD contains Cu or Zn and its prokaryotic counterpart contains Fe or Mn.&lt;ref name="Williams2012"/&gt;

Zn (II) doesn’t pose an oxidation threat to the [[cytoplasm]]. This allowed it to become a major cytoplasmic element in the eukaryotes. It became associated with a new group of [[Transcription factor|transcription proteins]], [[zinc fingers]]. This could only have occurred due to the long life of eukaryotes, which allowed time for zinc to exchange and hence become an internal messenger coordinating the action of other transcription factors during growth.&lt;ref name="Williams2012"/&gt;

===Molybdenum===

[[Molybdenum]] (Mo) is the most abundant [[transition element]] in solution in the sea (mostly as dianionic molybdate ion) and in living organisms, its abundance in the Earth’s crust is quite low. Therefore, the use of Mo by living organisms seems surprising at first glance. [[Archaea]], bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, including humans, require molybdenum. It is also found in over 50 different [[enzymes]]. Its hydrolysis to water-soluble oxo-anionic species makes Mo readily accessible. Mo is found in the [[active site]]s of [[metalloenzymes]] that perform key transformations in the [[metabolism]] of carbon, nitrogen, arsenic, selenium, sulfur,  and chlorine compounds.
The mononuclear Mo enzymes are widely distributed in the biosphere; they catalyze many significant reactions in the metabolism of nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds as well as various [[Carbonyl|carbonyl compounds]] (e.g., aldehydes, CO, and CO{{sub|2}}). [[Nitrate reductases]] enzymes are important for the nitrogen cycle. They belong to a class of enzymes with a mononuclear Mo center and they catalyze the metabolism reaction of C,  N, S, etc., in bacteria, plants, animals, and humans.&lt;ref name=Sigel&gt;

  |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis

  |volume=39
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the oxidation of [[sulfides]], The first considerable development was that of [[aerobic bacteria]] which could now utilize Mo.&lt;ref name=Williams2007/&gt; As oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere and oceans, the reaction of MoS{{sub|2}} to MoO{{sub|4}} also increased. This reaction made the highly soluble molybdate ion available for incorporation into critical metalloenzymes, and may have thus allowed life to thrive. It allowed organisms to occupy new ecological niches. Mo plays an important role in the reduction of [[dinitrogen]] to [[ammonia]], which occurs in one type of [[nitrogenase]]s. These enzymes are used by bacteria that usually live in a [[Symbiotic relationships|symbiotic]] relationship with plants; their role is [[nitrogen fixation]], which is vital for sustaining life on earth. Mo enzymes also play important roles in [[sulfur metabolism]] of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.&lt;ref name=Sigel/&gt;

===Tungsten===

[[File:Pyrococcus furiosus.png|thumb|Pyrococcus furiosus - one of the few modern organisms where the incorporation tungsten is still essential.|300x300px]]

Tungsten is one of the oldest metal ions to be incorporated in biological systems, preceding The Great Oxygenation Event. Before the abundance of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere, oceans teemed with [[sulfur]] and tungsten, while molybdenum, a metal that is highly similar chemically, was inaccessible in solid form. The abundance of tungsten and lack of free molybdenum likely explains why early marine organisms incorporated the former instead of the latter. However, as cyanobacteria began to fill the atmosphere with oxygen, molybdenum became available (molybdenum becomes soluble when exposed to oxygen) and molybdenum began to replace tungsten in the majority of [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]], which is seen today, as tungsten is only present in the biological complexes of prokaryotes (methanogens, gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes), and is only obligated in [[hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]] [[archaea]] such as [[Pyrococcus furiosus|P. furiosus]]. Tungesten's extremely high melting point (3,422&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C), partially explains its necessity in these archaea, found in extremely hot areas.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research into the specific enzyme complexes in which tungsten is incorporated is relatively recent (1970s), natural tungstoenzymes are abundantly found in a large number of prokaryotic microorganisms. These include formate dehydrogenase, formyl methanufuran dehydrogenase, acetylene hydratase, and a class of phylogenetically related oxidoreductases that catalyze the reversible oxidation of aldehydes. The first crystal structure of a tungsten- or [[pterin]]-containing enzyme, that of [[aldehyde]] [[ferredoxin]] [[oxidoreductase]] from P. furiosus, has revealed a [[Active site|catalytic site]] with one W atom coordinated to two pterin molecules which are themselves bridged by a magnesium ion.&lt;ref name=Sigel/&gt;

An '''extragalactic planet''', also known as an '''extragalactic [[exoplanet]]''', is a [[star]]-bound [[planet]], or [[rogue planet]], located outside of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. Due to the huge distances to such worlds, they would be very hard to detect directly. However, indirect evidence suggests that such planets may exist.&lt;ref name="ARX-20180202"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dai |first1=Xinyu |last2= Guerras |first2=Eduardo |title=Probing Planets in Extragalactic Galaxies Using Quasar Microlensing  |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=853 |issue=2 |pages=L27 |date=2 February 2018 |arxiv=1802.00049|bibcode=2018ApJ...853L..27D|doi=10.3847/2041-8213/aaa5fb }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NG-20180205"&gt;{{cite web |last=Zachos |first=Elaine |title=More Than a Trillion Planets Could Exist Beyond Our Galaxy - A new study gives the first evidence that exoplanets exist beyond the Milky Way. |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/exoplanets-discovery-milky-way-galaxy-spd/ |date=5 February 2018 |work=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=5 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GZM-20180205"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mandelbaum |first=Ryan F. |title=Scientists Find Evidence of Thousands of Planets in Distant Galaxy |url=https://gizmodo.com/scientists-find-evidence-of-thousands-of-planets-in-dis-1822727151 |date=5 February 2018 |work=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=5 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the most distant known planets are [[SWEEPS-11]] and [[SWEEPS-04]], located in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], approximately 27,710 light-years from the Sun, while the Milky Way is between 100,000–180,000 light years in diameter. This means that even galactic planets located further than that distance have not been detected.

==HIP 13044 b==
A planet with a mass of at least 1.25 times that of [[Jupiter]] had been potentially discovered by the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO) orbiting a star of extragalactic origin, even though the star now has been absorbed by our own galaxy. [[HIP 13044]] is a star about 2,000 light years away in the southern constellation of [[Fornax]],&lt;ref name="eso"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1045/|title=Planet from another galaxy discovered|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=ESO Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Helmi stream]] [[List of stellar streams|of stars]], a leftover remnant of a small galaxy that collided with and was absorbed by the Milky Way over 6 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Klement2010 /&gt; 

However, subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the potential planetary detection: for example an erroneous barycentric correction had been applied (the same error had also led to claims of planets around [[HIP 11952]] that were subsequently refuted). After applying the corrections, there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the star.&lt;ref name="JonesJenkins2014"/&gt; If it had been real, the Jupiter-like planet would have been particularly interesting, orbiting a star nearing the end of its life and seemingly about to be engulfed by it, potentially providing an observational model for the fate of our own planetary system in the distant future.

==Twin Quasar-related planet==
A microlensing event in the [[Twin Quasar]] [[gravitational lens]]ing system was observed in 1996, by [[Rudolph Schild|R. E. Schild]], in the "A" lobe of the lensed quasar. It is predicted that a 3-Earth-mass planet in the lensing galaxy, [[YGKOW G1]], caused the event. This was the first extragalactic planet candidate announced. This, however, is not a repeatable observation, as it was a one-time chance alignment. This predicted planet lies 4 billion light years away.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist (issue 2037), [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15120372.600-science--do-alien-worlds-throng-faraway-galaxy/ Do alien worlds throng faraway galaxy?] ''Govert Schilling'' 06 July 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extrasolar Visions, [http://www.extrasolar.net/planettour.asp?PlanetID=74 "The Q0957+561 Planet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330100014/http://www.extrasolar.net/planettour.asp?PlanetID=74 |date=2012-03-30 }} (accessed 1 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Andromeda galaxy planets==
A team of scientists has used gravitational microlensing to come up with a tentative detection of an extragalactic exoplanet in [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]], our nearest large galactic neighbor. The lensing pattern fits a star with a smaller companion, [[PA-99-N2]], weighing just around 6.34 times the mass of Jupiter. This suspected planet is the first announced in the Andromeda Galaxy.&lt;ref name="Thaindian"&gt;Thaindian News, [http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/health/first-extragalactic-exoplanet-may-have-been-found-by-gravitational-microlensing_100203542.html First extragalactic exoplanet may have been found by gravitational microlensing], 11 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17287-first-extragalactic-exoplanet-may-have-been-found/ First extragalactic exoplanet may have been found], 10 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A population of [[unbound planet]]s between stars, with masses ranging from [[Lunar mass|Lunar]] to [[Jovian mass]]es, have been indirectly detected, for the first time, by [[Astrophysics|astrophysicists]] from the [[University of Oklahoma]], in the lensing galaxy that lenses quasar [[RX J1131-1231]] by [[Gravitational microlensing|microlensing]].&lt;ref name="ARX-20180202" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NG-20180205" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GZM-20180205" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12821">'''Funding bias''', also known as '''sponsorship bias''', '''funding outcome bias''', '''funding publication bias''', and '''funding effect''', refers to the tendency of a scientific study to support the interests of the study's financial sponsor. This phenomenon is recognized sufficiently that researchers undertake studies to examine bias in past published studies. Funding bias has been associated, in particular, with research into chemical toxicity, tobacco, and pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Krimsky Sheldon | authorlink = Sheldon Krimsky | year = 2013 | title = Do Financial Conflicts of Interest Bias Research? An Inquiry into the "Funding Effect" Hypothesis | url = http://www.tufts.edu/~skrimsky/PDF/Funding%20Effect%20and%20Bias.PDF | journal = Science, Technology &amp; Human Values | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 566–587| doi = 10.1177/0162243912456271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an instance of [[experimenter's bias]].

==Causes==

===Human nature===
The psychology text ''[[Influence: Science and Practice]]'' describes the act of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] as a trait in which a person feels obliged to return favors. This trait is embodied in all human cultures. [[Human nature]] may influence even the most ethical researchers to be affected by their sponsors, although they may genuinely deny it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cialdini, Robert B | title=Influence: Science and Practice (5th ed) |publisher=Prentice Hall |date=2008-08-08 |isbn=978-0-205-60999-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misconduct===
{{main|scientific misconduct}}

[[Scientific malpractice]] involving shoddy research or data manipulation does occur in rare instances. Often, however, the quality of manufacturers' studies are at least as good as studies that were not funded by a special interest.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news | author=David Michaels |title=It's Not the Answers That Are Biased, It's the Questions |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/14/AR2008071402145.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, bias usually occurs for other reasons.

===Predetermined conclusion===

Research results can be selected or discarded to support a predetermined conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilmshurst |first=Peter |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tobacco industry]], for example, would publish their own internal research that invariably found minimal adverse health effects of [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

A company that hires researchers to perform a study may require the researchers to sign a nondisclosure agreement before they are funded, by which researchers waive their right to release any results independently and release them only to the sponsor. The sponsor may fund several studies at the same time, suppressing results found contrary to their business interests while publicizing the results that support their interests. Indeed, a review of pharmaceutical studies revealed that research funded by drug companies was less likely to be published, but the drug-company-funded research that was published was more likely to report outcomes favorable to the sponsor.&lt;ref name="lexchin"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joel |last=Lexchin |last2=Bero |first2=Lisa A |first3=Benjamin |last3=Djulbegovic |first4=Otavio |last4=Clark |title=Pharmaceutical industry sponsorship and research outcome and quality: systematic review |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/326/7400/1167 |journal=BMJ |date=2003-05-31 |volume=326 |pmid=12775614 |issue=7400 |pages=1167–1170 |pmc=156458 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7400.1167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[double-blind study]] with only objective measures is less likely to be biased to support a given conclusion. However, the researchers or the sponsors still have opportunities to skew the results by discarding or ignoring undesirable data, qualitatively characterizing the results, and ultimately deciding whether to publish at all. Also, not all studies are possible to conduct double-blind.

===Publication bias===
{{main|publication bias}}

Scientist researcher [[Anders Sandberg]] writes that funding bias may be a form of [[publication bias]]. Because it is easier to publish positive results than inconclusive or no results, positive results may be correlated with being positive for the sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Anders Sandberg | authorlink=Anders Sandberg | title=Supping with the Devil | url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/01/supping_with_th.html | publisher=OvercomingBias |date=2007-01-14}}&lt;!-- This is a science blog written by a notable scientist; therefore it can be considered a reliable source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reporting bias|Outcome reporting bias]] is related to publication bias and selection bias, in which multiple outcomes are measured but only the significant outcomes are reported, while insignificant or unfavorable outcomes are ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Bias |url=http://www.chalmersresearch.com/bmg/types_bias.html |publisher=Cochrane Bias Methods Group |date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection of subjects or comparators===
{{main|selection bias}}
[[Selection bias]] may result in a non-representative population of test subjects in spite of best efforts to obtain a representative sample. Even a double-blind study may be subject to biased selection of dependent variables, population (via inclusion and exclusion criteria), sample size, statistical methods, or inappropriate comparators, any of which can bias the outcome of a study to favor a particular conclusion.&lt;ref name="lexchin" /&gt;

==Examples==
*A 1996 study on the effects of [[nicotine]] on [[Cognitive deficit|cognitive performance]] revealed that findings of nicotine or smoking improving performance were more likely to be published by scientists who acknowledged tobacco industry support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christina Turner |author2=George J Spilich |title=Research into smoking or nicotine and human cognitive performance: does the source of funding make a difference? |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119158100/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |journal=Addiction |year=1997 |volume=92 |issue=11 |pmid=9519485 |pages=1423–1426 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1997.tb02863.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2003 study of published research on antidepressants found that studies sponsored by manufacturers of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRI) and newer antidepressants tended to favor their products over alternatives when compared to non-industry-funded studies. Also, modelling studies funded by industry were more favorable to industry than studies funded by non-industry sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.183.6.498 |author=C. Bruce Baker |author2=Michael T. Johnsrud |author3=M. Lynn Crismon |author4=Robert A. Rosenheck |author5=Scott W.

*A 2006 review of experimental studies examining the [[Mobile phone radiation and health|health effects of cell phone use]] found that studies funded exclusively by industry were least likely to report a statistically significant result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anke Huss |author2=Matthias Egger |author3=Kerstin Hug |author4=Karin Huwiler-Müntener |author5=Martin Röösli |title=Source of Funding and Results of Studies of Health Effects of Mobile Phone Use: Systematic Review of Experimental Studies |url=http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info:doi/10.1289/ehp.9149 |date=2006-09-15 |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |pages=1–4 |volume=115 |issue=1 |doi=10.1289/ehp.9149 |pmid=17366811 |pmc=1797826}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) determined in 2008 that the [[Bisphenol A#September 2008|bisphenol A]] (BPA) in [[plastic container]]s is safe when leeched into food, citing chemical industry studies. Independent research studies reached different conclusions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=vom Saal FS, Myers JP |title=Bisphenol A and Risk of Metabolic Disorders |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] |volume= 300|issue=  11|pages= 1353–5|year=2008 |pmid= 18799451|doi=10.1001/jama.300.11.1353 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/300.11.1353}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 90 percent of them finding health effects from low doses of BPA.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;
*Two opposing commercial sponsors can be at odds with the published findings of research they sponsor. A 2008 Duke University study on rats, funded by the [[Sugar Association]], found adverse effects of consuming the artificial sweetener [[Splenda]]. The manufacturer, [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] subsidiary McNeil Nutritionals LLC, responded by sponsoring its own team of experts to refute the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Splenda study: Industry and academia respond |author=Stephen Daniells |date=2009-09-25 |url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science-Nutrition/Splenda-study-Industry-and-academia-respond |publisher=Foodnavigator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, an analysis of studies exploring health effects of sugary soda consumption published between 2001 and 2016 found a 100% probability that a study was funded by sugar-sweetened beverage companies if it found no link between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and poorer metabolic health. Only 2.9% of studies that found sugary beverages linked to higher rates of diabetes and obesity were underwritten by the sugar-sweetened beverage industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Schillinger D, Tran J, Mangurian C, Kearns C |title=Do Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Cause Obesity and Diabetes?

The authors concluded "This industry seems to be manipulating contemporary scientific processes to create controversy and advance their business interests at the expense of the public's health.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Melissa Healy |date=31 October 2016 |title=Does the soda industry manipulate research on sugary drinks' health effects? |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-sugary-drink-research-20161031-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2017 [[Cochrane review]] analysis of outcomes of studies pertaining to drugs and medical devices revealed that manufacturing company sponsorship "leads to more favorable results and conclusions than sponsorship by other sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundh|first=Andreas|last2=Lexchin|first2=Joel|last3=Mintzes|first3=Barbara|last4=Schroll|first4=Jeppe B.|last5=Bero|first5=Lisa|date=16 Feb 2017|title=Industry sponsorship and research outcome|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=MR000033|doi=10.1002/14651858.MR000033.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28207928|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GEOMAR - Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel''' ('''GEOMAR'''), former ''Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences'' ([[German language|German]]: ''Leibniz-Institut für Meereswissenschaften'', IFM-GEOMAR), is a research institute in [[Kiel]], Germany. It was formed in 2004 by merging the Institute for Marine Science ([[Institut für Meereskunde Kiel]], (IFM)) with the Research Center for Marine Geosciences (GEOMAR) and is co-funded by both federal and provincial governments.&lt;ref name=GMRC /&gt; It was a member of the [[Leibniz Association]] till 2012 and is coordinator of the [[FishBase Consortium]].&lt;ref name=Palomares /&gt; Since 2012 it is member of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|Helmholtz Association]] and named ''GEOMAR - Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel''.

==Research divisions==
GEOMAR is structured into four research divisions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-geomar.de/index.php?id=struktur&amp;L=1 Organizational Structure of the Institute] IFM-GEOMAR web site.Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Physical oceanography|Ocean circulation and climate dynamics]]: This division, led by [[Mojib Latif]], investigates climate from different time perspectives, with computer simulations and ocean current models that include meteorological, geological and oceanographic considerations. Current ocean measurements are made from research vessels at sea, and include the use of [[remote sensing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-geomar.de/index.php?id=ozeanzirkulation&amp;L=1 Research Division 1: Ocean Circulation and Climate Dynamics] IFM-GEOMAR. Updated 5 August 2010. Retrieved 24 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marine biogeochemistry: Work in this division looks at the way the components of the marine [[biogeochemical]] processes interact with each other. These components include the material in the atmosphere, the sediment and oceanic reservoirs, and the biological organisms including humans. Particular attention is paid to the atmosphere/ocean interface and the sediment/ocean interface, as well as to elements and compounds which can cycle and cause [[radiative forcing]]. Research ranges from the atmosphere over the ocean, through the ocean [[surface layer]] into the [[water column]], and then down to the [[Pelagic sediments|marine sediments]] and the [[oceanic crust]]. [[Field work]] is also undertakes, as well as laboratory and [[mesocosm]] studies. The division also develops biological, chemical and isotope diagnostic tools for measuring [[Proxy (climate)|proxy variables]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-geomar.de/index.php?id=21&amp;L=1 Research Division 2: Marine biogeochemistry] IFM-GEOMAR. Updated 2 November 2010. Retrieved 24 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marine biology|Marine ecology]]: This division, led by Ulrich Sommer, aims to "understand the sensitivity of [[marine ecosystem]]s to [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and natural changes, with a mid-term focus on climate change and [[overexploitation]] of marine bio-resources." It is important to understand how much stress a given ecosystem can absorb before structural shifts occur. When a shift does occur, it is necessary to understand how this will impact the ecosystem populations and the degree to which the shift can be reversed. Structural shifts can result in invasions by harmful organisms, species collapse and a radical reconfiguring of the biogeochemical cycles. Traditional approaches group species broadly into size classes and [[trophic level]]s measured by [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] or [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. But to understand how ecosystems react to natural and anthropogenic stressors, specific differences in the way individual species react must also be understood, particularly where [[keystone species]] are involved. Research within this division range from genes to ecosystems, including the "[[ecophysiology]] of key species and its genetic basis, dynamics and genetics of individual populations and of communities, interactions within and among species, structure and response of entire [[food web]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-geomar.de/index.php?id=559&amp;L=1 Research Division 3: Marine Ecology] IFM-GEOMAR. Updated 27 November 2009. Retrieved 24 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dynamics of the ocean floor: Research is focused on "processes that shape the [[oceanic lithosphere]], and the impact of these processes on the environment, e.g. climate and natural hazards. These research themes are pursued in the three main [[geotectonic]] settings: divergent and [[Convergent boundary|convergent margins]] and in intraplate regions. These three settings represent critical stages in the life-cycle of the [[ocean floor]].  The [[ocean basin]]s are created by the [[rifting]] apart of continents. [[Oceanic lithosphere]] then forms at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. It is subsequently modified by low and high temperature interactions with the overlying oceans, the addition of intraplate [[magma]]s, the deposition of [[marine sediment]]s, and tectonic processes occurring at or near [[Transform plate|transform]] and [[convergent plate]] margins. When it [[subduct]]s at convergent margins, the dehydration of the plate induces [[arc volcanism]] that creates and modifies the [[continental crust]] and transfers climate-relevant volatiles into the atmosphere. Such [[continental margin]]s are sites of sediment accumulation, fluid exchange, important resources and major geo-hazards."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-geomar.de/index.php?id=dynamik&amp;L=1 Research Division 4: Dynamics of the ocean floor] IFM-GEOMAR.

'''Genetic admixture''' occurs when two or more previously isolated and genetically differentiated populations begin [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rius, M. and Darling, J.A. |title=How important is intraspecific genetic admixture to the success of colonising populations? |year=2014 |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=233−242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admixture results in the introduction of new [[Lineage (genetic)|genetic lineages]] into a population. It has been known to slow local adaptation by introducing foreign, unadapted [[genotype]]s (known as [[genetic pollution]]). It also prevents [[speciation]] by homogenizing populations and increasing [[heterozygosity]].

==Examples==
Climatic cycles facilitate genetic admixture in cold periods and genetic diversification in warm periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lv, X., Cheng, J., Meng, Y., Chang, Y., Xia, L., Wen, Z., Ge, D., Liu, S. and Yang, Q. |year=2018 |title=Disjunct distribution and distinct intraspecific diversification of ''Eothenomys melanogaster'' in South China |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Natural [[flood]]ing can cause genetic admixture within populations of migrating fish species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Jaisuk, C. and Senanan, W. |year=2018 |title=Effects of landscape features on population genetic variation of a tropical stream fish, Stone lapping minnow, ''Garra cambodgiensis'', in the upper Nan River drainage basin, northern Thailand |journal=PeerJ |volume=6 |page=e4487}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Genetic admixture may have an important role for the success of populations that colonise a new area and [[interbreed]] with individuals of native populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kolbe, J.J., Larson, A., Losos, J.B. and de Queiroz, K. |year=2008 |title=Admixture determines genetic diversity and population differentiation in the biological invasion of a lizard species |journal=Biology Letters |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=434−437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mapping==
Admixture mapping is a method of [[gene mapping]] that uses a [[population]] of mixed ancestry (an admixed population) to find the genetic [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] that contribute to differences in diseases or other [[phenotypes]] found between the different ancestral populations. The method is best applied to populations with recent admixture from two populations that were previously genetically isolated for tens of thousands of years, such as [[African Americans]] (admixture of African and European populations). The method attempts to correlate the degree of ancestry near a genetic locus with the phenotype or disease of interest. Genetic markers that differ in frequency between the ancestral populations are needed across the genome.&lt;ref name="Shriver"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shriver |first1=MD |display-authors=etal |title=Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry and admixture mapping |journal=Human Genetics |date=April 2003 |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=387–99 |doi=10.1007/s00439-002-0896-y |pmid=12579416|doi-broken-date=2018-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admixture mapping is based on the assumption that differences in disease rates or phenotypes are due in part to differences in the frequencies of disease-causing or phenotype-causing genetic variants between populations. In an admixed population, these causal variants occur more frequently on chromosomal segments inherited from one or another ancestral population. The first admixture scans were published in 2005 and since then genetic contributors to a variety of disease and trait differences have been mapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev-genom-082509-141523| last1 = Winkler  | first1 = C. A. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = G. W. | last3 = Smith | first3 = M. W. | title = Admixture mapping comes of age | journal = Annu Rev Genom Hum Genet | volume =  11 | pages =  65–89 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20594047}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[hypertension]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Body mass index|BMI]], and [[prostate cancer]] in African Americans. By 2010, high-density mapping panels had been constructed for African Americans, Latino/Hispanics, and [[Uyghurs]].

Dr. '''George Galambos'''  (born in [[Budapest]]) is a computer engineer.

He graduated the Budapest Technical University ([[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]) in 1972, with a Ph.D. in chemical engineering. Prior to which, he studied chemical engineering at the Leningrad Technology Institute ([[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology]]).

He is an [[IBM Fellow]] (2003), an IBM Distinguished Engineer and a member of the IBM Academy of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/5250.wss IBM Honors and Rewards Elite Technical Employees]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOialXpj?url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/5250.wss |date=December 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He holds the office of CTO, Global Services (IGS) IBM Canada.

Dr. Galambos was a designer on the team that built the Interac network connecting bank machines around the world. The result was an open system that allowed almost any card to be used in almost any machine, regardless of the user’s financial institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/Home/News.asp?id=1872 Interac architect sounds off on SOA]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOib2yra?url=http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/Home/News.asp?id=1872 |date=December 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Galambos advises companies on advanced systems design and strategic IT plans. His current interest includes system design patterns, with a focus on integration.

Dr. Galambos holds patent for 'System and method for transforming an enterprise using a component business model' (Patent #20070174109, Class: 705010000 (USPTO)), A system and method are described for using a Component Business Model (CBM) to transform a business. A CBM map is used to identify components that collaborate to provide a specified capability, and a repository supporting the CBM map is filtered to provide a view of the identified components that highlights how they collaborate. The view is used to identify component features contributing to the specified capability. The specified capability is then enhanced by a transformation strategy that includes re-engineering particular components, identifying a pattern characterizing the collaboration between components and adding a component to perform the collaborative pattern, or adding another feature to the collaboration and adding component to perform the additional feature. The CBM repository provides exemplar best practices that can be adapted for use in a re-engineered component.

The '''Home Energy Resources Unit''' or Home Energy Recovery Unit (HERU) is a [[prototype]] [[kitchen appliance]] which is claimed to use [[household waste]] to generate [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43643709 |title=New gadget turning waste into hot water |last=Gregory-Kumar |first=David |date=2018-04-04 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-08-28 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Household waste, both organic and inorganic, is placed into a main chamber. Plastic and cardboard packaging as well as food waste can be inserted as fuel, and the waste does not need to be sorted or separated.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.mobile.reuters.com/video/2018/07/02/machine-transforms-household-trash-into?videoId=441354971&amp;videoChannel=82|title=Machine transforms household trash into fuel|work=Reuters video|date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then goes through an eight-hour cycle. The chamber containing the waste is heated to 100° [[celsius]] to evaporate water and remove [[oxygen]]. The temperature is then increased and [[pyrolysis]] takes place. Oxygen is then re-introduced to allow [[incineration]] of the [[Pyrolysis#Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars|pyrolised waste]] for [[water heating]]. After eight hours, a tankful of stored hot water is produced, and all plastic, cardboard and organic waste is reduced to [[gas]] and [[ash]]. The gas is then used in a domestic [[boiler]], and the ash can be flushed safely into an ordinary sewage system. Any glass or metal waste is left in a [[thermal cleaning|clean state]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43643709|title=New kitchen appliance turning rubbish into hot water|website=BBC.co.uk|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/04/personal-incinerators-are-one-mans-vision-of-the-future/|title=Personal Incinerators Are One Man's Vision of the Future|website=Gizmodo.co.uk|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The invention won a grant from the [[UK Government]]'s [[Innovate UK]] Energy Game Changer Fund.&lt;ref name="utility"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://utilityweek.co.uk/worlds-first-efw-hybrid-boiler-gets-government-backing/|title=World’s first EFW hybrid boiler gets government backing|website=utilityweek.co.uk|date=16 March 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology won the 2017 Environment and Sustainability Group Prize of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref name="eesg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imeche.org/careers-education/scholarships-and-awards/energy-environment-and-sustainability-group-prize|title=Energy, Environment and Sustainability Group Prize|website=Institution of Mechanical Engineers|date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Honglujing Stele''' ({{zh|t=鴻臚井|s= 鸿胪井|p=Hónglújǐng}}) is a tablet 3 meters wide, 1.8 meters tall, &amp; 2 meters thick. It has 29 [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] characters written on it.

It is the only [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907) stele from [[Manchuria]]. It mentions the 1st king of the [[Balhae]] around 698 - 926 CE. The king listed on the tablet is [[Go of Balhae]].

This kingdom is considered [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n, or independent, depending on the nationality of the researcher. Russian and Japanese scholars classify it as an independent [[Mohe people|Mohe]] state.

It is currently located in the [[Japanese Imperial Palace]]. It was taken from [[Liaoning]] province, [[Lüshun]] city in about 1907 after the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Chinese researchers are now studying it for the first time.

'''Information theory''' studies the [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], [[Computer data storage|storage]], and [[Telecommunication|communication]] of [[information]].  It was originally proposed by [[Claude E. Shannon]] in 1948 to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] and communication operations such as [[data compression]], in a landmark paper entitled "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]". Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include [[lossless data compression]] (e.g. [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP files]]), [[lossy data compression]] (e.g. [[MP3]]s and [[JPEG]]s), and [[channel capacity|channel coding]] (e.g. for [[DSL|digital subscriber line (DSL)]]). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions to deep space, the invention of the [[compact disc]], the feasibility of [[mobile phone]]s, the development of the [[Internet]], the study of [[linguistics]] and of human perception, the understanding of [[black hole]]s, and numerous other fields.

A key measure in information theory is "[[information entropy|entropy]]". Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a [[random variable]] or the outcome of a [[random process]]. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair [[coin flip]] (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a {{dice}} (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are [[mutual information]], [[channel capacity]], [[error exponent]]s, and [[relative entropy]].

The field is at the intersection of [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[neurobiology]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]]. The theory has also found applications in other areas, including [[statistical inference]], [[natural language processing]], [[cryptography]], [[neurobiology]],&lt;ref name="Spikes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Spikes: Exploring the Neural Code|publisher=The MIT press|year=1997|isbn=978-0262681087|author1=F.

==Overview==

Information theory studies the transmission, processing, extraction, and utilization of information. Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty. In the case of communication of information over a noisy channel, this abstract concept was made concrete in 1948 by [[Claude Shannon]] in his paper "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]", in which "information" is thought of as a set of possible messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the channel noise. Shannon's main result, the [[noisy-channel coding theorem]] showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the [[channel capacity]], a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent.&lt;ref name="Spikes" /&gt;

Information theory is closely associated with a collection of pure and applied disciplines that have been investigated and reduced to engineering practice under a variety of [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]] throughout the world over the past half century or more: [[adaptive system]]s, [[anticipatory system]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], [[complex system]]s, [[complexity science]], [[cybernetics]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[machine learning]], along with [[systems science]]s of many descriptions. Information theory is a broad and deep mathematical theory, with equally broad and deep applications, amongst which is the vital field of [[coding theory]].

Coding theory is concerned with finding explicit methods, called ''codes'', for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the [[channel capacity]]. These codes can be roughly subdivided into [[data compression]] (source coding) and [[error-correction]] (channel coding) techniques. In the latter case, it took many years to find the methods Shannon's work proved were possible. A third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms (both [[code (cryptography)|code]]s and [[cipher]]s). Concepts, methods and results from coding theory and information theory are widely used in [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]]. ''See the article [[ban (unit)]] for a historical application.''

Information theory is also used in [[information retrieval]], [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence gathering]], [[gambling]], [[statistics]], and even in [[musical composition]].

==Historical background==
{{Main|History of information theory}}

The landmark event that ''established'' the discipline of information theory and brought it to immediate worldwide attention was the publication of [[Claude E. Shannon]]'s classic paper "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]" in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in July and October 1948.

Prior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at [[Bell Labs]], all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.  [[Harry Nyquist]]'s 1924 paper, ''Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'', contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation {{math|1=''W'' = ''K'' log ''m''}} (recalling [[Boltzmann's constant]]), where ''W'' is the speed of transmission of intelligence, ''m'' is the number of different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and ''K'' is a constant.  [[Ralph Hartley]]'s 1928 paper, ''Transmission of Information'', uses the word ''information'' as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one [[sequence of symbols]] from any other, thus quantifying information as {{math|1=''H'' = log ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''n'' log ''S''}}, where ''S'' was the number of possible symbols, and ''n'' the number of symbols in a transmission. The unit of information was therefore the [[decimal digit]], which has since sometimes been called the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honor as a unit or scale or measure of information. [[Alan Turing]] in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] ciphers.

Much of the mathematics behind information theory with events of different probabilities were developed for the field of [[thermodynamics]] by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[J. Willard Gibbs]].  Connections between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, including the important contributions by [[Rolf Landauer]] in the 1960s, are explored in ''[[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory]]''.

In Shannon's revolutionary and groundbreaking paper, the work for which had been substantially completed at Bell Labs by the end of 1944, Shannon for the first time introduced the qualitative and quantitative model of communication as a statistical process underlying information theory, opening with the assertion that
:"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point."

With it came the ideas of
* the [[information entropy]] and [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] of a source, and its relevance through the [[source coding theorem]];
* the [[mutual information]], and the [[channel capacity]] of a noisy channel, including the promise of perfect loss-free communication given by the [[noisy-channel coding theorem]];
* the practical result of the [[Shannon–Hartley law]] for the channel capacity of a [[Gaussian channel]]; as well as
* the [[bit]]—a new way of seeing the most fundamental unit of information.

==Quantities of information==
{{Main|Quantities of information}}

Information theory is based on [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]].  Information theory often concerns itself with measures of information of the distributions associated with random variables. Important quantities of information are [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]], a measure of information in a single [[random variable]], and [[mutual information]], a measure of information in common between two random variables.  The former quantity is a property of the probability distribution of a random variable and gives a limit on the rate at which data generated by independent samples with the given distribution can be reliably [[data compression|compressed]]. The latter is a property of the joint distribution of two random variables, and is the maximum rate of reliable communication across a noisy [[Communication channel|channel]] in the limit of long block lengths, when the channel statistics are determined by the joint distribution.

The choice of logarithmic base in the following formulae determines the [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[information entropy]] that is used.  A common unit of information is the [[bit]], based on the [[binary logarithm]]. Other units include the [[nat (unit)|nat]], which is based on the [[natural logarithm]], and the [[deciban|decimal digit]], which is based on the [[common logarithm]].

In what follows, an expression of the form {{math|''p'' log ''p''}} is considered by convention to be equal to zero whenever {{math|1=''p'' = 0}}.  This is justified because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{p \rightarrow 0+} p \log p = 0&lt;/math&gt; for any logarithmic base.

===Entropy of an information source===
Based on the [[probability mass function]] of each source symbol to be communicated, the Shannon [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] {{math|''H''}}, in units of bits (per symbol), is given by
:&lt;math&gt;H = - \sum_{i} p_i \log_2 (p_i)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the probability of occurrence of the {{math|''i''}}-th possible value of the source symbol. This equation gives the entropy in the units of "bits" (per symbol) because it uses a logarithm of base 2, and this base-2 measure of entropy has sometimes been called the "[[Shannon (unit)|shannon]]" in his honor. Entropy is also commonly computed using the [[natural logarithm]] (base [[E (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]], where {{mvar|e}} is [[Euler's number]]), which produces a measurement of entropy in "[[nat (unit)|nats]]" per symbol and sometimes simplifies the analysis by avoiding the need to include extra constants in the formulas. Other bases are also possible, but less commonly used. For example, a logarithm of base {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256}} will produce a measurement in [[byte]]s per symbol, and a logarithm of base 10 will produce a measurement in decimal digits (or hartleys) per symbol.

Intuitively, the entropy {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of a discrete random variable {{math|''X''}} is a measure of the amount of ''uncertainty'' associated with the value of {{math|''X''}} when only its distribution is known.

The entropy of a source that emits a sequence of {{math|''N''}} symbols that are [[independent and identically distributed]] (iid) is {{math|''N&amp;middot;H''}} bits (per message of {{math|''N''}} symbols). If the source data symbols are identically distributed but not independent, the entropy of a message of length {{math|''N''}} will be less than {{math|''N''·''H''}}.

[[File:Binary entropy plot.svg|thumbnail|right|200px|The entropy of a [[Bernoulli trial]] as a function of success probability, often called the ''[[binary entropy function]]'', {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')}}.  The entropy is maximized at 1 bit per trial when the two possible outcomes are equally probable, as in an unbiased coin toss.]]

If one transmits 1000 bits (0s and 1s), and the value of each of these bits is known to the receiver (has a specific value with certainty) ahead of transmission, it is clear that no information is transmitted.  If, however, each bit is independently equally likely to be 0 or 1, 1000 shannons of information (more often called bits) have been transmitted.  Between these two extremes, information can be quantified as follows. If  	𝕏 is the set of all messages {{math|{{mset|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} that {{math|''X''}} could be, and {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is the probability of some &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb X&lt;/math&gt;, then the entropy, {{math|''H''}}, of {{math|''X''}} is defined:&lt;ref name = Reza&gt;{{cite book | title = An Introduction to Information Theory | author = Fazlollah M. Reza | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc., New York | origyear = 1961| year = 1994 | isbn = 0-486-68210-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RtzpRAiX6OgC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=intitle:%22An+Introduction+to+Information+Theory%22++%22entropy+of+a+simple+source%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H(X) = \mathbb{E}_{X} [I(x)] = -\sum_{x \in \mathbb{X}} p(x) \log p(x).&lt;/math&gt;

(Here, {{math|''I''(''x'')}} is the [[self-information]], which is the entropy contribution of an individual message, and {{math|𝔼&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[expected value]].) A property of entropy is that it is maximized when all the messages in the message space are equiprobable {{math|1=''p''(''x'') = 1/''n''}}; i.e., most unpredictable, in which case {{math|1=''H''(''X'') = log ''n''}}.

The special case of information entropy for a random variable with two outcomes is the ''[[binary entropy function]]'', usually taken to the logarithmic base 2, thus having the shannon (Sh) as unit:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{b}}(p) = - p \log_2 p - (1-p)\log_2 (1-p).&lt;/math&gt;

===Joint entropy===
The ''[[joint entropy]]'' of two discrete random variables {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} is merely the entropy of their pairing: {{math|(''X'', ''Y'')}}.  This implies that if {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are [[statistical independence|independent]], then their joint entropy is the sum of their individual entropies.

For example, if {{math|(''X'', ''Y'')}} represents the position of a [[chess]] piece — {{math|''X''}} the row and {{math|''Y''}} the column, then the joint entropy of the row of the piece and the column of the piece will be the entropy of the position of the piece.

:&lt;math&gt;H(X, Y) = \mathbb{E}_{X,Y} [-\log p(x,y)] = - \sum_{x, y} p(x, y) \log p(x, y) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Despite similar notation, joint entropy should not be confused with ''[[cross entropy]]''.

===Conditional entropy (equivocation)===
The ''[[conditional entropy]]'' or ''conditional uncertainty'' of {{math|''X''}} given random variable {{math|''Y''}} (also called the ''equivocation'' of {{math|''X''}} about {{math|''Y''}}) is the average conditional entropy over {{math|''Y''}}:&lt;ref name=Ash&gt;{{cite book | title = Information Theory | author = Robert B. Ash | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc. | origyear = 1965| year = 1990 | isbn = 0-486-66521-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ngZhvUfF0UIC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=intitle:information+intitle:theory+inauthor:ash+conditional+uncertainty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H(X|Y) = \mathbb E_Y [H(X|y)] = -\sum_{y \in Y} p(y) \sum_{x \in X} p(x|y) \log p(x|y) = -\sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log p(x|y).&lt;/math&gt;

Because entropy can be conditioned on a random variable or on that random variable being a certain value, care should be taken not to confuse these two definitions of conditional entropy, the former of which is in more common use.  A basic property of this form of conditional entropy is that:

: &lt;math&gt; H(X|Y) = H(X,Y) - H(Y) .\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Mutual information (transinformation)===
''[[Mutual information]]'' measures the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another.  It is important in communication where it can be used to maximize the amount of information shared between sent and received signals.  The mutual information of {{math|''X''}} relative to {{math|''Y''}} is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = \mathbb{E}_{X,Y} [SI(x,y)] = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)\, p(y)}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|SI}} (''S''pecific mutual ''I''nformation) is the [[pointwise mutual information]].

A basic property of the mutual information is that
: &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y).\,&lt;/math&gt;
That is, knowing ''Y'', we can save an average of {{math|''I''(''X''; ''Y'')}} bits in encoding ''X'' compared to not knowing ''Y''.

Mutual information is [[symmetric function|symmetric]]:
: &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = I(Y;X) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Mutual information can be expressed as the average [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] (information gain) between the [[posterior probability|posterior probability distribution]] of ''X'' given the value of ''Y'' and the [[prior probability|prior distribution]] on ''X'':
: &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p(y)} [D_{\mathrm{KL}}( p(X|Y=y) \| p(X) )].&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, this is a measure of how much, on the average, the probability distribution on ''X'' will change if we are given the value of ''Y''.  This is often recalculated as the divergence from the product of the marginal distributions to the actual joint distribution:
: &lt;math&gt;I(X; Y) = D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p(X,Y) \| p(X)p(Y)).&lt;/math&gt;

Mutual information is closely related to the [[likelihood-ratio test|log-likelihood ratio test]] in the context of contingency tables and the [[multinomial distribution]] and to [[Pearson's chi-squared test|Pearson's χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test]]: mutual information can be considered a statistic for assessing independence between a pair of variables, and has a well-specified asymptotic distribution.

===Kullback–Leibler divergence (information gain)===
The ''[[Kullback–Leibler divergence]]'' (or ''information divergence'', ''information gain'', or ''relative entropy'') is a way of comparing two distributions: a "true" [[probability distribution]] ''p(X)'', and an arbitrary probability distribution ''q(X)''. If we compress data in a manner that assumes ''q(X)'' is the distribution underlying some data, when, in reality, ''p(X)'' is the correct distribution, the Kullback–Leibler divergence is the number of average additional bits per datum necessary for compression.  It is thus defined

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p(X) \| q(X)) = \sum_{x \in X} -p(x) \log {q(x)} \, - \, \sum_{x \in X} -p(x) \log {p(x)} = \sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Although it is sometimes used as a 'distance metric', KL divergence is not a true [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] since it is not symmetric and does not satisfy the [[triangle inequality]] (making it a semi-quasimetric).

Another interpretation of the KL divergence is the "unnecessary surprise" introduced by a prior from the truth: suppose a number ''X'' is about to be drawn randomly from a discrete set with probability distribution ''p(x)''.  If Alice knows the true distribution ''p(x)'', while Bob believes (has a [[prior probability|prior]]) that the distribution is ''q(x)'', then Bob will be more [[Self-information|surprised]] than Alice, on average, upon seeing the value of ''X''.  The KL divergence is the (objective) expected value of Bob's (subjective) [[surprisal]] minus Alice's surprisal, measured in bits if the ''log'' is in base 2.  In this way, the extent to which Bob's prior is "wrong" can be quantified in terms of how "unnecessarily surprised" it is expected to make him.

===Other quantities===
Other important information theoretic quantities include [[Rényi entropy]] (a generalization of entropy), [[differential entropy]] (a generalization of quantities of information to continuous distributions), and the [[conditional mutual information]].

==Coding theory==
{{Main|Coding theory}}

[[File:CDSCRATCHES.jpg|thumb|right|A picture showing scratches on the readable surface of a CD-R.  Music and data CDs are coded using error correcting codes and thus can still be read even if they have minor scratches using [[error detection and correction]].]]

[[Coding theory]] is one of the most important and direct applications of information theory. It can be subdivided into [[data compression|source coding]] theory and [[error correction|channel coding]] theory. Using a statistical description for data, information theory quantifies the number of bits needed to describe the data, which is the information entropy of the source.

* Data compression (source coding): There are two formulations for the compression problem:
*[[lossless data compression]]: the data must be reconstructed exactly;
*[[lossy data compression]]: allocates bits needed to reconstruct the data, within a specified fidelity level measured by a distortion function. This subset of information theory is called ''[[rate–distortion theory]]''.
* Error-correcting codes (channel coding): While data compression removes as much [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] as possible, an error correcting code adds just the right kind of redundancy (i.e., [[error correction]]) needed to transmit the data efficiently and faithfully across a noisy channel.

This division of coding theory into compression and transmission is justified by the information transmission theorems, or source–channel separation theorems that justify the use of bits as the universal currency for information in many contexts. However, these theorems only hold in the situation where one transmitting user wishes to communicate to one receiving user. In scenarios with more than one transmitter (the multiple-access channel), more than one receiver (the [[broadcast channel]]) or intermediary "helpers" (the [[relay channel]]), or more general [[computer network|networks]], compression followed by transmission may no longer be optimal. [[Network information theory]] refers to these multi-agent communication models.

===Source theory===
Any process that generates successive messages can be considered a ''[[Communication source|source]]'' of information.  A memoryless source is one in which each message is an [[Independent identically distributed random variables|independent identically distributed random variable]], whereas the properties of [[ergodic theory|ergodicity]] and [[stationary process|stationarity]] impose less restrictive constraints.  All such sources are [[stochastic process|stochastic]].  These terms are well studied in their own right outside information theory.

====Rate====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Channel capacity]] --&gt;
Information ''[[Entropy rate|rate]]'' is the average entropy per symbol.  For memoryless sources, this is merely the entropy of each symbol, while, in the case of a stationary stochastic process, it is

:&lt;math&gt;r = \lim_{n \to \infty} H(X_n|X_{n-1},X_{n-2},X_{n-3}, \ldots);&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the conditional entropy of a symbol given all the previous symbols generated.  For the more general case of a process that is not necessarily stationary, the ''average rate'' is

:&lt;math&gt;r = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} H(X_1, X_2, \dots X_n);&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the limit of the joint entropy per symbol.  For stationary sources, these two expressions give the same result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Compression for Multimedia: Principles and Standards | author = Jerry D. Gibson | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | year = 1998 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqQ2Ry6spu0C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=entropy-rate+conditional#PPA57,M1 | isbn = 1-55860-369-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common in information theory to speak of the "rate" or "entropy" of a language.  This is appropriate, for example, when the source of information is English prose.  The rate of a source of information is related to its [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] and how well it can be [[data compression|compressed]], the subject of ''source coding''.

===Channel capacity===
{{Main|Channel capacity}}

Communications over a channel—such as an [[ethernet]] [[Electrical cable|cable]]—is the primary motivation of information theory.  As anyone who's ever used a telephone (mobile or landline) knows, however, such channels often fail to produce exact reconstruction of a signal; noise, periods of silence, and other forms of signal corruption often degrade quality.

Consider the communications process over a discrete channel. A simple model of the process is shown below:


[[File:Channel model.svg|center|800px|Channel model]]


Here ''X'' represents the space of messages transmitted, and ''Y'' the space of messages received during a unit time over our channel. Let {{math|''p''(''y''{{pipe}}''x'')}} be the [[conditional probability]] distribution function of ''Y'' given ''X''. We will consider {{math|''p''(''y''{{pipe}}''x'')}} to be an inherent fixed property of our communications channel (representing the nature of the ''[[Signal noise|noise]]'' of our channel). Then the joint distribution of ''X'' and ''Y'' is completely determined by our channel and by our choice of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, the marginal distribution of messages we choose to send over the channel. Under these constraints, we would like to maximize the rate of information, or the ''[[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]'', we can communicate over the channel. The appropriate measure for this is the [[mutual information]], and this maximum mutual information is called the ''[[channel capacity]]'' and is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; C = \max_{f} I(X;Y).\! &lt;/math&gt;
This capacity has the following property related to communicating at information rate ''R'' (where ''R'' is usually bits per symbol).  For any information rate ''R &lt; C'' and coding error ε &gt; 0, for large enough ''N'', there exists a code of length ''N'' and rate ≥ R and a decoding algorithm, such that the maximal probability of block error is ≤ ε; that is, it is always possible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error.  In addition, for any rate ''R &amp;gt; C'', it is impossible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error.

''[[Channel code|Channel coding]]'' is concerned with finding such nearly optimal [[error detection and correction|codes]] that can be used to transmit data over a noisy channel with a small coding error at a rate near the channel capacity.

====Capacity of particular channel models====
* A continuous-time analog communications channel subject to [[Gaussian noise]] — see [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]].
* A [[binary symmetric channel]] (BSC) with crossover probability ''p'' is a binary input, binary output channel that flips the input bit with probability ''p''. The BSC has a capacity of {{math|1 &amp;minus; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')}} bits per channel use, where {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[binary entropy function]] to the base-2 logarithm:

* A [[binary erasure channel]] (BEC) with erasure probability ''p'' is a binary input, ternary output channel. The possible channel outputs are 0, 1, and a third symbol 'e' called an erasure. The erasure represents complete loss of information about an input bit. The capacity of the BEC is {{nowrap|1 &amp;minus; ''p''}} bits per channel use.

==Applications to other fields==

===Intelligence uses and secrecy applications===
Information theoretic concepts apply to [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]].  [[Turing]]'s information unit, the [[Ban (unit)|ban]], was used in the [[Ultra]] project, breaking the German [[Enigma machine]] code and hastening the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of World War II in Europe]].  Shannon himself defined an important concept now called the [[unicity distance]]. Based on the [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] of the [[plaintext]], it attempts to give a minimum amount of [[ciphertext]] necessary to ensure unique decipherability.

Information theory leads us to believe it is much more difficult to keep secrets than it might first appear.  A [[brute force attack]] can break systems based on [[public-key cryptography|asymmetric key algorithms]] or on most commonly used methods of [[symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key algorithms]] (sometimes called secret key algorithms), such as [[block cipher]]s.  The security of all such methods currently comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time.

[[Information theoretic security]] refers to methods such as the [[one-time pad]] that are not vulnerable to such brute force attacks.  In such cases, the positive conditional [[mutual information]] between the [[plaintext]] and [[ciphertext]] (conditioned on the [[key (cryptography)|key]]) can ensure proper transmission, while the unconditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext remains zero, resulting in absolutely secure communications.  In other words, an eavesdropper would not be able to improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key. However, as in any other cryptographic system, care must be used to correctly apply even information-theoretically secure methods; the [[Venona project]] was able to crack the one-time pads of the Soviet Union due to their improper reuse of key material.

===Pseudorandom number generation===
[[Pseudorandom number generator]]s are widely available in computer language libraries and application programs. They are, almost universally, unsuited to cryptographic use as they do not evade the deterministic nature of modern computer equipment and software. A class of improved random number generators is termed [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]s, but even they require [[random seed]]s external to the software to work as intended. These can be obtained via [[Extractor (mathematics)|extractors]], if done carefully. The measure of  sufficient randomness in extractors is [[min-entropy]], a value related to Shannon entropy through [[Rényi entropy]]; Rényi entropy is also used in evaluating randomness in cryptographic systems.  Although related, the distinctions among these measures mean that a [[random variable]] with high Shannon entropy is not necessarily satisfactory for use in an extractor and so for cryptography uses.

===Seismic exploration===
One early commercial application of information theory was in the field of seismic oil exploration. Work in this field made it possible to strip off and separate the unwanted noise from the desired seismic signal. Information theory and [[digital signal processing]] offer a major improvement of resolution and image clarity over previous analog methods.&lt;ref&gt;The Corporation and Innovation, Haggerty, Patrick, Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 2, 97-118 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiotics===
[[Semiotics|Semioticians]] [[:nl:Doede Nauta|Doede Nauta]] and [[Winfried Nöth]] both considered [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] as having created a theory of information in his works on semiotics.&lt;ref name="Nauta 1972"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Nauta |first1=Doede |title=The Meaning of Information |date=1972 |publisher=Mouton |location=The Hague |isbn=9789027919960}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171}}&lt;ref name="Nöth 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Nöth |first1=Winfried |title=Charles S. Peirce's theory of information: a theory of the growth of symbols and of knowledge |journal=Cybernetics and Human Knowing |date=January 2012 |volume=19 |issue=1–2 |pages=137–161 |url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/mod/resource/view.php?id=2311849}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|137}} Nauta defined semiotic information theory as the study of "the internal processes of coding, filtering, and information processing."&lt;ref name="Nauta 1972"/&gt;{{rp|91}}

Concepts from information theory such as redundancy and code control have been used by semioticians such as [[Umberto Eco]] and [[:it:Ferruccio Rossi-Landi|Ferruccio Rossi-Landi]] to explain ideology as a form of message transmission whereby a dominant social class emits its message by using signs that exhibit a high degree of redundancy such that only one message is decoded among a selection of competing ones.&lt;ref&gt;Nöth, Winfried (1981). "Semiotics of ideology". ''Semiotica'', Issue 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous applications===
Information theory also has applications in [[Gambling and information theory|gambling and investing]], [[black hole information paradox|black holes]], and [[bioinformatics]].

The '''International Society for Computational Biology Student Council''' (ISCB-SC) is a dedicated section of the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] created in 2004. It is composed by students from all levels ([[Undergraduate degree|undergraduates]], [[Postgraduate education|postgraduates]], and [[postdoctoral researcher]]s) in the fields of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]]. The organisation promotes the development of the students' community worldwide by organizing different events including [[Academic conference|symposia]], [[workshop]]s, [[webinar]]s, [[internship]] coordination and [[hackathon]]s. A special focus is made on the development of [[soft skills]] in order to develop potential in bioinformatics and computational biology students around the world.

The ISCB-SC is composed of Regional Student Groups (RSGs) which are located in various regions across the [[globe]]. Since its foundation, the ISCB-SC has gained representation in most continents through over thirty RSGs which collectively represent more than 1,000 students and researchers around the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== History ==
The ISCB Student Council was officially established in 2004 by a vote from the ISCB Board of Directors at the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology|ISMB]]/[[European Conference on Computational Biology|ECCB]] meeting. The concept of the student council was first proposed by [[Manuel Corpas (Scientist)|Manuel Corpas]] in late 2003. The establishment of the student council was the first move of the ISCB to include the new generation of computational biologists into the, then newly emerging, field.&lt;ref name="ISCBHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the ISCB|url=http://www.iscb.org/iscb-history|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first-exec-cmte"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISCB Newsletter 7-3|url=https://www.iscb.org/images/stories/newsletter/newsletter7-3/council.html|website=www.iscb.org|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting had about 30 students and eight members of the ISCB leadership at the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] (ISMB) 2005 in Detroit, Michigan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corpas|first1=Manuel|title=Graduate students band together to foster communication|journal=Nature|date=24 August 2005|volume=436|issue=1204|doi=10.1038/nj7054-1204b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first official Student Council Symposium (SCS) was held later that year at the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB) meeting in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The first SCS had approximately 100 attendees and was the beginning of a long-running series of meetings organized and highlighting students.&lt;ref name="ISCBHistory" /&gt; Other than the first instance of SCS, all later editions have as a satellite meeting of ISMB. In 2012, the SC started a second set of symposia that takes place at ECCB when it is not co-located with ISMB; the European Student Council Symposium (ESCS) regularly has more attendees than SCS when both events are held in the same year. Recently, the SC symposia have also been held along with other ISCB conferences like the case for the Latin American Student Council Symposium (LA-SCS) which is held every two years along with the Latin American ISCB Conference since 2014 &lt;ref name=Parra2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parra RG, Simonetti FL, Hasenahuer MA, Olguin-Orellana G, Shanmugam AK | title=Highlights from the 1st ISCB Latin American Student Council Symposium 2014. | pmc=4423572 |journal= BMC Bioinformatics |year=2015 |pmid=25955751 |volume=16 Suppl 8 |page=A1 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-16-s8-a1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ISCB Student Council Symposium in Africa (SCS-Africa) which is held along the ISCB Africa ASBCB conference since 2015.&lt;ref name=Souilmi2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Souilmi Y, Allali I, Badad O, Dwibedi CK | title= Highlights of the first ISCB Student Council Symposium in Africa 2015 | url= https://f1000research.com/articles/4-569/v1 |journal= F1000Res. |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional student groups==
In 2006, the student council created the Regional Student Group (RSG) initiative to tailor the efforts of the council for the local community.&lt;ref name="rsg_page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsg.iscbsc.org|title=ISCB-SC RSGs|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macintyre|first=Geoff|year=2013|title=The Regional Student Group Program of the ISCB Student Council: Stories from the Road|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003241}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSGs are locally managed groups established at various regions. Each RSG operates either under the aegis of a [[higher education]] institution or as an independent organisation sub-affiliated to local computational biology or bioinformatics organisation. RSGs are provided support from both the student council and other local groups in their region and often organize multi-RSG events such as BeNeLuxFra. {{As of|2017}}, the global network of the student council includes over 25 active RSGs operating across five continents.

The RSG committee was set up in 2008 to oversee and coordinates the activities of RSGs across the world. The team comprises an RSG-Chair, a co-chair and five vice-chairs corresponding to geographical regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Latin America and USA-Canada). The RSG chair is required to have previous experience as a president or secretary of an RSG. Currently, around 2,000 students and researchers are active members of RSG-related events.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The ISCB-SC continuously looks for PhD students or postdocs who may be interested in starting a new RSG in a region where the student council has no presence yet. The student council also supports existing RSGs by advising them on how to grow, in terms of the events and projects they face as well as economically. There are 3 funding calls every year where RSGs can submit proposals containing different types of events which will be evaluated by the continental RSG chairs and the Executive Committee. Since the creation of the Student Council ''[[Faculty of 1000|F1000Research]]'' channel&lt;ref name="f1000res-sc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles from channel ISCB Student Council - F1000Research|url=https://f1000research.com/channels/studentcouncil|website=f1000research.com|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016, achievements by RSGs throughout each year are discussed in editorial articles.&lt;ref name=Shome2016&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shome Sayane |author2=Meysman Pieter |author3=Parra R. Gonzalo |author4=Monzon Alexander Miguel |author5=Palopoli Nicolas |author6=White Benjamen |author7=Rahman Farzana |author8=Hassan Mehedi |author9=Ozkeserli Zeynep |author10=Ashano Efejiro |author11=Hughitt V.

The ISCB-SC runs an internship program in which researchers throughout the world can offer a place for a student from a developing nation to join his/her group for a period of time. This program aims to give students from developing nations the opportunity to have an experience in a working environment from first class research groups and interact with expert Principal Investigators around the world.&lt;ref name="intern"&gt;{{cite web|title=Internship Program {{!}} ISCB Student Council|url=http://www.iscbsc.org/content/internships-0|website=www.iscbsc.org|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Press ==
As a worldwide organization, the SC organizes symposia, workshops and different events across the globe. After more than ten years of existence, many new experiences have been gained on how to deal with different obstacles that arise when trying to tackle complex objectives. Learning experiences are published as articles that aim to help new RSGs, as well as other student organizations, including bioinformatics communities, to organize their own events and strengthen their growth.

=== Student Council Outreach Publications ===
Since its conception, the ISCB Student Council has not only advocated for the students in the [[ISCB]] and beyond&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISCB-SC Stands with all Scientists|url=http://iscbsc.org/iscbsc_stands_with_scientists|date=Feb 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, also, the SC has made lots of efforts to help educate new students.

In 2014, the ISCB Student Council began publishing a collection of articles in the ''[[PLOS]]'' journals that covers details about the development of the SC and how to advance in the field.&lt;ref name="PLoS_Articles"&gt;{{cite web|title=PLoS Collections|url=http://collections.plos.org/iscb-student-council}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a collective effort because of reaching a decade of story, different Student Council leaders from different regions in the world, came together and published 12 articles as part of the "Stories from the road: ISCB Student Council Collection" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stories from the road: SCB Student Council Collection|url=http://collections.plos.org/iscb-student-council}}&lt;/ref&gt; that summarize the experience and lessons that were learned through those years. These articles range in topic from starting and expanding your scientific network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Breaking the Ice and Forging Links: The Importance of Socializing in Research|first1=Miranda|last1=Stobbe|first2=et|last2=al.|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003355|date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Establishing and Managing a Global Student Network|first1=Avinash|last1=Shanmugam|first2=Geoff|last2=Macintyre|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003920|date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with the frustration of failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title= The Upside of Failure: How Regional Student Groups Learn from Their Mistakes|first1=Tarum|last1=Mishra|first2=R.

In particular, the article "Explain Bioinformatics to Your Grandmother!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Explain Bioinformatics to Your Grandmother!|first1=Virginie|last1=Bernard|first2=Magali|last2=Michaut|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003305|date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to simplify the answer to the question "What is bioinformatics?" to non-scientists, has accumulated more than 17,000 views (as of 2017) and constitutes one of the most read articles in ''[[PLOS Computational Biology]]''.

The Student Council also has its own article channel on ''F1000Research'' which features publications highlighting the activities of the council.&lt;ref name="f1000res-sc" /&gt;

In addition to the collections in F1000 and PLOS, the Student Council has publications that have appeared in ''[[BMC Bioinformatics]]'' and other journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications|url=http://iscbsc.org/content/publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
The student council organizes several symposia each year to coincide with the major [[ISCB]] Conferences&lt;ref&gt;[http://iscbsc.org/scs-previous-symposiums Previous ISCB-SC Symposia]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Student Council Symposium (SCS) is held each year directly preceding ISMB (or ISMB/ECCB). The symposium has been organised each year since 2005.
* The European Student Council Symposium (ESCS) is a biennial symposium that takes place preceding the ECCB (when ECCB is not co-located with ISMB). It has been held since 2010.
* The Latin American Student Council Symposium (LA-SCS) is held in even-numbered years directly preceding [[ISCB-LA]]. The LA-SCS has been held every other year since 2014.
* The African Student Council Symposium (SCS Africa) is held preceding the [[ISCB Africa ASBCB Conference on Bioinformatics]] since 2015.

In addition to the main ISCB-SC events that accompany the main ISCB conference(s), RSGs also hold events on a regular basis;&lt;ref name="rsg-events"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Regional Student Groups in 2016 {{!}} ISCB Student Council|url=http://iscbsc.org/node/196|website=iscbsc.org|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; these include annual events in Argentina,&lt;ref name="Parra2016" /&gt; Germany&lt;ref name="germany-symp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ibn-Salem|first1=Jonas|last2=Meiers|first2=Sascha|last3=Eigenbrod|first3=Ole|last4=Sehlke|first4=Robert|last5=Talyan|first5=Sweta|last6=Schwahn|first6=Kevin|last7=Otto|first7=Raik|last8=Pataskar|first8=Abhijeet|last9=Metge|first9=Franziska|last10=Angerer|first10=Philipp|title=Highlights of the 1st Student Symposium on Computational Genomics|url=https://genomicscomputbiol.org/ojs/index.php/GCB/article/view/59|website=Genomics and Computational Biology|accessdate=21 May 2017|pages=59|language=en|doi=10.18547/gcb.2016.vol2.iss1.e59|date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Farzana|last2=Farmer|first2=Rohit|last3=Das|first3=Sayoni|last4=Vayani|first4=Fatima|last5=Hassan|first5=Mehedi|date=2015-06-16|title=Highlights of the 1st Student Symposium of the ISCB RSG UK|url=http://f1000research.com/articles/4-154/v1|journal=F1000Research|volume=4|doi=10.12688/f1000research.6616.1|pmc=4786907|pmid=26998223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Benjamen|last2=Fatima|first2=Vayani|last3=Fatima|first3=Nazeefa|last4=Das|first4=Sayoni|last5=Rahman|first5=Farzana|last6=Hassan|first6=Mehedi|date=2016-05-17|title=Highlights of the 2nd Bioinformatics Student Symposium by ISCB RSG-UK|url=http://f1000research.com/articles/5-902/v1|journal=F1000Research|volume=5|doi=10.12688/f1000research.8445.1|pmc=4870987|pmid=27239284|page=902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committees ==
Every year, ISCB and SC members elect new leadership positions. The positions are filled by students and/or postdoctoral members of the SC. The key mission of the SC's Executive Team is to lead the sustainable development of the organisation and its RSGs, and managing the coordination of all activities.

In addition, the SC aims to coordinate and integrate efforts of all members and volunteers who contribute their time. For the purpose of better organizational structure, the SC has established several committees that are chaired by SC members and managed by the executive team.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16359">The '''international trade of fine art''' is most precisely defined as the trade across nations of unique, non-reproducible works by an artist.  The art trade contradicts typical international trade models since it is a culturally significant good.  It is not treated by consumers the same way any other commodity would because of the aesthetic value that is unique to each piece.  Despite existing as a finite physical piece, unique art is still considered intellectual property. This sparks the debate as to whether art exports should be restricted for nationalistic and cultural reasons, or liberalized for the sake of a healthier international market.

==Decorative art as a trade commodity==

The trade commodities included in the definition of "[[visual art]]" include the following: [[painting]], drawing, [[sculpture]] in various materials, [[printmaking]], [[photography]], maps, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], [[mail art]], [[assemblage art]], [[textile arts]], [[fashion design]], [[video art]], [[digital art]], and product design.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; These works are non-functional, emotional, social, political, traditional, and cultural statements, and in comparison to other goods, are not greatly affected by commercial-sector constraints.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Though visual art is a physical, hand-made good, it is often culturally rooted and created for aesthetic appeal.  Therefore, art is considered [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

The 4-digit [[Standard International Trade Classification]] (SITC) classifies "Works of Art, Collectors Pieces and Antiques" under category 8960, which includes paintings, drawings, pastels, original sculptures, original prints, stamps, and antiques over 100 years old. This is the only SITC category that consists of unique, non-reproducible art, which is typically thought of as "fine" art.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The 4-digit [[Harmonized System|harmonized commodity]] description and coding system, otherwise known as the harmonized system (HS) code for "fine" art is 9701, which is classified as "Paintings, Drawings and Pastels, Executed Entirely By Hand".&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

==History of international art trade==

The earliest known regulation of cultural property dates to 1464, when [[Pope Pius II]] prohibited the exportation of works of art from the Papal States.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; It wasn’t until the mid-1500s that any sizable amount of formal artwork was transferred between nations in licit markets.  Previously, local demand had satisfied the supply of artwork, but it couldn’t keep up as the number of artists increased.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;  Consequently, artists exported their works to foreign markets.  Between 1540 and 1670, an average of 144 paintings per year were transported between the [[Netherlands]] and [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Throughout much of the [[early modern period]], if an artist could not domestically sell his art, he sold it instead to dealers who exported the works abroad.  Starting in the 17th Century, however, most art was traded at the massive auction houses of [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]] of London, which both still survive today.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Like any other traded good, art has been historically subjected to import duties.  For example, in the more enlightened years of the 19th Century, art escaped high tariffs in America because the government viewed art as an important cultural good.   At other times, though, tariff revenue was considered more important than free intellectual property.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], neutral [[Switzerland]] became the primary trafficker of art on the European continent.  Most "degenerate" works of art that the [[Nazi]] government purged from German museums were sold there, where they largely entered [[black markets]].  Since the war ended, there has been a massive, ongoing effort to recover all of these works.  For fifteen years following the war, 45,000 pieces were returned to France, mostly to Jewish owners.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Today, almost every country in the world has restrictions and regulations on the export of cultural property.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;  Currently, most art auctions are facilitated on online sites such as [[eBay]] and [http://Lauritz.com/ Lauritz.com].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

==Economic theory of art trade==

Fine art proves complicated for economists to analyze, mostly because trade in unique art is in large part trade between consumers – the "secondary market" – rather than the "primary market" trade between the producer (artist) and the consumer.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;  For example, when a museum buys a sculpture from a private collector, the exchange is between two consumers and considered a transaction in the secondary market because neither of them produced the sculpture.  It is more complicated for economists, then, to capture these transactions in their data.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

[[Comparative advantage]] is also more difficult to pinpoint in the case of cultural goods.   There is a certain degree of cultural nationalism of art,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; making some nations reluctant to part with their cultural property.  Additionally, relative advantage cannot simply be calculated by the [[marginal cost]] of producing a unit of art, since aesthetic value plays so heavily into its price.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Trade theory demonstrates how much and at what price countries trade goods if they have different endowments or different preferences.  But this model is not very useful because of retentive nationalism:&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; a country that is relatively less endowed with art-producing resources will not stop producing simply because they can import art from abroad at cheaper prices.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

===Determination of prices===

Traditional trade theory treats art as a homogenous, non-differentiated good, which is where it fails to reliably predict trade trends.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Unique art is valued precisely because of its uniqueness.  Since each piece of art is different, and because each piece does not appear on the market very often, the determination of changes in market value prove difficult to determine.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Economists use the [[hedonic regression]] (HR) estimation method to calculate prices in art.  This is used to predict prices based on various attributes of the artwork such as its dimensions, the artist, and the subject matter attended to.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Protectionism vs. Liberalization==
 
[[Protectionism]] is a nationalistic viewpoint that contends that a healthy cultural industry is necessary to assert national sovereignty and identity.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;  Countries with small domestic markets are often overwhelmed by imports from larger markets in which producers can make up their costs of production by dumping content abroad.  America is the largest exporter of artwork in the world, and English speaking countries are especially vulnerable to American imports.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; Protectionists view this as a modern form of American [[imperialism]], which reduces cultural diversity when national industries are unable to compete.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

Protectionism is less concerned with direct economic interest as it is with preserving cultural integrity.  Australian economist [[David Throsby]] argues that investment in "cultural capital" may be necessary for the sustainability of a culture.&lt;ref name="twelve" /&gt; [[Paul M. Bator]], who helped negotiate and draft the [[UNESCO]] convention on the International Trade of Art, argues that larger countries are responsible for the cultural interests of smaller ones.  He explains in ''The International Trade in Art'' that "art-rich countries should create tax and other financial and psychological incentives to persuade those with important antiquities and archaeological objects to keep them at home".&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;


Proponents of [[Economic liberalization|liberalization]] in international art markets stress that open markets contribute to efficient production and distribution of cultural products.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; Reliance on competitive market forces also frees creative individuals from the hindrance of government oversight.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;   Many special characteristics of cultural products – the lack of rivalry in content, [[economies of scale]], and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration economies]] – enhance the case for opening markets.  Protection raises rather than lowers domestic prices, which detracts from consumer welfare.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The "[[commodification]] objection" is the reluctance to classify an important cultural good as a simple trade commodity, and is frequently cited by cultural protectionists.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;  Those who advocate openness believe that free-market nations can provide the most effective political force for development of an active market.  This argument diametrically opposes Bator’s: free-trade advocates contend that large countries are better suited to help smaller nations finance organization of their cultural resources for more effective participation in international trade.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The issue of the illicit art trade also factors into the debate.  In terms of value transferred, the illegal trafficking of art ranks in black market activities second only to narcotics.&lt;ref name="thirteeen" /&gt; More problematic than the actual theft of the work is its subsequent transport, which proves difficult to prosecute since most paintings are easily concealable. By maintaining an open market, liberalists argue that much of the illicit trade of art can be eliminated.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;

==Largest countries by total trade in art==

The following tables list the top world import/export values, according to data from the UN Comtrade database using SITC code 8960.  The sums here are greater than those included in HS 9701 (works done exclusively by hand) because the SITC classification includes works such as antiques, stamps, and sculpture that aren’t captured in the HS definition.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

[[Convergent evolution]] — the repeated evolution of similar traits in multiple lineages which all ancestrally lack the trait — is rife in nature, as illustrated by the examples below. The ultimate cause of convergence is usually a similar evolutionary [[biome]], as similar environments will select for similar traits in any species occupying the same ecological niche, even if those species are only distantly related. In the case of [[cryptic species]], it can create species which are only distinguishable by analysing their genetics.  Unrelated organisms often develop [[analogous structures]] by adapting to similar environments.

==In animals==
[[File:Beutelwolf fg01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The skulls of the [[thylacine]] (left) and the grey wolf, ''[[Canis lupus]]'', are similar, although the species are only very distantly related (different [[infraclass]]es). The skull shape of the red fox, ''[[Vulpes vulpes]]'', is even closer to that of the thylacine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|volume=34|issue=2|year=1986|pages=109–117|title=Comparison of Skull Shape in Marsupial and Placental Carnivores|author= L Werdelin|doi=10.1071/ZO9860109}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Mammals ===

* Several groups of [[ungulate]]s have independently reduced or lost side digits on their feet, often leaving one or two digits for walking. That name comes from their hooves, which have evolved from claws several times. Among familiar animals, [[horse]]s have one walking digit and [[cattle|domestic bovine]]s two on each foot. Various other land vertebrates have also reduced or lost digits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donaldprothero.com/files/47440214.pdf The phylogeny of the ungulates - Donald Prothero]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly, [[laurasiathere]] [[perissodactyl]]s and [[afrothere]] [[paenungulate]]s have several features in common, to the point of there being no obvious distinction among basal taxa of both groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gheerbrant | first1 = Emmanuel | last2 = Filippo | first2 = Andrea | last3 = Schmitt | first3 = Arnaud | year = 2016 | title = Convergence of Afrotherian and Laurasiatherian Ungulate-Like Mammals: First Morphological Evidence from the Paleocene of Morocco | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 7| page = e0157556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0157556 | pmid=27384169 | pmc=4934866| bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1157556G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[pronghorn]] of [[North America]], while not a true [[antelope]] and only distantly related to them, closely resembles the true antelopes of the [[Old World]], both behaviorally and morphologically. It also fills a similar ecological niche and is found in the same [[biome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcnj.edu/~hofmann/Pronghorn.htm tcnj.edu, ANTELOPE Vs. PRONGHORN]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Members of the two clades [[Australosphenida]] and [[Theria]] evolved tribosphenic [[molar (tooth)|molars]] independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luo | first1 = Zhe-Xi | last2 = Cifelli | first2 = Richard L. | last3 = Kielan-Jaworowska | first3 = Zofia | year = 2001 | title = Dual origin of tribosphenic mammals | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6816| pages = 53–57 | doi = 10.1038/35051023 | pmid = 11343108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[marsupial]] [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf) had many resemblances to [[placental]] [[canids]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kyletaitt.scienceblog.com/2013/02/07/the-curious-evolutionary-history-of-the-marsupial-wolf/ The Curious Evolutionary History of the ‘Marsupial Wolf’ by Kyle Taitt]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Several mammal groups have independently evolved prickly protrusions of the skin – [[echidna]]s ([[monotreme]]s), the insectivorous [[hedgehog]]s, some [[tenrec]]s (a diverse group of shrew-like [[Madagascar|Madagascan]] mammals), [[Old World porcupine]]s ([[rodent]]s) and [[New World porcupine]]s (another biological family of rodents). In this case, because the two groups of porcupines are closely related, they would be considered to be examples of [[parallel evolution]]; however, neither echidnas, nor hedgehogs, nor tenrecs are close relatives of the Rodentia. In fact, the last common ancestor of all of these groups was a contemporary of the [[dinosaur]]s.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Zoology, Page 102, by Joseph Springer, Dennis Holley, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[eutriconodont]] [[Spinolestes]] that lived in the Early Cretaceous Period represents an even earlier example of a spined mammal, unrelated to any modern mammal group.
* [[Cat|Cat-like]] sabre-toothed predators evolved in three distinct lineages of mammals – [[carnivora]]ns like the [[sabre-toothed cat]]s, and [[nimravid]]s ("false" sabre-tooths), the [[sparassodont]] family [[Thylacosmilidae]] ("marsupial" sabre-tooths), the [[gorgonopsid]]s and the [[creodont]]s also developed long [[canine teeth]], but with no other particular physical similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Convergent Evolution: Limited Forms Most Beautiful, page 158, by George R. McGhee, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* A number of mammals have developed powerful fore claws and long, sticky tongues that allow them to open the homes of social insects (e.g., [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s) and consume them (myrmecophagy).  These include the four species of [[anteater]], more than a dozen [[armadillo]]s, eight species of [[pangolin]] (plus fossil species), eight species of the [[monotreme]] (egg-laying mammals) [[echidna]] (plus fossil species), the  ''[[Fruitafossor]]'' of the Late Jurassic, the marsupial [[numbat]], the African [[aardvark]], the [[aardwolf]], and possibly also the [[sloth bear]] of South Asia, all unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/15/science/when-nature-discovers-the-same-design-over-and-over.html When Nature Discovers The Same Design Over and Over, By NATALIE ANGIER, Published: December 15, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marsupial]] [[Koalas]] of [[Australia]] have evolved [[fingerprint]]s, indistinguishable from those of non-related [[primates]], such as humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A14608541 BBC, Koalas' Fingerprints]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Australian [[honey possum]]s acquired a long tongue for taking nectar from flowers, a structure similar to that of [[Lepidoptera|butterflies]], some moths, and hummingbirds, and used to accomplish the same task.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reellifescience.com/2013/10/16/convergent-evolution-are-dolphins-and-bats-more-related-than-we-think-by-cariosa-switzer/ Convergent EVOLUTION: "Are Dolphins and Bats more related than we think?" by Cariosa Switzer, October 16, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Microbat]]s, [[toothed whale]]s and [[shrew]]s developed [[sonar]]-like [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] systems used for orientation, obstacle avoidance and for locating prey. Modern DNA phylogenies of bats have shown that the traditional suborder of echolocating bats (Microchiroptera) is not a true clade, and instead some echolocating bats are more related to non-echolocating Old World fruit bats than to other echolocating species. The implication is that [[Animal echolocation#Bats|echolocation]] in at least two lineages of [[bat]]s, [[Megachiroptera]] and [[Microchiroptera]] has evolved independently or been lost in Old World fruit bats.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Carol Kaesuk.

Birds of both families are very big, search for food by soaring, circle over sighted carrion, flock in trees, and have unfeathered heads and necks.&lt;ref&gt;Vulture, By Thom van Dooren, page 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Swim bladder]]s: Buoyant bladders independently evolved in [[fish]]es, the [[tuberculate pelagic octopus]], and [[siphonophores]] such as the [[Portuguese man o' war]].&lt;ref&gt;"The illustration of the swim bladder in fishes is a good one, because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose, namely, flotation, may be converted into one for a widely different purpose, namely, respiration. The swim bladder has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fishes. All physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous, or "ideally similar" in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there is no reason to doubt that the swim bladder has actually been converted into lungs, or an organ used exclusively for respiration.  According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient and unknown prototype, which was furnished with a floating apparatus or swim bladder."

* [[Bivalve]]s and [[brachiopod]]s independently evolved paired hinged shells for protection.

Moreover, its amino acid sequence has no homology with other invertebrate myoglobins or with hemoglobins, but is 35% homologous with human [[Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase|indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO)]], a vertebrate tryptophan-degrading enzyme. It does not share similar function with IDO.

=== Structural convergence ===
Here is a list of examples in which unrelated proteins have similar tertiary structures but different functions. Whole protein structural convergence is not thought to occur but some convergence of pockets and secondary structural elements have been documented.

{{Marxism|Aspects}}

'''Marxist geography''' is a strand of [[critical geography]] that uses the theories and philosophy of [[Marxism]] to examine the [[Spatial analysis|spatial relations]] of [[human geography]]. In Marxist geography, the relations that geography has traditionally analyzed — natural environment and spatial relations — are reviewed as outcomes of the mode of material production. To understand geographical relations, on this view, the social structure must also be examined. Marxist geography attempts to change the basic structure of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peet |first1=J. Richard |title=An Introduction to Marxist Geography |journal=Journal of Geography |date=1985 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=5–10 |doi=10.1080/00221348508979261|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ312759&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ312759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and methodology==

Marxist geography is [[Political_radicalism|radical]] in nature and its primary criticism of the positivist [[spatial science]] centered on the latter's methodologies, which failed to consider the characteristics of [[capitalism]] and abuse that underlie socio-spatial arrangements. As such, early Marxist geographers were explicitly political in advocating for social change and activism; they sought, through application of geographical analysis of social problems, to alleviate [[poverty]] and exploitation in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David. 1973. "Social Justice and the City"&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist geography makes exegetical claims regarding how the deep-seated structures of capitalism act as a determinant and a constraint to human agency. Most of these ideas were developed in the early 1970s by dissatisfied quantitative geographers; [[David Harvey]] is generally regarded as the primary trail-blazer of the Marxist movement in human geography.

In order to accomplish such philosophical aims, these geographers rely heavily upon Marxist social and economic theory, drawing on [[Marxian economics]] and the methods of [[historical materialism]] to tease out the manner in which the means of [[production control]] human spatial distribution in capitalist structures. [[Karl Marx|Marx]] is also invoked to examine how spatial relationships are affected by [[social class|class]]. The emphasis is on structure and structural mechanisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1352">In mathematics, the '''max–min inequality''' is as follows:  for any function ''f'': ''Z'' × ''W'' → ℝ,
: &lt;math&gt;
\sup_{z \in Z} \inf_{w \in W} f(z, w) \leq \inf_{w \in W} \sup_{z \in Z} f(z, w).
&lt;/math&gt;

When equality holds one says that ''f'', ''W'' and ''Z'' satisfies a strong max–min property (or a [[saddle point|saddle-point]] property). As the function ''f''(''z'',''w'')=sin(''z''+''w'')  illustrates, this equality does not always hold. A theorem giving conditions on ''f'', ''W'' and ''Z'' in order to guarantee the saddle point property is called a [[minimax theorem]].

==Proof==
Define &lt;math&gt; g(z) \triangleq \inf_{w \in W} f(z, w) &lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow g(z) \leq f(z, w), \forall z \forall w &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow \sup_z g(z) \leq \sup_z f(z, w) , \forall w &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow \sup_z \inf_w f(z,w) \leq \sup_z f(z, w), \forall w &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow \sup_z \inf_w f(z,w) \leq \inf_w \sup_z f(z, w) \qquad \square&lt;/math&gt;

==Current technology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
Molecular processors are currently in their infancy and currently only a few exist. At present a basic molecular processor is any biological or chemical system that uses a [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA) template to form a long chain [[amino acid]] molecule. A key factor that differentiates molecular processors is "the ability to control output" of [[protein]] or [[peptide]] concentration as a function of time. Simple formation of a molecule becomes the task of a chemical reaction, bioreactor or other polymerization technology. Current molecular processors take advantage of cellular processes to produce amino acide based proteins and peptides. The formation of a molecular processor currently involves integrating cDNA into the [[genome]] and should not replicate and re-insert, or be defined as a [[virus]] after insertion. Current molecular processors are replication incompetent, non-communicable and cannot be transmitted from cell to cell, animal to animal or human to human. All must have a method to terminate if implanted. The most effective methodology for insertion of cDNA (template with control mechanism) uses capsid technology to insert a payload into the genome. A viable molecular processor is one that dominates cellular function by re-task and or reassignment but does not terminate the cell. It will continuously produce protein or produce on demand and have method to regulate dosage if qualifying as a "drug delivery" molecular processor. Potential applications range from up-regulation of functional [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR]] in [[Cystic Fibrosis]] and Hemoglobin in Sickle Cell Anemia to [[angiogenesis]] in cardiovascular [[stenosis]] to account for protein deficiency (used in gene therapy.)

==Example==
A vector inserted to form a molecular processor is described in part. The objective was to promote angiogenesis, blood vessel formation and improve cardiovasculature. [[Vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.2479986|title=Vascular endothelial growth factor is a secreted angiogenic mitogen|pmid=2479986|year=1989|last1=Leung|first1=D.|last2=Cachianes|first2=G|last3=Kuang|first3=W.|last4=Goeddel|first4=D.|last5=Ferrara|first5=N|journal=Science|volume=246|issue=4935|pages=1306–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced [[green fluorescent protein]] (EGFP) cDNA was ligated to either side of an internal ribosomal re-entry site (IRES) to produce inline production of both the VEGF and EGFP proteins. After in vitro insertion and quantification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0166-0934(98)00166-9|pmid=10204701|title=Rapid feline immunodeficiency virus provirus quantitation by polymerase chain reaction using the TaqMan fluorogenic real-time detection system|first9=H|last9=Lutz|first8=WH|last8=Guenzburg|first7=F|last7=Boretti|first6=J|last6=Böni|first5=U|last5=Hummel|first4=C|last4=Mislin|first3=R|last3=Hofmann-Lehmann|first2=D|year=1999|last2=Klein|last1=Leutenegger|first1=C|journal=Journal of Virological Methods|volume=78|issue=1–2|pages=105–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of integrating units (IUs), engineered cells produce a bioluminescent marker and a chemotactic growth factor. In this instance, increased fluorescence of EGFP is used to show VEGF production in individual cells with active molecular processors. The production was exponential in nature and regulated through use of an integrating promoter, cell numbers, the number of integrated units (IUs) of molecular processors and or cell numbers. The measure the molecular processors efficacy was performed by FC/FACS to indirectly measure VEGF through fluorescence intensity. Proof of functional molecular processing was quantified by ELISA to show VEGF effect through chemotactic and angiogenesis models.

[[File:Neural Correlates Of Consciousness.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Neuronal Correlates of Consciousness (NCC) constitute the smallest set of neural events and structures sufficient for a given conscious percept or explicit memory. This case involves synchronized action potentials in [[neocortex|neocortical]] pyramidal neurons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 1.1 ''The Neuronal Correlates of Consciousness'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The '''neural correlates of consciousness''' ('''NCC''') constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious [[Perception#Process_and_terminology|percept]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover [[neural correlate]]s of subjective phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313192029/http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html |date=2013-03-13 }} for a glossary of related terms.&lt;/ref&gt; The set should be ''minimal'' because, under the assumption that the brain is sufficient to give rise to any given conscious experience, the question is which of its components is necessary to produce it.

==Neurobiological approach to consciousness==
A science of [[consciousness]] must explain the exact relationship between subjective mental states and brain states, the nature of the relationship between the conscious mind and the electro-chemical interactions in the body ([[mind–body problem]]). Progress in [[neuropsychology]] and [[neurophilosophy]] has come from focusing on the body rather than the mind. In this context the neuronal correlates of consciousness may be viewed as its causes, and [[consciousness]] may be thought of as a state-dependent property of some undefined [[complex systems|complex]], adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Squire2008|Squire 2008]], p. 1223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovering and characterizing neural correlates does not offer a theory of consciousness that can explain how particular systems experience anything at all, or how and why they are associated with consciousness, the so-called [[hard problem of consciousness]],&lt;ref name="Kandel2007p382"&gt;[[#Kandel2007|Kandel 2007]], p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; but understanding the NCC may be a step toward such a theory. Most neurobiologists assume that the variables giving rise to consciousness are to be found at the neuronal level, governed by classical physics, though a few scholars have proposed theories of [[quantum consciousness]] based on [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quantum physics in neuroscience and psychology: A neurophysiological model of mind/brain interaction |author1=Jeffrey M. Schwartz |author2=Henry P. Stapp |author3=Mario Beauregard |url=http://www-physics.lbl.gov/~stapp/PTB6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great apparent redundancy and parallelism in neural networks so, while activity in one group of neurons may correlate with a percept in one case, a different population might mediate a related percept if the former population is lost or inactivated. It may be that every phenomenal, subjective state has a neural correlate. Where the NCC can be induced artificially the subject will experience the associated percept, while perturbing or inactivating the region of correlation for a specific percept will affect the percept or cause it to disappear, giving a cause-effect relationship from the neural region to the nature of the percept.

What characterizes the NCC? What are the commonalities between the NCC for seeing and for hearing? Will the NCC involve all the [[Pyramidal cell|pyramidal neurons]] in the cortex at any given point in time? Or only a subset of long-range projection cells in the frontal lobes that project to the sensory cortices in the back? Neurons that fire in a rhythmic manner? Neurons that fire in a [[neural oscillations|synchronous manner]]? These are some of the proposals that have been advanced over the years.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Chalmers1998|Chalmers 1998]], available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools (e.g., [[#Adamantidis2007|Adamantidis et al. 2007]]) depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioral assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. It is the combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework, that will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness, one of the central mysteries of life.

==Level of arousal and content of consciousness==
There are two common but distinct dimensions of the term ''consciousness'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zeman2001|Zeman 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt; one involving ''arousal'' and ''states of consciousness'' and the other involving ''content of consciousness'' and ''conscious states''. To be conscious ''of'' anything the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called ''vigilance''), whether in wakefulness or [[REM sleep]], vividly experienced in dreams although usually not remembered. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a [[circadian]] rhythm but may be influenced by lack of sleep, drugs and alcohol, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude that triggers some criterion reaction (for instance, the sound level necessary to evoke an eye movement or a head turn toward the sound source). Clinicians use scoring systems such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] to assess the level of arousal in patients.

High arousal states are associated with conscious states that have specific content, seeing, hearing, remembering, planning or fantasizing about something. Different levels or states of consciousness are associated with different kinds of conscious experiences. The "awake" state is quite different from the "dreaming" state (for instance, the latter has little or no self-reflection) and from the state of deep sleep. In all three cases the basic physiology of the brain is affected, as it also is in ''altered states of consciousness'', for instance after taking drugs or during meditation when conscious perception and insight may be enhanced compared to the normal waking state.

Clinicians talk about ''impaired states of consciousness'' as in "the [[coma|comatose state]]", "the [[persistent vegetative state]]" (PVS), and "the [[minimally conscious state]]" (MCS). Here, "state" refers to different "amounts" of external/physical consciousness, from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and general anesthesia, to a fluctuating and limited form of conscious sensation in a minimally conscious state such as sleep walking or during a complex partial [[epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schiff2004|Schiff 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; The repertoire of conscious states or experiences accessible to a patient in a minimally conscious state is comparatively limited. In brain death there is no arousal, but it is unknown whether the subjectivity of experience has been interrupted, rather than its observable link with the organism.

The potential ''richness of conscious experience'' appears to increase from deep sleep to drowsiness to full wakefulness, as might be quantified using notions from complexity theory that incorporate both the dimensionality as well as the granularity of conscious experience to give an [[Integrated information theory|integrated-information-theoretical account]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tononi2016|Tononi et al. 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; As behavioral arousal increases so does the range and complexity of possible behavior. Yet in REM sleep there is a characteristic [[atonia]], low motor arousal and the person is difficult to wake up, but there is still high metabolic and electric brain activity and vivid perception.

Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]] and [[pons]] must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus]], [[claustrum]] and the [[basal ganglia]].

==The neuronal basis of perception==
The possibility of precisely manipulating visual percepts in time and space has made [[visual perception|vision]] a preferred modality in the quest for the NCC. Psychologists have perfected a number of techniques – [[Visual masking|masking]], [[binocular rivalry]], [[flash suppression|continuous flash suppression]], [[motion induced blindness]], [[change blindness]], [[inattentional blindness]] – in which the seemingly simple and unambiguous relationship between a physical stimulus in the world and its associated percept in the privacy of the subject's mind is disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#KimBlake2004|Kim and Blake 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular a stimulus can be perceptually suppressed for seconds or even minutes at a time: the image is projected into one of the observer's eyes but is invisible, not seen. In this manner the neural mechanisms that respond to the subjective percept rather than the physical stimulus can be isolated, permitting visual consciousness to be tracked in the brain. In a ''perceptual [[illusion]]'', the physical stimulus remains fixed while the percept fluctuates. The best known example is the ''[[Necker cube]]'' whose 12 lines can be perceived in one of two different ways in depth.

[[File:NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness3.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Necker Cube: The left line drawing can be perceived in one of two distinct depth configurations shown on the right. Without any other cue, the visual system flips back and forth between these two interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 16.1 ''The Bistable Necker Cube'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A perceptual illusion that can be precisely controlled is ''[[binocular rivalry]]''. Here, a small image, e.g., a horizontal grating, is presented to the left eye, and another image, e.g., a vertical grating, is shown to the corresponding location in the right eye. In spite of the constant visual stimulus, observers consciously see the horizontal grating alternate every few seconds with the vertical one. The brain does not allow for the simultaneous perception of both images.

Logothetis and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;[[#Logothetis1998|Logothetis 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; recorded a variety of visual cortical areas in awake macaque monkeys performing a binocular rivalry task. Macaque monkeys can be trained to report whether they see the left or the right image. The distribution of the switching times and the way in which changing the contrast in one eye affects these leaves little doubt that monkeys and humans experience the same basic phenomenon. In the primary visual cortex (V1) only a small fraction of cells weakly modulated their response as a function of the percept of the monkey while most cells responded to one or the other retinal stimulus with little regard to what the animal perceived at the time. But in a high-level cortical area such as the inferior temporal cortex along the [[ventral stream]] almost all neurons responded only to the perceptually dominant stimulus, so that a "face" cell only fired when the animal indicated that it saw the face and not the pattern presented to the other eye. This implies that NCC involve neurons active in the inferior temporal cortex: it is likely that specific reciprocal actions of neurons in the inferior temporal and parts of the prefrontal cortex are necessary.

A number of [[fMRI]] experiments that have exploited binocular rivalry and related illusions to identify the hemodynamic activity underlying visual consciousness in humans demonstrate quite conclusively that activity in the upper stages of the ventral pathway (e.g., the [[fusiform face area]] and the [[parahippocampal place area]]) as well as in early regions, including V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), follow the percept and not the retinal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ReesFrith2007|Rees and Frith 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, a number of fMRI&lt;ref&gt;[[#HaynesRees2005|Haynes and Rees 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lee2007|Lee et al. 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; and DTI experiments&lt;ref&gt;[[#ShimonoNiki2013|Shimono and Niki 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest V1 is necessary but not sufficient for visual consciousness.&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;[[#CrickKoch1995|Crick and Koch 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a related perceptual phenomenon, ''[[flash suppression]]'', the percept associated with an image projected into one eye is suppressed by flashing another image into the other eye while the original image remains. Its methodological advantage over binocular rivalry is that the timing of the perceptual transition is determined by an external trigger rather than by an internal event. The majority of cells in the inferior temporal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus of monkeys trained to report their percept during flash suppression follow the animal's percept: when the cell's preferred stimulus is perceived, the cell responds. If the picture is still present on the retina but is perceptually suppressed, the cell falls silent, even though primary visual cortex neurons fire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeopoldLogothetis1996|Leopold and Logothetis 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#SheinbergLogothetis1997|Sheinberg and Logothetis 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; Single-neuron recordings in the medial temporal lobe of epilepsy patients during flash suppression likewise demonstrate abolishment of response when the preferred stimulus is present but perceptually masked.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreiman2002|Kreiman et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global disorders of consciousness==
Given the absence of any accepted criterion of the minimal neuronal correlates necessary for consciousness, the distinction between a persistently vegetative patient who shows regular sleep-wave transitions and may be able to move or smile, and a minimally conscious patient who can communicate (on occasion) in a meaningful manner (for instance, by differential eye movements) and who shows some signs of consciousness, is often difficult. In global anesthesia the patient should not experience psychological trauma but the level of arousal should be compatible with clinical exigencies.

[[File:NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Midline structures in the brainstem and thalamus necessary to regulate the level of brain arousal. Small, bilateral lesions in many of these nuclei cause a global loss of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 5.1 ''The Cholinergic Enabling System'' p. 92. See Chapter 5, available on line.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Blood-oxygen-level-dependent [[fMRI]] have demonstrated normal patterns of brain activity in a patient in a vegetative state following a severe traumatic brain injury when asked to imagine playing tennis or visiting rooms in his/her house.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Owen2006|Owen et al. 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Differential brain imaging of patients with such global disturbances of consciousness (including [[akinetic mutism]]) reveal that dysfunction in a widespread cortical network including medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal associative areas is associated with a global loss of awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Laureys2005|Laureys 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Impaired consciousness in [[epileptic]] seizures of the [[medial temporal lobe|temporal lobe]] was likewise accompanied by a decrease in cerebral blood flow in frontal and parietal association cortex and an increase in midline structures such as the [[thalamus|mediodorsal thalamus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blumenfeld2004|Blumenfeld et al. 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively local bilateral injuries to midline (paramedian) subcortical structures can also cause a complete loss of awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]],  p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; These structures therefore ''enable'' and control brain arousal (as determined by metabolic or electrical activity) and are necessary neural correlates. One such example is the heterogeneous collection of more than two dozen nuclei on each side of the upper brainstem (pons, midbrain and in the posterior hypothalamus), collectively referred to as the [[reticular activating system]] (RAS). Their axons project widely throughout the brain. These nuclei – three-dimensional collections of neurons with their own cyto-architecture and neurochemical identity – release distinct neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline/norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine and orexin/hypocretin to control the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain, mediating alternation between wakefulness and sleep as well as general level of behavioral and brain arousal. After such trauma, however, eventually the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain can recover and consciousness can return.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Villablanca2004|Villablanca 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another enabling factor for consciousness are the five or more [[intralaminar nuclei]] (ILN) of the thalamus. These receive input from many brainstem nuclei and project strongly, directly to the basal ganglia and, in a more distributed manner, into layer I of much of the neocortex. Comparatively small (1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or less) bilateral lesions in the thalamic ILN completely knock out all awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bogen1995|Bogen 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forward versus feedback projections==
Many actions in response to sensory inputs are rapid, transient, stereotyped, and unconscious.&lt;ref name="milner"&gt;[[#MilnerGoodale1995|Milner and Goodale 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; They could be thought of as cortical reflexes and are characterized by rapid and somewhat stereotyped responses that can take the form of rather complex automated behavior as seen, e.g., in complex partial [[epileptic]] seizures. These automated responses, sometimes called ''zombie behaviors'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#KochCrick2001|Koch and Crick 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt; could be contrasted by a slower, all-purpose conscious mode that deals more slowly with broader, less stereotyped aspects of the sensory inputs (or a reflection of these, as in imagery) and takes time to decide on appropriate thoughts and responses. Without such a consciousness mode, a vast number of different zombie modes would be required to react to unusual events.

A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("[[physiological prematurity]]"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beilock2002|Beilock et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From an evolutionary standpoint it clearly makes sense to have both automated behavioral programs that can be executed rapidly in a stereotyped and automated manner, and a slightly slower system that allows time for thinking and planning more complex behavior. This latter aspect may be one of the principal functions of consciousness. Other philosophers, however, have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=[[Owen Flanagan]] and T. W. Polger |year=1995 |title=Zombies and the function of consciousness |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |pages=313–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=David|title=Consciousness and its function|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2008|volume=46|pages=829–840|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one has given a causal explanation, they argue, of why it would not be possible for a functionally equivalent non-conscious organism (i.e., a [[philosophical zombie]]) to achieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism. If evolutionary processes are blind to the difference between function ''F'' being performed by conscious organism ''O'' and non-conscious organism ''O*'', it is unclear what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Stevan Harnad]] |year=2002 |chapter= Turing indistinguishability and the Blind Watchmaker |editor=J. H. Fetzer |title=Consciousness Evolving |publisher=John Benjamins |url=http://cogprints.org/1615 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation but was an [[exaptation]] arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3790330 | pmid=24109460 | doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00667 | volume=4 | title=The evolutionary and genetic origins of consciousness in the Cambrian Period over 500 million years ago. | year=2013 | journal=Front Psychol | pages=667 |vauthors=Feinberg TE, Mallatt J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the retina where it is not an adaption of the retina, but instead just a by-product of the way the retinal axons were wired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zack ROBINSON |author2=Corey J. MALEY |author3=Gualtiero PICCININI | year = 2015 | title = Is Consciousness a Spandrel?. | url = | journal = Journal of the American Philosophical Association | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 365–383 | doi = 10.1017/apa.2014.10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several scholars including Pinker, Chomsky, Edelman, and Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory in the context of the development of higher-order consciousness.

It seems possible that visual zombie modes in the cortex mainly use the [[Two Streams hypothesis#Dorsal stream|dorsal stream]] in the parietal region.&lt;ref name="milner"/&gt; However, parietal activity can affect consciousness by producing attentional effects on the ventral stream, at least under some circumstances. The conscious mode for vision depends largely on the early visual areas (beyond V1) and especially on the ventral stream.

Seemingly complex visual processing (such as detecting animals in natural, cluttered scenes) can be accomplished by the human cortex within 130–150 ms,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thorpe1996|Thorpe et al. 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#VanRullenKoch2003|VanRullen and Koch 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; far too brief for eye movements and conscious perception to occur. Furthermore, reflexes such as the [[oculovestibular reflex]] take place at even more rapid time-scales. It is quite plausible that such behaviors are mediated by a purely feed-forward moving wave of spiking activity that passes from the retina through V1, into V4, IT and prefrontal cortex, until it affects motorneurons in the spinal cord that control the finger press (as in a typical laboratory experiment). The hypothesis that the basic processing of information is feedforward is supported most directly by the short times (approx. 100 ms) required for a selective response to appear in IT cells.

Conversely, conscious perception is believed to require more sustained, reverberatory neural activity, most likely via global feedback from frontal regions of neocortex back to sensory cortical areas&lt;ref name= "Crick"/&gt; that builds up over time until it exceeds a critical threshold. At this point, the sustained neural activity rapidly propagates to parietal, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions, thalamus, claustrum and related structures that support short-term memory, multi-modality integration, planning, speech, and other processes intimately related to consciousness. Competition prevents more than one or a very small number of percepts to be simultaneously and actively represented. This is the core hypothesis of the [[global workspace theory]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baars1988|Baars 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dehaene2003|Dehaene et al. 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, while rapid but transient neural activity in the thalamo-cortical system can mediate complex behavior without conscious sensation, it is surmised that consciousness requires sustained but well-organized neural activity dependent on long-range cortico-cortical feedback.

{{Books of the New Testament}}
{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}

The '''New Testament''' ({{lang-gr|Ἡ Καινὴ Διαθήκη}}, [[Transliteration|trans.]] ''Hē Kainḕ Diathḗkē''; {{lang-la|Novum Testamentum}}) is the second part of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], the first part being the [[Old Testament]], based on the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], as well as events in [[Christianity in the 1st century|first-century Christianity]]. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as [[Religious text|sacred scripture]]. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the [[Early centers of Christianity|spread of Christianity around the world]]. It reflects and serves as a source for [[Christian theology]] and [[Christian ethics|morality]]. Extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various [[Christian liturgy|Christian liturgies]]. The New Testament has influenced religious, [[Philosophical movement|philosophical]], and [[Political movement|political]] [[Social movement|movements]] in [[Christendom]] and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.

The New Testament is a collection of Christian works written in the [[Koine Greek|common (Koine) Greek]] language of the first century, at different times by various writers, and the modern consensus is that it provides important evidence regarding [[Christianity and Judaism|Judaism]] in the first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Barton (theologian)|Barton, John]] (3 February 2012). "Before the parting of the ways". ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all Christian traditions today, the New Testament consists of 27 books. 
The [[Biblical canon|canon]] or list of the books of the New Testament is not found anywhere in any book of the Bible. It was the united Catholic Church which defined the 27-book canon. The first time we find the complete list of the 27 books of the NT is in Athanasius, eastern Catholic bishop of the IV Century. The first time that church councils gave us this same list was in the councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage (397) in north Africa and the pope Innocent I ratified the same canon in 405, but it is probable that a Council in Rome in 382 under pope Damasus gave the same list first. These councils also provided the canon of the Old Testament, which included the so-called apocryphal books &lt;ref&gt; Introduction to the New Testament. Werner Georg Kummel, pages 500f. Abingdon Press. Nashville. 1993. &lt;/ref&gt;.

The original texts were written in the first century of the [[Christian Era]], in Greek, which was the [[Lingua franca|common language]] of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] from the [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquests of Alexander the Great]] (335–323 BC) until the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century AD. All the works that eventually became incorporated into the New Testament are believed to have been written no later than around 120 AD.&lt;ref name = seeStandard&gt;See the books listed under "Further reading", below, by Goodspeed, Kümmel, Duling and Perrin, Koester, Conzelmann and Lindemann, Brown, and Ehrman. E.g. {{cite book |author=Bart D. Ehrman |title=The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpoNAQAAMAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-508481-8 |page=8 |quote=The New Testament contains twenty-seven books, written in Greek, by fifteen or sixteen different authors, who were addressing other Christian individuals or communities between the years 50 and 120 C.E.

Collections of related texts such as [[Pauline epistles|letters]] of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] (a major collection of which must have been made already by the early 2nd century)&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Clabeaux, J. J. (1989). ''A Lost Edition of the Letters of Paul: A Reassessment of the Text of the Pauline Corpus Attested by [[Marcion]]''. Catholic Biblical Quarterly Monograph Series, 21. Washington, D.C.: Catholic Biblical Association.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Canonical Gospels]] of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (asserted by [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyon]] in the late-2nd century as ''the'' Four Gospels) gradually were joined to other collections and single works in different combinations to [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|form various Christian canons of Scripture]]. Over time, some [[Antilegomena|disputed books]], such as the [[Book of Revelation]] and the [[Catholic epistles|Minor Catholic (General) Epistles]] were introduced into [[Biblical canon|canons]] in which they were originally absent. Other works earlier held to be Scripture, such as [[1 Clement]], the [[Shepherd of Hermas]], and the [[Diatessaron]], were excluded from the New Testament. The Old Testament canon is not completely uniform among all major Christian groups including [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]], the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Slavic Orthodox|Slavic Orthodox Churches]], and the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]]. However, the [[Development of the New Testament canon|twenty-seven-book canon]] of the New Testament, at least since [[Late Antiquity]], has been almost universally recognized within [[Christianity]] (see [[Development of the New Testament canon]]).

The New Testament consists of:
*Four narratives of the life, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus called "gospel" or the good news.
*A narrative of the [[Apostles|Apostle]] ministries in the [[Early Christianity|early church]], called the "Acts of the Apostles", and probably written by the same writer as the [[Gospel of Luke]], which it continues;
*Twenty-one letters, often called "[[epistles]]" from Greek "epistole", written by various authors, and consisting of Christian doctrine, counsel, instruction, and conflict resolution; and
*An [[Apocalypse]], the [[Book of Revelation]], which is a [[Prophecy|book of prophecy]], containing some instructions to [[Seven churches of Asia|seven local congregations of Asia Minor]], but mostly containing prophetical [[semiotics|symbology]], about the [[end time]]s.

Modern English, like Latin, distinguishes [[wikt:testament|testament]] and [[wikt:covenant|covenant]] as alternative translations, and consequently the treatment of the term διαθήκη ''diathḗkē'' varies in [[Bible translations into English]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[John Wycliffe]]'s 1395 version is a translation of the [[Latin Vulgate]] and so follows different terms in Jeremiah and Hebrews:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Lo! days shall come, saith the Lord, and I shall make a new covenant (from Latin ''foedus'') with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah.{{Bibleref2c|Jeremiah|31:31}}

:For he reproving him saith, Lo! days come, saith the Lord, when I shall establish a new testament (from Latin ''testamentum'') on the house of Israel, and on the house of Judah.{{Bibleref2c|Hebrews|8:8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Use of the term ''New Testament'' to describe a collection of first and second-century Christian Greek Scriptures can be traced back to [[Tertullian]] (in ''Against [[Praxeas]]'' 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Allen, Clifton J. | date = 1969 | title = The Broadman Bible Commentary: Volume 8, General Articles, Matthew-Mark | location = London, England, and Nashville, Tennessee, USA | publisher = Broadman Press | asin = B000BUN8GM | quote = Tertullian was apparently the first to use the term New Testament in the sense of a collection of books (Against Praxeas XV). }}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Against [[Marcion]]'', written ''circa'' 208 AD, he writes of
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Divine Word, who is doubly edged with the two testaments of the [[Torah|law]] and the [[gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. "Chapter XIV". [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian123.html ''Against Marcion, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And Tertullian continues later in the book, writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
it is certain that the whole aim at which he [Marcion] has strenuously laboured, even in the drawing up of his [[Antitheses]], centres in this, that he may establish a diversity between the Old and the New Testaments, so that his own [[Christ]] may be separate from the [[Creator God|Creator]], as belonging to this rival god, and as alien from the law and the [[Neviim|prophets]].&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. "Chapter VI". [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian124.html ''Against Marcion, Book IV''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also Tertullian, [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian124.html ''Against Marcion, Book IV''], chapters I, II, XIV. However, his meaning in chapter XX is less clear, and in chapters IX and XL he uses the term to mean "new covenant".&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], the existence—even if not the exact contents—of both an Old and New Testament had been established. [[Lactantius]], a 3rd–4th century Christian author wrote in his early-4th-century Latin ''Institutiones Divinae'' (''Divine Institutes''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But all scripture is divided into two Testaments. That which preceded the advent and passion of Christ—that is, the [[Torah|law]] and the [[Neviim|prophets]]—is called the Old; but those things which were written after His resurrection are named the New Testament. The Jews make use of the Old, we of the New: but yet they are not discordant, for the New is the fulfilling of the Old, and in both there is the same testator, even Christ, who, having suffered death for us, made us heirs of His everlasting kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and disinherited. As the prophet Jeremiah testifies when he speaks such things: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new testament to the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not in my testament, and I disregarded them, saith the Lord."{{Bibleref2c|Jer|31:31–32}}  ... For that which He said above, that He would make a new testament to the house of Judah, shows that the old testament which was given by Moses was not perfect; but that which was to be given by Christ would be complete.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius. "Chapter XX". [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.iii.ii.iv.xx.html "The Divine Institutes, Book IV"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[canon of the New Testament]] is the collection of books that most [[Christians]] regard as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]] and constituting the New Testament of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]].&lt;ref name="mcdowell2006_canon"&gt;McDowell, Josh. Evidence for Christianity. Tennessee: Thomas Nelson, Inc. 2006. pp. 42–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period extending roughly from 50 to 150 AD, a number of documents began to circulate among the churches, including epistles, gospel accounts, memoirs, prophecies, homilies, and collections of teachings.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} While some of these documents were [[Apostolic Age|apostolic in origin]], others drew upon the tradition the apostles and ministers of the word had utilized in their individual missions, and still others represented a summation of the teaching entrusted to a particular church center.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Several of these writings sought to extend, interpret, and apply apostolic teaching to meet the needs of Christians in a given locality.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In general, among [[Christian denominations]] the New Testament canon came to be agreed-upon as a list of 27 books, although the order of the books can vary from one version of the printed scriptures to the next.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The book order is the same in the Greek Orthodox,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Roman Catholic,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and Protestant traditions.&lt;ref name="Luther"&gt;Bouman, Herbert J.

===The Gospels===
{{Main article|Canonical gospels}}
Each of the four [[gospels]] in the New Testament narrates the life, death, and resurrection of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]]. The word "gospel" derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''gōd-spell''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Gospel |title=Gospel |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (rarely ''godspel''), meaning "good news" or "glad tidings". The gospel was considered the "good news" of the coming [[Messiah#Christianity|Kingdom of Messiah]], and the redemption through the life and death of Jesus, the central Christian message.&lt;ref name="ODCC self Gospel"&gt;Cross, F. L., ed (2005). "Gospel". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Gospel is a [[calque]] (word-for-word translation) of the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|εὐαγγέλιον}}, ''euangelion'' (''eu-'' "good", ''-angelion'' "message").

Since the 2nd century, the four narrative accounts of the life and work of Jesus Christ have been referred to as "The Gospel of ..." or "The Gospel according to ..." followed by the name of the supposed author. Whatever these admittedly early ascriptions may imply about the sources behind or the perception of these gospels, they are anonymous compositions.&lt;ref name = seeStandard/&gt;
* The [[Gospel of Matthew]], ascribed to the [[Matthew the Evangelist|Apostle Matthew]]. This gospel begins with a [[genealogy of Jesus]] and a story of his birth that includes a visit from [[Biblical Magi|magi]] and a [[flight into Egypt]], and it ends with the [[Great Commission|commissioning of the disciples]] by the resurrected Jesus.
* The [[Gospel of Mark]], ascribed to [[Mark the Evangelist]]. This gospel begins with the preaching of [[John the Baptist]] and the [[baptism of Jesus]]. Two different secondary endings were affixed to this gospel in the 2nd century.
* The [[Gospel of Luke]], ascribed to [[Luke the Evangelist]], who was not one of [[Twelve Disciples#The Twelve Apostles|the Twelve Apostles]], but was mentioned as a companion of the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] and as a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmyer, Joseph A. (1985). ''The Gospel according to Luke, Vol. 1''. Anchor Bible Commentary series. New York: Doubleday. pp. 35–53.&lt;/ref&gt; This gospel begins with parallel stories of the birth and childhood of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus]] and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus and his ascension into heaven.
* The [[Gospel of John]], ascribed to [[John the Apostle]]. This gospel begins with a philosophical prologue and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus. It is about Jesus's miracles.

The first three gospels listed above are classified as the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. They contain similar accounts of the events in Jesus' life and his teaching, due to their literary interdependence. The Gospel of John is structured differently and includes stories of several miracles of Jesus and sayings not found in the other three.

These four gospels that were eventually included in the New Testament were only a few among many other early Christian gospels. The existence of such texts is even mentioned at the beginning of the Gospel of Luke.{{Bibleref2c|Luke|1:1–4}} Other early Christian gospels such as the so-called "[[Jewish-Christian Gospels]]" or the [[Gospel of Thomas]], also offer both a window into the context of [[early Christianity]] and may provide some assistance in the reconstruction of the [[historical Jesus]].

===Acts of the Apostles===
The [[Acts of the Apostles]] is a narrative of the apostles' ministry and activity after [[Christ's death]] and resurrection, from which point it resumes and functions as a sequel to the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Examining style, phraseology, and other evidence, modern scholarship generally concludes that Acts and the Gospel of Luke share the same author, referred to as [[Luke–Acts]]. Luke-Acts does not name its author.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=196}} Church tradition identified him as [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, but the majority of scholars reject this due to the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=235}} The most probable date of composition is around 80–100 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250–53}}

===Epistles===
The epistles of the New Testament are considered by Christians to be divinely inspired and holy letters, written by the apostles and disciples of Christ, to either local congregations with specific needs, or to New Covenant Christians in general, scattered about; or "Catholic Epistles."

====Pauline Letters to Churches====
{{Main article|Pauline epistles}}
The Pauline epistles are the thirteen New Testament books that present [[Paul the Apostle]] as their author.{{refn|group=note|[[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] in his ''Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians'' writes: "At this point [{{Bibleref2|Gal|6:11}}] the apostle takes the pen from his [[amanuensis]], and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ({{bibleref2|2 Thess|2:2||2 Thess. 3:17}}; {{bibleref2-nb|2 Thess|3:17||2 Thess. 3:17}}) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries.... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. ''pelikois grammasin''), that his handwriting may reflect the energy and determination of his soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lightfoot |first=Joseph Barber |year=1866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8ECAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 |title=St Paul's Epistle to the Galatians |edition=2nd |publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Six of the letters are disputed. Four are thought by most modern scholars to be [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]], i.e., not actually written by Paul even if attributed to him within the letters themselves.  Opinion is more divided on the other two disputed letters (2 Thessalonians and Colossians).&lt;ref&gt;Bassler, Jouette M. (2010). "Paul and his Letters". In Aune, David E. ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 388. {{ISBN|9781444318944}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These letters were written to Christian communities in specific cities or geographical regions, often to address issues faced by that particular community. Prominent themes include the relationship both to broader "[[Gentile|pagan]]" society, to Judaism, and to other Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Roetzel, Calvin J. (2009). ''The Letters of Paul: Conversations in Context'' (5th ed.). Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox. {{ISBN|9780664233921}}.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Epistle to the Romans]]
*[[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]
*[[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]]
*[[Epistle to the Galatians]]
*[[Epistle to the Ephesians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
*[[Epistle to the Philippians]]
*[[Epistle to the Colossians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
*[[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]]
*[[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
[Disputed letters are marked with an asterisk (*).]

====Pauline Letters to Persons====
The last four Pauline letters in the New Testament are addressed to individual persons. They include the following:
* [[First Epistle to Timothy]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Second Epistle to Timothy]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Epistle to Titus]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Epistle to Philemon]]
[Disputed letters are marked with an asterisk (*).]

All of the above except for Philemon are known as the [[Pastoral epistles]]. They are addressed to individuals charged with pastoral oversight of churches and discuss issues of Christian living, doctrine and leadership. They often address different concerns to those of the preceding epistles. These letters are believed by many to be pseudepigraphic. Some scholars (e.g., Bill Mounce, Ben Witherington) will argue that the letters are genuinely Pauline, or at least written under Paul's supervision.

====Hebrews====
The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] addresses a Jewish audience who had come to believe that Jesus was the [[Messiah#Judaism|anointed one]] (Hebrew: מָשִׁיחַ—transliterated in English as "Moshiach", or "Messiah"; Greek: Χριστός—transliterated in English as "Christos", for "[[Christ]]") who was predicted in the writings of the Hebrew Bible. The author discusses the "better-ness" of the new covenant and the ministry of Jesus, over the Mosaic covenant {{Bibleref2c|Heb.|1:1–10:18}} and urges the readers in the practical implications of this conviction through the end of the epistle.{{Bibleref2c|Heb.|10:19–13:25}}

The book has been widely accepted by the Christian church as inspired by God and thus authoritative, despite the acknowledgment of uncertainties about who its human author was. Regarding authorship, although the Epistle to the Hebrews does not internally claim to have been written by the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]], some similarities in wordings to some of the Pauline Epistles have been noted and inferred. In antiquity, some began to ascribe it to Paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold W. Attridge|Attridge, Harold W.]] (1989). ''Hebrews''. Hermeneia. Philadelphia: Fortress. pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century, [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] supported [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|Paul's authorship]]. The Church largely agreed to include Hebrews as the fourteenth letter of Paul, and affirmed this authorship until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The letter to the Hebrews had difficulty in being accepted as part of the Christian canon because of its anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Lane|Lane, William L.]] (1991). ''Hebrews 1–8''. Word Biblical Commentary series, Vol. 47A. Dallas, Texas: Word Books. p. cliv.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 3rd century, [[Origen]] wrote of the letter, "Men of old have handed it down as Paul's, but who wrote the Epistle God only knows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm |author=Eusebius |title=Church History, Book VI |chapter=Chapter 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scholars often reject Pauline authorship for the epistle to the Hebrews,&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2004:411"&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. (1997). ''The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings''. Oxford University Press. p. 323. "Scholars in the ancient world went about detecting forgeries in much the same way that modern scholars do. They looked to see whether the ideas and writing style of a piece conformed with those used by the author in other writings, and they examined the text for any blatant anachronisms, that is, statements about things that could not have existed at the time the alleged author was writing (like the letter reputedly from an early seventeenth-century American colonist that mentions "the United States")- Arguments of this kind were used by some Christian scholars of the third century to show that Hebrews was not written by Paul or the Book of Revelation by John the son of Zebedee. Modern scholars, as we will see, concur with these judgments. To be sure, neither of these books can be considered a forgery. Hebrews does not claim to be written by Paul (it is anonymous), and the John who wrote Revelation does not claim to be the son of Zebedee (it is therefore homonymous). Are there other books in the New Testament, though, that can be considered forgeries?"&lt;/ref&gt; based on its distinctive style and theology, which are considered to set it apart from Paul's writings.&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark A. |year=2009 |title=Introducing the New Testament: A Historical, Literary, and Theological Survey |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|publisher=Baker Academic |pages=431–32 |isbn=9780801028687 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholic epistles====
The [[Catholic epistles]] (or "general epistles") consist of both letters and treatises in the form of letters written to the church at large. The term "[[catholic]]" ([[Koine Greek|Greek]]: καθολική, ''katholikē''), used to describe these letters in the oldest manuscripts containing them, here simply means "general" or "universal". The authorship of a number of these is disputed.
* [[Epistle of James]], written by an author named "James", often identified with [[James the Just|James, the brother of Jesus]].
* [[First Epistle of Peter]], ascribed to the [[Saint Peter|Apostle Peter]].
* [[Second Epistle of Peter]], ascribed to the Apostle Peter, though widely considered not to have been written by him.&lt;ref&gt;Fornberg, Tord (1977). ''An Early Church in a Pluralistic Society: A Study of 2 Peter''. Coniectanea Biblica, New Testament Series 9. Lund: Gleerup.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First Epistle of John]], ascribed to [[John the Apostle]].
* [[Second Epistle of John]], ascribed to John the Apostle.
* [[Third Epistle of John]], ascribed to John the Apostle.
* [[Epistle of Jude]], written under the name of [[Jude, brother of Jesus|Jude, the brother of Jesus and James]].

===Book of Revelation===
{{Further information|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
The final book of the New Testament is the [[Book of Revelation]], also known as the Apocalypse of John. In the New Testament canon, it is considered [[Bible prophecy|prophetical]] or [[apocalyptic literature]]. Its authorship has been attributed either to John the Apostle (in which case it is often thought that John the Apostle is [[John the Evangelist]], i.e. author of the [[Gospel of John]]) or to another John designated "[[John of Patmos]]" after the island where the text says the revelation was received (1:9). Some ascribe the writership date as circa 81–96 AD, and others at around 68 AD.&lt;ref name=Mounce&gt;[[Robert Mounce|Mounce, Robert]] (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=06VR1JzzLNsC&amp;pg=PA15 ''The Book of Revelation''] (revised ed.). The New International Commentary on the New Testament Series. Cambridge, UK: Eerdmans. pp. 15–16. {{ISBN|0802825370}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The work opens with letters to [[Seven churches of Asia|seven churches]] and thereafter takes the form of an [[apocalypse]], a literary genre popular in ancient Judaism and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed study of the Apocalypse of John, see Aune, David E.

==Book order==
The order in which the books of the New Testament appear differs between some collections and ecclesiastical traditions. In the Latin West, prior to the [[Vulgate]] (an early 5th-century Latin version of the Bible), the four Gospels were arranged in the following order: Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark.{{refn|group=note|The Gospels are in this order in many Old Latin manuscripts, as well as in the Greek manuscripts [[Codex Bezae]] and [[Codex Washingtonianus]].}} The Syriac [[Peshitta]] places the major Catholic epistles (James, 1 Peter, and 1 John) immediately after Acts and before the Pauline epistles.

The order of an early edition of the letters of Paul is based on the size of the letters: longest to shortest, though keeping 1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians together. The Pastoral epistles were apparently not part of the ''Corpus Paulinum'' in which this order originated and were later inserted after 2 Thessalonians and before Philemon. Hebrews was variously incorporated into the ''Corpus Paulinum'' either after 2 Thessalonians, after Philemon (i.e. at the very end), or after Romans.

The New Testament of the 16th-century [[Luther Bible]] continues, to this day, to place Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Apocalypse last. This reflects the thoughts of the Reformer Martin Luther [[Luther's canon|on the canonicity of these books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/links10.html|title=Web Directory: German Bible Versions|publisher=Bible Research|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also the article on the [[Antilegomena]].}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Apocrypha==
{{Main article|New Testament apocrypha}}
The books that eventually found a permanent place in the New Testament were not the only works of Christian literature produced in the earliest Christian centuries. The long process of [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonization]] began early, sometimes with tacit reception of traditional texts, sometimes with explicit selection or rejection of particular texts as either acceptable or unacceptable for use in a given context (e.g., not all texts that were acceptable for private use were considered appropriate for use in the [[liturgy]]).

Over the course of history, those works of early Christian literature that survived but that did not become part of the New Testament have been variously grouped by theologians and scholars. Drawing upon, though redefining, an older term used in [[early Christianity]] and among Protestants when referring to those books found in the Christian [[Old Testament]] although not in the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]], modern scholars began to refer to these works of early Christian literature not included in the New Testament as "apocryphal", by which was meant non-canonical.

Collected editions of these works were then referred to as the "[[New Testament apocrypha]]". Typically excluded from such published collections are the following groups of works: [[Apostolic Fathers|The Apostolic Fathers]], the 2nd-century Christian apologists, [[Alexandrian school|the Alexandrians]], [[Tertullian]], [[Methodius of Olympus]], [[Novatian]], [[Cyprian]], martyrdoms, and [[Desert Fathers|the Desert Fathers]]. Almost all other Christian literature from the period, and sometimes including works composed well into [[Late Antiquity]], are relegated to the so-called New Testament apocrypha.

Although not considered to be inspired by God,  these "apocryphal" works may be helpful in the study of the New Testament in that they were produced in the same ancient context and often using the same language as those books that would eventually form the New Testament. Some of these later works are dependent (either directly or indirectly) upon books that would later come to be in the New Testament or upon the ideas expressed in them. There is even an example of a [[pseudepigraph]]ical letter composed under the guise of a presumably lost letter of the Apostle Paul, the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]].

==Authors==
{{Main article|Authorship of the Bible}}
The books of the New Testament were all or nearly all written by [[Jewish Christians]]—that is, Jewish disciples of Christ, who lived in the [[Roman Empire]], and under [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Powell|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, is frequently thought of as an exception; scholars are divided as to whether Luke was a Gentile or a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jew]].&lt;ref name="Strelan2013"&gt;Strelan, Rick (2013). ''Luke the Priest: The Authority of the Author of the Third Gospel''. Farnham, ENG: Routledege-[[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate]]. pp. 102–105.&lt;/ref&gt; A few scholars identify the author of the Gospel of Mark as probably a Gentile, and similarly for the Gospel of Matthew, though most assert Jewish-Christian authorship.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Mark, see Schröter, Jens (2010). "Gospel of Mark". In Aune, David. ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''. New York, USA: Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 281f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Mark, see Hare, Douglas R. A.

===Gospels===
{{Main article|Synoptic Gospels}}
Authorship is an area of longstanding and current research and debate, with different works posing different problems for identification. While the various works have traditional ascriptions of authorship, these ascriptions are in some cases defended by scholars, and in other cases disputed or rejected.&lt;ref&gt;For overviews of the scholarship on authorship of the various New Testament works, see the relevant entries in Aune, David E., ed. (2010). ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''. Hoboken, New Jersey, USA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; According to many (if not most) critical scholars, none of the authors of the Gospels were eyewitnesses or even explicitly claimed to be eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name=lost&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|authorlink=Bart D.

There is a tradition that the Apostle John was the author of the Gospel of John. Traditionalists (such as biblical commentators Albert Barnes and Matthew Henry) seem to support the idea that the writer of the Gospel of John himself claimed to be an eyewitness in their commentaries of John 21:24 and therefore the gospel was written by an eyewitness;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barnes |first=Albert |title=Barnes' Notes on the New Testament |year=1962 |orig-year=1832 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvXCoSQ1y0EC&amp;pg=PA360 |publisher=Kregel Publications |page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{Cite book|last=Henry |first=Matthew |title=Matthew Henry Complete Commentary on the Whole Bible |orig-year=1706 |url=http://www.studylight.org/commentaries/mhm/john-21.html |publisher=StudyLight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this idea is rejected by the majority of modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Johannine Literature|last1=Lindars|first1=Barnabas|authorlink1 = Barnabas Lindars |last2=Edwards|first2=Ruth B.|last3=Court|first3=John M.|year=2000|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVOD0PhayhsC&amp;pg=PA41|ref=harv|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of [[Richard Bauckham]]'s book ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony'' states "The common wisdom in the academy is that stories and sayings of Jesus circulated for decades, undergoing countless retellings and embellishments before being finally set down in writing."&lt;ref name="HahnScott2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first1=Scott W.|editor-last1=Hahn|editor-first2=David|editor-last2=Scott|title=Letter &amp; Spirit, Volume 3: The Hermeneutic of Continuity: Christ, Kingdom, and Creation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJ-fd4hQQJ0C&amp;pg=PA225|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Emmaus Road Publishing|isbn=978-1-931018-46-3|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars hold to the [[two-source hypothesis]], which claims that the [[Marcan priority|Gospel of Mark was written first]]. According to the hypothesis, the authors of the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke then used the Gospel of Mark and the hypothetical [[Q document]], in addition to some other sources, to write their individual gospel accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/mark.html |title=Gospel of Mark |publisher=Early Christian Writings |accessdate=15 January 2008 |last=Kirby |first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Achtemeier |first=Paul J. |encyclopedia=The Anchor Bible Dictionary |title=The Gospel of Mark |year=1992 |publisher=Doubleday |volume=4 |location=New York |isbn=0-385-19362-9 |page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Easton, M.

Scholars agree that the Gospel of John was written last, by using a different tradition and body of testimony. In addition, most scholars agree that the author of Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles. Scholars hold that these books constituted two halves of a single work, [[Luke-Acts]].

===Pauline epistles===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Pauline epistles}}
[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 17th-century painting. Most scholars think Paul actually dictated his letters to a secretary.]]
The Pauline epistles are the thirteen books in the New Testament traditionally attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus]]. The anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews is, despite unlikely Pauline authorship, often functionally grouped with these thirteen to form a corpus of fourteen "Pauline" epistles.{{refn|group=note|Although Hebrews was almost certainly not written by Paul, it has been a part of the Pauline corpus "from the beginning of extant MS production".&lt;ref name=hebot01&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Daniel B. |url=https://bible.org/seriespage/19-hebrews-introduction-argument-and-outline |title=Hebrews: Introduction, Argument, and Outline |publisher=Bible.org |date=28 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seven letters are generally classified as "undisputed", expressing contemporary scholarly near consensus that they are the work of Paul: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philemon. Six additional letters bearing Paul's name do not currently enjoy the same academic consensus: Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.{{refn|group=note|name="Lock, Meinertz p.622"|Guthrie lists: ohlenberg, Lock, Meinertz, Thornell, Schlatter, Spicq, [[Jeremais|Jeremias]], Simpson, Kelly, and Fee"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Guthrie|1990|p=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While many scholars uphold the traditional view, some question whether the first three, called the "Deutero-Pauline Epistles", are authentic letters of Paul. As for the latter three, the "Pastoral epistles", some scholars uphold the traditional view of these as the genuine writings of the Apostle Paul;&lt;ref group="note" name="Lock, Meinertz p.622"/&gt; most, however, regard them as [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigrapha]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman (2004), p. 385.{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One might refer to the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]] and the [[Third Epistle to the Corinthians]] as examples of works identified as pseudonymous. Since the early centuries of the church, there has been debate concerning the authorship of the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews, and contemporary scholars generally reject Pauline authorship.&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2004:411"/&gt;

The epistles all share common themes, emphasis, vocabulary and style; they exhibit a uniformity of doctrine concerning the [[Ten Commandments|Mosaic Law]], Jesus, faith, and various other issues. All of these letters easily fit into the chronology of Paul's journeys depicted in Acts of the Apostles.

===Other epistles===
The author of the [[Epistle of James]] identifies himself in the opening verse as "James, a servant of [[God]] and of the Lord [[Jesus]] Christ". From the middle of the 3rd century, [[patristic]] authors cited the ''Epistle'' as written by [[James the Just]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/j/james,epistle_of_st.html "Epistle of St. James"]. ''1914 Catholic Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient and modern scholars have always been divided on the issue of authorship. Many consider the epistle to be written in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlychristianwritings.com/james.html |title=Epistle of James |publisher=Early Christian Writings |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of the [[First Epistle of Peter]] identifies himself in the opening verse as "Peter, an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] of Jesus Christ", and the view that the epistle was written by St. Peter is attested to by a number of [[Church Fathers]]: [[Irenaeus]] (140–203), [[Tertullian]] (150–222), [[Clement of Alexandria]] (155–215) and [[Origen of Alexandria]] (185–253). Unlike [[The Second Epistle of Peter]], the authorship of which was debated in antiquity, there was little debate about Peter's authorship of this first epistle until the 18th century. Although 2 Peter internally purports to be a work of the apostle, many biblical scholars have concluded that Peter is not the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What Are They Saying About the Catholic Epistles? |first=Philip B. |last=Harner |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xenz0ZMWDNsC&amp;pg=PA49 |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2004|isbn=9780809141883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For an early date and (usually) for a defense of the Apostle Peter's authorship see Kruger,&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, M.J.

The Epistle of Jude title is written as follows: "Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James" ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]). The debate has continued over the author's identity as the apostle, the brother of Jesus, both, or neither.&lt;ref&gt;Bauckham, R. J. (1986). ''Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 50''. Word (UK) Ltd. p. 14f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johannine works===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
The [[First Epistle of John]] is traditionally held to have been composed by [[John the Apostle]] (the author of the [[Gospel of John]]) when the writer was in advanced age. The epistle's content, language and conceptual style indicate that it may have had the same author as the Gospel of John, 2 John and 3 John.&lt;ref name="Harris 1John"&gt;{{harvp|Harris|1985|loc="1 John"|pp=355–356}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] claimed that the author of 2nd and 3rd John was not [[John the Apostle]], but an "elder John" which refers either to the apostle at an advanced age or a hypothetical second individual ("[[John the Elder]]").&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. "Chapter 39". [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''The Church History, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars today are divided on the issue.

===Revelation===
The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] identifies himself several times as "John".{{Bibleref2c|Rev.|1:1,4,9;22:8||Rev.&amp;nbsp;1:1,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;9;&amp;nbsp;22:8}} and states that he was on [[Patmos]] when he received his first vision.{{Bibleref2c|Rev.|1:9;4:1-2||Rev.&amp;nbsp;1:9;&amp;nbsp;4:1-2}} As a result, the author is sometimes referred to as [[John of Patmos]]. The author has traditionally been identified with [[John the Apostle]] to whom the [[Gospel of John|Gospel]] and the [[epistles of John]] were attributed. It was believed that he was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]], and there wrote Revelation. [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100–165 AD) who was acquainted with [[Polycarp]], who had been mentored by John, makes a possible allusion to this book, and credits John as the source.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr. ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. Chapter LXXXI.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] (c. 115–202) assumes it as a conceded point. According to the ''Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible'', modern scholars are divided between the apostolic view and several alternative hypotheses put forth in the last hundred years or so.&lt;ref&gt;Tenney, Merrill C., gen. ed. (2009). "Revelation, Book of the". ''Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible, Vol. 5 (Q-Z)''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Witherington]] points out that linguistic evidence makes it unlikely that the books were written by the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben (2003). ''Revelation''. Cambridge University Press. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dates of composition==
:''See individual book articles for more detail.''
The earliest works that became part of the New Testament are the letters of the Apostle Paul. The earliest of the books of the New Testament was [[First Thessalonians]], an epistle of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], written probably in 51, or possibly [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] in 49 according to one of two theories of its writing.

In the 1830s German scholars of the [[Tübingen school]] tried to date the books as late as the 3rd century, but the discovery of some [[Biblical manuscript|New Testament manuscripts]] and fragments from the 2nd and 3rd centuries, one of which dates as early as 125 ([[Papyrus 52]]), disproves a 3rd-century date of composition for any book now in the New Testament. Additionally, a [[First Epistle of Clement|letter to the church at Corinth]] in the name of [[Clement I|Clement of Rome]] in 95 quotes from 10 of the 27 books of the New Testament, and a [[Polycarp's letter to the Philippians|letter to the church at Philippi in the name of Polycarp]] in 120 quotes from 16 books.  Therefore, some of the books of the New Testament must have been in circulation by the end of the first century.

Scholars hold a wide spectrum of views on exactly when the books of the new testament were written, with non-fundamentalist scholars tending to argue for later dates, and more conservative scholars arguing for an earlier one.  Most contemporary scholars regard [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] as a source used by Luke (see [[Marcan priority]]).&lt;ref&gt;Koester, Helmut (1999). ''Ancient Christian Gospels''. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Trinity Press International. p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; If it is true that Mark was written around the destruction of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]], around 70,&lt;ref name = "TM1998 Mark"&gt;Theissen, Gerd; Merz, Annette (1996). ''The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide''. Fortress Press. (1996 edition). p. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; they theorize that Luke would not have been written before 70. Some who take this view believe that Luke's prediction of the destruction of the temple could not be a result of Jesus predicting the future but with the benefit of hindsight regarding specific details. They believe that the [[Olivet Discourse]] in {{Bibleref2|Luke|21:5–30}} is specific enough (more specific than Mark's or Matthew's) that a date after 70 seems likely.&lt;ref name="ODCC self Matthew"&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. (2005). "Matthew, Gospel according to St". ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|S. Brown agrees that the references to the Jerusalem temple's destruction are seen as evidence of a post-70 date.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler. (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}} These scholars have suggested dates for Luke from 75 to 100.

Support for a later date comes from a number of reasons. Differences of chronology, "style", and theology suggest that the author of Luke-Acts was not familiar with [[Pauline Christianity|Paul's distinctive theology]] but instead was writing a decade or more after his death, by which point significant harmonization between different traditions within [[Early Christianity]] had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Luke-Acts has views on [[christology|Jesus' divine nature]], [[eschatology|the end times]], and [[soteriology|salvation]] that are similar to those found in [[Pastoral epistles]], which are often seen as [[pseudonym]]ous and of a later date than [[Authorship of the Pauline Epistles|the undisputed]] [[Pauline Epistles]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most conservative scholars however, argue that both [[internal evidence|internal]] and [[external evidence|external]] evidence strongly points to dates prior to 70 AD for the [[Synoptic Gospels]], [[Book of Acts|Acts]], and the [[Pauline Epistles]].  They note that there is no mention of the deaths of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[James the Just|James]], all of which happened between 60–65 AD, in any book of the New Testament.  These were all extremely important figures in the [[Early Christianity|early church]], writers would have mentioned their deaths if the New Testament had been written later.&lt;ref name ="Robinson" /&gt;  Furthermore, the Gospels contain numerous attacks on the [[Sadducees]], a sect of Judaism that was wiped out with the destruction of the temple.  Why, they ask, would later writers devote so much narrative space to attacking a group that no longer existed?&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite web

[[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John Robinson]] also notes that each book of the New Testament had to be written prior to the destruction of The Temple.  Robinson notes that most scholars interpret the [[Olivet Discourse]] as a post 70 AD account of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|destruction of The Temple]], couched in language to make it appear to be a prophecy, culminating in the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus to end the world.  Robinson notes that the Second Coming did not occur after the destruction of The Temple, leading him to ask, why would a writer in the 80s or 90s forge a prophecy of an event that is proven not to have occurred 20 years earlier?&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book| first = John Arthur Thomas | last = Robinson|title= Redating the New Testament|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CSMFAAAACAAJ|date= 1 October 2000| origyear = 1976 | publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock |isbn=978-1-57910-527-3 | author-mask = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{main article|Language of the New Testament}}
The major languages spoken by both Jews and Greeks in the [[Holy Land]] at the [[Cultural and historical background of Jesus|time of Jesus]] were [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]], and also a colloquial dialect of [[Mishnaic Hebrew]]. It is generally agreed by most scholars that the [[historical Jesus]] primarily spoke [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary|title=Aramaic|quote=It is generally agreed that Aramaic was the common language of Israel in the 1st century AD. Jesus and his disciples spoke the Galilean dialect, which was distinguished from that of Jerusalem (Matt. 26:73).|page=72|isbn=0-8028-2402-1|editor=Myers, Allen C. |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|publisher=William B. Eerdmans|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps also some [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek]]. The majority view is that all of the books that would eventually form the New Testament were written in the Koine Greek language.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce M.; Ehrman, Bart D. (2005). ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration''. 4th ed. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aland, K.; Aland, B. (1995). ''The Text of the New Testament''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|9780802840981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early centers of Christianity|As Christianity spread]], these books were later translated into other languages, most notably, [[Latin]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Coptic language|Egyptian Coptic]]. However, some of the [[Church Fathers]]&lt;ref&gt;Koester, Helmut (1982). ''Introduction to the New Testament, Volume 2''. Philadelphia. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; imply or claim that Matthew was originally written in [[Hebrew Gospel of Matthew|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic Matthew|Aramaic]], and then soon after was written in Koine Greek. Nevertheless, the Gospel of Matthew known today was composed in Greek and is neither directly dependent upon nor a translation of a text in a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. D.; Allison, Dale C. (1988). ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on The Gospel according to Saint Matthew, Vol. 1''. Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark. pp. 33–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the New Testament canon==
{{Main article|Development of the New Testament canon}}
The process of canonization of the New Testament was complex and lengthy. In the initial centuries of [[early Christianity]], there were many books widely considered by the church to be inspired, but there was no single formally recognized New Testament canon.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. "Chapter 25". [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''Church History, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt; The process was characterized by a compilation of books that [[Sacred tradition|apostolic tradition]] considered authoritative in worship and teaching, relevant to the historical situations in which they lived, and consonant with the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Harry Y. (1985). ''The New Testament Canon: Its Making and Meaning''. Guides to Biblical Scholarship. Philadelphia: Fortress.&lt;/ref&gt; Writings attributed to the apostles circulated among the [[Early centers of Christianity|earliest Christian communities]] and the Pauline epistles were circulating, perhaps in collected forms, by the end of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]].&lt;ref&gt;Three forms are postulated, from ''The Canon Debate'', chapter 18, page 300, note 21, attributed to Harry Y. Gamble: "(1) Marcion's collection that begins with Galatians and ends with Philemon; (2) Papyrus 46, dated about 200, that follows the order that became established except for reversing Ephesians and Galatians; and (3) the letters to seven churches, treating those to the same church as one letter and basing the order on length, so that Corinthians is first and Colossians (perhaps including Philemon) is last."&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest attempts at solidifying a canon was made by [[Marcion]], ''circa'' 140 AD, who accepted only a modified version of Luke (the [[Gospel of Marcion]]) and ten of Paul's letters, while rejecting the Old Testament entirely. His canon was increasingly rejected by other groups of Christians, notably the [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodox Christians]], as was his theology, [[Marcionism]]. [[Adolf Harnack]] in ''Origin of the New Testament'' (1914) observed that the church gradually formulated its New Testament canon in response to the challenge posed by Marcion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harnack |first=Adolf |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html |title=Origin of the New Testament |chapter=Appendix VI |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]] and [[Tertullian]] held the letters of Paul to be on par with the Hebrew Scriptures as being divinely inspired, yet others rejected him. Other books were held in high esteem but were gradually relegated to the status of [[New Testament apocrypha]]. Justin Martyr, in the mid [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], mentions "memoirs of the apostles" as being read on Sunday alongside the [[Nevi'im|"writings of the prophets"]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Justin Martyr. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm ''First Apology'']. Chapter 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Muratorian fragment]], dated at between 170 and as late as the end of the 4th century (according to the [[Anchor Bible Series#Anchor Bible Dictionary|Anchor Bible Dictionary]]), may be the earliest known New Testament canon attributed to mainstream Christianity. It is similar, but not identical, to the modern New Testament canon.

The oldest clear endorsement of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John being the only legitimate gospels was written ''circa'' 180 AD. A four gospel canon (the ''Tetramorph'') was asserted by Irenaeus, who refers to it directly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Everett |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kxW-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT345 |chapter=Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon |editor-last1=McDonald |editor-first1=L.

[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.xii.html "Chapter XI"]. ''Against Heresies, Book III''. Section 8.&lt;/ref&gt; in his [[polemic]] ''Against the Heresies'', "It is not possible that the gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are. For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, while the church is scattered throughout all the world, and the "pillar and ground" of the church is the gospel and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying men afresh."&lt;ref name=AHIII8/&gt; The books considered to be authoritative by Irenaeus included the four gospels and many of the letters of Paul, although, based on the arguments Irenaeus made in support of only four authentic gospels, some interpreters deduce that the fourfold Gospel must have still been a novelty in Irenaeus's time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=McDonald |editor-first1=L. M |editor-last2=Sanders |editor-first2=J. A. |year=2002 |title=The Canon Debate |publisher=Hendrickson |page=277 |ref={{harvid|McDonald|Sanders|2002}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origen (3rd century)===
By the early 200s, [[Origen]] may have been using the same twenty-seven books as in the Catholic New Testament canon, though there were still disputes over the canonicity of the Letter to the Hebrews, Epistle of James, II Peter, II John and III John and the Book of Revelation,&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Mark A. (1997). ''Turning Points''. Baker Academic. pp 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Antilegomena]]. Likewise, the [[Muratorian fragment]] is evidence that, perhaps as early as 200, there existed a set of Christian writings somewhat similar to the twenty-seven book NT canon, which included four gospels and argued against objections to them.&lt;ref&gt;de Jonge, H. J. (2003). "The New Testament Canon". In de Jonge, H. J.; Auwers, J. M (eds.). ''The Biblical Canons''. Leuven University Press. p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while there was a good measure of debate in the [[Early Church]] over the New Testament canon, the major writings are claimed to have been accepted by almost all Christians by the middle of the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of the Bible, Vol. 1 |author=Ackroyd, P. R.; Evans, C. F. (eds.) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1970 |page=308 |ref={{harvid|Ackroyd|Evans|1970}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Origen was largely responsible for the collection of usage information regarding the texts that became the New Testament. The information used to create the late-4th-century [[Easter Letter]], which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the ''Ecclesiastical History'' [HE] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origen's list at HE 6:25. Eusebius got his information about what texts were then accepted and what were then [[Antilegomena|disputed]], by the [[Early centers of Christianity|third-century churches throughout the known world]], a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, C. G. (2010). [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1653073 "Origen’s Role in the Formation of the New Testament Canon"]. Social Science Research Network.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Origen would have possibly included in his list of "inspired writings" other texts kept out by the likes of Eusebius—including the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[Shepherd of Hermas]], and [[1 Clement]]. Notwithstanding these facts, "Origen is not the originator of the idea of biblical canon, but he certainly gives the philosophical and literary-interpretative underpinnings for the whole notion."&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, John A. (2003). "Origen as Literary Critic in the Alexandrian Tradition". In Perrone, L. (ed.). ''Origeniana Octava: Origen and the Alexandrian Tradition, Vol. 1''. Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium 164. Leuven: Leuven University Press. pp. 121–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History===
[[Eusebius]], ''circa'' 300, gave a detailed list of New Testament writings in his ''Ecclesiastical History'' [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-08.htm#P1497_696002 Book 3], Chapter XXV:
: "1... First then must be put the holy quaternion of the gospels; following them the Acts of the Apostles... the epistles of Paul... the epistle of John... the epistle of Peter... After them is to be placed, if it really seem proper, the Book of Revelation, concerning which we shall give the different opinions at the proper time. These then belong among the accepted writings."

: "3 Among the disputed writings, which are nevertheless recognized by many, are extant the so-called epistle of James and that of Jude, also the second epistle of Peter, and those that are called the second and third of John, whether they belong to the evangelist or to another person of the same name. Among the rejected [Kirsopp Lake translation: "not genuine"] writings must be reckoned also the [[Acts of Paul]], and the so-called [[Shepherd of Hermas|Shepherd]], and the [[Apocalypse of Peter]], and in addition to these the extant [[epistle of Barnabas]], and the so-called [[Didache|Teachings of the Apostles]]; and besides, as I said, the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse of John]], if it seem proper, which some, as I said, reject, but which others class with the accepted books. And among these some have placed also the [[Gospel of the Hebrews|Gospel according to the Hebrews]]... And all these may be reckoned among the disputed books."

: "6... such books as the [[Gospel of Peter|Gospels of Peter]], of [[Gospel of Thomas|Thomas]], of [[Gospel of Matthias|Matthias]], or of any others besides them, and the [[Acts of Andrew]] and [[Acts of John|John]] and the other apostles... they clearly show themselves to be the fictions of heretics. Wherefore they are not to be placed even among the rejected writings, but are all of them to be cast aside as absurd and impious."

The Book of Revelation is counted as both accepted (Kirsopp Lake translation: "Recognized") and disputed, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so. From other writings of the church fathers, it was disputed with several canon lists rejecting its canonicity. EH 3.3.5 adds further detail on Paul: "Paul's fourteen epistles are well known and undisputed. It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, saying that it is disputed by the church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul." EH 4.29.6 mentions the [[Diatessaron]]: "But their original founder, Tatian, formed a certain combination and collection of the gospels, I know not how, to which he gave the title Diatessaron, and which is still in the hands of some. But they say that he ventured to paraphrase certain words of the apostle Paul, in order to improve their style."

===4th century and later===
In his Easter letter of 367, [[Athanasius]], Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of the books that would become the twenty-seven-book NT canon,&lt;ref name="LindbergCarter"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Christianity |first=Carter |last=Lindberg |page=15|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=1-4051-1078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he used the word "canonized" (''kanonizomena'') in regards to them.&lt;ref&gt;Brakke, David (Oct 1994). "Canon Formation and Social Conflict in Fourth Century Egypt: Athanasius of Alexandria's Thirty Ninth Festal Letter". ''Harvard Theological Review'' '''87''' (4): 395–419.&lt;/ref&gt; The first council that accepted the present canon of the New Testament may have been the [[Synod of Hippo|Synod of Hippo Regius]] in North Africa (393 AD); the acts of this council, however, are lost. A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the [[Council of Carthage (397)]] and the [[Council of Carthage (419)]].&lt;ref name=McDonaldD2&gt;{{harvp|McDonald|Sanders|2002|loc=Appendix D-2, note 19}} "Revelation was added later in 419 at the subsequent synod of Carthage."&lt;/ref&gt; These councils were under the authority of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], who regarded the canon as already closed.&lt;ref name=Ferguson320&gt;{{harvp|Ferguson|2002|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=F. F. |year=1988 |title=The Canon of Scripture |publisher=Intervarsity Press |page=230 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine. ''De Civitate Dei''. 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Damasus I]]'s [[Council of Rome]] in 382, if the ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above,&lt;ref name="LindbergCarter" /&gt; or, if not, the list is at least a 6th-century compilation.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1988 234"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Damasus' commissioning of the Latin [[Vulgate]] edition of the Bible, c. 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the West.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1988 225"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''c.'' 405, [[Pope Innocent I]] sent a list of the sacred books to a Gallic bishop, [[Exuperius|Exsuperius of Toulouse]]. Christian scholars assert that, when these [[bishops]] and councils spoke on the matter, however, they were not defining something new but instead "were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church."&lt;ref name=Ferguson320/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzger 1987 237–238"&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce |last=Metzger |title=The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origins, Development, and Significance |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon |year=1987 |pages=237–238 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament canon as it is now was first listed by [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria]], in 367, in a letter written to his churches in Egypt, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-93.htm Festal Letter 39]. Also cited is the [[Council of Rome]], but not without controversy. That canon gained wider and wider recognition until it was accepted at the [[Third Council of Carthage]] in 397 and 419.{{refn|group=note|The [[Book of Revelation]] wasn't added till the [[Council of Carthage (419)]].&lt;ref name=McDonaldD2/&gt;}}

Even this council did not settle the matter, however. Certain books, referred to as [[Antilegomena]], continued to be questioned, especially [[Epistle of James|James]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. Even as late as the 16th century, the Reformer [[Martin Luther]] questioned (but in the end did not reject) the [[Epistle of James]], the [[Epistle of Jude]], the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. To this day, German-language [[Luther Bible]]s are printed with these four books at the end of the canon, rather than in their traditional order as in other editions of the Bible.

In light of this questioning of the canon of Scripture by Protestants in the 16th century, the (Roman Catholic) [[Council of Trent]] reaffirmed the traditional western canon (i.e., the canon accepted at the 4th-century [[Council of Rome]] and [[Council of Carthage]]), thus making the [[Canon of Trent]] and the [[Vulgate]] Bible [[Roman Catholic Dogma|dogma]] in the Catholic Church. Later, [[Pope Pius XI]] on 2 June 1927 decreed the [[Comma Johanneum]] was open to dispute and [[Pope Pius XII]] on 3 September 1943 issued the encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', which allowed translations based on other versions than just the Latin [[Vulgate]], notably in English the [[New American Bible]].

Thus, some claim that, from the [[Christianity in the 4th century#Defining scripture|4th century]], there existed unanimity in the [[Western Church|West]] concerning the New Testament canon (as it is today),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, by the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], the [[Eastern Church]], with a few exceptions, had come to accept the [[Book of Revelation]] and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.&lt;ref name="P. R. Ackroyd and C. F. Evans, eds. 1970 305"&gt;{{harvp|Ackroyd|Evans|1970|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, full dogmatic articulations of the canon were not made until the [[Canon of Trent]] of 1546 for [[Roman Catholicism]], the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Calvinism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for the [[Greek Orthodox]].

On the question of NT Canon formation generally, New Testament scholar Lee Martin McDonald has written that:&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lee M. (1995). ''The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon''. Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Although a number of Christians have thought that [[church council]]s determined what books were to be included in the biblical canons, a more accurate reflection of the matter is that the councils recognized or acknowledged those books that had already obtained prominence from usage among the various early Christian communities.}}

Christian scholars assert that when these bishops and councils spoke on the matter, they were not defining something new, but instead "were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church".&lt;ref name="Metzger 1987 237–238"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce" /&gt;

Some synods of the 4th century published lists of canonical books (e.g. [[Synod of Hippo|Hippo]] and [[Council of Carthage|Carthage]]). The existing 27-book canon of the New Testament was reconfirmed (for [[Roman Catholicism]]) in the 16th century with the [[Council of Trent]] (also called the Tridentine Council) of 1546,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Metzger|1987|p=246}} "Finally on 8 April 1546, by a vote of 24 to 15, with 16 abstensions, the Council issued a decree (''De Canonicis Scripturis'') in which, for the first time in the history of the church, the question of the contents of the Bible was made an absolute article of faith and confirmed by an anathema."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Calvinism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Although these councils did include statements about the canon, when it came to the New Testament they were only reaffirming the existing canon, including the [[Antilegomena]].

According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on the Canon of the New Testament: "The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the [[Council of Trent|Tridentine Council]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=George |year=1908 |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm |chapter=Canon of the New Testament |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 331, [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine I]] commissioned Eusebius to deliver [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|fifty Bibles]] for the [[Church of Constantinople]]. [[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]] may be examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonald|Sanders|2002|pp=414–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence among the [[First Council of Nicaea#The biblical canon|canons of the First Council of Nicaea of any determination on the canon]].

==Early manuscripts==

{{Main article|New Testament manuscripts}}

Like other literature from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], the text of the New Testament was (prior to the advent of the [[printing press]]) preserved and transmitted in [[manuscripts]]. Manuscripts containing at least a part of the New Testament number in the thousands. The earliest of these (like manuscripts containing other literature) are often very fragmentarily preserved. Some of these fragments have even been thought to date as early as the 2nd century (i.e., [[Papyrus 90]], [[Papyrus 98]], [[Papyrus 104]], and famously [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], though the early date of the latter has recently been called into question).&lt;ref&gt;For the initial dating of P52, see Roberts, C. H. (ed.) (1935). ''An Unpublished Fragment of the Fourth Gospel in the John Rylands Library''. Manchester: Manchester University Press; and Bell, H. Idris; Skeat, T. C. (1935). ''Fragments of an Unknown Gospel and Other Early Christian Papyri''. London: Trustees of the British Museum. Though see now Nongbri, Brent (2005). "The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel". ''Harvard Theological Review'' '''98''': 23–52; and Martinez, David G. (2009). "The Papyri and Early Christianity". In Bagnall, Roger S. (ed.). ''The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 590–623.&lt;/ref&gt;

For each subsequent century, more and more manuscripts survive that contain a portion or all of the books that were held to be part of the New Testament at that time (for example, the New Testament of the 4th-century [[Codex Sinaiticus]], once a complete Bible, contains the [[Epistle of Barnabas]] and the [[Shepherd of Hermas]]), though occasionally these manuscripts contain other works as well (e.g., [[Papyrus 72]] and the Crosby-Schøyen Codex). The date when a manuscript was written, however, does not necessarily reflect the date of the form of text it contains. That is, later manuscripts can, and occasionally do, contain older forms of text or older readings.

Some of the more important manuscripts containing an early text of books of the New Testament are:

*The [[Chester Beatty Papyri]] (Greek; the New Testament portions of which were copied in the 3rd century)
*The [[Bodmer Papyri]] (Greek and Coptic; the New Testament portions of which were copied in the 3rd and 4th centuries)
*[[Codex Bobiensis]] (Latin; copied in the 4th century, but containing at least a 3rd-century form of text)
*[[Uncial 0171|Uncial '''0171''']] (Greek; copied in the late-third or early 4th century)
*[[Syriac Sinaiticus]] (Syriac; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Schoyen Collection|Schøyen Manuscript]] 2560 (Coptic; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Vaticanus]] (Greek; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Sinaiticus]] (Greek; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Vercellensis]] (Latin; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Curetonian Gospels]] (Syriac; copied in the 5th century)
*[[Garima Gospels]] ( [[Ge'ez language]], produced in the 5th through 6th century)

==Textual variation==
{{Main article|Textual variants in the New Testament|Textual criticism of the New Testament}}
[[Textual criticism]] deals with the identification and removal of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] errors in the [[Writing|texts]] of [[manuscripts]]. Ancient [[scribes]] made errors or alterations (such as including non-authentic [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|additions]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ehrman|2005|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament has been preserved in more than 5,800 [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Ethiopic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Even if the [[Greek New Testament|original Greek]] versions were lost, the entire New Testament could still be assembled from the translations.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"&gt;Strobel, Lee (1998). ''The Case for Christ''. Chapter Three, when quoting biblical scholar [[Bruce Metzger]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are so many quotes from the New Testament in early church documents and commentaries that the entire New Testament could also be assembled from these alone.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt; Not all biblical manuscripts come from orthodox Christian writers. For example, the [[Gnostic]] writings of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] come from the 2nd century AD, and these Christians were regarded as heretics by the mainstream church.&lt;ref name="Bruce, F.F. 1981 P 14"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=F.F. |year=1981 |title=The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable? |publisher=InterVarsity Press |page=14 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, but it also gives scholars a better idea of how close modern Bibles are to the original versions.&lt;ref name="Bruce, F.F. 1981 P 14"/&gt;

On noting the large number of surviving ancient manuscripts, [[Bruce Metzger]] sums up the view on the issue by saying "The more often you have copies that agree with each other, especially if they emerge from different geographical areas, the more you can cross-check them to figure out what the original document was like. The only way they'd agree would be where they went back genealogically in a family tree that represents the descent of the manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt;

===Interpolations===
In attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as additions of material, centuries after the gospel was written. These are called [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original. According to [[Bart D. Ehrman]], "These scribal additions are often found in late medieval manuscripts of the New Testament, but not in the manuscripts of the earlier centuries."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D. |authorlink=Bart D. Ehrman |year=2005 |title=Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why |titlelink=Misquoting Jesus |publisher=HarperCollins |page=265 |isbn=978-0-06-073817-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern Bibles have footnotes to indicate passages that have disputed source documents. Bible Commentaries also discuss these, sometimes in great detail. While many variations have been discovered between early copies of biblical texts, almost all have no importance, as they are variations in spelling, punctuation, or grammar. Also, many of these variants are so particular to the Greek language that they would not appear in translations into other languages. For example, order of words (i.e. "man bites dog" versus "dog bites man") often does not matter in Greek, so textual variants that flip the order of words often have no consequences.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt;

Outside of these unimportant variants, there are a couple variants of some importance. The two most commonly cited examples are the [[Mark 16|last verses]] of the ''Gospel of Mark''&lt;ref&gt;Nave, Guy D. ''The Role and Function of Repentance in Luke-Acts''. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spong, John Shelby (26 September 1979).

[[File:RossanoGospelsChristBeforePilate.jpg|thumb|The [[Rossano Gospels]], 6th century, a representative of [[Byzantine]] text.]]

The often referred to Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, a book written to prove the validity of the New Testament, says: " A study of 150 Greek [manuscripts] of the Gospel of Luke has revealed more than 30,000 different readings... It is safe to say that there is not one sentence in the New Testament in which the [manuscript] is wholly uniform."&lt;ref&gt;Parvis, M. M. Vol. 4. pp. 594–595.{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the variation took place within the first three Christian centuries.

===Text-types===
By the 4th century, textual "families" or types of text become discernible among [[biblical manuscript|New Testament manuscripts]]. A "text-type" is the name given to a family of texts with similar readings due to common ancestors and mutual correction. Many early manuscripts, however, contain individual readings from several different earlier forms of text. Modern texual critics have identified the following text-types among textual witnesses to the New Testament: The [[Alexandrian text-type]] is usually considered to generally preserve many early readings. It is represented, e.g., by [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and the [[Bodmer Papyri]].

The [[Western text-type]] is generally longer and can be paraphrastic, but can also preserve early readings. The [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of the Acts of the Apostles]] is, notably, 8.5% longer than the Alexandrian form of the text. Examples of the Western text are found in [[Codex Bezae]], [[Codex Claromontanus]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]], the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] (i.e., Latin translations made prior to the [[Vulgate]]), as well as in quotations by [[Marcion]], [[Tatian]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Cyprian]].

A text-type referred to as the "[[Caesarean text-type]]" and thought to have included witnesses such as [[Codex Koridethi]] and minuscule 565, can today be described neither as "Caesarean" nor as a text-type as was previously thought. However, the Gospel of Mark in [[Papyrus 45]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]] and in [[Family 13]] does indeed reflect a distinct type of text.

Increasing standardization of distinct (and once local) text-types eventually gave rise to the [[Byzantine text-type]]. Since most manuscripts of the New Testament do not derive from the first several centuries, that is, they were copied after the rise of the Byzantine text-type, this form of text is found the majority of extant manuscripts and is therefore often called the "Majority Text." As with all of the other (earlier) text-types, the Byzantine can also occasionally preserve early readings.

===Biblical criticism===
{{Main article|Biblical criticism}}
[[Biblical criticism]] is the scholarly "study and investigation of [[Biblical manuscript|biblical writings]] that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings." Viewing biblical texts as having human rather than supernatural origins, it asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey.

It will vary slightly depending on whether the focus is on the [[Old Testament]], the letters of the New Testament, or the [[Canonical Gospels]]. It also plays an important role in the quest for the [[historical Jesus]]. It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used, its preservation, history, and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines including [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[folklore]], [[linguistics]], [[Christian Oral Tradition|Oral Tradition studies]], history, and [[religious studies]].

===Establishing a critical text===
{{Main article|New Testament manuscripts}}
The [[#Textual variation|textual variation]] among manuscript copies of books in the New Testament prompted attempts to discern the earliest form of text already in antiquity (e.g., by the 3rd-century Christian author [[Origen]]). The efforts began in earnest again during the [[Renaissance]], which saw a revival of the study of ancient Greek texts. During this period, modern [[textual criticism]] was born. In this context, [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] such as [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Erasmus]] promoted a return to the original Greek of the New Testament. This was the beginning of modern [[New Testament textual criticism]], which over subsequent centuries would increasingly incorporate more and more manuscripts, in more languages (i.e., versions of the New Testament), as well as citations of the New Testament by ancient authors and the New Testament text in [[lectionary|lectionaries]] in order to reconstruct the earliest recoverable form of the New Testament text and the history of changes to it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger|Metzger, Bruce M.]]; [[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]] (2005). ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration''. 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to earlier and contemporaneous literature==
{{Further information|Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible}}
Books that later formed the New Testament, like other Christian literature of the period, originated in a literary context that reveals relationships not only to other Christian writings, but also to [[Classics|Graeco-Roman]] and [[Judaism#Antiquity|Jewish]] works. Of singular importance is the extensive use of and interaction with the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]] and what would become the [[Old Testament|Christian Old Testament]]. Both implicit and explicit citations, as well as countless allusions, appear throughout the books of the New Testament, from the Gospels and Acts, to the Epistles, to the Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Stendahl, Krister (1954). ''The School of St. Matthew and Its Use of the Old Testament''. Uppsala and Lund; Marcus, Joel (1993). ''The Way of the Lord: Christological Exegesis of the Old Testament in the Gospel of Mark''. Edinburgh; Smith, D. Moody (1972). "The Use of the Old Testament in the New". In ''The Use of the Old Testament in the New and Other Essays: Studies in Honor of William Franklin Stinespring''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press. pp. 3–65; [[Donald Juel|Juel, Donald]] (1988). ''Messianic Exegesis: Christological Interpretation of the Old Testament in Early Christianity''. Philadelphia: Fortress; and Barr, James (1966). ''Old and New in Interpretation: A Study of the Two Testaments''. London: SCM.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early versions==
The first translations (usually called "versions") of the New Testament were made beginning already at the end of 2nd century. The earliest versions of the New Testament are the translations into the [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Latin]], and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Võõbus|Võõbus, Arthur]] (1954). ''Early Versions of the New Testament''. Stockholm. pp. 1–128, 211–240.&lt;/ref&gt; These three versions were made directly from the Greek, and are frequently cited in the apparatuses of modern critical editions.

===Syriac===
{{Main article|Syriac versions of the Bible}}
[[File:RabulaGospelsFolio04vCanonTable.jpg|thumb|The [[Rabbula Gospels]], [[Eusebian Canons]].]]
Syriac was spoken in [[Syria]], and [[Mesopotamia]], and with dialect in [[Syria Palaestina|Roman]] and [[Palaestina Secunda|Byzantine Palestine]] where it was known as [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]]. Several Syriac translations were made and have come to us. Most of the Old Syriac, however, as well as the Philoxonian version have been lost.

[[Tatian]], the Assyrian, created the [[Diatessaron]], a [[gospel harmony]] written in Syriac around 170 AD and the earliest form of the gospel not only in Syriac but probably also in Armenian.

In the 19th century, manuscript evidence was discovered for an "Old Syriac" version of the four distinct (i.e., not harmonized) gospels. These "separated" (Syriac: ''da-Mepharreshe'') gospels, though old, have been shown to be later than the Diatessaron. The Old Syriac gospels are fragmentarily preserved in two manuscripts: the 5th-century [[Curetonian Gospels|Curetonian Syriac]] and the [[Syriac Sinaiticus|Sinaitic Syriac]] from the 4th or 5th century.

No Old Syriac manuscripts of other portions of the New Testament survive, though Old Syriac readings, e.g. from the [[Pauline Epistles]], can be discerned in citations made by Eastern fathers and in later Syriac versions. The Old Syriac version is a representative of the [[Western text-type]]. The [[Peshitta]] version was prepared in the beginning of the 5th century. It contains only 22 books (neither the [[General epistles|Minor Catholic Epistles]] of 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude, nor the [[Book of Revelation]] were part of this translation).

The [[Philoxenian]] probably was produced in 508 for [[Philoxenus, Bishop of Mabung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce M. Metzger |year=1977 |title=The Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=3–98 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin===
{{Main article|Vetus Latina|Vulgate}}
The Gospels were likely translated into Latin as early as the last quarter of the 2nd century in North Africa (''Afra''). Not much later, there were also European Latin translations (''Itala''). There are about 80 Old Latin mansucripts. The [[Vetus Latina]] ("Old Latin") versions often contain readings with a Western type of text. (For the avoidance of confusion, these texts were written in [[Late Latin]], not the early version of the Latin language known as [[Old Latin]], pre 75 BC.)

The bewildering diversity of the Old Latin versions prompted [[Jerome]] to prepare another translation into Latin&amp;nbsp;— the [[Vulgate]]. In many respects it was merely a revision of the Old Latin. There are currently around 8,000 manuscripts of the Vulgate.

===Coptic===
{{Main article|Coptic versions of the Bible}}
There are several dialects of the Coptic language: [[Bohairic]] (northern dialect), [[Fayyumic]], [[Sahidic]] (southern dialect), [[Akhmimic]], and others. The first translation was made by at least the 3rd century into the Sahidic dialect (cop&lt;sup&gt;sa&lt;/sup&gt;). This translation represents a mixed text, mostly [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]], though also with [[Western text-type|Western]] readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vööbus |first=Arthur |year=1954 |title=Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Stockholm |pages=216–229 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bohairic translation was made later, but existed already in the 4th century. Though the translation makes less use of Greek words than the Sahidic, it does employ some Greek grammar (e.g., in word-order and the use of particles such as the syntactic construction μεν&amp;nbsp;— δε). For this reason, the Bohairic translation can be helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vööbus|1954|pp=229–237}}; {{harvp|Metzger|1977|pp=99–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continued spread of Christianity, and the foundation of national churches, led to the translation of the Bible—often beginning with books from the New Testament—into a variety of other languages at a relatively early date: [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Ethiopic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Soghdian]], and eventually [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Church Slavonic language|Old Church Slavonic]], [[Arabic]], and [[Nubian languages|Nubian]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Gothic, see {{harvp|Vööbus|1954|loc=pp. 133–210, 243–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern translations==
{{Main article|Bible translations}}
[[Modern Literal Version]] is the most recent literal translation of the books of the new testament, with the largest number of translation experts being involved in the final translation.

Historically, throughout the [[Christendom|Christian world]] and in the context of [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary activity]], the New Testament (or portions thereof) has been that part of the Christian Bible first translated into the [[vernacular]]. The production of such translations grew out of the insertion of [[vernacular]] [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] in biblical texts, as well as out of the production of [[biblical paraphrase]]s and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ (e.g., the [[Heliand]]).

The 16th century saw the rise of [[Protestantism]] and an explosion of translations of the New (and Old) Testament into the [[vernacular]]. Notable are those of [[Luther Bible|Martin Luther]] (1522), [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] (1523), the [[Zürich Bible|Froschau Bible]] (1525–1529, revised in 1574), [[Tyndale Bible|William Tyndale]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536), the [[Brest Bible]] (1563), and the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized Version]] (also called the "King James Version") (1611).

Most of these translations relied (though not always exclusively) upon one of the printed editions of the Greek New Testament edited by [[Erasmus]], a form of this Greek text emerged as the standard and is known as the [[Textus Receptus]]. This text, based on the majority of manuscripts is also used in the majority of translations that were made in the years 100 to 400 AD.

Translations of the New Testament made since the appearance of critical editions of the Greek text (notably those of [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]], [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]], and [[Von Soden catalogue|von Soden]]) have largely used them as their [[Source text|base text]]. Unlike the [[Textus Receptus]], these have a pronounced Alexandrian character. Standard critical editions are those of [[Alexander Souter|Souter]], Vogels, Bover, Merk, and [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestlé-Aland]] (the text, though not the full critical apparatus of which is reproduced in the [[United Bible Societies]]' "Greek New Testament").

Notable translations of the New Testament based on these most recent critical editions include the [[Revised Standard Version]] (1946, revised in 1971), [[:fr:La Bible de Jérusalem|La Bible de Jérusalem]] (1961, revised in 1973 and 2000), the [[Einheitsübersetzung]] (1970, final edition 1979), the [[New American Bible]] (1970, revised in 1986), the [[Traduction Oecuménique de la Bible]] (1988, revised in 2004), and the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989).

==Theological interpretation in Christian churches==
{{Main article|Biblical authority}}
Though all Christian churches accept the New Testament as scripture, they differ in their understanding of the nature, extent, and relevance of its authority. Views of the authoritativeness of the New Testament often depend on the concept of ''[[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]]'', which relates to the role of God in the formation of the New Testament. Generally, the greater the role of God in one's doctrine of inspiration, the more one accepts the [[doctrine]] of [[biblical inerrancy]] or authoritativeness of the Bible. One possible source of confusion is that these terms are difficult to define, because many people use them interchangeably or with very different meanings. This article will use the terms in the following manner:
*''Infallibility'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in matters of doctrine.
*''Inerrancy'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in factual assertions (including historical and scientific assertions).
*''Authoritativeness'' relates to the correctness of the Bible in questions of practice in morality.

{{Quotation|The self-witness of the Bible to its inspiration demands a commitment to its unity. The ultimate basis for unity is contained in the claim of divine inspiration in {{Bibleref2|2tim|3:16||2&amp;nbsp;Timothy 3:16}} that "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (KJV). The term "inspiration" renders the Greek word ''theopneustos''. This term only occurs here in the New Testament and literally means "God-breathed" (the chosen translation of the NIV).&lt;ref name=Elwell&gt;Meadors, Gary T. (1997). [http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary/scripture-unity-and-diversity-of.html "Scripture, Unity and Diversity of"]. In Elwell, Walter A. (ed.). ''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.'' Grand Rapids: Baker Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

All of these concepts depend for their meaning on the supposition that the text of Bible has been properly interpreted, with consideration for the intention of the text, whether [[literal and figurative language|literal]] history, [[allegory]] or poetry, etc. Especially the doctrine of inerrancy is variously understood according to the weight given by the interpreter to scientific investigations of the world.

===Unity in diversity===
The notion of unity in diversity of Scripture claims that the Bible presents a noncontradictory and consistent message concerning God and redemptive history. The fact of diversity is observed in comparing the diversity of time, culture, authors' perspectives, literary genre, and the theological themes.&lt;ref name=Elwell/&gt;

Studies from many theologians considering the "unity in diversity" to be found in the New Testament (and the Bible as a whole) have been collected and summarized by New Testament theologian [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]]. He describes them as some basic presuppositions, tenets, and concerns common among the New Testament writers, giving to the New Testament its "unity in diversity":
#The reality of God is never argued but is always assumed and affirmed
#Jesus Christ is absolutely central: he is Lord and Savior, the foretold Prophet, the Messianic King, the Chosen, the way, the truth, and the light, the One through whom God the Father not only acted but through whom He came
#The Holy Spirit came anew with Jesus Christ.
#The Christian faith and life are a calling, rooted in divine election.
#The plight of everyone as sinner means that each person is completely dependent upon the mercy and grace of God
#Salvation is both God's gift and his demand through Jesus Christ, to be received by faith
#The death and resurrection of Jesus are at the heart of the total event of which he was the center
#God creates a people of his own, designated and described by varied terminology and analogies
#History must be understood eschatologically, being brought along toward its ultimate goal when the kingdom of God, already present in Christ, is brought to its complete triumph
#In Christ, all of God's work of creation, revelation, and redemption is brought to fulfillment&lt;ref name=Stagg&gt;Stagg, Frank (1962). ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Classical Anglicanism===
For the [[Roman Catholic Church]], there are two modes of Revelation: Scripture and [[Apostolic Tradition|Tradition]]. Both of them are interpreted by the teachings of the Church. The Roman Catholic view is expressed clearly in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (1997):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
§ 82: As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone. Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honoured with equal sentiments of devotion and reverence.
&lt;br /&gt;
§ 107: The inspired books teach the truth. Since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Catholic terminology the teaching office is called the [[Magisterium]].  The Catholic view should not be confused with the two-source theory.  As the Catechism states in §§ 80 and 81, Revelation has "one common source ... two distinct modes of transmission."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c2a2.htm "The Transmission of Divine Revelation"]. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. 2nd ed. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] writers distinguish between Scripture and Tradition, Bishop Kallistos Ware says that for the Orthodox there is only one source of the Christian faith, Holy Tradition, within which Scripture exists.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Kallistos (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2Z8bVDVMLEC&amp;pg=PT243 "Holy Tradition: The Source of the Orthodox Faith"].''The Orthodox Church''. Penguin UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]] believe that "Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation", (Article VI), but also that the Catholic Creeds "ought thoroughly to be received and believed" (Article VIII), and that the Church "hath authority in Controversies of Faith" and is "a witness and keeper of Holy Writ" (Article XX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |title=Articles of Religion |publisher=Anglicans Online |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Anglicanism, therefore, like Orthodoxy, holds that Holy Tradition is the only safe guardian against perversion and innovation in the interpretation of Scripture.

In the famous words of Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells: "As for my religion, I dye in the holy catholic and apostolic faith professed by the whole Church before the disunion of East and West, more particularly in the communion of the Church of England, as it stands distinguished from all Papal and Puritan innovations, and as it adheres to the doctrine of the Cross."

===Protestantism===
Following the doctrine of [[sola scriptura]], Protestants believe that their traditions of faith, practice and interpretations carry forward what the scriptures teach, and so tradition is not a source of authority in itself. Their traditions derive authority from the Bible, and are therefore always open to reëvaluation. This openness to doctrinal revision has extended in [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal]] Protestant traditions even to the reevaluation of the doctrine of Scripture upon which the Reformation was founded, and members of these traditions may even question whether the Bible is infallible in doctrine, inerrant in historical and other factual statements, and whether it has uniquely divine authority. However, the adjustments made by modern [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to their doctrine of scripture vary widely.

====American evangelical and fundamentalist Protestantism====
Within the US, the [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]] (1978) is a statement, articulating evangelical views on this issue. Paragraph four of its summary states: "Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault in all its teaching, no less in what it states about God's acts in creation, about the events of world history, and about its own literary origins under God, than in its witness to God's saving grace in individual lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html |title=The Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy |publisher=Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American mainline and liberal Protestantism====
[[Mainline (Protestant)|Mainline]] American [[Protestant]] denominations, including the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Presbyterian Church USA]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|The Episcopal Church]], and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], do not teach the doctrine of inerrancy as set forth in the Chicago Statement. All of these churches have more ancient doctrinal statements asserting the authority of scripture, but may interpret these statements in such a way as to allow for a very broad range of teaching—from evangelicalism to skepticism. It is not an impediment to ordination in these denominations to teach that the scriptures contain errors, or that the authors follow a more or less unenlightened ethics that, however appropriate it may have seemed in the authors' time, moderns would be very wrong to follow blindly.

For example, [[ordination of women]] is universally accepted in the mainline churches, [[abortion]] is condemned as a grievous social tragedy but not always a personal [[sin]] or a crime against an unborn person, and [[homosexuality]] is sometimes recognized as a genetic propensity or morally neutral preference that should be neither encouraged nor condemned. In North America, the most contentious of these issues among these churches at the present time is how far the ordination of gay men and lesbians should be accepted.

Officials of the Presbyterian Church USA report: "We acknowledge the role of scriptural authority in the Presbyterian Church, but Presbyterians generally do not believe in biblical inerrancy. Presbyterians do not insist that every detail of chronology or sequence or prescientific description in scripture be true in literal form. Our confessions do teach biblical infallibility. Infallibility affirms the entire truthfulness of scripture without depending on every exact detail."&lt;ref&gt;"Homosexual ordination vote widens gap between Presbyterian factions". ''ReligionToday''. 20 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who hold a more liberal view of the Bible as a human witness to the glory of God, the work of fallible humans who wrote from a limited experience unusual only for the insight they have gained through their inspired struggle to know God in the midst of a troubled world. Therefore, they tend not to accept such doctrines as inerrancy. These churches also tend to retain the social activism of their evangelical forebears of the 19th century, placing particular emphasis on those teachings of scripture that teach compassion for the poor and concern for [[social justice]].

The message of personal [[salvation]] is, generally speaking, of the good that comes to oneself and the world through following the New Testament's [[ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] admonition to love others without hypocrisy or prejudice. Toward these ends, the "spirit" of the New Testament, more than the letter, is infallible and authoritative.

There are some movements that believe the Bible contains the teachings of Jesus but who reject the churches that were formed following its publication. These people believe all individuals can communicate directly with God and therefore do not need guidance or doctrines from a church. These people are known as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].

===Messianic Judaism===
[[Messianic Judaism]] generally holds the same view of New Testament authority as evangelical Protestants.&lt;ref name = "Beit Simcha"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; According to the view of some Messianic Jewish congregations, Jesus did not annul the Torah, but that its interpretation is revised and ultimately explained through the Apostolic Scriptures.&lt;ref name="KehilatTNuvahSOF1"&gt;{{cite web

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] accept the New Testament as divinely inspired Scripture, and as infallible in every detail, with equal authority as the Hebrew Scriptures. They view it as the written revelation and good news of the [[Messiah]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|ransom sacrifice of Jesus]], and the [[Kingdom of God]], explaining and expounding the Hebrew Bible, not replacing but vitally supplementing it. They also view the New Testament as the primary instruction guide for Christian living, and [[church discipline]]. They generally call the New Testament the "Christian Greek Scriptures", and see only the "covenants" as "old" or "new", but not any part of the actual Scriptures themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Equipped For Every Good Work". Brooklyn, New York: Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc. International Bible Students Association. 1946. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Pentecostals===
[[Oneness Pentecostalism]] subscribes to the common Protestant doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]''. They view the Bible as the inspired Word of God, and as absolutely [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] in its contents (though not necessarily in every translation).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web |last=Raddatz |first=Tom |url=http://www.1lord1faith.org/wm/Oneness/1TrinDebate.htm |title=A Response to the Oneness-Trinity Debate |publisher=1Lord1Faith.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320000616/http://www.1lord1faith.org/wm/Oneness/1TrinDebate.htm |archivedate=20 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dulle, Jason. [http://www.onenesspentecostal.com/howgetbible.htm "How We Get Our Bible"]. Institute for Biblical Studies. Retrieved 15 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  They regard the New Testament as perfect and inerrant in every way, revealing the Lord Jesus Christ in the Flesh, and his Atonement, and which also explains and illuminates the Old Testament perfectly, and is part of the Bible canon, not because church councils or decrees claimed it so, but by witness of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Dulle, Jason.

===Seventh-Day Adventists===
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] holds the New Testament as the inspired Word of God, with God influencing the "thoughts" of the Apostles in the writing, not necessarily every word though.  The first fundamental belief of the Seventh-Day Adventist church stated that "The Holy Scriptures are the [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] revelation of [God's] will." [[Seventh-day Adventist theology|Adventist theologians]] generally reject the "verbal inspiration" position on Scripture held by many conservative [[evangelical Christians]]. They believe instead that God inspired the thoughts of the biblical authors and apostles, and that the writers then expressed these thoughts in their own words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe|author=Ministerial Association, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists |year=2005 |publisher=Pacific Press Publishing Association |edition=2nd |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is popularly known as "thought inspiration", and most Adventist members hold to that view. According to Ed Christian, former ''[[Journal of the Adventist Theological Society|JATS]]'' editor, "few if any [[Adventist Theological Society|ATS]] members believe in verbal inerrancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McLarty |first=John |url=http://www.atoday.com/magazine/2001/11/adventist-theological-society-0 |title=The Adventist Theological Society |work=Adventist Today |date=15 November 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225063148/http://www.atoday.com/magazine/2001/11/adventist-theological-society-0 |archivedate=25 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the teachings of the New Testament compared to the Old, and the application in the New Covenant, Adventists have traditionally taught that the [[Ethical Decalogue|Decalogue]] is part of the moral law of God, which was not abrogated by the ministry and death of [[Jesus Christ]]. Therefore, the fourth commandment concerning the Sabbath is as applicable to Christian believers as the other nine. Adventists have often taught a distinction between "moral law" and "ceremonial law". According to Adventist beliefs, the moral law continues into the "New Testament era", but the ceremonial law was done away with by Jesus.

How the [[Mosaic law]] should be applied came up at Adventist conferences in the past, and Adventist theologians such as [[A. T. Jones]] and [[E. J. Waggoner]] looked at the problem addressed by Paul in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] as not the ceremonial law, but rather the wrong use of the law ([[legalism (theology)|legalism]]). They were opposed by [[Uriah Smith]] and [[George Ide Butler|George Butler]] at the 1888 Conference. Smith in particular thought the Galatians issue had been settled by Ellen White already, yet in 1890 she claimed justification by faith is "the [[Three Angels' Messages|third angel's message]] in verity."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Ellen White interpreted {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:14|NIV}} as saying that the ceremonial law was nailed to the cross.&lt;ref&gt;White, Ellen (2015). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yKqXCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT409 ''Patriarchs and Prophets'']. Start Publishing LLC. p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter-day Saints===
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) believe that the New Testament, as part of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], is accurate "as far as it is translated correctly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mormon.org/articles-of-faith |title=Articles of Faith |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe the Bible as originally revealed is the word of God, but that the processes of transcription and translation have introduced errors into the texts as currently available, and therefore they cannot be regarded as completely inerrant.&lt;ref name="Givens2015"&gt;{{cite book|first=Terry L.|last=Givens|title=The Oxford Handbook of Mormonism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0fCgAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-977836-2|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LDSInerrancy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/bible-inerrancy-of?lang=eng|title=Bible, Inerrancy of|date=2016|publisher=The Church of the Latter Day Saints|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Old and New Testaments, the [[Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ|Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]] are considered part of their scriptural canon.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Macmillan 1992, pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PaulsenMusser2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Lamont Paulsen|author2=Donald W.

==In the liturgy==
[[File:Codex Harcleianus.PNG|thumb|right|A Byzantine lectionary, ''[[Lectionary 150|Codex Harleianus]]'' (''l''&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;), 995 AD, text of John 1:18.]] Despite the wide variety among [[Christian liturgy|Christian liturgies]], texts from the New Testament play a role in almost all forms of [[Christian worship]]. In addition to some language derived from the New Testament in the [[liturgy]] itself (e.g., the [[Trisagion]] may be based on Apocalypse 4:8, and the beginning of the "Hymn of Praise" draws upon Luke 2:14), the reading of extended passages from the New Testament is a practice common to almost all [[Christian worship]], liturgical or not.

These [[Lection|readings]] are most often part of an established [[lectionary]] (i.e., [[Lection|selected texts]] to be read at church services on specific days), and (together with an Old Testament reading and a [[Psalms (Christian)|Psalm]]) include a non-gospel reading from the New Testament and culminate with a [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel reading]]. No readings from the [[Book of Revelation]], however, are included in the standard [[lectionary]] of the [[Orthodox church|Eastern Orthodox churches]].

Central to the [[Christian liturgy]] is the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] or "Holy Communion". The [[Words of Institution]] that begin this rite are drawn directly from 1 Corinthians 11:23–26. In addition, the communal recitation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] (in the form found in the Gospel of Matthew 6:9–13) is also a standard feature of [[Christian worship]].

The [[Early Christian art|earliest Christian art]] would often depict scenes from the New Testament such as the [[raising of Lazarus]], the [[baptism of Jesus]] or the motif of the [[Good Shepherd]].

[[Biblical paraphrase]]s and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ (e.g., the [[Heliand]]) became popular in the [[Middle Ages]], as did the portrayal of the [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest]], [[Trial of Jesus|trial]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|execution]] of Jesus in [[Passion play]]s. Indeed, the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] became a central theme in Christian [[Crucifixion in the arts|art]] and [[Passion (music)|music]]. The [[:Category:Portrayals of Jesus in film|ministry]] and [[Passion (Christianity)#Film|Passion]] of Jesus, as portrayed in one or more of the [[:Category:Films based on the Gospels|New Testament Gospels]], has also been a theme in film, almost since the inception of the medium (e.g., "La Passion", France, 1903).

'''''Overcoming Life's Disappointments''''' ({{ISBN|1-4000-3336-5}}) is a 2006 book by [[Harold Kushner]], a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[rabbi]].  Kushner addresses in the book the question of how to cope when disappointing things happen to you. He uses Biblical examples, such as how Moses coped with being denied entrance to The Promised Land, as well as secular examples, such as how Abraham Lincoln coped with depression. The emphasis is on the common disappointments faced by many throughout life, such as the breakup of a marriage, death of a loved one, loss of a job, or financial reversals.

Rabbi Kushner's book was a ''New York Times'' bestseller for many months in the "nonfiction" category.

It has been introduced in 2001 by Lions, Maday and Turinici. Since then, it has become one of the most widely studied parallel-in-time integration methods {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

== Parallel-in-time integration methods ==

In contrast to e.g. [[Runge–Kutta methods|Runge-Kutta]] or [[Linear multistep method|multi-step]] methods, some of the computations in Parareal can be performed [[Parallel computing|in parallel]] and
Parareal is therefore one example of a ''parallel-in-time'' integration method.
While historically most efforts to parallelize the [[Numerical partial differential equations|numerical solution]] of [[partial differential equation]]s focussed on the spatial discretization, in view of the challenges from [[exascale computing]], parallel methods for [[temporal discretization]] have been identified as a possible way to increase concurrency in [[List of numerical analysis software|numerical software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

Because Parareal computes the numerical solution for multiple time steps in parallel, it is categorized as a ''parallel across the steps'' method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Parareal can be derived as both a [[multigrid method]] in time method or as [[Direct multiple shooting method|multiple shooting]] along the time axis.&lt;ref name="gander2007"&gt;{{cite journal

== Algorithm ==
[[File:Parareal Animation.ogg|thumb|708x708px|Visualization of the Parareal algorithm. The coarse propagator here is labelled &lt;math&gt;\bar{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; whereas the fine propagator is labelled &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.]]
Parareal solves an initial value problem of the form

&lt;math&gt; \dot{y}(t) = f(y(t), t), \quad y(t_0) = y_0 \quad \text{with} \quad t_0 \leq t \leq T.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the right hand side &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can correspond to the spatial discretization of a partial differential equation in a [[method of lines]] approach.

Parareal now requires a [[Domain decomposition methods|decomposition]] of the time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_0, T]&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; so-called time slices &lt;math&gt;[t_j, t_{j+1}]&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt; [t_0, T] = [t_0, t_1] \cup [t_1, t_2] \cup \ldots \cup [t_{P-1}, t_{P} ].&lt;/math&gt;

Each time slice is assigned to one processing unit when parallelizing the algorithm, so that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number of processing units used for Parareal: in an [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] based code for example, this would be the number of processes, while in an [[OpenMP]] based code, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; would be equal to the number of [[Thread (computing)|threads]].

Parareal is based on the iterative application of two methods for [[Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations|integration of ordinary differential equations]].
One, commonly labelled &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, should be of high accuracy and computational cost while the other, typically labelled &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;, must be computationally cheap but can be much less accurate. 
Typically, some form of Runge-Kutta method is chosen for both coarse and fine integrator, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; might be of lower order and use a larger time step than &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.
If the initial value problem stems from the discretization of a PDE, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; can also use a coarser spatial discretization, but this can negatively impact convergence unless high order interpolation is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruprecht|first=Daniel|date=2014-12-01|title=Convergence of Parareal with spatial coarsening|journal=PAMM|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1031–1034|doi=10.1002/pamm.201410490|issn=1617-7061|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/90536/1/paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The result of numerical integration with one of these methods over a time slice &lt;math&gt;[t_{j}, t_{j+1}]&lt;/math&gt; for some starting value &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; given at &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; is then written as

&lt;math&gt; y = \mathcal{F}(y_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) &lt;/math&gt;   or   &lt;math&gt;y = \mathcal{G}(y_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) &lt;/math&gt;.

Serial time integration with the fine method would then correspond to a step-by-step computation of

&lt;math&gt; y_{j+1} = \mathcal{F}(y_j, t_j, t_{j+1}), \quad j=0, \ldots, P-1.&lt;/math&gt;

Parareal instead uses the following iteration

&lt;math&gt; y_{j+1}^{k+1} = \mathcal{G}(y^{k+1}_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) + \mathcal{F}(y^k_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) - \mathcal{G}(y^k_j, t_j, t_{j+1}), \quad j=0, \ldots, P-1, \quad k=0, \ldots, K-1,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the iteration counter. 
As the iteration converges and &lt;math&gt;y^{k+1}_j - y^k_j \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, the terms from the coarse method cancel out and Parareal reproduces the solution that is obtained by the serial execution of the fine method only.
It can be shown that Parareal converges after a maximum of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; iterations.&lt;ref name="gander2007" /&gt;
For Parareal to provide speedup, however, it has to converge in a number of iterations significantly smaller than the number of time slices, that is &lt;math&gt;K \ll P&lt;/math&gt;.

In the Parareal iteration, the computationally expensive evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(y^k_j, t_j, t_{j+1})&lt;/math&gt; can be performed in parallel on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; processing units.
By contrast, the dependency of &lt;math&gt;y^{k+1}_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}(y^{k+1}_j, t_j, t_{j+1})&lt;/math&gt; means that the coarse correction has to be computed in serial order.

===Speedup===
Under some assumptions, a simple theoretical model for the [[Amdahl's law|speedup]] of Parareal can be derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last       = Minion
| first      = Michael L.
| date       = 2010
| title      =  A Hybrid Parareal Spectral Deferred Corrections Method
| journal    = Communications in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science
| volume     = 5
| issue      =  2
| pages      = 265–301
| bibcode    = 
| doi        = 10.2140/camcos.2010.5.265
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although in applications these assumptions can be too restrictive, the model still is useful to illustrate the trade offs that are involved in obtaining speedup with Parareal.

First, assume that every time slice &lt;math&gt;[t_j, t_{j+1}]&lt;/math&gt; consists of exactly &lt;math&gt;N_f&lt;/math&gt; steps of the fine integrator and of &lt;math&gt;N_c&lt;/math&gt; steps of the coarse integrator.
This includes in particular the assumption that all time slices are of identical length and that both coarse and fine integrator use a constant step size over the full simulation.
Second, denote by &lt;math&gt;\tau_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; the computing time required for a single step of the fine and coarse methods, respectively, and assume that both are constant.
This is typically not exactly true when an [[Temporal discretization#Implicit Time Integration|implicit]] method is used, because then runtimes vary depending on the number of iterations required by the [[Iterative method|iterative solver]].

Under these two assumptions, the runtime for the fine method integrating over &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; time slices can be modelled as

&lt;math&gt; c_{\text{fine}} = P N_{f} \tau_f. &lt;/math&gt;

The runtime of Parareal using &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; processing units and performing &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; iterations is

&lt;math&gt; c_{\text{parareal}} = (K+1) P N_{c} \tau_c + K N_{f} \tau_f. &lt;/math&gt;

Speedup of Parareal then is

&lt;math&gt; S_{p} = \frac{c_{\text{fine}}}{c_{\text{parareal}}} = \frac{1}{ (K+1) \frac{N_c}{N_f} \frac{\tau_c}{\tau_f} + \frac{K}{P}} \leq \min\left\{ \frac{N_f \tau_f}{N_c \tau_c}, \frac{P}{K}  \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

These two bounds illustrate the trade off that has to be made in choosing the coarse method: on the one hand, it has to be cheap and/or use a much larger time step to make the first bound as large as possible, on the other hand the number of iterations &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has to be kept low to keep the second bound large.
In particular, [[Speedup#Additional Details|Parareal's parallel efficiency]] is bounded by

&lt;math&gt; E_{p} = \frac{S_p}{P} \leq \frac{1}{K},&lt;/math&gt;

that is by the inverse of the number of required iterations.

=== Instability for imaginary eigenvalues ===
The vanilla version of Parareal has issues for problems with imaginary [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]].&lt;ref name="gander2007" /&gt; It typically only converges toward the very last iterations, that is as &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and the speedup &lt;math&gt; S_p&lt;/math&gt; is always going to be smaller than one.  So either the number of iterations is small and Parareal is unstable or, if &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is large enough to make Parareal stable, no speedup is possible. This also means that Parareal is typically unstable for [[Hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic]] equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stability of the Parareal Algorithm|last=Staff|first=Gunnar Andreas|last2=Rønquist|first2=Einar M.|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540225232|editor-last=Barth|editor-first=Timothy J.|series=Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering|pages=449–456|language=en|doi=10.1007/3-540-26825-1_46|editor-last2=Griebel|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last3=Keyes|editor-first3=David E.|editor-last4=Nieminen|editor-first4=Risto M.|editor-last5=Roose|editor-first5=Dirk|editor-last6=Schlick|editor-first6=Tamar|editor-last7=Kornhuber|editor-first7=Ralf|editor-last8=Hoppe|editor-first8=Ronald|editor-last9=Périaux|editor-first9=Jacques}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the formal analysis by Gander and Vandewalle covers only linear problems with constant coefficients, the problem also arises when Parareal is applied to the nonlinear [[Navier-stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]] when the [[viscosity]] coefficient becomes too small and the [[Reynolds number]] too large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Convergence of Parareal for the Navier-Stokes Equations Depending on the Reynolds Number|last=Steiner|first=Johannes|last2=Ruprecht|first2=Daniel|last3=Speck|first3=Robert|last4=Krause|first4=Rolf|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319107042|editor-last=Abdulle|editor-first=Assyr|series=Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering|pages=195–202|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-10705-9_19|editor-last2=Deparis|editor-first2=Simone|editor-last3=Kressner|editor-first3=Daniel|editor-last4=Nobile|editor-first4=Fabio|editor-last5=Picasso|editor-first5=Marco|citeseerx = 10.1.1.764.6242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different approaches exist to stabilise Parareal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dai|first=X.|last2=Maday|first2=Y.|date=2013-01-01|title=Stable Parareal in Time Method for First- and Second-Order Hyperbolic Systems|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=35|issue=1|pages=A52–A78|doi=10.1137/110861002|issn=1064-8275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farhat|first=Charbel|last2=Cortial|first2=Julien|last3=Dastillung|first3=Climène|last4=Bavestrello|first4=Henri|date=2006-07-30|title=Time-parallel implicit integrators for the near-real-time prediction of linear structural dynamic responses|journal=International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering|language=en|volume=67|issue=5|pages=697–724|doi=10.1002/nme.1653|issn=1097-0207|bibcode=2006IJNME..67..697F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Use of Reduced Basis Methods to Accelerate and Stabilize the Parareal Method|last=Chen|first=Feng|last2=Hesthaven|first2=Jan S.|last3=Zhu|first3=Xueyu|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319020891|editor-last=Quarteroni|editor-first=Alfio|series=MS&amp;A - Modeling, Simulation and Applications|pages=187–214|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-02090-7_7|editor-last2=Rozza|editor-first2=Gianluigi|url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/190666}}&lt;/ref&gt; one being Krylov-subspace enhanced Parareal.

Early on it was recognised that for linear problems information generated by the fine method &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\delta t}&lt;/math&gt; can be used to improve the accuracy of the coarse method &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Originally, the idea was formulated for the parallel implicit time-integrator PITA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farhat|first=Charbel|last2=Chandesris|first2=Marion|date=2003-11-07|title=Time-decomposed parallel time-integrators: theory and feasibility studies for fluid, structure, and fluid–structure applications|journal=International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering|language=en|volume=58|issue=9|pages=1397–1434|doi=10.1002/nme.860|issn=1097-0207|bibcode=2003IJNME..58.1397F}}&lt;/ref&gt; a method closely related to Parareal but with small differences in how the correction is done. In every iteration &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; the result &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\delta t}(y^k_j)&lt;/math&gt; is computed for values &lt;math&gt;u^k_j \in \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=0, \ldots, P-1&lt;/math&gt;. Based on this information, the [[Vector space|subspace]]

&lt;math&gt;
S_k := \left\{ y^{k'}_j : 0 \leq k' \leq k, j=0, \ldots, P-1 \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

is defined and updated after every Parareal iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gander|first=M.|last2=Petcu|first2=M.|title=Analysis of a Krylov subspace enhanced parareal algorithm for linear problems|journal=ESAIM: Proceedings|volume=25|pages=114–129|doi=10.1051/proc:082508|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denote as &lt;math&gt; P_k&lt;/math&gt; the [[orthogonal projection]] from &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; S_k&lt;/math&gt;. Then, replace the coarse method with the improved integrator &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{K}_{\Delta t}(y) = \mathcal{F}_{\delta t}(P_k y) + \mathcal{G}_{\Delta t}((I-P_k)y)&lt;/math&gt;.

As the number of iterations increases, the space &lt;math&gt; S_k&lt;/math&gt; will grow and the modified propagator &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{K}_{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; will become more accurate. This will lead to faster convergence. This version of Parareal can also stably integrate linear hyperbolic partial differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruprecht|first=D.|last2=Krause|first2=R.|date=2012-04-30|title=Explicit parallel-in-time integration of a linear acoustic-advection system|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045793012000709|journal=Computers &amp; Fluids|volume=59|pages=72–83|doi=10.1016/j.compfluid.2012.02.015|arxiv=1510.02237}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extension to nonlinear problems based on the reduced basis method exists as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Hybrid Parareal spectral deferred corrections ===
A method with improved parallel efficiency based on a combination of Parareal with spectral deferred corrections (SDC) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutt|first=Alok|last2=Greengard|first2=Leslie|last3=Rokhlin|first3=Vladimir|date=2000-06-01|title=Spectral Deferred Correction Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations|journal=BIT Numerical Mathematics|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=241–266|doi=10.1023/A:1022338906936|issn=0006-3835}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed by M. Minion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minion|first=Michael|date=2011-01-05|title=A hybrid parareal spectral deferred corrections method|url=http://msp.org/camcos/2010/5-2/p05.xhtml|journal=Communications in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science|volume=5|issue=2|pages=265–301|doi=10.2140/camcos.2010.5.265|issn=2157-5452}}&lt;/ref&gt; It limits the choice for coarse and fine integrator to SDC, sacrificing flexibility for improved parallel efficiency. Instead of the limit of &lt;math&gt;1/K&lt;/math&gt;, the bound on parallel efficiency in the hybrid method becomes

&lt;math&gt;E_p \leq \frac{K_s}{K_p}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt; being the number of iterations of the serial SDC base method and &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; the typically greater number of iterations of the parallel hybrid method. The Parareal-SDC hybrid has been further improved by addition of a ''full approximation scheme''  as used in nonlinear [[Multigrid method|multigrid]]. This led to the development of the ''parallel full approximation scheme in space and time'' (PFASST).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emmett|first=Matthew|last2=Minion|first2=Michael|date=2012-03-28|title=Toward an efficient parallel in time method for partial differential equations|url=http://msp.org/camcos/2012/7-1/p04.xhtml|journal=Communications in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science|volume=7|issue=1|pages=105–132|doi=10.2140/camcos.2012.7.105|issn=2157-5452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance of PFASST has been studied for PEPC, a [[Barnes–Hut simulation|Barnes-Hut]] tree code based particle solver developed at [[Jülich Supercomputing Centre|Juelich Supercomputing Centre]].

=== Multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) ===
The multigrid reduction in time method (MGRIT) generalises the interpretation of Parareal as a multigrid-in-time algorithms to multiple levels using different smoothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falgout|first=R.|last2=Friedhoff|first2=S.|last3=Kolev|first3=T.|last4=MacLachlan|first4=S.|last5=Schroder|first5=J.|date=2014-01-01|title=Parallel Time Integration with Multigrid|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=36|issue=6|pages=C635–C661|doi=10.1137/130944230|issn=1064-8275|citeseerx=10.1.1.701.2603}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a more general approach but for a specific choice of parameters it is equivalent to Parareal. The [http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/parallel-time-integration-multigrid XBraid] library implementing MGRIT is being developed by [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].

=== ParaExp ===
ParaExp uses [[exponential integrator]]s within Parareal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gander|first=M.|last2=Güttel|first2=S.|date=2013-01-01|title=PARAEXP: A Parallel Integrator for Linear Initial-Value Problems|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=35|issue=2|pages=C123–C142|doi=10.1137/110856137|issn=1064-8275|citeseerx=10.1.1.800.5938}}&lt;/ref&gt; While limited to linear problems, it can produce almost optimal parallel speedup.

Some theoretical concepts about plasma cosmology originated with [[Hannes Alfvén]], who tentatively&lt;ref name="Alfvenpu1987"&gt;{{cite journal

Cosmologists and astrophysicists who have evaluated plasma cosmology have rejected it because it does not match the observations of astrophysical phenomena as well as current cosmological theory. Very few papers supporting plasma cosmology have appeared in the literature since the mid-1990s.

The term ''plasma universe'' is sometimes used as a synonym for plasma cosmology,&lt;ref name="Peratt1992"/&gt; as an alternative description of the plasma in the universe.&lt;ref name=Alfven1990 /&gt;

|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Alfvén–Klein cosmology, sometimes called Klein–Alfvén cosmology, the universe is made up of equal amounts of matter and [[antimatter]] with the boundaries between the regions of matter and antimatter being delineated by cosmic [[electromagnetic fields]] formed by [[Double layer (plasma physics)|double layers]], thin regions comprising two parallel layers with opposite electrical charge. Interaction between these boundary regions would generate radiation, and this would form the plasma. Alfvén introduced the term ambiplasma for a plasma made up of matter and antimatter and the double layers are thus formed of ambiplasma. According to Alfvén, such an ambiplasma would be relatively long-lived as the component particles and antiparticles would be too hot and too low-density to annihilate each other rapidly. The double layers will act to repel clouds of opposite type, but combine clouds of the same type, creating ever-larger regions of matter and antimatter. The idea of ambiplasma was developed further into the forms of heavy ambiplasma (protons-antiprotons) and light ambiplasma (electrons-positrons).&lt;ref name="Alfven1966" /&gt;

Alfvén–Klein cosmology was proposed in part to explain the observed [[baryon asymmetry]] in the universe, starting from an [[initial condition]] of exact [[symmetry]] between matter and antimatter. According to Alfvén and Klein, ambiplasma would naturally form pockets of matter and pockets of antimatter that would expand outwards as annihilation between matter and antimatter occurred in the double layer at the boundaries. They concluded that we must just happen to live in one of the pockets that was mostly [[baryon]]s rather than [[antibaryon]]s, explaining the baryon asymmetry. The pockets, or bubbles, of matter or antimatter would expand because of annihilations at the boundaries, which Alfvén considered as a possible explanation for the observed [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], which would be merely a local phase of a much larger history. Alfvén postulated that the universe has always existed &lt;ref name="Alfven1988"&gt;{{cite web

In 1993, theoretical cosmologist [[Jim Peebles]] criticized Alfvén–Klein cosmology, writing that "there is no way that the results can be consistent with the isotropy of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] and [[X-ray background]]s".&lt;ref name="Peebles1993"&gt;{{cite book

|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book he also showed that Alfvén's models do not predict [[Hubble's law]], [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|the abundance of light elements]], or the existence of the [[cosmic microwave background]]. A further difficulty with the ambiplasma model is that matter–antimatter [[annihilation]] results in the production of high energy [[photon]]s, which are not observed in the amounts predicted. While it is possible that the local "matter-dominated" cell is simply larger than the [[observable universe]], this proposition does not lend itself to observational tests.

Hannes Alfvén from the 1960s to 1980s argued that plasma played an important if not dominant role in the universe because [[electromagnetic force]]s are far more important than [[gravity]] when acting on interplanetary and interstellar [[charged particle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Alfvén and C.-G. Falthammar, ''Cosmic electrodynamics''(2nd edition, Clarendon press, Oxford, 1963). "The basic reason why electromagnetic phenomena are so important in cosmical physics is that there exist celestial magnetic fields which affect the motion of charged particles in space ... The strength of the interplanetary magnetic field is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; gauss (10 [[nanotesla]]s), which gives the [ratio of the magnetic force to the force of gravity] ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. This illustrates the enormous importance of interplanetary and interstellar magnetic fields, compared to gravitation, as long as the matter is ionized." (p.2-3)&lt;/ref&gt; He further hypothesized that they might promote the contraction of [[interstellar cloud]]s and may even constitute the main mechanism for contraction, initiating [[star formation]].&lt;ref name="Alfven1978" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfvén | first1 = H. | last2 = Carlqvist | first2 = P. | year = 1978 | title = Interstellar clouds and the formation of stars | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1978Ap%26SS..55..487A&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c30728 | journal = Astrophysics and Space Science | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 487–509 | bibcode=1978Ap&amp;SS..55..487A|doi = 10.1007/BF00642272 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current standard view is that magnetic fields can hinder collapse, that large-scale [[Birkeland current]]s have not been observed, and that the length scale for charge neutrality is predicted to be far smaller than the relevant cosmological scales.&lt;ref name="Siegel2006" &gt;{{cite document |author= Siegel, E.

For example, Peratt proposed that the mainstream approach to galactic dynamics which relied on gravitational modeling of stars and gas in galaxies with the addition of dark matter was overlooking a possibly major contribution from plasma physics. He mentions laboratory experiments of [[Winston H. Bostick]] in the 1950s that created plasma discharges that looked like galaxies.&lt;ref name="Peratt1986b"&gt;{{cite journal |author=A.

==Comparison to mainstream astrophysics==
Standard astronomical modeling and theories attempt to incorporate all known [[physics]] into descriptions and explanations of observed phenomena, with [[Gravitation|gravity]] playing a dominant role on the largest scales as well as in [[celestial mechanics]] and [[Stellar dynamics|dynamics]]. To that end, both [[Keplerian]] orbits and [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]] are generally used as the underlying frameworks for modeling astrophysical systems and [[structure formation]], while [[high-energy astronomy]] and [[particle physics in cosmology]] additionally appeal to [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] processes including plasma physics and [[radiative transfer]] to explain relatively small scale energetic processes observed in the [[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s. In conventional cosmology, [[plasma physics]] is not considered to be the dominant force on most large-scale phenomena, although much of the matter in the universe is thought to be ionised or exist as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. (See [[astrophysical plasma]] for more.)

Proponents of plasma cosmology claim electrodynamics is as important as gravity in explaining the structure of the universe, and speculate that it provides an alternative explanation for the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|evolution of galaxies]]&lt;ref name=Peratt1986 /&gt; and the initial collapse of interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name=Alfven1978 /&gt; In particular plasma cosmology is claimed to provide an alternative explanation for the flat [[galaxy rotation curve|rotation curves]] of spiral galaxies and to do away with the need for [[dark matter]] in galaxies and with the need for [[supermassive black holes]] in galaxy centres to power [[quasars]] and [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]].&lt;ref name="Peratt1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peratt1986 /&gt; However, theoretical analysis shows that "many scenarios for the generation of seed magnetic fields, which rely on the survival and sustainability of currents at early times [of the universe are disfavored]",&lt;ref name=Siegel2006 /&gt; i.e. Birkeland currents of the magnitude needed (10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; amps over scales of megaparsecs) for galaxy formation do not exist.&lt;ref name="Colafrancesco2006" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colafrancesco | first1 = S. | last2 = Giordano | first2 = F. | year = 2006 | title = The impact of magnetic field on the cluster M - T relation | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume = 454 | issue = 3| pages = L131–134 | bibcode=2006A&amp;A...454L.131C | doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20065404|arxiv = astro-ph/0701852 }} recount: "Numerical simulations have shown that the wide-scale magnetic fields in massive clusters produce variations of the cluster mass at the level of ~ 5 − 10% of their unmagnetized value ... Such variations are not expected to produce strong variations in the relative [mass-temperature] relation for massive clusters."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many of the issues that were mysterious in the 1980s and 1990s, including discrepancies relating to the [[cosmic microwave background]] and the nature of [[quasars]], have been solved with more evidence that, in detail, provides a distance and time scale for the universe.

Some of the places where plasma cosmology supporters are most at odds with standard explanations include the need for their models to have light element production without [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], which, in the context of Alfvén–Klein cosmology, has been shown to produce excessive [[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s beyond that observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 0 | last1 = et al | year = 1985 | title = Big Bang Photosynthesis and Pregalactic Nucleosynthesis of Light Elements | url = http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1985ApJ...293L..53A | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 293 | issue = | pages = L53–L57 | bibcode=1985ApJ...293L..53A|doi = 10.1086/184490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | display-authors = etal   | year = 1976 | title = The origin of deuterium | doi = 10.1038/263198a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 263 | pages = 198–202|bibcode = 1976Natur.263..198E }} point out that if proton fluxes with energies greater than 500 MeV were intense enough to produce the observed levels of deuterium, they would also produce about 1000 times more gamma rays than are observed.&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma cosmology proponents have made further proposals to explain light element abundances, but the attendant issues have not been fully addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Ref. 10 in "Galactic Model of Element Formation" (Lerner, ''IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science'' Vol. 17, No. 2, April 1989 [http://www.health-freedom.info/pdf/Galactic%20Model%20of%20Element%20Formation.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229074857/http://www.health-freedom.info/pdf/Galactic%20Model%20of%20Element%20Formation.pdf |date=2006-12-29 }}) is J.Audouze and J.Silk, "Pregalactic Synthesis of Deuterium" in ''Proc. ESO Workshop on "Primordial Helium"'', 1983, pp. 71-75 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983prhe.work...71A] Lerner includes a paragraph on "Gamma Rays from D Production" in which he claims that the expected gamma ray level is consistent with the observations. He cites neither Audouze nor Epstein in this context, and does not explain why his result contradicts theirs.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Eric Lerner published his alternative explanation for the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = Eric | date = 1995 | title = Intergalactic Radio Absorption and the COBE Data | url = http://www.photonmatrix.com/pdf/Intergalactic%20Radio%20Absorption%20And%20The%20COBE%20Data.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Astrophysics and Space Science | volume = 227 | issue =  | pages = 61–81 | doi = 10.1007/bf00678067 | bibcode = 1995Ap&amp;SS.227...61L | access-date = 2012-05-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715083205/http://www.photonmatrix.com/pdf/Intergalactic%20Radio%20Absorption%20And%20The%20COBE%20Data.pdf | archive-date = 2011-07-15 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that his model explained the fidelity of the CMB spectrum to that of a black body and the low level of anisotropies found, even while the level of isotropy at 1:10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; is not accounted for to that precision by any alternative models. Additionally, the sensitivity and resolution of the measurement of the CMB anisotropies was greatly advanced by [[WMAP]] and the [[Planck satellite]] and the statistics of the signal were so in line with the predictions of the Big Bang model, that the CMB has been heralded as a major confirmation of the Big Bang model to the detriment of alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spergel | first1 = D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15492">'''Progress tests''' are longitudinal, feedback oriented [[educational assessment]] tools for the evaluation of development and sustainability of cognitive knowledge during a learning process. A progress test is a written knowledge exam (usually involving multiple choice questions) that is usually administered to all students in the "A" program at the same time and at regular intervals (usually twice to four times yearly) throughout the entire academic program. The test samples the complete knowledge domain expected of new graduates upon completion of their courses, regardless of the year level of the student). The differences between students’ knowledge levels show in the test scores; the further a student has progressed in the curriculum the higher the scores. As a result, these resultant scores provide a longitudinal, repeated measures, curriculum-independent assessment of the objectives (in knowledge) of the entire programme.&lt;ref name=MT18_103&gt;van der Vleuten CPM, Verwijnen GM, Wijnen WHFW. 1996.

==History==
Since its inception in the late 1970s at both [[Maastricht University]] &lt;ref name=MT18_103/&gt; and the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] &lt;ref&gt;Arnold L, Willoughby TL. 1990. The quarterly profile examination. Academic Medicine 65(8):515–516.&lt;/ref&gt; independently, the progress test of applied knowledge has been increasingly used in medical and health sciences programs across the globe. They are well established and increasingly used in [[medical education]] in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. They are used formatively and summatively.

==Use in academic programs==

Retrieved 18 July 2011, from http://ipptx.org/&lt;/ref&gt; involving faculties in Ireland, Australia, Canada, Portugal and the West Indies.

The progress test serves several important functions in academic programs. Considerable empirical evidence from medical schools in the Netherlands, Canada, United Kingdom and Ireland, as well postgraduate medical studies and schools in dentistry and psychology have shown that the longitudinal feature of the progress test provides a unique and demonstrable measurement of the growth and effectiveness of students’ knowledge acquisition throughout their course of study

As a result, this information can be consistently used for diagnostic, remedial and prognostic teaching and learning interventions.  In the Netherlands, these interventions have been aided by the provision of a web-based results feedback system known as ProF &lt;ref&gt;Muijtjens, A. M.

Medical Teacher, 32, 491-495.&lt;/ref&gt; in which students can compare their results with their peers across different total and subtotal score perspectives, both across and within universities.

Additionally, the longitudinal data can serve as a transparent quality assurance measure for program reviews by providing an evaluation of the extent to which a school is meeting its curriculum objectives.&lt;ref name=MT18_103/&gt;&lt;ref name=MT32_503/&gt;&lt;ref name=MT27_514&gt;Verhoeven, B.

The versatility of progress testing assessed in an international context: a start for benchmarking global standardization? Medical Teacher, 27(6), 514-520.&lt;/ref&gt; The test also provides more reliable data for high-stakes assessment decisions by using measures of continuous learning rather than a one-shot method (Schuwirth, 2007).  Inter-university progress testing collaborations provide a means of improving the cost-effectiveness of assessments by sharing a larger pool of items, item writers, reviewers, and administrators. The collaborative approach adopted by the Dutch and other consortia has enabled the progress test to become a benchmarking instrument by which to measure the quality of educational outcomes in knowledge. The success of the progress test in these ways has led to consideration of developing an international progress test.&lt;ref name=MT27_514/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schauber, S., &amp; Nouns, Z. B. (2010). Using the cumulative deviation method for cross-institutional benchmarking in the Berlin progress test. Medical Teacher, 32, 471-475.&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits for all main stakeholders in a medical or health sciences programme make the progress test an appealing tool to invest resources and time for inclusion in an assessment regime. This attractiveness is demonstrated by its increasingly widespread use in individual medical education institutions and inter-faculty consortia around the world, and by its use for national and international benchmarking practices.

==Advantages==
Progress tests provide a rich source of information: the comprehensive nature in combination with the cross-sectional and longitudinal design offers a wealth of information both for individual learners as well as for curriculum evaluations.&lt;ref name=MT18_103/&gt;

Progress Testing fosters knowledge retention: the repeated testing of the same comprehensive domain of knowledge means that there is no point testing facts that could be remembered if studied the night before. Long term knowledge and knowledge retention is fostered because item content remains relevant long after the knowledge has been learned. Progress Testing removes the need for resit examinations: every new test occasion is a renewed opportunity to demonstrate growth of knowledge.

Progress Testing allows early detection of high achievers: some learners perform (far) beyond the expected level of their phase in training (e.g. they might have had relevant previous other training) and, depending on their performance, individual and more speeded pathways through the curriculum could be offered.

Progress Testing brings stability in assessment procedures: curriculum changes, changes in content, have no consequence for the progress test provided the end outcomes are unchanged.

Progress Testing provides excellent benchmarking opportunities: progress tests are not limited to a single school nor to PBL curricula and evaluations can easily be done to compare graduates and the effectiveness of different curriculum approaches.

==Disadvantages==
Naturally, there are disadvantages. The required resources for test development and scoring and the need for a central organization are two very important ones.

Scoring,&lt;ref&gt;Muijtjens AM, Mameren HV, Hoogenboom RJ, Evers JL, van der Vleuten CP. 1999. The effect of a ‘don’t know’ option on test scores: Number-right and formula scoring compared. Medical Education 33(4):267–275.&lt;/ref&gt; psychometric procedures &lt;ref&gt;Shen L. 2000. Progress testing for postgraduate medical education: A four year experiment of American College of Osteopathic Surgeons Resident Examinations. Advances in Health Sciences Education: Theory and Practice 5(2):117–129&lt;/ref&gt; for reducing test difficulty variation and standard setting procedures &lt;ref&gt;Verhoeven BH, Snellen-Balendong HA, Hay IT, Boon JM, van der Linde MJ, Blitz-Lindeque JJ, Hoogenboom RJI, Verwijnen GM, Wijnen WHFW, Scherpbier AJJA, et al. 2005. The versatility of progress testing assessed in an international context: A start for benchmarking global standardization? Medical Teacher 27(6):514–520&lt;/ref&gt; are more complex in progress testing.

Finally progress tests do not work in heterogeneous programs with early specialization (like in many health sciences programs). In more homogenous programs, such as most medical programs, they work really well and pay off in relation to driving learning and use of resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4858">The '''QED manifesto''' was a proposal for a computer-based database of all [[mathematics|mathematical]] knowledge, strictly formalized and with all proofs having been [[automated proof checking|checked automatically]]. ([[Q.E.D.]] means {{lang|la|quod erat demonstrandum}} in [[Latin]], meaning "which was to be demonstrated.") 

==Overview==
The idea for the project arose in 1993, mainly under the impetus of [[Robert S. Boyer|Robert Boyer]]. The goals of the project, tentatively named ''QED project'' or ''project QED'', were outlined in the QED manifesto, a document first published in 1994, with input from several researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/TypesSS05/Extra/wiedijk_2.pdf The QED Manifesto] in ''Automated Deduction - CADE 12'', Springer-Verlag, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 814, pp. 238-251, 1994. [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/qed/qed.html HTML version]&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit authorship was deliberately avoided. A dedicated mailing list was created, and two scientific conferences on QED took place, the first one in 1994 at [[Argonne National Laboratories]] and the second in 1995 in [[Warsaw]] organized by the [[Mizar system|Mizar]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mizar.org/people/romat/qed95rep.pdf The QED Workshop II report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project seems to have died in 1996, never having produced more than discussions and plans. In a 2007 paper, Freek Wiedijk identifies two reasons for the failure of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Freek Wiedijk, [http://mizar.org/trybulec65/8.pdf The QED Manifesto Revisited], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In order of importance:
* Very few people are working on formalization of mathematics. There is no compelling application for fully mechanized mathematics.
* [[Formalized mathematics]] does not yet resemble real, traditional mathematics. This is partly due to the complexity of mathematical notation, and partly to the limitations of existing [[Automated theorem prover|theorem provers]] and [[proof assistant]]s; the paper finds that the major contenders, [[Mizar system|Mizar]], [[HOL theorem prover family|HOL]], and [[Coq]], have serious shortcomings in their abilities to express mathematics.

Nonetheless, QED-style projects are regularly proposed, and the [[Mizar system|Mizar]] library has successfully formalized a large portion of undergraduate mathematics. {{As of|2007}} it is the largest such library.&lt;ref&gt;Fairouz Kamareddine, Manuel Maarek, Krzysztof Retel, and J. B. Wells, ''[http://mizar.org/trybulec65/7.pdf Gradual Computerisation/Formalisation of Mathematical Texts into Mizar]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another such project is the [[Metamath]] proof database.

In 2014 the Twenty years of the QED Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.ru.nl/qed20/QED-index.html Twenty years of the QED Manifesto workshop]&lt;/ref&gt; workshop was organized as part of the [[Vienna Summer of Logic]].

'''Rent control in the United States''' refers to laws or ordinances that set [[price control]]s on the [[renting]] of American residential [[Apartment|housing]]. They function as a [[price ceiling]].{{ r | GPG }}

The loose term "rent control" can apply to several types of price control:
* "strict price ceilings", also known as "'''rent freeze'''" systems, or "'''absolute'''" or "'''first generation'''" rent controls, in which no increases in rent are allowed at all (rent is typically frozen at the rate existing when the law was enacted) 
* "vacancy control", also known as "'''strict'''" or "'''strong'''" rent control, in which the rental price can rise, but continues to be regulated in between tenancies (a new [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] pays almost the same rent as the previous tenant) and 
* "vacancy decontrol", also known as "'''tenancy'''" or "'''second-generation'''" rent control, which limits price increases during a tenancy, but allows rents to rise to market rate between tenancies (new tenants pay market rate rent, but increases are limited as long as they remain).{{ r | GPG }}

As of 2018, four states ([[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Maryland]]) and the [[District of Columbia]] have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding [[Mobile home|mobile homes]]).{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}  Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while nine states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}

==History==
In the [[United States]] during [[World War I]], rents were "controlled" through a combination of public pressure and the efforts of local anti-rent-profiteering committees. Between 1919 and 1924, a number of cities and states adopted rent- and eviction-control laws.  Modern rent controls were first adopted in response to [[World War II|WWII]]-era shortages, or following [[Richard Nixon]]'s 1971 wage and price controls.  They remain in effect or have been reintroduced in some cities with large [[leasehold estate|tenant]] populations, such as [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Oakland, California]]. Many smaller communities also have rent control — notably the [[California]] cities of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]]&lt;ref name="dca.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/appendix2.shtml|title=Landlord/Tenant Book - California Department of Consumer Affairs|first=Department of Consumer Affairs, State of|last=California|website=www.dca.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; — along with many small towns in [[New Jersey]]. In the early 1990s, rent control in some cities, such as [[Boston]] and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], was ended by state [[referendum|referenda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |vauthors= |title=Massachusetts Election Statistics 1994: Ballot Question #9 |year= 1994|publisher= [Boston?] : The Division|quote= | url=https://archive.org/stream/massachusettsele1994mass#page/522/mode/2up |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===

[[New York State]] has had the longest [[Rent control in New York|history of rent controls]], since 1943. New York City contains the majority of units covered by rent control. Rent control laws have stayed on the books for decades in New York because of an inadequate supply of "decent, affordable housing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenant.net/Oversight/50yrRentReg/history.html|title=History of Rent Regulation|website=www.tenant.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worsening in the rental market led to the enactment of the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969, which aimed to help increase the number of available rental units. The current system is very complicated, and most of the protected renters are elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metcouncil.net/factsheets/rentcontrol.htm|title=Rent Control Fact Sheet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

In California, municipal enactment of rent controls followed the high [[inflation]] of the 1970s (causing rents to continually rise){{ r | Birth_of_RC_in_SF | p=1 | q=Inflation averaged 8 percent in the Bay Area during the 1970s; renters were forced to pay rents that were changing monthly as the dollar devalued and the demand for hard assets, especially real estate, grew. Deinstfrey called it mailbox roulette, for tenants never knew what kind of huge rent increase might be waiting for them in the mail. }} and the 1979 statewide [[Proposition 13]], which set [[property tax]] rates at 1%, and capped yearly increases at 2%. Leading the campaign to enact Proposition 13, California politician [[Howard Jarvis]] tried to get tenants to vote for Prop 13 by claiming that landlords would pass tax savings along to tenants; when most failed to do so, it became an additional motivating factor for rent control.{{ r | Birth_of_RC_in_SF | p=2 | q=Proposition 13 threw fuel on the fire. One of Howard Jarvis&amp;apos; arguments for rolling back and rapidly freezing escalating property taxes (an inflation-induced mess, too) was that the savings would be passed onto tenants. Although several large San Francisco property owners passed Proposition 13 savings on to some 7,000 tenants, most landlords did not. In jurisdictions with large tenant populations like San Francisco, the empty promises became a rallying cry for activists. }}

In 2018, a statewide [[initiative]] (Proposition 10) attempted to repeal the Costa-Hawkins law, which, if passed, would have allowed cities and municipalities to enact "strong" or "vacancy control" systems, allowed rent control to be applied to buildings newer than 1995, and would have allowed rent control on single-family homes. (All currently prohibited by Costa-Hawkins.){{ r | SJMN_RC_failed | p=1 | q=Prop. 10 took aim at a decades-old state law that prohibits cities from enforcing certain types of rent control. Without that law, cities would have had the power to place price caps on rented single family homes, condominiums and apartment buildings constructed after 1995 — or in the case of cities with older rent-control policies, such as Oakland and San Francisco, apartments built after the late 1970s or early 1980s. Under current state law, those units cannot be subject to rent control. ... In addition to expanding the types of properties that would fall under rent control, Prop. 10 would have let cities permanently cap the price of an apartment, allowing only modest increases even after tenants move out. That policy, known as vacancy control, was used decades ago in a handful of cities including Berkeley, East Palo Alto and Santa Monica before California passed the Costa-Hawkins law banning it. Currently, landlords can raise prices to market rates after a tenant in a rent-controlled unit leaves. Vacancy control would have immediately taken effect in Berkeley if Prop. 10 passed, as it has remained on the books, unenforced, for more than two decades. }} The proposition failed, 62% to 38%.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Dillon, [http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-hold-proposition-10-rent-control-1541029296-htmlstory.html "California voters reject Prop. 10"], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 6, 2018.

===Mobile homes===

In some regions, rent control laws are more commonly adopted for [[mobile home]] parks.  Reasons given for these laws include residents owning their homes while renting the land the home sits on, the high cost of moving mobile homes, and the loss of home value when they are moved. California, for example, has only 13 local apartment rent control laws but over 100 local mobile home rent control laws.{{citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Statements are very likely true, but need references to back up the numbers. }}  No new mobile home parks have been built in California since 1991.{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Statements may be true, but need references to prove the claims, and a reference to prove that the non-building of mobile home parks is BECAUSE OF rent control; otherwise this statement is irrelevant to this article. }}

==Law==
Rent control laws define which rental units are affected, and may only cover larger complexes, or units older than a certain date. To attempt to not disincentivise investment in new housing stock, rent control laws often exempt new construction.  For example, San Francisco's Rent Stabilization Ordinance exempts all units built after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/rentboard_page.asp?id=54501|title=San Francisco Rent Board: Fact Sheet 1 – General Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York State]] generally exempts units built after 1974 anywhere in the state (although owners can agree to rent stabilization in exchange for tax benefits).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dhcr.state.ny.us/ora/pubs/html/orafac1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

The frequency and degree of rent increases are limited, usually to the rate of inflation defined by the [[Consumer Price Index]] or to a fraction thereof. San Francisco, for example, allows annual rent increases of 60% of the CPI, up to a maximum 7%.&lt;ref&gt;

Rent control laws are often administered by nonelected rent control boards. Officers in city government assign members of the board, which will ensure mixed numbers of tenants and property owners to balance out their benefits. As stated in Goodman's research, a typical rent control board in New York is structured by two tenants, two landlords, and one homeowner.(Gilderbloom &amp; Markham,1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9906.1996.tb00388.x|title=Moderate Rent Control: Sixty Cities over 20 Years|journal=Journal of Urban Affairs|volume=18|issue=4|pages=409–430|year=2016|last1=Gilderbloom|first1=John I.|last2=Markham|first2=John P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal law===
Rent regulation in the [[United States]] is an issue for each state. In 1921, the [[US supreme court|US Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Block v. Hirsh]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|256|135|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; held by a majority that regulation of rents in the District of Columbia as a temporary emergency measure was constitutional, but shortly afterwards in 1924 in ''[[Chastleton Corp v. Sinclair]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|264|543|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same law was unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court.  After the 1930s [[New Deal]], the Supreme Court ceased to interfere with social and economic legislation, and a growing number of states adopted rules.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The application was often inconsistent. For example, in [[New York City]], almost half of property units continue to have the protection of rent regulation, while other units on the private market are left to be priced according to what the market will bear.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt; {{ cite web | last=Beyer | first=Scott | date=April 24, 2015 | title=How Ironic: America's Rent-Controlled Cities Are Its Least Affordable | publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/04/24/how-ironic-americas-rent-controlled-cities-are-its-least-affordable/ |accessdate=12 June 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501001409/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/04/24/how-ironic-americas-rent-controlled-cities-are-its-least-affordable/ | archive-date=2015-05-01 | dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 case of ''[[Fisher v. City of Berkeley]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|475|260|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the US Supreme court held that there was no incompatibility between rent control and the [[Sherman Act]].

===State law===
As of 2018, four states ([[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Maryland]]) and the [[District of Columbia]] have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding [[Mobile home|mobile homes]]).{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}  Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while nine states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}

==Arguments for==

===Economic===
The rental-accommodation market suffers from [[asymmetrical information|information asymmetries]] and high [[transaction costs]]. Typically, a landlord has more information about a home than a prospective tenant can reasonably detect. Moreover, once the tenant has moved in, the costs of moving again are very high.  Unscrupulous landlords could conceal defects and, if the tenant complains, threaten to raise the rent at the end of the [[lease]]. With rent control, tenants can request that hidden defects, if they exist, be repaired to comply with [[building code]] requirements, without fearing retaliatory rent increases. Rent control could thus compensate somewhat for inefficiencies of the housing market.{{ r | GPG | p=1 | q=Another justification is to correct market inefficiencies such as information asymmetry and high transaction costs. Because of the high cost of moving, tenants can arguably be pressured by landlords to accept rent increases. Tenants may also be unaware of the real condition of units until they move in. If the tenant complains, the landlord may threaten to increase the rent. }} &lt;ref name=R_vU-S &gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0166-0462(01)00093-X |title=A model of regulation in the rental housing market |journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=475–500 |year=2002 |last1=Raess |first1=Pascal |last2=von Ungern-Sternberg |first2=Thomas }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In older buildings, rent control may broaden incentives to renovate individual units: tenants may invest [[sweat equity]] and their own money to improve their homes if they are protected from landlords trying to capture the added value,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Kx8-Lz5K1YYC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=%22sweat+equity%22+%22rent+control%22 | title = Community versus Commodity: Tenants and the American City | isbn = 9780791498439 | author1 = Čapek | first1 = Stella M | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LMLT_history &gt; {{ cite web | url=http://www.lmlt.org/lmlt1.html | doi= | title=Background history | last= | first= | publisher=Lower Manhattan Loft Tenants | date=2002-01-01 | accessdate= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629051939/http://www.lmlt.org/lmlt1.html | archive-date=2012-06-29 | dead-url=yes | pages= | quote=As early as the mid-1960s, artists began pioneering the economically-depressed manufacturing zone of lower Manhattan known as SoHo where they found affordable "raw" or "as is" spaces large enough to both live and work (ie: lofts). Delighted to receive rent for these often abandoned, derelict spaces, commercial property owners welcomed and encouraged the residential occupancy of their buildings. Using sweat equity, artists renovated their leased lofts converting them into habitable living/working studios, installing plumbing and electrical fixtures along with other improvements--generally at their own expense. The City, which was equally delighted by the stabilization of the property tax base, turned a blind eye to the fact that none of these buildings had a residential Certificate of Occupancy. }} &lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=August 2018|reason=The second source does not support the statement; these tenants improved their units even though they had no rent-control; technically they were living there illegally. }} while vacancy decontrol preserves landlords' financial incentive to renovate vacant units because it allows them to re-rent at market value.

===Moral===

Tenants' rights activists argue that rent control is necessary in times of long term housing shortages (See [[California housing shortage]]) to reduce the human suffering caused by increasing rents and the homelessness which results when people who can no longer afford the rent increases get evicted.{{r | SD_RC_Tenant_Union | p=1 | q=... the projections show that even building at maximum capacity, the county will not be able to catch up and there will still be a 152,000-housing-unit shortage in 2050. ... Unless San Diego gets rent control, greedy landlords and government officials will be directly responsible for the rampant creation of homelessness and increased worker suffering. }}

==Arguments against==
Writing in 1946, economists [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George J. Stigler]] said: "Rent ceilings, therefore, cause haphazard and arbitrary allocation of space, inefficient use of space, retardation of new construction and indefinite continuance of rent ceilings, or subsidization of new construction and a future depression in residential building."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fee.org/library/books/roofs-or-ceilings-the-current-housing-problem/|title=Roofs or Ceilings? The Current Housing Problem - Milton D. Friedman|first=Milton D.|last=Friedman|date=21 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although those paying lower than market rent are "protected," most economists argue that newer residents actually pay higher rent due to reduced supply.

===Economic===
In a 1992 [[Stratified sampling|stratified]], random survey of 464 US economists, economics [[graduate school|graduate students]], and members of the [[American Economic Association]], 93% "generally agreed" or "agreed with [[wikt:proviso|provisos]]" that "A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available."{{ r | 1992_poll | p=204 | q=76.3% generally agreed, 16.6% agreed but with provisos }} {{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=The analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and -- among economists, anyway -- one of the least controversial.

A 2009 review of the economic literature{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=106 | q=If rent-control is such a “no-brainer,” why bother to scrutinize the literature? The cluster of restrictions persists in roughly 140 jurisdictions in the United States as of 2001. As Hazlett (1982) notes, “economists have been notoriously thorough in convincing themselves of the destructive effects of rent control and notoriously inept at convincing anyone else” (278). Better understanding of the issue might help correct the error, prevent other governments from falling into it, and promote an understanding among more than just economists. Also, better understanding is an end in itself. }} by Blair Jenkins through [[EconLit]] covering theoretical and empirical research on multiple aspects of the issue, including housing availability, maintenance and housing quality, rental rates, political and administrative costs, and redistribution, for both first generation and second generation rent control systems, found that “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves”.{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=105 | q=My review of the rent-control literature indexed by EconLit (or cited by such indexed articles) finds that economic research quite consistently and predominantly frowns on rent control. ...

The upshot is that, at best, rent control does little harm but probably not much good and, at worst, it has negative impacts on landlords and tenants.  There is near universal agreement that strict price ceilings, such as the kind imposed in New York City in the 1940s, are always bad because they severely inhibit housing production and investment. Even those most sympathetic to rent control seem to agree with this. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_cities | p=1 | q=Bad ideas die hard, and rent control is no exception.

Two economists from opposing sides of the political spectrum, [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Paul Krugman]] (who identifies as an American liberal or European [[social democrat]]),&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR1FpbMkZ58 "Nobelpristagaren i ekonomi 2008: Paul Krugman"], speech by Paul Krugman (Retrieved December 26, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Sowell]], (who stated that "[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]" might best describe his views){{ r | Sowell_Salon | p=1 | q=What would your preferred label be? I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that "libertarian" would suit me better than many others, }} have both criticized rent regulation as poor economics, which, despite its good intentions, leads to the creation of less housing, raises prices, and increases [[urban blight]].{{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=Sky-high rents on uncontrolled apartments, because desperate renters have nowhere to go -- and the absence of new apartment construction, despite those high rents, because landlords fear that controls will be extended? Predictable. }} {{ r | Sowell_EF&amp;F | p=4 | q=Rent control, for example, has been imposed in various cities around the world, with the intention of helping tenants. Almost invariably, landlords and builders of housing find the reduced range of terms less acceptable and therefore supply less housing. ... In other words, while landlords and builders simply lost an opportunity to make as much money as they could have otherwise, many tenants lost an opportunity to find a decent place to live. }} {{ r | Sowell_Salon | p=1 | q=You aren&amp;apos;t a fan of rent control? No, I&amp;apos;m not. A figure I ran across recently that struck me as illustrating the moral bankruptcy of rent control is this: The number of boarded-up housing units in New York City is four times the number of homeless people on the streets. To think of that! On winter nights there are people sleeping on the cold pavement and dying of exposure, when there are these buildings that are boarded up as a consequence of economic protectionism. }}

Price ceilings can create [[shortages]] and reduce quality when they are less than the [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium price]].  By capping the price of housing, rent control can increase [[Supply and demand|demand]] and reduce available [[Supply and demand|supply]], causing a shortage.&lt;ref name=mankiw&gt;Mankiw, Gregory. Principles of Economics. 4th ed. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Irrelevant citation|date=October 2018}}  It is argued that rent control also reduces the quality of available housing, deters investment, and raises rents on tenants who are excluded from its protections (for example, in jurisdictions with vacancy decontrol, tenants who move or arrive later).{{Verify source|date=September 2011}}  When property owners are restricted in the rents they can charge, they are less willing to construct more housing (a form of [[capital strike]]).{{ r | SJMN_RC_new_housing | p=1 | q=David Shulman, an economist and expert on California housing, agreed that housing trends in California follow economic cycles, but said there could be trouble on the horizon should voters clear the way for strong rent control, he said. “All the rent control laws that passed previously always exempted new construction, even Berkeley and Santa Monica. Therefore it’s credible to say that housing construction would continue under rent control,” Shulman said. “Until now.” Shulman said repeal of Costa-Hawkins could send a message to developers that California is an unpredictable place to do business, and that could have an unprecedented chilling effect on development of new apartments. “That’s a legitimate fear,” Shulman said. “Cities could go back and change their laws anytime they want… This could lead to a collapse of new apartment construction.”}}  Since supply is low, landlords worry less about tenants leaving and have little incentive to maintain the property.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  For example, unless owners can reasonably expect that [[punitive]] action will be taken against them, they might let building maintenance deteriorate in order to mitigate the lower rental income.{{Verify source|date=September 2011}} People moving into the city have difficulty finding housing because of the shortage created by rent control.&lt;ref name=Krugman&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Krugman  | first = Paul  | title =  Reckonings; A Rent Affair  | newspaper = The New York Times  | date = June 7, 2000  | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E4DF153FF934A35755C0A9669C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When housing is limited, it must be rationed in some way. After the [[San Francisco earthquake of 1906]], the number of houses relative to the number of people who needed housing fell by 40%, but a shortage was avoided because the market price mechanism effectively rationed housing and provided an incentive for new housing to be built. In 1946, however, a far less extreme situation was dealt with via chance and favoritehood.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Some, such as William Tucker of the [[Cato Institute]], a leading [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[thinktank]],&lt;ref name=Cato&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Tucker  | first = William  | title = How Rent Control Drives Out Affordable Housing  | journal = Cato Policy Analysis  | issue = 274  | date = May 21, 1997  | url = https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa274.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that rent control laws are a textbook example of the problems that arise in trying to artificially reduce prices. The natural consequence in a [[free-market]] economy is a reduction in supply and consequent shortages. Tucker has argued that rent control has the perverse effect of creating ''less'' affordable housing.&lt;ref name=Cato/&gt;

Areas with rent-controlled housing are blamed for difficulty of finding vacant housing and the resulting power imbalance between landlords and tenants as tenants may "game the system" to impose onerous conditions on the landlord, forcing long cycles of judicial action, leading to considerable economic hardship for the landlord.  Likewise, new tenants have serious difficulty finding housing, so they are seriously disadvantaged if they must move. As a result, landlords can impose numerous conditions and requirements.&lt;ref name=Krugman/&gt;

===Moral===
Rent control restricts the [[property right]]s of property owners,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; as it limits what they may do with their property, requiring petitioning and other processes by law, prior to taking action against a renter.

Because enacting rent control on a building reduces the investment return that can be expected from that building, it thereby reduces the present value of the building, which can be viewed as a partial [[expropriation]] of private property.&lt;ref&gt;"By enacting rent control legislation and thereby restricting investors in future rentals, a city may actively reduce the present value of a property.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5235">The '''Society for the Study of Early Christianity''' is a professional association of [[ancient historians]] and [[biblical studies|biblical scholars]], established within the Ancient Cultures Research Centre (ACRC) at [[Macquarie University]]. This assists SSEC in "fulfilling its aims through the study of the [[New Testament]] in its times, including its [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish context]], and the development of [[Early Christianity]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131245/http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ |date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and purpose==

The Society was established by the Vice-Chancellor on 8 May 1987, and a Constitution for the Society was approved by the Council of Macquarie University in December 1987. The society has no ecclesiastical ties, however it collaborates on academic occasions with [[Christian theology|Christian]] and [[Jewish theology]] colleges and communities. The current president is [[Alanna Nobbs]]. The society circulates three newsletters a year outlining their activities.

The society lists its aims as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131245/http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ |date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To encourage the study of the [[New Testament]] in its times and related topics.
* To build up resources for this study (for example, books, papyri, coins).
* To organise conferences, public lectures, seminars and other activities to which the Society's members are invited.
* To circulate three newsletters a year outlining forthcoming activities.

==Projects==
The Society supports a number of associated projects including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/associated_projects/ SSEC Associated Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327154717/http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/associated_projects/ |date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainability standards and certifications''' are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas.  There are perhaps up to 500 such standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.  The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of [[Ecolabel]]s and standards for [[Organic food]] and other products. In recent years, numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Overview article on sustainability standards in the food industry]&lt;/ref&gt; A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as "certification" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.

The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold.  Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and [[NGO]] movements around the globe demanded action.  For example, campaigns by Global Exchange&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030618203029/http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/sweatshops/nike/ |Global Exchange Campaign - Nike]&lt;/ref&gt; and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from “[[sweatshop]]” factories by the likes of [[Nike, Inc.]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the [[SA8000]] and others.  Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the [[Business-to-business|B2B]] supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, organic and other standards.  A leading example of a consumer standard is the [[Fairtrade]] movement, administered by [[FLO International]] and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx Fairtrade Growth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225094221/http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a [[Business-to-business|B2B]] standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]’s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.

However, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and [[precompetitive]] industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} .

With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering ''real'' social, environmental and economic results. The [[ISEAL Alliance]] has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.

Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of [[State of Sustainability Initiatives|The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI)]] project, facilitated by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) and the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

== Origin of global standards ==

''Most'' sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by [[social movements]] in particular countries, such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards were initiated by individual companies, such as [[UTZ Certified|Utz Certified]] (Ahold), Starbucks C.A.F.E. (Starbucks), and Nespresso AAA (Nespresso). Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms, development agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. For example, the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters, including [[Kraft Foods]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] and [[Nestle]], assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development ([[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]]). One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs, coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries. For example, the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers. 4C builds on development projects in Peru, Colombia and Vietnam, involving GIZ, major coffee roasters, and local producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1668888 Article on the Development of the Common Code for the Coffee Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture, with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes, and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards. Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential, with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share. Cotton, palm oil, soy, biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest, due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together. More recently, standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold, silver, aluminium, and oil and gas - as well as for cattle, electronics, plastics and tourism.

Evidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[ISEAL Alliance]] in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally.

== Different sustainability standards ==
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}

Numerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices. Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures, there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development, target groups of adopters, geographical diffusion, and emphasis on environmental, social or economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Introduction to different standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard. Some standards set the bar high for a sector, promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices. Often times there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally (usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness) whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Additional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first, second or third party; the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials; and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products.

=== Fairtrade ===

The [[Fairtrade]] label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The initiative performs [[development work]] and promotes its political vision of an [[alternative economy]], seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The ''most distinguishing'' feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a [[social premium]] that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly. Recently{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system.

=== Rainforest Alliance ===
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}
The [[Rainforest Alliance]] was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity. One key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system to assist wildlife conservation. Another objective is to improve workers’ welfare by establishing and securing ''sustainable'' livelihoods. Producer prices may carry a premium. Yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed [[floor price]], the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields and enhanced cost efficiency{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== Utz Certified ===

[[UTZ Certified]] (formerly Utz Kapeh) was co-founded by the Dutch coffee roaster [[Ahold Coffee Company]] in 1997. It aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products. ''Instruments'' include the UTZ Traceability System and the UTZ Code of Conduct. The traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has ''stringent'' chains of custody requirements. The UTZ Code of Conduct emphasizes both environmental practices (e.g. biodiversity conservation, waste handling and water use) and social benefits (e.g. access to medical care, access to sanitary facilities at work).

=== Organic ===
The [[Organic farming|Organic]] standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on [[IFOAM]] Basic Standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. IFOAM stands for International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement. The IFOAM Basic Standards provide a framework of minimum requirements, including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers. The use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated. Genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are forbidden{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== trustea ===

The [http://www.trustea.org trustea code] is designed to evaluate the social, economic, [[agronomic]] and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs).

It is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach. The applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period. The India tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly– producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards. The verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers.

=== SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===

SuRe® is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, through various criteria across governance, social and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib-foundation.org/sure-standard/&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently developed under ISEAL guidelines by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) and the French bank [[Natixis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/sustainable-trade-infrastructure-in-africa-a-key-element-for-growth&lt;/ref&gt; GIB and Natixis launched the SuRe® standard at a [[COP21]] event on 9 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greeneconomycoalition.org/updates/gib-launches-sure%C2%AE-standard-cop21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
Other types of standards include sector-specific schemes such as the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO); standards for climate and development interventions like the Gold Standard, retailer-led sustainability certification initiatives such as [[GlobalGAP]];
Corporate own-brand sustainability initiatives such as [[Starbucks#Coffee and Farmer Equity .28C.A.F.E..29 practices|Starbucks' CAFE Practices]]; and national programmes such as the [[Bord Bia|Irish Food Board]]'s 'Origin Green' scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Topics/Product-differentiation/Special-report-Implications-of-sustainability-certification-schemes-for-the-ACP ''Agritrade'': Implications of sustainability certification schemes for the ACP] 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards]] (UNFSS) is a joint initiative of FAO, UNEP, ITC, UNCTAD, and UNIDO on Sustainability Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards|url=https://unfss.org|website=UNFSS|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9707">'''Thermo-mechanical fatigue''' (short '''TMF''') is the overlay of a cyclical mechanical loading, that leads to [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] of a material, with a cyclical thermal loading. Thermo-mechanical fatigue is an important point that needs to be considered, when constructing turbine engines or gas turbines.

==Failure Mechanisms==
There are three mechanisms acting in thermo-mechanical fatigue
*'''[[Creep (deformation)|Creep]]''' is the flow of material at high temperatures
*'''[[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]''' is crack growth and propagation due to repeated loading
*'''Oxidation''' is a change in the chemical composition of the material due to environmental factors. The oxidized material is more brittle and prone to crack creation.

Each factor has more or less of an effect depending on the parameters of loading. In phase (IP) thermo-mechanical loading (when the temperature and load increase at the same time) is dominated by creep. The combination of high temperature and high stress is the ideal condition for creep. The heated material flows more easily in tension, but cools and stiffens under compression. Out of phase (OP) thermo-mechanical loading is dominated by the effects of oxidation and fatigue. Oxidation weakens the surface of the material, creating flaws and seeds for crack propagation. As the crack propagates, the newly exposed crack surface then oxidizes, weakening the material further and enabling the crack to extend. A third case occurs in OP TMF loading when the stress difference is much greater than the temperature difference. Fatigue alone is the driving cause of failure in this case, causing the material to fail before oxidation can have much of an effect.&lt;ref&gt;Nagesha, A et al. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msea.2010.05.082 "A comparative study of isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue on type 316L(N) austenitic stainless steel"] '''Materials Science and Engineering: A''', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

TMF still is not fully understood. There are many different models to attempt to predict the behavior and life of materials undergoing TMF loading. The two models presented below take different approaches.

==Models of Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue==
There are many different models that have been developed in an attempt to understand and explain TMF. This page will address the two broadest approaches, constitutive and phenomenological models. Constitutive models utilize the current understanding of the microstructure of materials and failure mechanisms. These models tend to be more complex, as they try to incorporate everything we know about how the materials fail. These types of models are becoming more popular recently as improved imaging technology has allowed for a better understanding of failure mechanisms. Phenomenological models are based purely on the observed behavior of materials. They treat the exact mechanism of failure as a sort of "black box". Temperature and loading conditions are input, and the result is the fatigue life. These models try to fit some equation to match the trends found between different inputs and outputs.

===Damage Accumulation Model===
The damage accumulation model is a constitutive model of TMF. It adds together the damage from the three failure mechanisms of fatigue, creep, and oxidation.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {N_f} = \frac {1} {N_f^{fatigue}} + \frac {1} {N_f^{oxidation}} + \frac {1} {N_f^{creep}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_f &lt;/math&gt; is the fatigue life of the material, that is, the number of loading cycles until failure. The fatigue life for each failure mechanism is calculated individually and combined to find the total fatigue life of the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;Changan, Chai et al. [http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9904/Cai/Cai-9904.htm "Recent Developments in the Thermomechanical Fatigue Life Prediction of Superalloys"], '''JOM''', April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.efatigue.com/hightemp/background/tmf.html "Thermo Mechanical Technical Background"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fatigue====
The life from fatigue is calculated for isothermal loading conditions. It is dominated by the strain applied to the specimen.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\Delta \epsilon_m} {2} = C(2N_f^{fatigue})^d &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; are material constants found through isothermal testing. Note that this term does not account for temperature effects. The effects of temperature are treated in the oxidation and creep terms..

====Oxidation====
The life from oxidation is affected by temperature and cycle time.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {N_f^{oxidation}} = \left(\frac {h_{cr}\delta_0} {B\Phi^{oxidation}K_p^{eff}}\right)^{\frac {-1} {\beta}} \frac {2(\Delta \dot{\epsilon_m})^{\frac {2} {\beta} +1}} {\epsilon^{1-\alpha / \beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; K_p^{eff} = \frac {1} {t_c} \int_0^t D_0 exp \left(\frac {-Q} {RT(t)} \right) dt&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{oxidation} = \frac {1} {t_c} \int_0^t exp \left[-\frac {1} {2} \left(\frac{(\dot{\epsilon_{th}} / \dot{\epsilon_m}) + 1} {\dot{\zeta}^{oxidation}} \right)^2 \right] dt&lt;/math&gt;

Parameters are found by comparing fatigue tests done in air and in an environment with no oxygen (vacuum or argon). Under these testing conditions, it has been found that the effects of oxidation can reduce the fatigue life of a specimen by a whole order of magnitude. Higher temperatures greatly increase the amount of damage from environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, T. K. et al. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/7232j3t772580465/fulltext.html "Thermomechanical Fatigue of the TiAl Intermetallic Alloy TNB-V2"] '''Experimental Mechanics''', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creep====
&lt;math&gt; D^{creep} = \Phi^{creep} \int_0^t Ae^{(-\Delta H/RT(t))} \left(\frac {\alpha_1 \bar{\sigma} + \alpha_2 \sigma_H} {K} \right)^m dt &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi^{creep} = \frac {1} {t_c} \int_0^t exp \left[ -\frac {1}{2} \left( \frac {(\dot{\epsilon_{th}}/ \dot{\epsilon_m})-1} {\dot{\zeta}^{creep}} \right)^2 \right] dt&lt;/math&gt;

====Benefit====
The damage accumulation model is one of the most in-depth and accurate models for TMF. It accounts for the effects of each failure mechanism.

====Drawback====
The damage accumulation model is also one of the most complex models for TMF. There are several material parameters that must be found through extensive testing.&lt;ref&gt;Minichmayr, Robert et al. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V35-4NCJCRP-2&amp;_user=571676&amp;_coverDate=02%2F29%2F2008&amp;_alid=1572321743&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_cdi=5721&amp;_sort=r&amp;_st=13&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=1&amp;_acct=C000029040&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=571676&amp;md5=be6d57b6fac5d812e66d17e3afabb53b&amp;searchtype=a "Thermo-mechanical fatigue life assessment of aluminum components using the damage rate model of Sehitoglu"] '''International Journal of Fatigue''', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strain-Rate Partitioning===
Strain-rate partitioning is a phenomenological model of thermo-mechanical fatigue. It is based on observed phenomenon instead of the failure mechanisms. This model deals only with inelastic strain and ignores elastic strain completely. It accounts for different types of deformation and breaks strain into four possible scenarios:&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, W. Z. et al. [http://hdl.handle.net/1947/3887 "Thermo-mechanical fatigue life prediction: A critical review"] '''Defence Science and Technology Organisation Publications''', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
*PP – plastic in tension and compression
*CP – creep in tension and plastic in compression
*PC – plastic in tension and creep in compression
*CC – creep in tension and compression

&lt;!-- [Insert Image] --&gt;

The damage and life for each partition is calculated and combined in the model

&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {N_f} = \frac {F_{pp}} {N'_{pp}} + \frac {F_{cc}} {N'_{cc}} + \frac {F_{pc}} {N'_{pc}} + \frac {F_{cp}} {N'_{cp}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_{pp}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{pp}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}},   F_{cc}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{cc}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}},   F_{pc}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{pc}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}},   F_{cp}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{cp}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}} &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;N'_{pp} &lt;/math&gt; etc., are found from variations of the equation &lt;math&gt; \Delta \epsilon_{inelastic} = A_{pp}(N'_{pp})^{C_{pp}} &lt;/math&gt;

where A and C are material constants for individual loading.

====Benefit====
Strain-Rate Partitioning is a much simpler model than the damage accumulation model. Because it breaks down the loading into specific scenarios, it can account for different phases in loading.

====Drawback====
The model is based on inelastic strain. This means that it does not work well with scenarios of low inelastic strain, such as brittle materials or loading with very low strain.
This model can be an oversimplification. Because it fails to account for oxidation damage, it may overpredict specimen life in certain loading conditions.

==Looking Forward==
The next area of research is attempting to understand TMF of composites. The interaction between the different materials adds another layer of complexity.

Zhang and Wang are currently investigating the TMF of a unidirectional fiber reinforced matrix. They are using a finite element method that accounts for the known microstructure. They have discovered that the large difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the matrix and the fiber is the driving cause of failure, causing high internal stress.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Junqian and Fang Wang [http://ijd.sagepub.com/content/19/7/851.abstract "Modeling of Damage Evolution and Failure in Fiber-Reinforced Ductile Composites Under Thermomechanical Fatigue Loading"] '''International Journal of Damage Mechanics''', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tondo''' (plural "tondi" or "tondos") is a [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] term for a [[Circle|circular]] work of art, either a [[painting]] or a [[sculpture]]. The word derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''rotondo,'' "round."  The term is usually not used in English for small round paintings, but only those over about 60&amp;nbsp;cm (two feet) in diameter, thus excluding many round [[portrait miniature]]s – for sculpture the threshold is rather lower.

==History==
Artists have created tondi since [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. The circular paintings in the centre of [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Development of vase painting|painted vases]] of that period are known as tondi, and the inside of the broad low winecup called a ''[[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'' also lent itself to circular enframed compositions.&lt;ref&gt;E. F. van der Grinten, ''On the Composition of the Medallions in the Interiors of Greek Black- and Red-Figured Kylixes''. Amsterdam 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The style was revived in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, particularly in Italy, where it may have developed from the smaller [[desco da parto]] or birthing tray.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-the-adoration-of-the-kings "''The Adoration of the Kings'', about 1470-5, Sandro Botticelli"], National Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has been less common. In [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s painting ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'', the ship's wire railing curving round the figures helps enclose the composition within its tondo shape.

The background scene is consolidated or omitted, and to a large extent, unimportant. While the background may be visible in tondo paintings, in tondo relief carvings the background is not seen. [[Andrea della Robbia]] and other members of his family created glazed terracotta ''tondi'' that were often framed in a wreath of fruit and leaves and which were intended for immuring in a stuccoed wall. In [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]], Florence, 1421–24,  Andrea della Robbia provided glazed terracotta babes in swaddling clothes in tondos with plain blue backgrounds to be set in the [[spandrel]]s of the arches.

In the sixteenth century the painterly style of ''istoriato'' decoration for [[maiolica]] wares was applied to large circular dishes (see also [[Charger (table setting)|charger]]).

The tondo has also been used as a design element in [[architecture]] since the [[Renaissance]]; it may serve centered in the gable-end of a [[pediment]] or under the round-headed [[arch]] that was revived in the fifteenth century.

Although the earliest true Renaissance, or late Gothic painted tondo is Burgundian, from [[Champmol]]  (of a ''Pietá'' by [[Jean Malouel]] of 1400-15, now in the [[Louvre]]), the tondo became fashionable in 15th century [[Florence]], with [[Botticelli]] painting many examples, both [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] and narrative scenes.  [[Michelangelo]] employed the circular tondo for several compositions, both painted and sculpted, including ''The Holy Family with the infant St. John the Baptist'', the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' at the [[Uffizi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/M/michelangelo/holy_family.jpg.html|title=Michelangelo, The Doni Tondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Raphael]].

The infrequently-encountered synonym ''[[rondo]]''&lt;ref name="Artlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/  Artlex.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; much more usually refers to a musical form.
