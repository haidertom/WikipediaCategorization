The '''Alexander Mosaic''', dating from circa 100&amp;nbsp;BC, is a [[Roman mosaic|Roman]] floor [[mosaic]] originally from the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;European History, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000712/http://europeanhistory.boisestate.edu/westciv/alexander/06.shtml Alexander the Great, The Battle of Issus]&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a battle between the armies of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Darius III of Persia]] and measures {{convert|2.72|x|5.13|m|ftin}}.&lt;ref name="HF"&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 178. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original is preserved in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]. The mosaic is believed to be a copy of an early 3rd-century BC Hellenistic painting.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Woodford, Susan. (1982) ''The Art of Greece and Rome''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 67. {{ISBN|0521298733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==

===Battle===
The mosaic illustrates a battle in which Alexander faced and attempted to capture or kill Darius. Alexander defeated him at the [[Battle of Issus]] and two years later at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. The work is traditionally believed to show the Battle of Issus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/wars-of-alexander-the-great-battle-of-issus.htm Battle of Issus], [[History.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mosaic emulates the appearance of a painting so accurately, it has been uniformly agreed that the mosaic is a copy of an original Hellenistic Greek painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mosaics|last = L'Orange and Nordhagen|first = Hans Peter and Per Jonas|year = 1966|isbn = |location = Great Britain|pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic is held to be a copy either of a painting by [[Aristides of Thebes]], or of a lost late 4th-century BC [[fresco]] by the painter [[Philoxenus of Eretria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/alexander-mosaic.html Alexander Mosaic] by Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker, ''Smarthistory'', 2013. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] (XXXV, 110) as a commission for the [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonian]] king [[Cassander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A Global History|first=Fred S.|last=Kleiner|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=0-495-11549-5|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexander and Darius===

Despite being damaged, the two main figures are easy to recognize.
*The portrait of Alexander is one of his most famous. Alexander's breastplate depicts [[Medusa]], the famous [[Gorgon]], and his wavy hair is typical of royal portraiture as established in Greek art of the fourth century BC. He is portrayed sweeping into battle at the left, on his famous horse, [[Bucephalus]],&lt;ref&gt;Winkes, Rolf: "Bukephalas”, Archaeologia Transantlantica XVIII, 2000, 101-107&lt;/ref&gt; and focusing his gaze on the Persian leader.
*Darius is shown in a chariot. He seems to be desperately commanding his frightened charioteer to flee the battle, while stretching out his hand either as a mute gesture to Alexander, or possibly after throwing a [[javelin]]. He has a worried expression on his face. The charioteer is whipping the horses as he tries to escape.

The Persian soldiers behind him have expressions of determination and consternation.

===Other features===
Darius's brother [[Oxyathres of Persia|Oxyathres]] is also portrayed, sacrificing himself to save the King.

Radical [[foreshortening]] – as in the central horse, seen from behind – and the use of shading to convey a sense of mass and volume enhance the naturalistic effect of the scene. Repeated diagonal spears, clashing metal, and the crowding of men and horses evoke the din of battle. At the same time, action is arrested by dramatic details such as the fallen horse and the Persian soldier in the foreground who watches his own death throes reflected in a shield.

==History of the mosaic==

===Production===
The mosaic is made of about one and a half million tiny colored tiles called [[tesserae]], arranged in gradual curves called ''[[opus vermiculatum]],'' (also known as "worm work," because they seem to replicate the slow motion of a crawling worm). The color scale of Roman mosaics are extremely rich in gradation. The process of gathering materials for mosaics was a complex undertaking since the color scale was based solely on the pieces of marble that could be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Janson's History of Art|last = Davies|first = Penelope JE|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0135006887|location = New Jersey|pages = 246|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic is an unusually detailed work for a private residence and was likely commissioned by a wealthy person or family. The fact that this scene was made to be viewed in the house of a Roman civilian reveals that Alexander the Great was more than just a heroic image to the Romans. Because Roman leaders followed after Alexander's image, Roman civilians also aspired to emulate the power he represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Janson's History of Art|last = Davies|first = Penelope JE|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0135006887|location = New Jersey|pages = 146|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mosaic was arranged on the floor where the patron could receive guests, it was the first decorative object a visitor would see upon entering that room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Houses and Society in Pompeii and Herculaneum|last = Wallace-Hadrill|first = Andrew|publisher = |year = 1994|isbn = |location = |pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
The mosaic was rediscovered on October 24, 1831 in [[Pompeii]], and was moved to [[Naples]] in September 1843, where it is currently preserved on a wall (''not'' on a floor as it was found) in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archeologico Nazionale]]. The mosaic is featured on 1,000 [[Greek drachma]] banknotes from 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://history-of-macedonia.com/2012/03/04/16-04-1956-alexander-the-great-in-modern-greek-bank-note-of-one-thousand-drachmas/|title=16.04.1956: Alexander the Great in Modern Greek Bank Note of one thousand Drachmas=|publisher=History of Macedonia| accessdate =16 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern copy===
[[File:Battle of Issus.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern reconstruction of the Alexander Mosaic.]]
In 2003 the ''International Center for the Study and Teaching of Mosaic'' (CISIM) in [[Ravenna]], Italy, proposed to create a copy of the mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.archaeology.org/0601/abstracts/mosaic.html Alexander, Piece by Piece.] by Marco Merola, ''Archaeology'', Abstracts Vol. 59, No. 1, Jan/Feb 2006. Retrieved 26 May 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6GtFeiXeK Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; When they had received approval, the mosaic master Severo Bignami and his eight-person team took a large photograph of the mosaic, made a tracing of the image with a dark marker and created a negative impression of the mosaic.

The team composed the mosaic in sections in 44 clay frames, trying to preserve the pieces of the mosaic in the exact positions they are in the original mosaic. They had to keep the plates wet all the time. Then they pressed a tissue on the clay to create an image of the outlines of the mosaic in the clay. The team recreated the mosaic with about 2 million pieces of various marble types. When they had placed all the pieces, they covered the result with a layer of glue and gauze and pulled it out of the clay. They placed each section on synthetic concrete and then united the sections with the compound of glasswool and plastic.

The project took 22 months and a cost equivalent to US $216,000. The copy was installed in the [[House of the Faun]] in 2005.

==Life and career==
Feeney was born in [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania]] to Annabelle (née Runner) and Edward J. Feeney. She has a younger sister, Kathleen. The family moved to the nearby [[Brookline (Pittsburgh)|Brookline neighborhood]] of the city of [[Pittsburgh]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insisterhood.info/historical-library/activist-histories/|title=In Sisterhood Project - Activist Histories|website=www.insisterhood.info|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18042216/anne_feeney/ The Pittsburgh Press], 08 Jul 1990, Sun, Page 122&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Resurrection Elementary School (Pittsburgh)|Resurrection Elementary School]] in 1964.

Feeney graduated from [[Fontbonne Academy]],&lt;ref name=PostGazette19900708&gt;{{cite news|title=A rebel named Feeney: singer-activist-lawyer belts out her music and causes|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PG&amp;p_theme=pg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADE6E0897F97C7&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=July 8, 1990|accessdate=March 16, 2010|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Catholic girls' high school, in 1968.

After saving for one year, she purchased a [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|Martin]] [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company#Six-string guitars|D-28]] guitar that she retired from service after 40 years. [[The Vietnam War]] and [[Civil Rights Movement]] were influential events that shaped her politics and songwriting. Feeney was also influenced by her grandfather, William Patrick Feeney,&lt;ref name=PostGazette19900708/&gt; who was a [[miner|mineworker]]s' [[union organizer|organizer]] and [[violin]]ist who also used his music in the service of political and labor causes.

In 1972 she was arrested in [[Miami]] at the [[Republican National Convention]] where she was protesting [[Richard Nixon]]'s re-nomination for President of the United States.  The charges were subsequently dismissed. That same year Feeney attended the 2nd Annual Conference on Women and the Law.  Inspired by the group that founded "Women Organized Against Rape" in [[Philadelphia]], Feeney began a campaign for a rape crisis center in Pittsburgh. The work begun by her committee evolved into Pittsburgh Action Against Rape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Women In Drive To End Secrecy and Stigma on Rape|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9N8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7431,3172362&amp;dq=rape+anne-feeney&amp;hl=en|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=September 24, 1973|accessdate=March 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which still provides services to rape victims in the Pittsburgh area. She graduated from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1974 with a Liberal Studies degree.

In 1976 she joined a bluegrass band - Cucumber Rapids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Folk singer carries the torch for new generation|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BL&amp;p_theme=bl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F21D5ADBB1E1A02&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|work=[[The Pantagraph]]|date=October 11, 1991|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeney played rhythm guitar and acoustic double bass. The other members of the band were John Wiley Nelson (guitar), Paul Boas (harmonica), Gary Mohler (guitar and dobro) and Bill Vandivier (banjo, bass and trumpet). Later on, Larry Zierath (mandolin) replaced Gary Mohler, and violinist John Mattes joined the band shortly thereafter. The group disbanded in 1977.

On November 19, 1977, she married labor attorney Ron Berlin.&lt;ref name=PittsburghPress19890317&gt;{{cite news |title=Activist musician sings out loudly for women's rights |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n7AqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bWMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6565,634199&amp;dq=ron-berlin+anne-feeney&amp;hl=en |work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|date=March 17, 1989|accessdate=March 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]]&lt;ref name=PittsburghPress19890317/&gt; in 1978. Feeney is the mother of two children, Dan (1979) and Amy (1981) Berlin. She worked for 12 years as a trial attorney and served as president of the Pittsburgh [[American Federation of Musicians|Musicians' Union]] (the only woman ever elected to this position) from 1997-1998.&lt;ref name=PostGazette19981202&gt;{{cite news|title=Music union elects new president|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PG&amp;p_theme=pg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB48EB8D33AE32C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=December 2, 1998|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeney's marriage to Ron Berlin ended in divorce in 1995 but she has remained involved in community activism and regional performances at political and labor rallies. She is a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]&lt;ref name=NPR20060904&gt;{{cite news|title=Industrial Workers' Songbook Gets Big Update|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=5764742|work=[[National Public Radio]]|date=September 4, 2006|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the American Federation of Musicians.&lt;ref name=PostGazette19981202/&gt;

Since 1991, Feeney has toured [[North America]] and the world to perform and participate in political and labor rallies and events.&lt;ref name=Ledgin&gt;{{cite book|title=Discovering Folk Music|last=Ledgin|first=Stephanie P.|page=69|year=2009|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-0-275-99387-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first recording, ''Look to the Left'', was released in 1992.&lt;ref name=SingOut38&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|year=1993|journal=[[Sing Out!]]|volume=38|page=104|oclc=60637751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then she has released several more albums, including "Union Maid," "If I Can't Dance," "Have you Been to Jail for Justice?", ''Dump the Bosses Off Your Back''.&lt;ref name=NPR20060904/&gt; and, most recently "Enchanted Way" (2010). Feeney and her daughter Amy Berlin performed Feeney's song "Ain't I a Woman" at the "March for Women's Lives" in [[Washington, DC]], on April 25, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Have You Been to Jail for Justice?|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19000563_ITM|work=[[Sing Out!]]|date=March 22, 2005|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeney's music has been recorded by [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]&lt;ref name=Ledgin/&gt; and played in concert as well. Political cartoonist [[Mike Konopacki]] included her recording of "[[Union Maid]]" in a flash animation in 2003. Feeney's music is frequently featured on the broadcast radio program ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' and her anthem "Have You Been to Jail for Justice?" is featured in the documentaries ''This is What Democracy Looks Like'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arts in Brief |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BL&amp;p_theme=bl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F6EB1246DE2AD93&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=[[The Pantagraph]] |date=October 25, 2002 |accessdate=March 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Isn't This a Time: A Tribute to Harold Leventhal''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Folksinger Anne Feeney signed the Manifesto against conscription and the military system|url=http://bellaciao.org/en/article.php3?id_article=10640|work=Bellaciao|date=February 27, 2006|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Get Up/Stand Up: The History of Pop and Protest''.

In 2002, she married Swedish political artist Julie Leonardsson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNF Presents Unique Musical and Visual Experience |url=http://www.unf.edu/ia/pr/media_relations/press/2007/UNF_Presents_Unique_Musical_and_Visual_Experience.aspx |publisher=[[University of North Florida]] |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035728/http://www.unf.edu/ia/pr/media_relations/press/2007/UNF_Presents_Unique_Musical_and_Visual_Experience.aspx |archivedate=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, while touring in [[Sweden]], Feeney was diagnosed with small cell [[lung cancer]]. She is currently undergoing treatment for that, as well as a MAC infection in her lungs. Her friends around [[North America]] have been holding benefit events to provide her living expenses since she will be unable to work for some time. In 2013, the cancer was determined to be in complete remission. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

{{Anthropology}}
'''Anthropology of art''' is a sub-field in [[social anthropology]] dedicated to the study of [[art]] in different cultural contexts. The anthropology of art focuses on historical, economic and aesthetic dimensions in non-Western art forms, including what is known as '[[tribal art]]'.

==History==
[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern [[anthropology]], conducted many field studies of the arts, helping create a foundation to the field. His book, ''Primitive Art'' (1927), summarizes his main insights into so-called 'primitive' art forms, with a detailed case study on the arts of the Northwest Pacific Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas. (1927) ''Primitive art''.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] took Boas' analyses further in his book ''The Way of the Masks'', where he traced changes in the plastic form of Northwest Pacific masks to patterns of intercultural interaction among the indigenous peoples of the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss. (1982) ''The Way of the Masks''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Problem of Art==
One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Layton. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is no consensus on a single, cross-cultural definition of 'art' in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Morphy &amp; Morgan Perkins. (2006) Introduction, in ''The Anthropology of Art: A Reader''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Angioni, ''Fare dire sentire: l'identico e il diverso nelle culture'', Nuoro, il Maestrale, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', Claude Lévi-Strauss' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally-specific 'aesthetics'. More recently, in his book ''Art and Agency'', [[Alfred Gell]] proposed a new definition of 'art' as a complex system of intentionality, where artists produce art objects to effect changes in the world, including (but not restricted to) changes in the aesthetic perceptions of art audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Gell. (1998) ''Art and Agency''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gell's ideas have stirred a large controversy in the anthropology of art in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Bowden. (2004) A Critique of Alfred Gell on Art and Agency. ''Oceania'', 74: 309-325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Layton. (2003) Art and Agency: A reassessment. ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 9: 447-464&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Morphy. (2009). Art as a Mode of Action: Some Problems with Gell’s Art and Agency.

The '''Association of Writers of Serbia (UKS)''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Удружење књижевника Србије, ''Udruženje književnika Srbije'') is [[Serbia]]'s official writing association, and its current president is [[Radomir Andrić]].

==History==
The association was founded on May 26, 1905 under the presidency of [[Milan Đ. Milićević]].&lt;ref&gt;Milovan Bogavac, Association of Serbian Writers 1905-1945, UKS history&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Jovan Skerlić]], secretary
* Dobrosav Ružić, treasurer
* Živojin O. Dačić, librarian

It comprised an [[exhibition]], a [[publication]] and a [[lecture]] series that all focused on the heart and brain in various fields: [[art]], [[science]], [[religion]], the [[occult]] and [[cooking]], in order to reflect on the philosophical and practical relationship between art and science.&lt;ref&gt;Begrepp en Samling, 1992, ed.

In the exhibition, one could see two large metal and glass sculptures of the heart and the brain that contained the crumbled posters promoting the exhibition. Large photographs of histological samples of the two organs sat next to scientific abstracts, occult and religious images. Close to the entry of the exhibition, hearts and brains of various animals including and elephant and a lemur which had been lent by the Museum of Natural History sat next to recipes of how to cook the organs.&lt;ref&gt;Tjugo år : Maria Bonnier Dahlins stiftelse : 1985-2005, Ed.

'''Bertha Crawford Hubbard''' (1861–1946) was one of the founders of the [[Roycroft]] movement, an American branch of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78010458 Bertha Crawford Hubbard], ''Find a grave''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bertha C. Crawford''' was born in Maryland to James C. Crawford and Elizabeth Hinkle. She was married to [[Elbert Hubbard]] the charismatic leader of the Roycrofters on June 30, 1881 in Bloomington, Illinois - when he was a soap salesman for the [[Larkin Administration Building|Larkin Soap Company]]. Their marriage produced four children, but ended in divorce because of her husband's infidelity with [[Alice Moore Hubbard|Alice Moore]], a local school-teacher. Elbert and Moore would eventually marry. After the Hubbards' divorce, Bertha was pushed out of the Roycroft business and supplanted by Alice Moore,despite Bertha's considerable influence in Roycroft's development.  Her children went on to lead Roycrofters in the years after the death of their father and Alice Moore in the sinking of the [[RMS Lusitania]].

'''Biennale''' ({{IPA-it|bi.enˈnaːle|pron}}), [[Italian language|Italian]] for "biennial" or "every other year", is any event that happens every two years. It is most commonly used within the [[art world]] to describe large-scale international [[contemporary art]] exhibitions. As such the term was popularised by [[Venice Biennale]], which was first held in 1895. The phrase has since been used for other artistic events, such as the "[[Biennale de Paris]]", "[[Kochi-Muziris Biennale]]", or even as a [[portmanteau]] as with [[Berlinale]] (for the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]) and [[Vienna International Film Festival|Viennale]] (for [[Vienna]]'s international film festival). "Biennale" is therefore used as a general term for other recurrent international events (such as triennials, [[Documenta]], [[Skulptur Projekte Münster]]).

== Characteristics ==
According to author Federica Martini, what is at stake in contemporary biennales is the diplomatic/international relations potential as well as urban regeneration plans. Besides being mainly focused on the present (the “here and now” where the cultural event takes place and their effect of "spectacularisation of the everyday"), because of their site-specificity cultural events may refer back to, {{Who|date=July 2017}} produce or frame the history of the site and communities' collective memory.&lt;ref&gt;Vittoria Martini e Federica Martini, ''Just another exhibition. Histories and politics of biennials'', Postmedia Books, 2011 {{ISBN|8874900600}}, {{ISBN|978-8874900602}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Crystal Palace - Queen Victoria opens the Great Exhibition.jpg|thumb|The Great Exhibition in [[The Crystal Palace]] in Hyde Park, London, in 1851, the first attempt to condense the representation of the world within a unitary exhibition space.]]
A strong and influent symbol of biennales and of large-scale international exhibitions in general is the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], the gigantic and futuristic London architecture that hosted the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition in 1851]]. According to philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]],&lt;ref&gt;Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}} the Crystal Palace is the first attempt to condense the representation of the world in a unitary exhibition space, where the main exhibit is society itself in an a-historical, spectacular condition. The Crystal Palace main motives were the affirmation of British economic and national leadership and the creation of moments of spectacle. In this respect, 19th century World fairs provided a visual crystallization of colonial culture and were, at the same time, forerunners of contemporary theme parks.

The [[Venice Biennale]], a periodical large-scale cultural event founded in 1895, served as an archetype of the biennales. Meant to become a [[World Fair]] focused on [[contemporary art]], the Venice Biennale used as a pretext the wedding anniversary of the Italian king and followed up to several national exhibitions organised after Italy unification in 1861. The Biennale immediately put forth issues of city marketing, cultural tourism and urban regeneration, as it was meant to reposition Venice on the international cultural map after the crisis due to the end of the [[Grand Tour]] model and the weakening of the Venetian school of painting. Furthermore, the Gardens where the Biennale takes place were an abandoned city area that needed to be re-functionalised. In cultural terms, the Biennale was meant to provide on a biennial basis a platform for discussing contemporary art practices that were not represented in fine arts museums at the time. The early Biennale model already included some key points that are still constitutive of large-scale international art exhibitions today: a mix of [[city marketing]], internationalism, [[gentrification]] issues and destination culture, and the spectacular, large scale of the event.

=== Biennales after the 1990s ===
The situation of biennials has changed in the contemporary context: while at its origin in 1895 Venice was a unique cultural event, but since the 1990s hundreds of biennials have been organized across the globe. Given the ephemeral and irregular nature of some biennials, there is little consensus on the exact number of biennials in existence at any given time. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Furthermore, while Venice was a unique agent in the presentation of contemporary art, since the 1960s several museums devoted to contemporary art are exhibiting the contemporary scene on a regular basis. Another point of difference concerns 19th century internationalism in the arts, that was brought into question by post-colonial debates and criticism of the contemporary art “ethnic marketing”, and also challenged the Venetian and World Fair’s national representation system. As a consequence of this, Eurocentric tendency to implode the whole word in an exhibition space, which characterises both the Crystal Palace and the Venice Biennale, is affected by the expansion of the artistic geographical map to scenes traditionally considered as marginal. The birth of the Havana Biennial in 1984 is widely considered an important counterpoint to the Venetian model for its prioritization of artists working in the Global South and curatorial rejection of the national pavilion model.

==Plot==
In [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], Doug Dooligan (John Moore), a young [[Nyoongar]] man, is released from prison where he was incarcerated for assault. Outside he is picked up by his charismatic childhood friend Floyd "Pretty Boy" Davies ([[David Ngoombujarra]])—who was partially responsible for Doug's incarceration—and taken to a remote [[:Category:Aboriginal communities in Western Australia|Aboriginal community]]. He becomes attracted to local girl Polly (Jaylene Riley) and, upon learning that Floyd is still involved in criminal activities, decides to leave and visit his mother. Determined to stay out of trouble, Doug buys back his father's old property, Yetticup, which has [[Aboriginal land rights in Australia|traditional roots]]. Polly joins him at Yetticup and not soon after Doug's father reappears having escaped from prison. Doug narrowly escapes the police when his father is apprehended, who later dies in prison. Distraught, Doug meets Floyd and the two become friends again. When Doug tries to stop Floyd from committing a crime, Floyd sacrifices his own life so that Doug can escape and avoid arrest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15161">[[File:Parmigianino 004.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna with the Long Neck]]'', by [[Parmigianino]]. As in other [[Mannerist]] works, the proportions of the body - here the [[neck]] - are exaggerated for artistic effect.]]
While there is significant variation in anatomical proportions between people, there are many references to '''body proportions''' that are intended to be canonical, either in [[art]], [[measurement]], or [[medicine]].

In [[measurement]], body proportions are often used to relate two or more measurements based on the body.  A [[cubit]], for instance, is supposed to be six [[palm (unit)|palms]]. A [[span (unit)|span]] is taken to be 9 inches and was previously considered as half a cubit. While convenient, these ratios may not reflect the physiognomic variation of the individuals using them.

Similarly, in [[art]], body proportions are the study of relation of [[human body|human]] or animal body parts to each other and to the whole.  These ratios are used in depictions of the figure (to varying degrees naturalistic, idealized or stylized), and may become part of an [[aesthetic canon]] within a culture.

==Basics of human proportions==
[[Image:Braus 1921 1.png|thumb|upright=0.6&lt;!--size for very long image--&gt;|Human proportions marked out in an illustration from a 20th-century anatomy text-book. Hermann Braus, 1921]]
[[Image:Braus 1921 3.png|300px|thumb|upright|A) [[black lemur]]&lt;br&gt;B) chimpanzee&lt;br&gt;C) gorilla&lt;br&gt; D) human]]
It is important in [[figure drawing]] to draw the human figure in proportion. Though there are subtle differences between individuals, human proportions fit within a fairly standard range, though artists have historically tried to create idealised standards, which have varied considerably over different periods and regions. In modern figure drawing, the basic unit of measurement is the 'head', which is the distance from the top of the head to the chin. This unit of measurement is reasonably standard, and has long been used by artists to establish the proportions of the human figure.  [[Ancient Egyptian art]] used a canon of proportion based on the "fist", measured across the knuckles, with 18 fists from the ground to the hairline on the forehead.  This was already established by the [[Narmer Palette]] from about the 31st century BC, and remained in use until at least the conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] some 3,000 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. Stevenson, and Simpson, William Kelly. ''The Art and Architecture of Ancient Egypt'', pp. 12-13 and note 17, 3rd edn. 1998, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0300077475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportions used in figure drawing are:{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

* An average person is generally 7-and-a-half heads tall (including the head).
* An ideal figure, used when aiming for an impression of nobility or grace, is drawn at 8 heads tall.
* A [[heroic]] figure, used in the heroic for the depiction of [[gods]] and [[superheroes]], is eight-and-a-half heads tall.  Most of the additional length comes from a bigger chest and longer legs.

===Leg-to-body ratio===

A study using Polish participants by Sorokowski found 5% longer legs than an individual used as a reference was considered most attractive.&lt;ref name=tws19jan&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.09.002 |title=Adaptive preferences for leg length in a potential partner |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=86–91 |year=2008 |last1=Sorokowski |first1=Piotr |last2=Pawlowski |first2=Boguslaw }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded this preference might stem from the influence of leggy runway models.&lt;ref name="Sorokowski"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09709274.2010.11906309 |title=Attractiveness of Legs Length in Poland and Great Britain |journal=Journal of Human Ecology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=145 |year=2017 |last1=Sorokowski |first1=Piotr }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sorokowski study was criticized for using a picture of the same person with digitally altered leg lengths which Marco Bertamini{{who|date=March 2016}} felt were unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Bertamini" /&gt;

Another study using British and American participants, found ''mid-ranging'' leg-to-body ratios to be most ideal.&lt;ref name="Frederick"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2009.09.001 |pmid=19822462 |title=The influence of leg-to-body ratio (LBR) on judgments of female physical attractiveness: Assessments of computer-generated images varying in LBR |journal=Body Image |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=51–5 |year=2010 |last1=Frederick |first1=David A |last2=Hadji-Michael |first2=Maria |last3=Furnham |first3=Adrian |last4=Swami |first4=Viren }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Swami et al. of American men and women showed a preference for men with legs as long as the rest of their body and women with 40%{{clarify|date=March 2016}} longer legs than the rest of their body&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2006.08.003 |pmid=18089235 |title=The leg-to-body ratio as a human aesthetic criterion |journal=Body Image |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=317–23 |year=2006 |last1=Swami |first1=Viren |last2=Einon |first2=Dorothy |last3=Furnham |first3=Adrian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researcher concluded that this preference might be influenced by American culture where long-legged women are portrayed as more attractive.&lt;ref name="Swami" /&gt; The Swami et al. study was criticized for using a picture of the same person with digitally altered leg lengths which Marco Bertamini felt were unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Bertamini"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0099320 |title=The effect of leg length on perceived attractiveness of simplified stimuli |journal=Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=233–50 |year=2009 |last1=Bertamini |first1=Marco |last2=Bennett |first2=Kate M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertamini also criticized the Swami study for only changing the leg length while keeping the arm length constant.&lt;ref name="Bertamini" /&gt; Bertamini's own study which used stick figures mirrored Swami's study, however, by finding a preference for leggier women.&lt;ref name="Bertamini" /&gt;

Another common measurement of related to leg-to-body ratio is sitting-height ratio (SHR). Sitting height ratio is the ratio of the head plus spine length to total height which is highly correlated to leg-to-body ratio. SHR has been found to be very different between individuals of different ancestry. It has been reported that individuals with African ancestry have on average longer leg length, i.e. lower SHR than individuals of European ancestry.&lt;ref name="LegLengthBeauty"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bogin | first1 = B. | last2 = Varela-Silva | first2 = MI | date = Mar 2010 | title = Leg length, body proportion, and health: a review with a note on beauty | url = | journal = Int J Environ Res Public Health | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 1047–75 | doi=10.3390/ijerph7031047 | pmid=20617018 | pmc=2872302}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2015 revealed that this difference is mainly due to genetic differences and the SHR difference between African and European individuals is as large as 1 standard deviation.&lt;ref name="SHR"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.02.018 |pmid=25865494 |pmc=4570286 |title=Genome-wide Analysis of Body Proportion Classifies Height-Associated Variants by Mechanism of Action and Implicates Genes Important for Skeletal Development |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=695–708 |year=2015 |last1=Chan |first1=Yingleong |last2=Salem |first2=Rany M |last3=Hsu |first3=Yu-Han H |last4=McMahon |first4=George |last5=Pers |first5=Tune H |last6=Vedantam |first6=Sailaja |last7=Esko |first7=Tonu |last8=Guo |first8=Michael H |last9=Lim |first9=Elaine T |last10=Franke |first10=Lude |last11=Smith |first11=George Davey |last12=Strachan |first12=David P |last13=Hirschhorn |first13=Joel N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscle men and thin women===

The ancient Greek sculptor [[Polykleitos]] (c.450–420 BC), known for his ideally proportioned bronze ''[[Doryphoros]]'', wrote an influential ''Canon'' describing the proportions to be followed in sculpture.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=Journal of Hellenic Studies |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") creating a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]]. Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body, scaling this length up repeatedly by {{radic|2}} to obtain the ideal size of the other phalanges, the hand, forearm, and upper arm in turn.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal| author=Tobin, Richard | title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos | journal=American Journal of Archaeology | volume=79 | issue=4 | date=October 1975 | pages=307–321 | doi=10.2307/503064| jstor=503064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coat of arms of Peru''' is the national symbolic emblem of [[Peru]]. Four variants are used: the Coat of arms ''per se'' (''{{lang|es|Escudo de Armas}}''); the National Coat of arms, or National Shield (''{{lang|es|Escudo Nacional}}''); the Great Seal of the State (''{{lang|es|Gran Sello del Estado}}''); and the Naval Coat of arms (''{{lang|es|Escudo de la Marina de Guerra}}'').

==Description==
All four share the same [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] or shield, consisting of three elements: the top left section shows the [[vicuña]], the national animal, on a light-blue [[field (heraldry)|field]], representing the [[fauna]] of Peru; the tree in the top right section is the [[cinchona]] tree (the source of [[quinine]], a powerful anti-malarial drug and the key flavorant in [[tonic water]]), on a white background, representing the national [[flora]]; and the bottom [[cornucopia]] with coins spilling from it, on a red field, represents the mineral resources of the country

==Variants==

===The Coat of arms===
The [[coat of arms]] (''{{lang|es|Escudo de Armas}}'') has a [[palm branch]] on its left and an [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] one on its right, tied by a red and white ribbon, as well as a [[Holm oak]] [[civic crown]] above it. These represent victory and glory. This variant is used on the [[Flag of Peru#National ensign (state flag)|national ensign]] (''{{lang|es|Pabellón Nacional}}'') or state flag. Its use on its own is infrequent, except on [[Peruvian nuevo sol|currency]], both on coins and bills, and stamps.

===The National Coat of arms===
The National Coat of arms, or National Shield (''{{lang|es|Escudo Nacional}}''), consists of the shield plus a [[Flag of Peru|Peruvian flag]] and a standard on each side, and a Civic Crown as [[crest (heraldry)|crest]]. It is used on the [[flag of Peru#War flag|war flag]] (''{{lang|es|Bandera de Guerra}}''). Its use on its own is mandated for all public buildings, with the name of the entity under it.

===The Great Seal of the State===
The Great Seal of the State (''{{lang|es|Gran Sello del Estado}}''), consisting of the National Shield and the semicircular inscription "{{lang|es|República del Perú}}" ("Republic of Peru") above it, is used on official documents.

===The Naval Coat of arms===
The Naval Coat of Arms (''{{lang|es|Escudo de la Marina de Guerra}}''), consists of the National Shield and the semicircular inscription "{{lang|es|Marina de Guerra del Peru}}", along with anchors instead of the traditional flags it is embedded upon, as well as having an image of the sun as the crest. It is used for various naval purposes.

==History==

=== First version ===
[[File:Escudo del Perú-1821.tif|thumb|First version.]]
The first version of the Coat of Arms of Peru was designed by General [[José de San Martín]] and officially declared on 21 October 1820. It consisted of a landscape of [[Inti]] the sun rising from the [[Andes]], seen from the sea, and escorted by laurel branches tied with a golden ribbon.

In the shield, on a blue sky background, the sun's yellow rays can be seen behind the dark brown mountains rising above the blue and green ocean.

The flags of the South American nations and a banana tree can be seen behind the shield. A [[condor]] on the left and a [[llama]] on the right act as supporters.

This was on top of a [[baroque]] base, with a scroll under it with the [[motto]] "''Renació el sol del Perú''" ("Peru's sun is reborn") in capital letters. Some flowers, branches and ammunition were on the base.

===Second version===
[[File:Escudo peruano.jpg|thumb|Coat of Arms in 1825]]
[[File:Escudo de la República Peruana (1825-1950).svg|thumb|Third Coat of Arms since 1825 until 1950.]]

On 25 February 1825, [[Simón Bolívar]] and the Constituent Congress proclaimed a law defining the new national symbols. establishing the new Coat of Arms, similar to the one used today. This was designed by [[Congress of Peru|Congressmen]] José Gregorio Paredes and Francisco Javier Cortés. The official description was the following:

:"Las armas de la Nación Peruana constarán de un escudo dividido en tres campos (forma polaca), uno azul celeste, a la derecha, que llevará una vicuña mirando al interior; otro blanco, a la izquierda, donde se colocará el árbol de la quina; y otro rojo inferior y más pequeño en que se verá una cornucopia derramando monedas, significándose con estos símbolos, las preciosidades del Perú en los tres reinos naturales. El escudo tendrá por timbre una corona cívica vista de plano; e irá acompañada en cada lado de una bandera y un estandarte de los colores nacionales, señalado más adelante."

:"The arms of the Peruvian Nation shall consist of a shield divided into three fields (Polish shape), one light-blue, to the left, which will carry a vicuña looking inwards; another white, on the right, where a cinchona tree will be located; and another red below and smaller in which a cornucopia will be seen spilling coins, signifying with these symbols, the richnesses of Peru in the three natural kingdoms. The shield shall have as crest a Civic Crown seen flat; and shall be escorted on each side by a flag and standard of the same national colors, described later."

====1950 modification====

This is the coat of arms used today and is a modification of the second version. Until 1950, the coat of arms was a symbol of both the nation and the state, and presented some difficulties in its design. These generated that, months after its creation, that the seals of ministries modified the law, cutting the width of the shield to design the cornucopia comfortably, and getting rid of the escorting flags.

The last modification was in March 1950, during General [[Manuel A. Odría]]’s administration. In this way, the coat of arms was split in halves, and the lower section became the largest, rather than the smallest. The national coat of arms was created simultaneously as a heraldic symbol of the State.

'''''Creation of the World''''' is a [[mosaic]] composition in the dome of the [[Chigi Chapel]] in [[Santa Maria del Popolo]], [[Rome]], designed by [[Raphael]]. The chapel itself was designed by Raphael for his friend and patron, banker [[Agostino Chigi]] as a private chapel and family burial place. The dome was decorated with mosaics, a somewhat unusual and old-fashioned technique in the 16th century. Raphael's cartoons were executed by a Venetian craftsman, Luigi da Pace in 1516. The original cartoons were lost but some preparatory drawings, that confirm the originality of the work, survived in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]. There are two studies for the figure of God and one for the angel above Jupiter. Another drawing in the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Palais des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Lille]] shows the planet Mars with an angel. This is probably a creative drawing by a pupil suggested by its inferior quality.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Joannides: ''The Drawings of Raphael: With a Complete Catalogue'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 1983, p.231&lt;/ref&gt; Luigi da Pace signed and dated the work at the corner of the panel of Venus:&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Riegel: Die Chigi-Kapelle in Santa Maria del Popolo. Eine kritische Revision, Marburger Jahrbuch für Kunstwissenschaft, 30. Bd. (2003), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"LV[dovicus] D[e] P[ace] V[enetus] F[ecit] 1516"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Raphaels ashmolean angel.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Preparatory drawing by Raphael.]]
The central roundel represents God, the Father, surrounded by putti, effectively foreshortened in an impetuous gesture, harking back to [[Michelangelo]], which seems to give rise to the entire motion of the universe below. Eight mosaic panels show the Sun, the Moon, the starry sky and the six known planets as pagan deities depicted in half-length, each accompanied by an angel with colourful feathered wings. The figures are accompanied by the signs of the zodiac.

The sequence of the panels is as follows: the sky; [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the god holding the [[caduceus]] (with [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] and [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]); [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], the crescent moon jewelled goddess holding a bow (with [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]); [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], the bearded god holding the scythe (with [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]); [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the king of the gods with his eagle holding a thunderbolt (with [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]); [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the god of war holding a sword and a shield (with [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] and [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]); [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], the sun-jewelled god holding a bow (with [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]); [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the goddess of love with [[Cupid]] holding a torch as the Evening Star (with [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] and [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]). A French engraver, [[Nicolas Dorigny]] created a series of plates depicting the mosaics in 1695 for [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy]].

The mosaic panels are surrounded by richly gilded stucco decoration. The blue background creates an optical illusion giving the impression of an architectural framework opening to the sky above the chapel. The panels look like illusionistic skylights between the gilt stucco ribs while God is standing on the edge of the central oculus.&lt;ref&gt;John Shearman: The Chigi Chapel in S. Maria del Popolo, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 24, No. 3/4 (Jul. - Dec., 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional interpretation of the dome is that the composition shows the ''Creation of the World''. Another (disputed) interpretation claims that it represents the cosmos as described by [[Plato]] in a Christianized [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] form. This idea had a widespread popularity in the Renaissance. In this case the dome is a depiction of the Realm of the Soul after Death with God, the Father receiving the soul (of Agostino Chigi) in his new home. The presence of the signs of the zodiac corroborates this interpretation because the signs were symbols of the passage of time in eternity, and they appeared in antique funeral art around the image of the departed.

Nicole Riegel emphasized the role of the angels in the composition: "In view of the important, anything but accessory position of the angels in the panels, there is an unmistakable effort for a reconciliation or interfusion of the Pagan and Christian life view."&lt;ref&gt;Op. cit. p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical Metrics''' was a web-based [[Recommender system|music recommendation service]]. Unlike user-driven sites like [[The Hype Machine]] and [[Pandora (music service)|Pandora]], Critical Metrics featured only expert-generated content. Aggregating reviews and playlists from over 150 publications, both print and online, the site also encompassed historical sources. The site then ranked the songs mathematically, based on the information gathered. With a methodology based in the fields of [[bibliometrics]] and [[sentiment analysis]], Critical Metrics quantified these positive citations and sentiments into indices for media playlisting and consumption.

Streaming audio and [[YouTube]] videos were presented with the original recommendations, along with the option to purchase via [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] or other online retailers. When the site was launched in April 2007, it hosted the streaming music itself. A licensing arrangement with [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] removed the free music, but allowed unlimited listening and playlist-building for Rhapsody subscribers.

Critical Metrics was founded by Joey Anuff, the co-founder of [[Suck.com]] and a former [[VH1]] executive. The site was praised by [[Boing Boing]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[Business Week]]''. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' senior music critic [[Ann Powers]] referred to the site as her "favorite snobby top 40 station".

'''''Danse macabre''''', [[opus number|Op.]] 40, is a [[tone poem]] for orchestra, written in 1874 by the French composer [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]. It is in the key of [[G minor]]. It started out in 1872 as an [[art song]] for voice and piano with a French text by the poet [[Henri Cazalis]], which is based on an [[Danse Macabre|old French superstition]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Malcolm. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/07153 "Dance of death]",  Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 6 October 2015. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, the composer expanded and reworked the piece into a tone poem, replacing the vocal line with a solo violin part.

==Analysis==
According to legend, "[[Death (personification)|Death]]" appears at midnight every year on [[Halloween]]. Death calls forth the dead from their [[grave (burial)|graves]] to dance for him while he plays his [[violin|fiddle]] (here represented by a solo violin). His skeletons dance for him until the rooster crows at dawn, when they must return to their graves until the next year.

The piece opens with a harp playing a single note, D, twelve times (the twelve strokes of midnight) which is accompanied by soft chords from the string section. The solo violin enters playing the [[tritone]], which was known as the ''[[Tritone#Historical uses|diabolus in musica]]'' ("the Devil in music") during the Medieval and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras, consisting of an A and an E{{music|flat}}—in an example of [[scordatura]] tuning, the violinist's E string has actually been tuned down to an E{{music|flat}} to create the dissonant tritone. 

The first theme is heard on a solo flute,&lt;ref&gt;[IMSLP full score, page 3]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the second theme, a descending scale on the solo violin which is accompanied by soft chords from the string section.&lt;ref&gt;[full score, page 4, 4th bar]&lt;/ref&gt; The first and second themes, or fragments of them, are then heard throughout the various sections of the orchestra. The piece becomes more energetic and at its midpoint, right after a [[contrapuntal]] section based on the second theme,&lt;ref&gt;[full score, page 13, rehearsal letter C]&lt;/ref&gt; there is a direct quote&lt;ref&gt;[full score, page 16, rehearsal letter D]&lt;/ref&gt; played by the woodwinds of ''[[Dies irae]]'', a [[Gregorian chant]] from the [[Requiem]] that is melodically related to the work's second theme. The ''Dies irae'' is presented unusually in a major key. After this section the piece returns to the first and second themes and climaxes with the full orchestra playing very strong dynamics. Then there is an abrupt break in the texture&lt;ref&gt;[full score, page 50, 6th bar]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[coda (music)|coda]] represents the dawn breaking (a [[cockerel]]'s crow, played by the [[oboe]]) and the skeletons returning to their graves.

The piece makes particular use of the [[xylophone]] to imitate the sounds of rattling bones. Saint-Saëns uses a similar [[motif (music)|motif]] in the ''Fossils'' movement of ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]''.

==Instrumentation==
''Danse macabre'' is scored for an [[obbligato]] violin and an orchestra consisting of one [[piccolo]], two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}}, two [[bassoon]]s; four [[French horn|horns]] in G and D, two [[trumpet]]s in D, three [[trombone]]s, one [[tuba]]; a percussion section that includes [[timpani]], [[xylophone]], [[bass drum]], [[cymbals]] and [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]; one [[harp]] and [[string section|strings]].

==Reception==
When ''Danse macabre'' was first performed it was not well received.&lt;ref name=nichols&gt;Nichols, Roger (2012), Notes to Chandos CD CHSA 5104, OCLC 794163802&lt;/ref&gt; The piece caused widespread consternation: the commentator Roger Nichols mentions adverse reaction to "the deformed ''Dies irae'' plainsong", the "horrible screeching from solo violin", the use of a xylophone and "the hypnotic repetitions", in which Nichols hears a pre-echo of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]].&lt;ref name=nichols/&gt;

Today, it's considered one of Saint-Saëns masterpieces, widely regarded and reproduced in erudite and popular culture.

==Usage==
Shortly after the premiere, the piece was transcribed into a piano arrangement by [[Franz Liszt]] (S.555),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Franz Liszt: A Guide to Research |last=Salle |first=Michael |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-94011-7 |page=460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a good friend of Saint-Saëns. The best-known piano transcription (for four hands)  is by [[Ernest Guiraud]]. The composition was again later transcribed for piano by [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. There is an organ transcription by [[Edwin Lemare]].

The piece was later used in dance performances, including those of [[Anna Pavlova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Legacies of Twentieth-century Dance |last=Garafola |first=Lynn |year=2005 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8195-6674-4 |pages=155–156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is played offstage during the first act of Henrik Ibsen's 1896 play ''[[John Gabriel Borkman]].''

The piece is used as a recurring ironic motif in Jean Renoir's 1939 film ''[[The Rules of the Game]]'' (La Règle du Jeu),

An adaptation of the piece is used as the theme music for ''[[Jonathan Creek]]'', a mystery crime series on British television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/composers/saint-saens/guides/saint-saens-facts/jonathan-creek-13/|title=A Danse Macabre|website=Classicfm.com|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is used in the animated television series ''[[Modern Toss (TV series)|Modern Toss]]'' as the theme tune for the character, Mr. Tourette - Master Signwriter.

The piece is used in the Dutch theme park ''[[Efteling]]'' in the attraction [[Haunted Castle (Efteling)|Haunted Castle]].

It can be heard in [[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|''Alone in the Dark'']] after setting the record on the Gramophone in the Dance Hall.

A portion of the piece can be heard in the 1993 [[western film]] ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' during the performance of the stage version of ''[[Faust]]''.

A synthesized version of the piece is used in the soundtrack for the anime television series [[Dimension W]].

In Neil Gaiman's novel ''[[The Graveyard Book]]'' the characters dance the "Macabray". In the audiobook, the Danse Macabre is played between chapters.

Korean figure skater [[Yuna Kim]] used the piece as her short program music in 2008-2009 season.

The piece is used in several instances during the 2011 ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]'' episode ''[[Danse Macabre (Grimm episode)|Danse Macabre]]'', for which it is named.

The piece can be heard during the New Year's Eve festivities in the 2014 [[Gothic horror|gothic horror film]], ''[[Stonehearst Asylum]].''

The piece is played in the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' episode "[[Hush (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Hush]]"; rather than serving merely as soundtrack, the character [[Rupert Giles]] plays the song in-universe while describing the episode's villains, the Gentlemen.

The piece's title is used for a [[Hitman (2016 video game)|''Hitman'']] mission set in Italy, in which [[Agent 47]] is required to crush three victims with falling objects while dressed as a plague doctor.

The piece is arranged in multiple levels of [[The End Is Nigh (video game)|''The End is Nigh'']], such as "The End" and "Mortaman".

The piece is used in the opening of Season 2 Episode 8 of the [[USA Network|USA]] original, ''[[Mr. Robot]]''.

The piece was used in a [[Jameson Irish Whiskey]] commercial &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqYOv3-nqUo|title=Jameson Irish Whiskey - Giant Bird|first=|last=macturtle|date=26 November 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Décolletage''' {{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|l|ə|t|ɑː|ʒ}} (or '''décolleté''', its adjectival form, in current [[French language|French]]) is a term used in woman's fashion referring to the upper part of a woman's [[torso]], comprising her neck, shoulders, back and upper chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. The term is most commonly used in Western female fashions and is most commonly applied to a [[neckline]] that reveals or emphasizes [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]. Low-cut necklines are a feature of [[ball gown]]s, [[evening gown]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[lingerie]] and [[swimsuit]]s, among other fashions. Although décolletage does not itself prescribe the extent of exposure of a woman's upper chest, the design of a décolleté garment takes into account current fashions, aesthetics, social norms and the occasion when a garment will be worn.

Though neckline styles have varied in Western societies and décolletage may be regarded as [[aesthetic]] and an expression of [[femininity]], in some parts of the world any décolletage is considered provocative and shocking.

== Etymology ==

Décolletage is a French word which is derived from ''décolleter'', meaning to reveal the neck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/d%C3%A9collet%C3%A9 The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in English literature sometime before 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Barnhart|editor-first=Robert K.|title=Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-270084-1|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In strict usage, décolletage is the neckline extending about two handbreadths from the base of the neck down, front and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudofsky|first=Bernard|title=The Unfashionable Human Body|year=1984|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-442-27636-2|edition=Repr. d.

== History ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Studioportret van een Javaanse vrouw mogelijk uit Jogjakarta TMnr 60027279.jpg|230px|thumb|right| [[Indonesia]]n woman in traditional [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] ''kemben'', c. 1900.]]

In [[Indonesia]] (especially in [[Javanese people|Java]]), a breast cloth known as ''[[kemben]]'' was worn for centuries until the 20th century. Today, shoulder-exposing gowns still feature in many [[culture of Indonesia|Indonesian rituals]].

Gowns which exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and non-controversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, pp. 25–26, 43, 53, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris. ''The Naked Woman. A Study of the Female Body'', p. 156. New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2004. {{ISBN|0-312-33853-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During that long period, low-cut dresses partially exposing breasts were considered more acceptable than they are today; a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders were considered more risqué than exposed breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-486-27124-8 |author=C. Willett |author2=Phillis Cunnington |last-author-amp=yes |title=The History of Underclothes |location=London |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1450, [[Agnès Sorel]], mistress to [[Charles VII of France]], is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with [[toplessness|fully bared breasts]] in the French court.&lt;ref name="histoire_mode"&gt;Monique Canellas-Zimmer, ''Histoires de mode'', Les Dossiers d'Aquitaine - 2005, {{ISBN|9782846221191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included [[Simonetta Vespucci]], whose [[Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci (Piero di Cosimo)|portrait with exposed breasts]] was painted by [[Piero di Cosimo]] in c. 1480.

Based on woodcut prints, a researcher has argued that during the 17th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/ne1000000086551/ |title=Historian Reveals Janet Jackson's 'Accidental' Exposing of Her Breast was the Height of Fashion in the 1600s|date=5 May 2004|publisher=University of Warwick |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040803155530/http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |archivedate = 3 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne of Brittany]] has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], wife of [[Charles I of England]], were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect [[Inigo Jones]] designed a [[masque]] costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigel Llewellyn 1660"/&gt;

In [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] and upper-class circles, the display of breasts was at times regarded as a [[status symbol]], as a sign of beauty, wealth or social position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/caricatures/fr6-wetnursing.cfm |title=French Caricature |accessdate=2010-01-13 |publisher=University of Virginia Health System |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601211316/http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/caricatures/fr6-wetnursing.cfm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Renaissance]] onwards, the bared breast even invoked associations with nude sculptures of [[Ancient Greece|classical Greece]] that were exerting an influence on art, sculpture, and architecture of the period.&lt;ref name="Nigel Llewellyn 1660"&gt;Lucy Gent and Nigel Llewellyn, eds., ''Renaissance Bodies: The Human Figure in English Culture c. 1540–1660''. London: Reaktion Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[French Revolution]] décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back.&lt;ref&gt;S. Devadas Pillai. ''Indian Sociology through Ghurye, A Dictionary'', p. 68, Popular Prakashan, 1997, {{ISBN|81-7154-807-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1795–1820 in fashion|fashions of the period 1795–1820]], many women wore dresses which bared the bosom and shoulders.

During the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end of the 19th century), the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions. (See [[1880s in fashion]].) In 1884, a portrait painting by [[John Singer Sargent]] of American-born Paris socialite, [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]], was criticised&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ormand and Elaine Kilmurray, ''Sargent: The Early Portraits'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998, p. 114, {{ISBN|0-300-07245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she was depicted in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884, his reputation in tatters. The painting was named "[[Portrait of Madame X]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |title=John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-300-08744-4 |page=139, Note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&amp;p=a&amp;a=i&amp;ID=424 "Sargent's Portraits"], an article including a mention of the scandal caused by the portrayal of cleavage in [[John Singer Sargent]]'s "[[Portrait of Madame X]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

When it became fashionable, around 1913, for dresses to be worn with what would now be considered a relatively modest round or V-shaped neckline, [[clergymen]] all over the world became deeply shocked. In the [[German Empire]], all of the [[Roman Catholic]] bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking modern fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim,  94.&lt;/ref&gt; Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more permitted in Western societies, during [[World War I]] and remained so for nearly half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Kim K. P. Johnson, Susan J. Torntore, and Joanne Bubolz Eicher. ''Fashion foundations'', p. 716, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-619-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Hollywood film ''[[The French Line]]'' was found objectionable under the strict [[Hays Code]] with some of [[Jane Russell]]'s décolletage gowns being described as "intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme décolletage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doherty|first=Thomas|title=Hollywood's Censor: Joseph I. Breen and the Production Code Administration|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14358-5|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, [[Gina Lollobrigida]] raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations.

During a short period in 1964, "topless" dress designs appeared at fashion shows, but those who wore the dresses in public found themselves arrested on indecency charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sixtiescity.com/Fashion/Fashion.shtm |title=Sixties City – Bringing on back the good times |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104085440/http://sixtiescity.com/Fashion/Fashion.shtm |archivedate=2010-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cleavage of a woman.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A woman's revealing [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]], is a modern form of décolletage]]

Low necklines usually result in increased décolletage. In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much body, and especially breast, exposure is acceptable in public.&lt;ref&gt;Salmansohn, Karen. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-salmansohn/the_power_of_cleavage_b_70260.html The Power of Cleavage]". ''The Huffington Post'', October 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered the appropriate neckline varies by context, and is open to differences of opinion. In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, [[Southwest Airlines]] crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters, or to leave the plane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;NBC News.

The movie compiles interviews from gamers, developers, journalists to show how pervasive sexist behavior is in the gaming world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/culture/2015/06/18/docfest-film-reviews-playing-games-with-top-spin-and-gtfo/|title=DocFest film reviews: Playing games with ‘Top Spin’ and ‘GTFO’|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|first=John|last=Angelico|date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's premiere at South by Southwest was met with primarily favorable reviews, with critic Dennis Harvey commenting: "Several other documentaries are currently in the works on the same subject, and many will no doubt be a lot slicker than 'GTFO.' But the rough edges of Sun-Higginson’s Kickstarter-funded feature lend it an ingratiating, unpretentious modesty, and its lack of rancor on a topic that might’ve easily supported a more sensationalist approach can only be a plus in reaching male gamers most in need of its wake-up call."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sxsw-film-review-gtfo-get-the-f-out-1201458625/|title=‘GTFO’ Review: An Entertaining, Accessible Look at Misogyny in the Videogaming World - Variety|author=Dennis Harvey|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''holmium–magnesium–zinc (Ho–Mg–Zn) quasicrystal''' is a [[quasicrystal]] made of an alloy of those three metals that has the shape of a regular [[dodecahedron]], a [[Platonic solid]] with 12 five-sided faces. Unlike the similar [[pyritohedron]] shape of some cubic-system crystals such as [[pyrite]], this quasicrystal has faces that are true regular pentagons.

[[File:Falconry Book of Frederick II 1240s detail falconers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Detail of two [[falconry|falconers]] from the Medieval ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'', c. 1240]]
'''Human uses of birds''' have included both economic uses such as food and symbolic uses such as art, music and religion, for thousands of years.

In terms of economic uses, birds have been hunted for food since [[Palaeolithic]] times. They have been captured and bred as [[poultry]] to provide meat and eggs since at least the time of ancient Egypt. Some species have been used, too, to help locate or to catch food, as with [[cormorant fishing]] and the use of [[greater honeyguide|honeyguides]]. Feathers have long been used for bedding, as well as for [[quill pen]]s and for [[Fletching|fletching arrows]].
Today, many species face [[habitat loss]] and other threats caused by humans; [[bird conservation]] groups work to protect birds and to influence governments to do so.

Birds have appeared in the mythologies and religions of many cultures since ancient [[Sumer]]. For example, the dove was the symbol of the ancient [[Mesopotamian goddess]] [[Inanna]], the [[Canaan]]ite mother goddess [[Asherah]], and the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]. [[Athena]], the Greek goddess of wisdom, had a [[little owl]] as her symbol, and, in ancient India, the [[peacock]] represented [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]. Birds have often been seen as symbols, whether bringing bad luck and death, being sacred, or being used in [[heraldry]]. 
In terms of entertainment, [[Bird of prey|raptors]] have been used in [[falconry]], while [[aviculture|cagebirds]] have been kept for their [[bird vocalization|song]]. Other birds have been raised for the traditional sports of [[cockfight]]ing and [[pigeon racing]]. [[Birdwatching]], too, has grown to become a major leisure activity.
Birds feature in a wide variety of art forms, including in [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[poetry]] and [[prose]], [[film]] and [[fashion]]. [[Birds in music|Birds also appear in music]] as well as traditional [[dance]] and [[ballet]]. In certain cases, such as the [[bird-and-flower painting]] of China, birds are central to an artistic genre.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by birds in human culture, so defined.

==Economic uses==

Birds are important economically, providing substantial amounts of food, especially protein, largely but not exclusively from the domestic chicken;&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;&lt;ref name=CIWF/&gt; feathers and down are used for bedding, insulation, and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sheikh |first1=Farhan |title=Poultry feathers-how many ways they can be used for? |url=http://thepoultryguide.com/uses-of-chicken-feathers/ |website=The Poultry Guide |date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As food===

[[File:Egyptian - Vase in the Shape of a Duck - Walters 48421 - Profile.jpg|thumb|left|Ducks were common in [[Ancient Egypt]], as depicted in this 3rd century BC [[faience]] vase.]]

[[Birds]] were among the wild animals hunted for food before the [[Neolithic revolution]] and the development of agriculture. For example, in the [[Epipaleolithic]] of the [[Levant]], between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both [[waterfowl]] and [[bird migration|migratory birds]] were eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cummings |first1=Vicki |last2=Jordan |first2=Peter |last3=Zvelebil |first3=Marek|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology and Anthropology of Hunter-Gatherers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nl2yAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT239 |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-102526-6 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example, waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Robert L. |title=The Lifeways of Hunter-Gatherers: The Foraging Spectrum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDAWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53 |year=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-02487-8 |pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battery hens -Bastos, Sao Paulo, Brazil-31March2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Battery hens: [[poultry]] is a major source of food, the [[chicken]] alone providing 20% of the world's animal protein.&lt;ref name=Poultry/&gt;]]

Birds have been [[domestication|domesticated]] and bred as [[poultry]] for use as food for at least four thousand years. The most important species is the [[chicken]]. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |author1=Adler, Jerry |author2=Lawler, Andrew |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/ |newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine |date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Egypt]], poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1998 |author=Manuelian, Peter der |title=Egypt: The World of the Pharaohs |location=Cologne, Germany|publisher=Könemann |isbn=3-89508-913-3 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicken now provides some 20% of the animal protein eaten by the world's human population in the form of meat and [[egg]]s. [[Poultry farming|Chickens are often raised intensively]] in [[battery farm]]s; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds.&lt;ref name=CIWF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/chickens/egg-laying-hens/ |title=About egg laying hens |publisher=Compassion in World Farming |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species including [[ducks]], [[geese]], [[pheasants]], [[guineafowl]] and [[turkeys]] are significant economically around the world.&lt;ref name=Poultry&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Poultry |url=http://www.poultryclub.org/poultry/history-of-poultry/ |publisher=The Poultry Club of Great Britain |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly raised species such as the [[ostrich]] are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in [[cholesterol]]; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shanawany |first1=M. M. |title=Recent developments in ostrich farming |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v6200t/v6200T02.htm |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds are hunted in many countries around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as [[mallard]], [[wigeon]], [[shoveler]] and [[teal]] have for centuries been captured by [[waterfowl hunting|wildfowlers]], while pheasants, [[partridges]], [[driven grouse shooting|grouse]], and [[snipe]] are among the terrestrial birds that are [[hunting|hunted]] for sport, generally with guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marchington |first1=John |title=History of Wildfowling |date=1980 |publisher=A &amp; C Black |isbn=978-0-713-62053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of the world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where [[cassowaries]], [[crowned pigeon]]s, [[hornbill]]s and [[megapode]]s are captured for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pangau-Adam |first1=Margaretha |last2=Noske |first2=Richard |editor1-last=Tideman |editor1-first=Sonia |editor2-last=Gosler |editor2-first=Andrew |title=Wildlife Hunting and Bird Trade in Northern Papua (Irian Jaya), Indonesia |work=Aboriginal stories: The riches and colour of Australian birds |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan|pages=74–85 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim_Whiteside/publication/236596667_Aboriginal_stories_The_riches_and_colour_of_Australian_birds/links/0046352d335d8135ea000000/Aboriginal-stories-The-riches-and-colour-of-Australian-birds.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seabird]]s such as [[Muttonbirding|muttonbirds]], [[penguin]]s and [[auks]] have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the [[great auk]], extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simeone, A.  |author2=Navarro, X. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Human exploitation of seabirds in coastal southern Chile during the mid-Holocene |journal=Rev.

===Assisting hunters and gatherers===
[[File:Greater Honeyguide, Gambia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Some peoples in Africa are guided to the nests of wild bees by the [[greater honeyguide]].]]

The archaeological and historical records suggest interdependence between humans and [[vulture]]s for millions of years. Like other animal species, early [[hominin]]s probably used these birds as beacons signalling the location of meat, in the form of [[Cadaver|carcasses]], in the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morelli |first=F. |last2=Kubicka |first2=A. | last3=Tryjanowski |first3=P. | last4=Nelson |first4=N. |year=2015 |title=The vulture in the sky and the hominin on the land: three million years of human-vulture interaction |journal=Anthrozoos  |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=449–468 |doi=10.1080/08927936.2015.1052279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cormorant fishing]] is a traditional fishing method in which trained [[cormorant]]s are used to catch fish in rivers. Historically, cormorant fishing has taken place in [[Japan]] and [[China]] since about 960 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = C.

[[Aviculture|Cagebirds]] such as [[domestic canary|canaries]], [[budgerigars]], [[cockatoo]]s, [[lovebird]]s, [[quail]]s, [[finch]]es, and [[parrot]]s are popular [[pet]]s, whether for their song, their behaviour, their colourful plumage, or their [[talking bird|ability to mimic speech]].

The nature writers Mark Cocker and [[Richard Mabey]], reviewing people's love of birds, observe that people are touched by feelings for birds in a variety of ways, such as enjoying the [[northern lapwing|lapwing's]] "joyous display",&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cocker |first1=Mark |last2=Mabey |first2=Richard |author2link=Richard Mabey |title=Birds Britannica |titlelink=Birds Britannica |date=2005 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |isbn=0-7011-6907-9 |pages=ix–x, 436–437 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "beauty and mystery" of the [[tawny owl]]'s call on a cold winter's night.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; They argue that people feel the simple companionship of birds, are inspired by them to create art, let them mark the seasons and provide a sense of place, and use them "as symbols of joy and love".&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; A former statesman, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], was able to express his feeling for birds in his 1927 book ''The Charm of Birds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Grey, Edward |authorlink1=Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon |title=The Charm of Birds |date=1927 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such feelings, in turn, have stimulated the intention to conserve birds and their habitats.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; Around the same time as Grey was writing, the first conservation organisations were coming into being, starting in Britain, triggered by the rapid disappearance of familiar species as they were captured for their feathers or for food.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; A substantial folklore rich in symbolism has accrued around birds; it was documented early in the 20th century as something that was already fading from memory. For example, the [[house sparrow]] has been associated with "sex and lechery"&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; since ancient Egypt, where libidinousness was written with the sparrow hieroglyph. In the same vein, in the classical era the sparrow was sacred to the goddess of love, [[Aphrodite]] or [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]]; the sparrow features in an erotic poem by Catullus for the same reason. [[Chaucer]] describes the summoner in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' as being as "lecherous as a sparwe".&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ingersoll |first1=Ernest |title=Birds in Legend, Fable, and Folklore |date=1923 |publisher=Longmans Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong |first1=Edward A. |title=The Folklore of Birds|date=1958 |publisher=Collins ([[New Naturalist]] series)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown how important birds are to individual societies, touching on all aspects of life. In Andean societies such as the [[Moche culture|Moche]] (1–800 AD), [[Nazca people|Nazca]] (100–700 AD) and [[Chimu]] (1150–1450 AD), bright parrot and macaw feathers were traded from the Amazon rainforest to the mountains and the Pacific coast, while guano was collected as a fertiliser, and artists and craftsmen were inspired to create textiles, metal jewellery, and ceramics depicting condors, cormorants, ducks, hummingbirds, owls, vultures, and waders. Their religions, too, endowed birds with symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds of the Andes |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bird/hd_bird.htm |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Audubon society]], reviewing the importance of birds in 2013, obtained statements from many people with differing perspectives.

Birds have sometimes served as religious symbols.

In Medieval Christian iconography, the [[cormorant]]'s "wing-drying" pose represents the Christian cross, and hence is a figure of Christ. In [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', on the other hand, the bird's cross-like pose is a travesty of Christ: "Then up he flew, and...

''Extinct Birds of New Zealand'', Te Papa Press, Wellington {{ISBN|978-0-909010-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Persian mythology, the [[simurgh]] was a gigantic bird, the first to come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality.

In [[Chinese painting|Chinese art]], [[bird-and-flower painting]] forms one of the three major subjects (the others being landscapes and figures), from the time of the [[Five Dynasties]] in the 10th century. [[Huang Quan (painter)|Huang Quan]] created the naturalistic ''xiesheng'' style for bird paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bird Painting |url=http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/painting-birds.php |website=China Online Museum |accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Birds have long been celebrated in the [[Japanese art|arts of Japan]], including in painting, woodblock printing, cloisonné, ceramics and indeed poetry from the 18th and 19th centuries. Print artists like [[Utamaro]] and [[Hokusai]] made use of Western and Chinese influences to give a sophisticated effect, while [[Hiroshige]] reworked the traditional bird-and-flower genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds in Japanese Art and Poetry |url=http://www.worcesterart.org/exhibitions/past/birds_in_japanese.html |publisher=Worcester Art Museum |accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poetry====

Birds have been celebrated in [[poetry]] since ancient times, when for example the Roman poet [[Catullus]] wrote in one of his most famous works about a girl and her pet [[sparrow]] in ''[[Catullus 2|Passer, deliciae meae puellae]]'', "Sparrow, delight of my girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Phillimore, J.S. |title=Passer: Catull.

Birds featured in medieval poetry, for example forming the characters of the 1177 Persian poem ''[[The Conference of the Birds]]'', where the birds of the world assemble under the wisest bird, the [[hoopoe]], to decide who is to be their king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conference of the Birds |author=Attar, Farid al-Din |authorlink=Farid al-Din Attar |editor1=Darbandi, Afkham |editor2=Davis, Dick |publisher=Penguin Classics |date=1984 |isbn=978-0-14-044434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English romantic poetry, [[John Keats]]'s 1819 "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]" and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s 1820 "[[To a Skylark]]" are popular classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooks |first=Cleanth |last2=Warren |first2=Robert Penn |title=The ''Ode to a Nightingale'' |work=Keats's Odes |editor-first=Jack |editor-last=Stillinger |pages=44–47 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Sandy | first=Mark | title=To a Skylark | encyclopedia=The Literary Encyclopedia | date=2002 | url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=7305 | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird poems by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] include "Sea and Skylark" and "[[The Windhover]]" (on the kestrel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hopkins |first1=Gerard Manley |title=Poems and Prose |date=1985 |publisher=Penguin Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afjmf6TpHagC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227|isbn=9780140420159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Ted Hughes]]'s 1970 collection of poems about a bird character, "[[Crow (poetry)|Crow]]", is considered one of his most important works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetedhughessociety.org/crow.htm |title=Crow – The Ted Hughes Society Journal |publisher=The Ted Hughes Society |date=2012 |accessdate=22 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702124543/http://www.thetedhughessociety.org/crow.htm |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Billy |title=Bright Wings|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-15084-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, birds have appeared in books illustrated by some exceptional artists, producing images that were accurate and beautiful, and that made use of the latest available printing techniques. The [[wood engraver]] [[Thomas Bewick]]'s 1797–1804 ''[[A History of British Birds]]'' brought affordable illustrations to the public for the first time, and the book formed in effect the first [[field guide]] to birds,&lt;ref name=Uglow&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/oct/14/art.biography | agency=[[The Guardian]] | title=Small wonders | date=14 October 2006 | accessdate=12 January 2013 | author=Uglow, Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Uglow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcastle"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st December – The Partridge|url=https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/speccoll/tag/thomas-bewick/|publisher=Newcastle University|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John James Audubon]]'s enormous&lt;ref&gt;The first [[Book size|double elephant folio]] edition was 39.5 inches high by 28.5 inches wide. {{cite web |url=http://minniesland.com/prints/audubon_folio_birds_havell.htm |title=Prints: Audubon's Folio Birds Havell Edition (1827-1838) |publisher=minniesland.com |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and impressive images of birds in his 1827–1838 ''[[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]'' are among the most admired by art critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smart |first1=Alastair |title=The best birds in art |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/10816680/The-best-birds-in-art.html |accessdate=22 April 2016 |agency=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/12/books | work=The Economist | title=Book value | date=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithologist [[John Gould]]'s bird illustrations, in books such as ''A Century of Birds hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains'' (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume ''The Birds of Australia'' (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Karen S.|title=John Gould: Bird Illustration in the Age of Darwin|url=https://exhibits.lib.ku.edu/exhibits/show/gould/about/kucollections|publisher=University of Kansas Gould Collections|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds are popular characters in children's books, which are often handsomely illustrated. [[Beatrix Potter]]'s 1908 ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-duck]]'' created an enduringly popular bird heroine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taylor, Judy |year=1996 |origyear=1986 |title=Beatrix Potter: Artist, Storyteller and Countrywoman |publisher=Frederick Warne |isbn=0-7232-4175-9 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors followed with many bird characters in books for children of different ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Gill |title=Gill Lewis's top 10 birds in books |url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/31/top-ten-birds-childrens-books-gill-lewis |work=The Guardian |date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In books for adults, birds may have symbolic or psychological significance. For instance, [[Paul Gallico]]'s 1940 ''[[The Snow Goose: A Story of Dunkirk]]'' was a parable about the regenerative power of friendship in wartime; the goose symbolises both the hero, Rhayader, a wounded artist, and the world wounded by war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/19/winter-reads-snow-goose-paul-gallico |author=Allardice, Lisa |title=Winter reads: The Snow Goose by Paul Gallico |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. H. White]]'s 1951 ''The Goshawk'' describes the author's "monstrous and often cruel battles" to train his bird of prey, while [[Helen Macdonald (writer)|Helen Macdonald]]'s 2014 ''[[H is for Hawk]]'', which references White's book, tells how her obsession with the same species as a falconer helped her through the loss of her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Rachel |title=H is for Hawk review – Helen Macdonald's taming of a goshawk called Mabel reads like a thriller |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/h-is-for-hawk-review-helen-macdonald-taming-goshawk-mabel |work=The Guardian |date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====
{{main|Birds in music}}
[[File:Léon Bakst 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Ballerina in ''[[The Firebird]]'' by [[Léon Bakst]], 1910]]

[[Birds in music|In music]], [[birdsong]] has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Beethoven]] did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, first seen in the work of [[Ottorino Respighi]]; or as [[Beatrice Harrison]] did in 1924 with a [[nightingale]], and [[David Rothenberg]] did in 2000 with a [[laughingthrush]], they can duet with birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Head, Matthew |title=Birdsong and the Origins of Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |volume=122 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1093/jrma/122.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark, Suzannah |year=2001 |title=Music Theory and Natural Order from the Renaissance to the Early Twentieth Century |journal=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-77191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ledger&gt;{{cite news |last=Reich |first=Ronni |title=NJIT professor finds nothing cuckoo in serenading our feathered friends |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2010/10/njit_professor_finds_nothing_c.html |accessdate=19 June 2011 |newspaper=Star Ledger |date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two groups of scientists, namely Luis Felipe Baptista and Robin A. Keister in 2005, and Adam Tierney and colleagues in 2011, have argued that [[birdsong]] has a similar structure to music. Baptista and Keister argue that the way birds use variations of [[rhythm]], relationships of [[musical pitch]], and combinations of [[musical note|note]]s is somewhat musical, perhaps because some birds exploit variation in song to avoid monotony, or [[mimicry|mimic]] other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baptista |first1=Luis Felipe |last2=Keister |first2=Robin A. |title=Why Birdsong is Sometimes Like Music |journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |date=2005 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=426–443 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2005.0066 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/185549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tierney argues that the similar motor constraints on human and avian song drive these to have similar song structures, including "arch-shaped and descending melodic contours in musical phrases", long notes at the ends of phrases, and typically small differences in pitch between adjacent notes.&lt;ref name=Tierney&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tierney |first1=Adam T. |last2=Russo |first2=Frank A. |last3=Patel |first3=Aniruddh D. |title=The motor origins of human and avian song structure |journal=PNAS |date=2011 |volume=108 |issue=37 |pages=15510–15515 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1103882108 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/37/15510.full.pdf |pmid=21876156 |pmc=3174665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dance====

Birds feature as central characters in [[dance]] traditions around the world.
For example, [[Goldie's bird of paradise]] is celebrated in Papua New Guinea in a "beautiful"&lt;ref name=LeCroy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LeCroy |first1=Mary |last2=Kulupi |first2=Alfred |last3=Peckover |first3=W. S. |title=Goldie's Bird of Paradise: Display, Natural History and Traditional Relationships of People to the Bird |journal=The Wilson Bulletin|date=September 1980 |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=289–301 |url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v092n03/p0289-p0301.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; dance by two men who dress in grass skirts with the bird's plumes on the rump; they carry [[cassowary]] feathers in their hands and on their armbands, and imitate the bird's calls while they dance. It is performed on important occasions, carrying "special magic",&lt;ref name=LeCroy/&gt; and the performers are obliged to prepare for a week, avoiding certain foods, and undergoing a prolonged submergence in a cold stream to prepare their minds. The dance is preceded by a "magic chant" to the bird of paradise.&lt;ref name=LeCroy/&gt;
In [[Balinese dance]], the [[Cendrawasih (dance)|cendrawasih]] dance illustrates the [[bird-of-paradise]]'s mating rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Tari Cendrawasih Keelokan Gerak dan Busana |trans-title=Cendrawasih Dance: The Beauty of Costume and Movement |language=Indonesian |work=Pikiran Rakyat  |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/269737 |date=12 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TtXit61n?url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/269737 |archivedate=7 November 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, the [[Ewe people]] of Ghana, who were said to have been guided from Dahomey to Ghana by a bird, incorporate the flapping of the bird's wings in dances such as ''Agbadza'', ''Atsiagbekor'', and ''Gakpa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Welsh-Asante |first=Kariamu |title=African Dance: An Artistic, Historical, and Philosophical Inquiry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnsWhJGkXo8C&amp;pg=PA14 |year=1996 |publisher=Africa World Press |isbn=978-0-86543-197-3 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ballet]], [[Tchaikovsky]]'s classical 1895 ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1910 ''[[The Firebird]]'' have central bird characters.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Roland John. ''Tchaikovsky's Ballets: Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, Nutcracker''. Oxford University Press 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The dramatic arts====
[[File:Alabastron (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ancient Greek]] bird: an [[alabastron]], 600 BC]]

In [[theatre]], [[Aristophanes]]'s 414 BC [[Greek comedy|comedy]] ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ὄρνιθες}} ''Ornithes'') is an acclaimed fantasy with effective mimicry of birds. The play's chorus consists of characters playing many identifiable species, including the [[kingfisher]], [[Streptopelia|turtledove]], and [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrowhawk]]; birds feature as messengers and dancers, and several Athenians are compared to specific birds.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Birds and Other Plays''. Barrett, D.; Sommerstein, A. Penguin Classics, 1978, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Drama''. [[Peter Levi|Levi, Peter]] in 'The Oxford History of the Classical World'. Boardman, J.; Griffin, J.; Murray, O. (eds), Oxford University Press, 1986, page 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[film]], birds can feature as the major driving force in a story, as in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s acclaimed 1963 ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''. Loosely based on [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s [[The Birds (story)|story of the same name]], it tells the tale of sudden attacks on people by violent flocks of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=David |authorlink=David Thomson (film critic) |title='Have You Seen…?' A Personal introduction to 1,000 Films |year=2008 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0-375-71134-3 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bird plays the role of an outlet for a person's feelings in [[Ken Loach]]'s much admired&lt;ref name=BFI/&gt; 1969 ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]''. The film is based on [[Barry Hines]]'s 1968 novel ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'', and tells the story of a young boy who [[Bildungsroman|comes of age]] by training a [[kestrel]] that he has taken from the nest.&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;{{cite web |title=Kes (1969) |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6adf17e2 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds feature also in the mass media with iconic [[animated cartoon]] characters such as [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Donald Duck]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Blitz | first=Marcia | title=Donald Duck | year=1979 | publisher=[[Harmony Books]] | isbn=0-517-52961-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]]'s [[Tweety Pie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hartl |first1=John |title=Warner Bros. cartoons get respect, with Museum of History &amp; Industry show |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/warner-bros-cartoons-get-respect-with-museum-of-history-industry-show/ |work=The Seattle Times |date=21 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Lantz]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]]. The species involved are not always discernible, though Woody has been claimed to be based on the [[acorn woodpecker|acorn]] or [[pileated woodpecker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zickefoose |first=Julie |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101665227 |title=Woody The Acorn (Not Pileated) Woodpecker |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the [[barn swallow]] and [[European starling]], they have caused population decreases or [[extinction]] in many other species.

Effects are not all negative; for example, [[wind farm]]s produce [[renewable energy]], helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can [[Bird migration perils|kill many birds]] in collisions.&lt;ref name=RSPBwindfarms/&gt; For example, at the [[Altamont Pass Wind Farm|Altamont Pass]] in California, the [[golden eagle]] has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DRIESSEN: Big Wind tax credit exterminates endangered species |author=Paul Driessen |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/22/big-wind-tax-credit-exterminates-endangered-specie/ |newspaper=[[Washington Times]] |date=22 December 2012 |quote=In an 86-square-mile area blanketed by the Altamont wind facility, no eagles have nested for more than 20 years even though the area is prime habitat, Mr. Wiegand says. Overall, there has been an 80 percent population decline for the golden eagle in Southern California, he notes. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is a [[trade-off]] in the siting of any wind farm.&lt;ref name=RSPBwindfarms&gt;{{cite web |title=Wind Farms |url=https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/our-positions-and-campaigns/positions/windfarms/ |publisher=[[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments and [[conservation biology|conservation]] groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that [[In-situ conservation|preserve]] and [[ecological restoration|restore]] bird habitat, or by establishing [[Ex-situ conservation|captive populations]] for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the [[California condor]] and [[Norfolk parakeet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0030605306000950 | last1=Butchart | first1=S. | last2=Stattersfield | first2=A. | last3=Collar | first3=N. | year=2006 | title=How many bird extinctions have we prevented? | url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/08/butchart_et_al_2006.pdf | journal=Oryx | volume=40 | issue=3| pages=266–279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], founded as the Plumage League in 1889 to protect birds such as the [[egret]] from hunting for their plumes, used in fashion, has grown to have over a million members; it has been followed by similar societies in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=[[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more specialised organisation, the [[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]] founded in 1946, works to conserve waterfowl and their [[wetland]] habitats, with projects around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our projects |url=https://www.wwt.org.uk/conservation/wwt-projects/ |publisher=[[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]] |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
'''''Iki''''' (いき, English: roughly "chic, stylish") is a concept in aesthetics, the basis of which is thought to have formed among urbane commoners ([[chōnin]]) in [[Edo]] in the [[Edo period|Tokugawa period]].&lt;ref name="nussbaum379"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Iki''{{-"}} in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 379|page=379}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iki'' is sometimes misunderstood as simply "[[Cool Japan|anything Japanese]]" overseas, but it is actually a specific aesthetic ideal, distinct from more ethereal notions of transcendence or poverty. As such, [[samurai]], for example, would typically, as a class, be considered devoid of ''iki'' (see ''[[yabo]]''). At the same time, individual warriors are often depicted in contemporary popular imagination as embodying the ''iki'' ideals of a clear, stylish manner and blunt, unwavering directness. The term became widespread in modern intellectual circles through the book ''[[The Structure of Iki]]'' (1930) by [[Kuki Shūzō]].

==Interpretation==
''Iki'', having emerged from the worldly [[Japanese merchant class]], may appear in some ways a more contemporary expression of Japanese aesthetics than concepts such as ''[[wabi-sabi]]''. The term is commonly used in conversation and writing, but is not necessarily exclusive of other categories of beauty.

''Iki'' is an expression of simplicity, sophistication, spontaneity, and originality. It is ephemeral, romantic, straightforward, measured, audacious, smart, and lacking in detrimental self-consciousness.

''Iki'' is not overly refined, pretentious, complicated, showy, slick, coquettish, or, generally, [[Kawaii|cute]]. At the same time, ''iki'' may exhibit any of those traits in a smart, direct, and unabashed manner.

''Iki'' may signify a personal trait, or artificial phenomena exhibiting human will or consciousness. ''Iki'' is not used to describe natural phenomena, but may be expressed in human appreciation of natural beauty, or in the nature of human beings. [[Murakami Haruki]] (b. 1949), who writes in a clear, unflinching style—at turns sentimental, fantastic, and surreal—is described as embodying ''iki''. In contrast, [[Kawabata Yasunari]] (1899-1972) writes in a more poetic vein, with a closer focus on the interior "complex" of his characters, while situations and surroundings exhibit a kind of ''[[wabi-sabi]]''. That said, stylistic differences may tend to distract from a similar emotional subjectivity. Indeed, ''iki'' is strongly tied to stylistic tendencies.

==''Tsū''==
The indefinite ideal of '''tsū''' (通) can be said to reference a highly cultivated but not necessarily solemn sensibility. The ''iki''/''tsu'' sensibility resists being construed within the context of overly specific rules about what could be considered as vulgar or uncouth.&lt;ref&gt;Gallaher, John. ''Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art.'' p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iki'' and ''tsu'' are considered synonymous in some situations, but ''tsu'' exclusively refers to persons, while ''iki'' can also refer to situations/objects. In both ideals, the property of refinement is not academic in nature. ''Tsu'' sometimes involves excessive obsession and cultural (but not academic) pedantry, and in this case, it differs from ''iki'', which will not be obsessive. ''Tsu'' is used, for example, for knowing how to properly appreciate (eat) Japanese cuisines ([[sushi]], [[tempura]], [[soba]] etc.). ''Tsu'' (and some ''iki''-style) can be transferred from person to person in form of "tips." As ''tsu'' is more focused in knowledge, it may be considered superficial from ''iki'' point of view, since ''iki'' cannot be easily attained by learning.

==''Yabo''==
{{main|Yabo}}

''[[Yabo]]'' (野暮) is the antonym of ''iki''. ''Busui'' (無粋), literally "non-''iki''," is synonymous to ''yabo''.

==''Sui''==
In the [[Kamigata]] or [[Kansai]] area, the ideal of ''sui'' is prevalent. ''Sui'' is also represented by the [[kanji]] "粋". The sense of ''sui'' is similar to ''iki'' but not identical, reflecting various regional differences.&lt;ref name="nussbaum379"/&gt; The contexts of their usages are also different.

The '''International Thespian Society''' (ITS) is an honor society for [[high school]] and [[middle school]] theatre students. It is a division of the [[Educational Theatre Association]]. Thespian troupes serve students in grades 9-12; Junior Thespian troupes serve students in grades 6 through 8. A few famous ITS alumni include [[Tom Hanks]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[James Marsters]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/membership/distinguishedthespians|title=Distinguished Thespians - EdTA - Educational Theatre Association|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festivals are held annually at the district, state and national levels. Each June the [[International Thespian Festival]] is held at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]. Membership currently stands at approximately 100,000 student members across 4,700 schools. The one millionth Thespian was inducted in 1976 and the two millionth Thespian was inducted in 2009. As of 2017, there have been over 2.3 million Thespians inducted.

== History ==
The International Thespian Society was founded in 1929 in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]]. Originally named National Thespians, the society was founded by Dr. Paul Opp, Earnest Bavely and Harry Leaper. National Thespians was an honorary organization for high school theater students who earned membership through participation in their schools' theatre programs. The organization consisted of troupes, each linked to a school. The first troupe was formed by Dr. Earl Blank at Natrona County High School in Casper, Wyoming.

At the end of the 1928-1929 school year there were 71 troupes across 26 states. In October, 1929, the first issue of The High School Thespian, "official organ of National Thespians" was published. The National Thespian headquarters was moved to Cincinnati during the year 1935. That same year, the society was renamed The National Thespian Dramatic Honor Society. The society held its first National High School Drama Conference and Play Production Festival in 1941 at Indiana University, which later became a bi-annual event. The ''High School Thespian'' became ''Dramatics'' in 1944.

In October 1945, The National Thespian Dramatic Honor Society was again renamed the National Thespian Society. As the Thespian Society reached its 25th anniversary in 1954, 1,432 Thespian troupes existed across forty-eight states and the then-territories of Alaska, Hawaii, and the Canal Zone, as well as Canada and Japan. In 1969 the organization's name was changed to the title it still holds today: The International Thespian Society. June 1982 marked a name change for the National High School Drama Conference and Play Production Festival, turning it into the Thespian Festival, as it is still called today. The Thespian Festival also began an annual schedule for the first time.

The Society offered its first set of summertime retreats for high school theatre directors in 1986, an activity that would eventually grow into a professional association called the Theatre Education Association. In 1989 the ITS board established the Educational Theatre Association (EdTA), meant to oversee both the Thespian Society and the Theatre Education Association, and launched ''Teaching Theatre,'' a quarterly journal for theatre educators. The Theatre Education Association was eventually absorbed completely into the EdTA and thus its title is no longer used.

1990 marks the birth of the Junior Thespians branch of ITS, extending the reach of the society to middle school theatre students. The EdTA helped to write the theatre section of the National Standards for Arts Education, the first set of guidelines for the arts education field, in 1994. By 2012, International Thespian Society had formed a strong bond with the charity organization [[Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS]] and raised more than $1 million for their benefit. 2015 marked the EdTA's launch of [https://www.schooltheatre.org/programs/jumpstarttheatre JumpStart Theatre], which brings sustainable musical theatre programs to underserved middle schools where there currently are none, and the creation of an ITS branch in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/about/history|title=History - EdTA - Educational Theatre Association|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thespian Chapters ==
Chapters are created in order to support the mission of the International Thespian Society. They are led by a chapter director who is supported and assisted by a chapter board. As of 2017, there are active chapters in the following states, regions, and countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/membership/chapters|title=Chapters - EdTA - Educational Theatre Association|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, California, Hawaii, the Western Pacific Islands, and China.

== Thespian Induction and Promotion ==
The International Thespian Society allows for the induction of high school and middle school students attending ITS affiliated schools, based on the quality and quantity of work in all realms of theatre. Points can be earned from participation in productions (either on stage or backstage), Thespian Festivals, seeing other theatre's productions, and holding an officer position in a Thespian troupe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/internationalthespiansociety/troupedirectors/thespianpointsystem|title=Official Thespian point system - International Thespian Society|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Induction ceremonies vary from troupe to troupe, but most are run by the troupe's officers and director. They include, at the very least, a brief summation of the Society's history, followed by a listing of the names and achievements of each new inductee, and then a reciting of the Society's pledge by all new and existing members. The pledge is as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''I promise to uphold the aims and ideals of the International Thespian Society. I am a student of theatre and excellence is my ideal. I promise to perform my part as well as I can; to accept praise and criticism with grace; to cooperate with my fellow thespians and work for the good of the troupe; and to share my love of theatre."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/internationalthespiansociety/troupedirectors/troupehandbook#5c|title=Thespian troupe handbook - International Thespian Society|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After induction, members can continue to earn points in order to move up through the International Thespian Society ranking system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Student Leadership==
At the high school level there are various offices possible, including, but not limited to, President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, and Historian. There are also state and international student leaders elected annually by their respective student bodies. The International Thespian Officers are student members elected to represent the student membership. They suggest policy and service changes to the Educational Theatre Association Board, and take an active role in training, chapter conferences, and the annual International Thespian Festival. There are also State Thespian Officers, elected to manage such events as State Thespian Festivals and local Junior Thespian Festivals.

Matejko spent most of his life in [[Kraków]]. His teachers at the [[Kraków Academy of Fine Arts]] included [[Wojciech Korneli Stattler]] and [[Władysław Łuszczkiewicz]]. Later, he became a director at this institution, which eventually was renamed the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts. A number of his students became prominent painters themselves, including [[Maurycy Gottlieb]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Józef Mehoffer]] and [[Stanisław Wyspiański]].{{CN|date=October 2017}}

==Biography==

===Youth===

Matejko was born on 24 June 1838, in the [[Free City of Kraków]].&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; His father, [[Franciszek Ksawery Matejko]] ({{lang-cs|František Xaver Matějka}}) (born 1789 or 13 January 1793, died 26 October 1860), a Czech from the village of [[Roudnice]], was a graduate of the [[Hradec Králové]] school who later became a tutor and [[music teacher]].&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; He first worked for the Wodzicki family in Kościelniki, Poland, then moved to [[Kraków]], where he married the half-German, half-Polish Joanna Karolina Rossberg (Rozberg).&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; Jan was the ninth child of eleven children.&lt;ref name="szypowska12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in a [[kamienica (architecture)|kamienica]] building on [[Floriańska Street]].&lt;ref name="szypowska11"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his mother in 1845, Jan and his siblings were cared for by his maternal aunt, Anna Zamojska.&lt;ref name="szypowska12"/&gt;

[[File:Rodzeństwo Matejki.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Matejko's father, Franciszek, and three of his children. An early work of Matejko from 1853]]
At a young age he witnessed the [[Kraków Uprising|Kraków revolution]] of 1846 and the 1848 [[siege of Kraków]] by the Austrians, the two events which ended the existence of the [[Free City of Kraków]].&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; His two older brothers served in these battles, under General [[Józef Bem]]; one died and the other was forced into exile.&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; Matejko attended [[Bartłomiej Nowodworski High School|St. Ann's High School]], but he dropped out in 1851 because of poor grades.&lt;ref name="szypowska182223"/&gt; From his earliest days Matejko showed artistic talent, but had great difficulty with other academic areas.&lt;ref name="szypowska182223"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|pages=18, 22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never mastered a foreign language.&lt;ref name="szypowska18"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- and did not do well even with his native [[Polish language|Polish]]. As a result, the public appearances he was obliged to make all his life must have been difficult for him. {{cn}} --&gt; Despite that, and because of his exceptional skill, he studied at the [[School of Fine Arts in Kraków]] from 1852 to 1858.&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; His teachers included [[Wojciech Korneli Stattler]] and [[Władysław Łuszczkiewicz]].&lt;ref name="szypowska25"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He selected [[historical painting]] as his specialization, and finished his first major work, ''Tsars Shuyski before Zygmunt III'' (''Carowie Szujscy przed Zygmuntem III''), in 1853 (he would return to this topic in a year before his death, in 1892&lt;ref name="MatejkoMalinowski1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jan Matejko|author2=Jerzy Malinowski|author3=Krystyna Sroczyńska|author4=Jurij Birjułow|title=Matejko: Album|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8suAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Arkady|language=Polish|quote=Matejko malował nadto dwukrotnie sceny hołdu carów Szujskich przed Zygmuntem III w 1853 i 1892 roku."}} [Google Books does not display page number for this book]&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="szypowska25"/&gt;&lt;ref name=psb185/&gt; During this time, he began exhibiting historical paintings at the [[Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts]] (starting with 1855).&lt;ref name=psb185&gt;Bochnak (1975), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; His seminal project for his graduation in 1858 was ''[[Sigismund I the Old]] ennobles the professors of the [[Jagiellonian University]]'' (''Zygmunt I nadaje szlachectwo profesorom Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego'').&lt;ref name="szypowska39"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation,&lt;ref name="szypowska39"/&gt; Matejko received a scholarship in 1859 to study with [[Hermann Anschütz]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]].&lt;ref name=psb185/&gt; The following year he received a scholarship to study at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]] as well, but after a few days and a major quarrel with [[Christian Ruben]], Matejko returned to Kraków.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt; and opened a studio at his family home in Floriańska Street.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt; It would however be years before he would gain commercial success; for a time he was the proverbial "starving artist", who celebrated when he sold a canvas (the ''Tsars Shuyski...'') for five [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]].&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt;

In 1860 Matejko published an illustrated album, ''[[Clothing in Poland (Matejko)|Clothing in Poland]]'' (''Ubiory w Polsce''), a project reflecting his intense interest in historical records of all kinds and his desire to promote such interest among Polish people, to intensify their patriotism.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt; His financial situation improved when he sold two paintings, ''Death of Wapowski during the crowning of Henry Valois'' (''Zabicie Wapowskiego w czasie koronacji Henryka Walezego'', 1861) and ''Jan Kochanowski mourning his daughter Urszulka'' (''Jan Kochanowski nad zwłokami Urszulki'', 1862), which settled his debts.&lt;ref name="szypowska78"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1862 he finished a painting, ''[[Stańczyk (painting)|Stańczyk]]''. Initially received without much applause, in time this would become known as one of Matejko's most famous masterpieces.&lt;ref name="szypowska85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marks a visible transition in Matejko's art style, from simply illustrating history to creating a philosophical and moral commentary of it.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt;

[[File:Matejko-Dzieci.jpg|thumbnail|Portrait of the artist's four children. A late work of Matejko from 1879]]
During the [[January Uprising]] of 1863, in which he did not participate because of poor health, Matejko gave financial support, donating most of his savings to the cause, and personally [[Gunrunning|transported arms]] to the insurgents' camp.&lt;ref name=psb186&gt;Bochnak (1975), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Skarga's Sermon]]'' (''Kazanie Skargi''), finished in May 1864, was displayed in the gallery of the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts, which gained him much publicity.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt; On 5 November that year, in recognition for his contributions to recreating historical themes, he became a member of the [[Kraków Scientific Society]] (''Towarzystwo Naukowe Krakowskie'').&lt;ref name="Słoczyński2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henryk Marek Słoczyński|title=Matejko|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUVMAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Wydawn. Dolnośląskie|isbn=978-83-7023-820-9|page=81|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, on 21 November, he married [[Teodora Matejko|Teodora Giebultowska]], with whom he would have five children: Beata, [[Helena Unierzyska|Helena]], Tadeusz, Jerzy and Regina.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt;  Helena, his daughter, also an artist, helped victims in [[World War I]] and was awarded the [[Cross of Independence]] by [[president]] [[Stanisław Wojciechowski]].&lt;ref name="Helena z Matejków Unierzyska"/&gt;

At that time Matejko started to gain international recognition. In 1865, Matejko's painting ''Skarga's Sermon'' was awarded a gold medal at the yearly Paris salon; soon afterwards Count {{ILL|Maurycy Potocki|pl}} bought it for 10,000 guldens.&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; In 1867, his painting ''[[Rejtan (painting)|Rejtan]]'' was awarded a gold medal at the [[International Exposition (1867)|World Exhibition]] in Paris and acquired by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] for 50,000 franks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Projekt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDAtAQAAIAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Prasa-Książka-Ruch|page=cxliii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Matejko|title=Matejko: obrazy olejne : katalog|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMsuAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Arkady|isbn=978-83-213-3652-7|page=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next major painting was the ''[[Union of Lublin (painting)|Union of Lublin]]'' (''Unia Lubelska''), created in the years 1867-1869.

In 1872 during an exhibition in [[Prague]] he was offered a directorship of the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Prague]], and soon afterwards, a similar position at Kraków's School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name=psb187/&gt; He accepted the Kraków offer, and was for many years the principal ([[Rector (academia)|rector]]) of the Academy of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name=psb187/&gt; In 1874 he finished ''[[Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta]]'' (''The Hanging of the Sigismund bell'').&lt;ref name=WM/&gt; In 1878 he finished another masterpiece, ''[[Battle of Grunwald (painting)|Battle of Grunwald]]''.&lt;ref name=psb188&gt;Bochnak (1975), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; That year he received an "honorary grand gold" medal in Paris, and the city council of Kraków presented him with a ceremonial [[scepter]], a symbol of his "royal status in fine arts".&lt;ref name=psb188/&gt; In 1879 he finished ''[[Rok 1863 - Polonia]]'' (Year 1863 - Polonia), his take on the [[January Uprising]] of that time.

Years 1880-1882 marked his work on another large painting, ''[[Prussian Homage (painting)|Prussian Tribute]]'' (''Hołd Pruski'').&lt;ref name=psb188/&gt; Matejko gifted this painting to "the Polish nation", and it earned him [[honorary citizenship]] of Kraków; one of the squares in the city was also named [[Matejko Square]].&lt;ref name=psb188/&gt; In 1883 he finished ''[[Sobieski at Vienna]]'' (''Jan Sobieski pod Wiedniem'').&lt;ref name=psb185/&gt;&lt;ref name=psb188/&gt; ''Sobieski...'' was gifted to [[Pope Leo XIII]] as a "gift of the Polish nation" and Matejko, who was one of the members of the group delivering it, received a Knight Commander with Star [[Order of Pius IX]].&lt;ref name=psb189&gt;Bochnak (1975), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is exhibited in the Sobieski Room of the [[Vatican Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/monumenti/musei-vaticani/sala-sobieski-e-dell-immacolata.paginate.1.html|title=The Immaculate Conception and Sobieski Rooms|author=|date=|website=www.vaticanstate.va|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;At that time he also became a vocal spokesman in a number of political issues, publishing letters on issues such as [[Polish-Russian relations]].&lt;ref name=psb189/&gt; Another arena he was very engaged in were efforts to protect and reconstruct various historical monuments in the city of Kraków.&lt;ref name=psb190/&gt; In 1886, he finished a painting about French rather than about Polish history: ''[[Virgin of Orléans]]'', portraying [[Joan of Arc]].&lt;ref name=psb189/&gt;&lt;ref name="RadvanAsmus2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roxana Radvan|author2=John F.

==Significance, style and themes==

[[File:GrobowiecJanaMatejki-CmentarzRakowicki-POL, Kraków.jpg|thumb|Matejko's tomb]]He is counted among the most famous [[Polish painters]],&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MioPa"/&gt; described as "Poland's greatest historical painter"&lt;ref name="Reddaway1971"/&gt; and "a cult figure to the nation at large... [already] by the time of his death.".&lt;ref name=WM/&gt; His style was praised for being "colourful, detailed and imaginative".&lt;ref name=WM/&gt; He succeeded in propagating Polish history, and reminding the world about Poland, while his country remained partitioned and without any independent political representation.&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; His works, disseminated in thousands of reproductions, have become almost standard illustrations of many key events in [[Polish history]].&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MioPa"/&gt; His 1860 illustrated album ''Ubiory w Polsce'' (Clothing in Poland) is seen as a valuable historical reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.krakow.pl/Wystawa.1106.0.html?&amp;cHash=1c6a6d9bec42ba80c47995258e045fb5&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1105&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=5274 |title=WYSTAWA: Wielka rekwizytornia artysty.

Many of his works are dedicated to famous events in Polish history. Matejko was focusing on major themes in Polish history and using historical sources to paint events in minute historical detail.&lt;ref name="Chilvers2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Chilvers|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WYaRX58a0_IC&amp;pg=PA452|date=10 June 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-860476-1|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His earliest paintings are simple historical paintings with no hidden messages.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt; The later ones, starting with the painting ''[[Stańczyk]]'' (1862), are intended to inspire the viewers with a patriotic message.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norman1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geraldine Norman|title=Nineteenth-century Painters and Painting: A Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_AIX2wVuj0C&amp;pg=PA181|date=1 January 1977|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03328-3|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stańczyk'' focuses on the court jester, portrayed as a symbol of country's conscience, sitting in a chair in the background of a party - a sole figure reflecting on the war, ignored by the joyful crowd.&lt;ref name=WM&gt;Wanda Małaszewska. "Matejko, Jan." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 28 May 2014, http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T055919&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to history paintings Matejko made also numerous portraits.&lt;ref name=psb189/&gt; Among others: portraits of Jagiellonian University rectors [[Józef Szujski]] and [[Stanisław Tarnowski]], and numerous portraits of family and friends, including ''Wife in the wedding dress'' ("Żona w sukni ślubnej") (1865, destroyed by his wife during a quarrel and recreated in 1879) and a self-portrait (1892).&lt;ref name=psb189/&gt; Altogether Matejko authored 320 [[oil paintings]] and several thousands [[drawings]] and [[watercolors]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} He also designed the [[polychrome]] in [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków]] (1889–1891).&lt;ref name="Serafińska1958"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanisława Serafińska|title=Jan Matejko: wspomnienia rodzinne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUhsYBacEW8C|year=1958|publisher=Wydawn.

His paintings are on display in numerous Polish museums; including the [[National Museum in Warsaw]], [[National Museum in Kraków]], [[National Museum in Poznań]] and [[National Museum in Wrocław]].&lt;ref name=psb190/&gt; National Museum in Kraków has a branch dedicated to Matejko - [[House of Jan Matejko]] (''Dom Jana Matejki'') located in his former studio and family house at Floriańska Street, opened in 1898.&lt;ref name=psb190/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.krakow.pl/O-oddziale.67.0.html |title=O oddziale |publisher=Muzeum.krakow.pl |accessdate=29 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004222/http://www.muzeum.krakow.pl/O-oddziale.67.0.html |archivedate=24 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another museum dedicated to Matejko, [[Dworek Jana Matejki w Krzesławicach|Dworek Jana Matejki]], opened in [[Krzesławice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Krzesławice]] (where Matejo acquired a [[dworek (house)|manor]]&lt;ref name=psb188/&gt;) in 1865.&lt;ref name=psb191&gt;Bochnak (1975), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 80 painters have been Matejko's students at some point, many influenced during his tenure as the director of the Kraków School of Fine Arts, and are referred to as members of "Matejko School".&lt;ref name=WM/&gt;&lt;ref name=cultureplart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/en/event/artists-from-the-school-of-jan-matejko |title="Artists from the School of Jan Matejko" &amp;#124; Event |publisher=Culture.pl |accessdate=29 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529052601/http://culture.pl/en/event/artists-from-the-school-of-jan-matejko |archivedate=29 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent among them are [[Maurycy Gottlieb]],&lt;ref name=cultureplart/&gt; [[E.M.

'''Jerry Saltz''' (born February 19, 1951) is an American [[art critic]]. Since 2006, he has been senior art critic and columnist for ''[[New York magazine|New York]]'' magazine. Formerly the senior art critic for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', he received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]] in 2018 and was nominated for the award in 2001 and 2006. He has also contributed to ''[[Art in America]], [[Flash Art|Flash Art International]], [[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]], and [[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'', among other art publications.&lt;ref&gt;Parmiggiani, Sandro (February 2011). "[http://www.ilgiornaledellarte.com/articoli/2011/2/106529.html Il 90% dell’arte è pessima, il 9% buona, l’1% favolosa (e forse resterà)]" (review of Italian edition of ''Seeing Out Loud''; in Italian). ''Il Giornale dell'arte''. No. 306. ilgiornaledellarte.com. Retrieved 2018-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Saltz served as a visiting critic at [[The School of Visual Arts]], [[Columbia University]], [[Yale University]], and [[The School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] and the New York Studio Residency Program, and was the sole advisor for the 1995 [[Whitney Museum|Whitney Biennial]].

==Early life==
Saltz was born in Chicago and attended art school for a few years before dropping out. Before moving to New York at 26, he founded an artist-run gallery in Chicago.&lt;ref name=br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2008/09/art/jerry-saltz-in-conversation-with-irving-sandler |title=Jerry Saltz with Irving Sandler |last=Sandler |first=Irving |date=12 September 2012 |website=brooklynrail.org |publisher=Brooklyn Rail|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art criticism==
In an article in ''[[Artnet]]'' magazine, Saltz codified his outlook: "All great contemporary artists, schooled or not, are essentially self-taught and are de-skilling like crazy. I don't look for skill in art...Skill has nothing to do with technical proficiency... I'm interested in people who rethink skill, who redefine or reimagine it: an engineer, say, who builds rockets from rocks."&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry, [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/saltz/saltz12-20-05.asp "Seeing Out Loud"], ''www.artnet.com'', December 20, 2005. Retrieved 2015-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Saltz said, "I'm looking for what the artist is trying to say and what he or she is actually saying, what the work reveals about society and the timeless conditions of being alive".&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Sarah. Seven Days in the Art World. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company. 2008. (174–75)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VOLVO.jpg|thumbnail|left|150px|Saltz was a long distance truck driver before becoming an art critic.&lt;ref&gt;Parsi, Novid. [http://chicago.timeout.com/articles/tv/85918/jerry-saltz-interview "Jerry Saltz: Interview"]. Time Out: Chicago. May 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]In ''Seeing Out Loud'', his collection of ''Village Voice'' columns published in 2003, he said he considers himself the kind of critic that [[Peter Plagens]] calls a "goalie," someone who says "It's going to have to be pretty good to get by me."&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry. Seeing Out Loud: the Village Voice Art Columns Fall 1998 – Winter 2003. The Figures. 2003 (20–21).&lt;/ref&gt;
Saltz has cited Manny Farber's "termite art" and [[Joan Didion]]'s "Babylon" as well as other wide-ranging systemic metaphors for the [[art world]]. Although he's defended the art market, he's also called out faddy market behavior and the fetish for youth, saying "the art world eats its young."&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry. [http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/features/saltz/saltz9-13-00.asp "Babylon Calling"]. ''Artnet Magazine''. September 13, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On a [[College Art Association]] panel in February 2007, Saltz commented, "We live in a Wikipedia art world. Twenty years ago, there were only four to five encyclopedias—and I tried to get into them. Now, all writing is in the Wikipedia. Some entries are bogus, some are the best. We live in an open [[art world]]."

His humor, irreverence, [[self-deprecation]] and volubility have led some to call him the [[Rodney Dangerfield]] of the art world.&lt;ref name=HAH/&gt; He has expressed doubt about art critics' influence as purveyors of taste, saying they have little effect on the success of an artist's career. Nonetheless, [[ArtReview]] called him the 73rd most powerful person in the art world in their 2009 Power 100 list.&lt;ref name=HAH&gt;Harrison, Helen A. [http://sagharboronline.com/artists-dont-get-no-respect/ "Artists Don't Get No Respect"]. Sag Harbor Express. August 7, 2010. Retrieved 2015-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogue with readers through Facebook===
Saltz uses Facebook more actively than many other art critics, posting daily questions and diatribes to his audience of friends, which numbered 89,155 in September 2018. He has stated that he wants to demystify the art critic to artists and a general art audience. His posts are less polished and restrained than his writing for ''New York Magazine'' and ''[[vulture.com]]'', and he has shared personal matters including family tragedies, career bumps and his diet. He told the ''[[New York Observer]]'', "It's exciting to be in this room with 5,000 people. It's like the Cedar Bar for me, or [[Max's Kansas City]]."&lt;ref&gt;Neyfakh, Leon. [http://www.observer.com/2010/media/many-friends-jerry-saltz "The Many Friends of Jerry Saltz"]. New York Observer. February 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has used his page to defend the use of [[irony]] in art, arguing against adherents of "the New Seriousness", whom he calls the "Purity Police".&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Sharon L. [http://www.brooklynrail.org/2009/03/artseen/the-art-world-on-facebook-a-primer "The Art World on Facebook:A Primer"]. Brooklyn Rail. March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 2010, artist [[Jennifer Dalton]] exhibited an artwork called "What Are We Not Shutting Up About?" at the FLAG Foundation in New York that statistically analyzed five months of Facebook conversations between Saltz and his online friends.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ken. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/arts/design/13galleries-002.html "Art in Review: Jennifer Dalton – Making Sense"]. ''New York Times''. August 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Artinfo]], Dalton said of the work, “I became interested in Jerry Saltz's Facebook page as an amazing site of written dialogue and as a place where culture is being created on the spot. I think my piece, and Jerry Saltz's Facebook page itself, tells us that a lot of people in the art world crave dialogue and community, and when a space is welcoming enough people really flock to it.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/artintheair/2010/07/07/jennifer-dalton-makes-art-from-jerry-saltzs-facebook/ "Jennifer Dalton Makes Art From Jerry Saltz's Facebook Page"]. Artinfo. July 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Saltz asked his Facebook friends about art studio (or office) door signs—and then later sought someone to compile the replies. The result was a book featuring Saltz and dozens of his page's followers' quotes: ''JERRY SALTZ ART CRITIC's Fans, Friends, &amp; The Tribes Suggested ART STUDIO DOOR SIGNS of Real Life or Fantasy'' ({{ISBN|978-0-9798261-0-8}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blurb.com/books/1445427 "Art studio door signs book online preview portal"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Saltz was briefly suspended from Facebook after the site received complaints from users about provocative posts.&lt;ref name=nyt.fb&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=4 March 2015 |title=Jerry Saltz, New York Magazine Art Critic, Suspended From Facebook |url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/jerry-saltz-new-york-magazine-art-critic-suspended-from-facebook/ |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York, NY |access-date=5 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/qa/jerry-saltz-on-facebook-and-medieval-porn-52674|title=Jerry Saltz on His (Brief) Exile From Facebook, and the Virtues of Medieval Torture Porn|website=Artspace|language=en|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art critic as television personality===
Saltz served as a judge in the [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] television series ''[[Work of Art: The Next Great Artist]]'' which premiered on June 9, 2010.

==Personal life==
Saltz lives in New York City with his wife [[Roberta Smith]], co-chief art critic for the ''[[New York Times]]''. They were married in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/opinion/kenny-schachter-jerry-saltz-777836|title=Jerry Saltz and the Future of the Critic-Artist {{!}} artnet News|date=2016-12-09|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is critical of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mobile.twitter.com/jerrysaltz/status/1047919526657085441]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Museo Del Oro, Bogota (24546916613).jpg|thumb|right|235px|An example of the interaction of the art of nature and the famous goldworking of the Muisca is the precious '''golden sea snail''' in the collection of the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]] in Bogotá]]
[[File:Sabana de Bogota.png|thumb|235px|right|The flat '''Bogotá savanna''', the southern territory of the [[Muisca Confederation]], not only provided fertile agricultural lands, but also many different clays for the production of ceramics, rock shelters where petroglyphs and petrographs were made and a central strategic access to the regions around it. This made trade with various neighbouring indigenous groups possible by which the Muisca obtained feathers, cotton, pigments and the vast amounts of gold and copper used for their fine ''tunjos'', jewelry, and other golden and ''[[tumbaga]]'' artefacts]]
This article describes the '''art''' produced by the '''Muisca'''. The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] established one of the four grand civilisations of the [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Americas on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] in present-day central [[Colombia]]. Their various forms of art have been described in detail and include pottery, textiles, body art, hieroglyphs and rock art. While their architecture was modest compared to the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya civilisations]], the Muisca are best known for their skilled goldworking. The [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]] in the Colombian capital [[Bogotá]] houses the biggest collection of golden objects in the world, from various Colombian cultures including the Muisca.

The first art in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Colombian [[Andes]] goes back several millennia. Although this predates the Muisca civilisation, whose onset is commonly set at 800 AD, nevertheless, some of these styles persevered through the ages.

During the [[Andean preceramic|preceramic]] era, the people of the highlands produced petrographs and petroglyphs representing their [[Muisca religion|deities]], the abundant [[List of flora and fauna named after the Muisca|flora and fauna]] of the area, abstract motives and anthropomorphic or anthropo-zoomorphic elements. The self-sufficient sedentary [[Muisca agriculture|agricultural]] society developed into a culture based on ceramics and the extraction of [[Nemocón|salt]] in the [[Herrera Period]], usually defined as 800 BC to 800 AD. During this time, the oldest existing form of constructed art was erected; the [[archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical]] site called ''[[El Infiernito]]'' ("The Little Hell") by the catholic Spanish [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]]. The Herrera Period also marked the widespread use of pottery and textiles and the start of what would become the main motive for the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquest]]; the skilled fine goldworking. The golden age of Muisca metallurgy is represented in the [[Muisca raft]], considered the masterpiece of this technology and depicts the initiation ritual of the new ''[[zipa]]'' of [[Bacatá]], the southern part of the [[Muisca Confederation]]. This ceremony, performed by ''xeques'' (priests) and ''caciques'' wearing feathered golden crowns and accompanied by [[Muisca music|music and dance]], took place on a raft in [[Lake Guatavita]], in the northern part of the flat [[Bogotá savanna]]. Accounts of such ceremonies created the [[Muisca mythology|legend]] of ''[[El Dorado]]'' among the Spanish, leading them on a decades-long quest for this mythical place.

The rich art elaborated by the Muisca has inspired modern artists and designers in their creativity. Muisca motives are represented as murals, in clothing and as objects found all over the former Muisca territories as well as in animated clips and video games. The art of the indigenous inhabitants of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense is well studied by many different [[List of Muisca scholars|researchers]] who published their work right from the beginning of colonial times. The conquistador who made first contact with the Muisca, [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], wrote in his memoires about a skilled and well-organised civilisation of traders and farmers. [[Friar]] [[Pedro Simón]] described the relation between art and the [[Muisca religion|religion]] and later contributions in the analysis of the various artforms have been made by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Joaquín Acosta]] and [[Liborio Zerda]] in the 19th century, [[Miguel Triana]], [[Eliécer Silva Celis]] and [[Sylvia M. Broadbent]] in the 20th century and modern research is dominated by the work of [[Carl Henrik Langebaek|Carl Henrik Langebaek Rueda]], [[Javier Ocampo López]] and many others.

== Background ==
[[File:Rocas de Suesca 1.JPG|thumb|right|235px|The rock shelters of '''Suesca''' at the northern edge of the Bogotá savanna were inhabited early in history and characterised by artistic expressions in the form of rock art and a collection of 150 mummies, found in the early colonial period]]
[[File:Golden Fishing Hooks.jpg|thumb|right|235px|The Muisca were fishermen and caught the fish of the many lakes and rivers of the Altiplano using '''golden hooks''']]
The central highlands of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Colombian [[Andes]], called [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]], was inhabited by indigenous groups from 12,500 BP, as evidenced from archaeological finds at rock shelter [[El Abra]], presently part of [[Zipaquirá]]. The first human occupation consisted of hunter-gatherers who foraged in the valleys and mountains of the Andean high plateau. Settlement in the early millennia of this [[Andean preceramic]] age was mainly restricted to caves and rock shelters, such as [[Tequendama]] in present-day [[Soacha]], [[Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park|Piedras del Tunjo]] in [[Facatativá]] and [[Nemocón#Checua|Checua]] that currently is part of the municipality [[Nemocón]]. Around 3000 BC, the inhabitants of the Andean plains started to live in open space areas and constructed primitive circular houses where they elaborated the [[stone tool]]s used for hunting, fishing, [[Muisca cuisine|food preparation]] and primitive art, mostly [[rock art]]. The [[type locality (archaeology)|type site]] for this transition is the [[List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites|archaeological site]] [[Aguazuque]], in the northwest of Soacha, close to [[Bogotá]].

Abundant evidence for the domestication of [[guinea pig]]s has been found at Tequendama and Aguazuque where the small rodents formed part of the diet of the people, who consumed mainly [[white-tailed deer]], hunted on the plains surrounding the various lakes and rivers. The diet was greatly expanded when early [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]] was introduced, possibly influenced by migrations from the south; present-day [[Peru]]. The main cultivated product was [[maize]] in various forms and colours, while [[tubers]] formed a significant other part of the food source. The fertile soils of especially the [[Bogotá savanna]] proved advantageous for the development of this agriculture, still evidenced today by the widespread farmfields outside the Colombian capital.

== Pre-Muisca art ==
[[File:Monumento el Infiernito.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The phallic monoliths of archaeoastronomical observatory '''''El Infiernito''''' are the oldest remaining constructed art on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]
{{see also||El Abra|Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park|Tequendama|Herrera Period|El Infiernito}}
The first forms of art recognised on the Altiplano are [[petrograph]]s and [[petroglyph]]s in various locations on the Altiplano, mainly at the rock shelters of the Bogotá savanna. El Abra, Piedras del Tunjo and Tequendama are among the oldest sites where rock art has been discovered.&lt;ref name=ICANH&gt;{{es}} [http://www.icanh.gov.co/?idcategoria=5157 Siteos arqueológicos] - [[ICANH]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Herrera Period, commonly defined from 800 BC to 800 AD, was the age of the first ceramics. The oldest Herrera pottery has been discovered in [[Cachipay, Cundinamarca|Tocarema]] and dates to 800 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Argüello García, 2015, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Herrera art is also represented by the [[archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical site]], called ''[[El Infiernito]]'' by the Spanish. On a field outside [[Villa de Leyva]], [[menhir]]s in the shape of aligned phalluses were erected. This site, the oldest remaining of constructed art, dated at 500 BC, formed an important place for [[Muisca religion|religious]] rituals and festivities where great quantities of the alcoholic drink [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]] was consumed. The evidence for festivities at this site are from a later date, already in the Muisca Period.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 2005, p.290&lt;/ref&gt;

The goldworking in the northern parts of South America, mainly in present-day Colombia, is thought to originate from regions more to the south; the north of Peru and Ecuador, during a large timespan from 1600 to 1000 BC. The development of different goldworking cultures in southern Colombia happened around 500 BC.&lt;ref name=Lleras_p183&gt;Lleras et al., 2009, p.183&lt;/ref&gt; The late Herrera Period showed the first evidences of goldworking on the Altiplano. Golden artefacts have been found in [[Tunja]] and [[Cómbita]] in Boyacá and Guatavita in Cundinamarca with estimated ages ranging from 250 to 400 AD.&lt;ref name=Lleras_p179&gt;Lleras et al., 2009, p.179&lt;/ref&gt;

== Muisca art ==
[[File:Colombia, muisca, tre serpentelli, X-XVI sec, oro fuso.JPG|thumb|right|300px|'''Serpentiform golden figures''' were common in the Muisca art]]
The Muisca period is commonly set commencing from 800 AD and lasting until the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]] in 1537, although regional variations of the start dates are noted. The Early Muisca Period, roughly defined from 800 to 1000 AD, showed an increase in long-distance trade with the Caribbean coastal indigenous populations, mummification and the introduction of goldworking.&lt;ref name=Langebaek2003_p263&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 2003, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; The transition between Early Muisca and Late Muisca is defined by a more complex society, interregional trade of pottery, population growth and settlements of larger sizes closer to the [[Muisca agriculture|agricultural lands]]. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived on the Altiplano, they described a concentration of settlements on the flatlands of the Bogotá savanna.&lt;ref name=Langebaek2003_p263/&gt;

===Zoomorphic figurines===
As the [[Tairona]] of the Colombian Caribbean coast, the Muisca made the zoomorphic figurines based on the [[List of flora and fauna named after the Muisca|fauna]] with their habitat of the area. Main animals used for their figures were the frog and serpents. The serpents were made in zig-zag shapes with eyes on top of the head. Many serpentiform objects have the typical forked tongue of the snake represented as well as the fawns clearly added. Some of the snakes have beards, moustaches or even a human head.&lt;ref name=Legast_p28&gt;Legast, 2000, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Muisca scholars|Researcher]] [[Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff]] theorised in his book ''Orfebrería y chamanismo'' in 1988 that the basis for the beards and moustaches may have been the abundant fish present on the Altiplano and essential part of the [[Muisca cuisine|diet]] of the Muisca and their ancestors, as evidenced in [[Aguazuque]]; ''[[Eremophilus mutisii]]''.&lt;ref name=Legast_p29&gt;Legast, 2000, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García, 2012, p.133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aguazuque_p80&gt;Correal Urrego, 1990, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

Frogs (''iesua'', meaning "food from the Sun" in [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]]) and toads were important animals in the concept of nature and the relation with the spiritual world for the Muisca.&lt;ref name=Bohorquez_p170&gt;Bohórquez Caldera, 2008, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; They represented the start of the rainy season, which is illustrated in the use in the [[Muisca calendar]]; the symbols for the first (''ata''), ninth (''aca'') and holy twentieth (''gueta'') month of the years are derived from toads. The common year of the complex lunisolar calendar consisted of twenty months.&lt;ref name=Izquierdo_p30&gt;Izquierdo Peña, 2009, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; The frogs are shown in many different settings and forms of art; painted on ceramics, in the hieroglyphs of the rock art and as figurines. In many cases they are shown in combination with everyday activities and were used to represent humans, mostly [[Women in Muisca society|women]].&lt;ref name=Bohorquez_p171&gt;Bohórquez Caldera, 2008, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goldworking ===
[[File:Muisca Gold and Wax Working Tools - Museo del Oro - Bogotá.jpg|right|thumb|300px|'''Gold- and waxworking tools''' of the Muisca, Museo del Oro, Bogotá]]
The Muisca were famous for their goldworking. Although in the [[Muisca Confederation]] gold deposits were not abundant, the people obtained a lot of gold through [[Muisca economy#Trade|trading]], mainly in [[Barrancabermeja|La Tora]] (called Barrancabermeja today) and other locations at the [[Magdalena River]].&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p216&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[carbon dating|radiocarbon]] dates of goldworking of the Muisca are derived from carbon traces in the cores of golden noserings and provided ages of between 600 and 800 AD. The oldest evidences for Muisca goldworking were found in [[Guatavita]], [[Fusagasugá]] and [[El Peñón, Cundinamarca|El Peñon]], all in present-day Cundinamarca. The goldwork bears similarity but is not identical to the metallurgy of the [[Quimbaya culture|Quimbaya]] of the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] and [[Magdalena River|Magdalena Valleys]].&lt;ref name=Langebaek2003_p264&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 2003, p.264&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the stylistic variability and metallurgic technology analysed in Muisca goldworking, three processes have been concluded;

*the Herrera people elaborated golden and copper objects such as crowns, and other offering figures from [[alluvial]] resources using the first molds and hammers and possibly matrixes.
*Around 400 AD, the metallurgy became more advanced, using the ''[[tumbaga]]'' alloy and an increase in the production of offering figures is noted.
*The last phase of skilled goldworking is characterised by more detailed goldworking using gold from [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] with other indigenous groups.&lt;ref name=Lleras_p184&gt;Lleras et al., 2009, p.184&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[indigenous peoples of Colombia|indigenous groups]] closer to the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean Coast]], the people [[Muisca economy#Trade|traded]] highly valuable sea snails. Ironically, the sea snails were worth more than the price of gold to the Muisca, due to the distance from their location far inland high in the [[Andes]]. The skilled goldworking of the Muisca formed the basis for the [[Muisca mythology|legend]] of ''[[El Dorado]]'' that became widespread among the Spanish [[conquistador]]s; this eventually drew them into the heart of Colombia—an ill-fated expedition that took almost a year and cost the lives of about 80% of their men.&lt;ref name=ConquistaGonzalo&gt;{{es}} [http://letras-uruguay.espaciolatino.com/aaa/bolivar_grimaldos_rafael/conquista_rapida_y_saqueo.htm Conquista rápida y saqueo cuantioso de Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BancoList&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/gennrgun/gennrgun9x.htm List of conquistadors led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''tunjos'' were mostly elaborated using ''[[tumbaga]]''; an alloy of [[gold]], [[copper]] and [[silver]], some with [[trace element|traces]] of [[lead]] or [[iron]].&lt;ref name=Museo/&gt; The majority of ceramic or stone ''tunjos'' has been described from [[Mongua]], close to [[Sogamoso]].&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez, s.a., p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tunjos'' served three purposes; as decoration of temples and shrines, for offering rituals in the sacred lakes and rivers in the [[Muisca religion]], and as pieces in funerary practices; to accompany the dead to the afterlife.&lt;ref name=Museo&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/meaneg/meaneg8.htm Description and metallurgy of ''tunjos''] - [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]] - [[Bogotá]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic human ''tunjos'' were kept in the houses (''bohíos'') of the Muisca, together with [[emerald]]s.&lt;ref name=Pena_p8&gt;Peña Gama, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The precious metals silver and gold were not common in the Eastern Ranges, while copper was mined in [[Gachantivá]], [[Moniquirá]] and in the mountains to the south of the Bogotá savanna at [[Sumapaz]]. The process of elaborating the fine [[filigree]] figures took place by creating a mold of obsidian, shale or clay, filling the open space with bee wax, obtained through [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] with the neighbouring indigenous peoples from the [[Orinoquía Region|Llanos Orientales]] to the east of the Altiplano; the [[Achagua people|Achagua]], [[Tegua people|Tegua]] and [[Guayupe people|Guayupe]]. The bee wax occupied the voids of the mold and the mold was heated by fires. The bee wax would melt, leaving an open space where the ''tumbaga'' or sometimes gold was poured into, a process called [[lost-wax casting]].&lt;ref name=Museo/&gt; Using this method, modern ''tunjos'' are still fabricated in the centre of Bogotá.&lt;ref name=CooperLangebaek&gt;Cooper &amp; Langebaek Rueda, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1577 and 1583, various colonial writers have reported in their chronicles the use of ''tunjos'' for offering pieces. The descriptions from the early colonial period of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] have been collected first by Vicenta Cortés Alonso in 1958 and later by Ulises Rojas in 1965. The reports of the late 16th century show that the religious practices of the Muisca were still alive, despite the intensive catholic conversion policies.&lt;ref&gt;Londoño, 1989, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caciques'' of [[Tuta, Boyacá|Tuta]], [[Toca, Boyacá|Toca]], [[Duitama]], [[Lake Iguaque|Iguaque]], [[Ramiriquí]], [[Paz de Río|Chitagoto]], [[Onzaga]], [[Tunja]] and [[Cucunubá]] participated in these rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Londoño, 1989, p.94-117&lt;/ref&gt; The religious leader of [[Sogamoso]] was still the most important in these days.&lt;ref&gt;Londoño, 1989, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Muisca raft ====
[[File:Muisca raft - detail - Museo del Oro, Bogotá.jpg|right|300px|thumb|'''Muisca raft''' in the Museo del Oro, Bogotá]]
{{main article|Muisca raft}}
The Muisca raft is the masterpiece of the Muisca goldworking and has become illustrative for the fine techniques used. The {{convert|19.1|cm|in}} by {{convert|10|cm|in}} object was found in 1969 in a ceramic pot hidden in a cave in the municipality of [[Pasca, Cundinamarca|Pasca]], in the southwest of the Bogotá savanna and has become the centerpiece in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]] in Bogotá.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://banrep.org/museo/esp/expo_bogota4.htm Exposición del Museo del Oro en Bogotá] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcXgRApLxfM Explanation of the metallurgy of the Muisca raft by Eduardo Londoño] - [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]]&lt;/ref&gt; The raft is interpreted as picturing the initiation ritual of the new ''[[zipa]]'' in the sacred [[Lake Guatavita]], where the new ruler would cover himself in gold dust and jump from a small boat into the waters of the {{convert|3000|m|ft}} high post-glacial lake to honour the gods. This ceremony was accompanied by priests (Muysccubun: ''xeque'') and formed the basis for the ''[[El Dorado]]'' legend that drew the Spanish [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]] towards the high Andes. The raft has been constructed using the lost-wax casting method and is made of ''tumbaga'' of around 80% gold, 12% silver and 8% copper.&lt;ref name=secrets2013&gt;{{Cite AV media|title=Secrets: Golden Raft of El Dorado|year=2013|publisher=Smithsonian Channel|time=27 minutes, 11 seconds}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 229 grams of gold.

The Muisca raft is also featured in the coat of arms of two municipalities of Cundinamarca; [[Sesquilé]], where Lake Guatavita is located, and Pasca, where the raft was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.sesquile-cundinamarca.gov.co/nuestromunicipio.shtml?apc=M1d1--&amp;m=f&amp;s=m#simbolos Official website Sesquilé]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pasca-cundinamarca.gov.co/nuestromunicipio.shtml?apc=mfxx1-&amp;m=f#simbolos Official website Pasca]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jewelry ====
[[File:TISQUESUSA1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The rich jewelry is shown in a 19th-century interpretation of ''zipa'' '''Tisquesusa''', the ruler of ''Bacatá'' in 1537, when the Spanish arrived]]
The Muisca society was in essence egalitarian with slight differences in terms of use of jewelry. The [[guecha warrior]]s, priests and ''caciques'' were allowed to wear multiple types of jewelry, while the common people used less jewels. Golden or ''tumbaga'' jewelry existed of [[diadem]]s, nose pieces, breast plates, earrings, pendants, [[tiara]]s, bracelets and masks.&lt;ref name=Pena_p8/&gt;

=== Architecture ===
[[File:ParqueArqueológicoSogamoso.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The '''''bohíos''''' of the Muisca were circular and constructed on a slightly elevated platform against flooding. The roofs were made of plant material and the houses did not have rooms, yet one open space]]
[[File:Malay Archipelago Dyak crossing a bamboo bridge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The many rivers were crossed by the Muisca using vines and '''bamboo''']]
{{main article|Muisca architecture}}
While the other three grand pre-Columbian civilisations—the Maya, Aztec and Inca—are known for their grand architecture in the form of pyramids, stelae, stone cities and temples, the modest Muisca architecture has left very little traces in the present.&lt;ref name=Langebaek2003_p265&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 2003, p.265&lt;/ref&gt; The houses (called ''bohíos'' or ''malokas'') and temples of the people, where spiritual gatherings took place honouring the gods and sacrificing ''tunjos'', emeralds and children, were made of degradable materials such as wood, clay and reed. The circular structures were built on top of slightly elevated platforms to prevent them from flooding on the frequently inundated plains; small settlements of ten to one hundred houses were surrounded by wooden poles forming an enclosure, called ''ca'' in [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]].&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, 1974, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://muysca.cubun.org/ca ''ca''] - Muysccubun dictionary online&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more gates gave entrance to the villages.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 1995a, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; The houses and temples themselves were built around a central pole of wood attached to the roof; the temples were constructed using the wood of ''[[Guaiacum officinale]]'' tree, giving high quality construction.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; The floors of the open spaced houses were covered with straw or, for the ''caciques'', with ceramic floors.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardale de Schrimpff, 1985, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Cloths were attached to the roof and painted with red and black colours. The houses and sacred places were adorned with ''tunjos'' and emeralds, and in some cases with the remains of [[Muisca religion#Sacrifice|human sacrifices]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roads====
The roads the Muisca merchants and ''xeques'' used to traverse the Altiplano and access surrounding areas, were dug in the top soil without pavement, making them hard to recognise in the archaeological record. The roads leading to the religious sites, such as [[Lake Tota]], were marked with stones surrounding the pathway, which are still visible today.&lt;ref&gt;Cristancho Mejía, 2008, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Cable bridges of vines and [[Olyra (plant)|bamboo]] connected the banks of the many rivers of the Andes. The roads crossing the mountains of the Eastern Ranges were narrow, which created a problem for the [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|Spanish conquistadors]] who used horses to travel long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 1995b, Ch.1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Remaining antiquities====
A few structures built by the Muisca still exist today; the [[Cojines del Zaque]] ("cushions of the zaque") in [[Tunja]] are two round stones with inclined upper parts used for religious ceremonies. Of the [[Goranchacha Temple]], a circle of pillars remained, located on the terrains of the [[UPTC]], also in Tunja. The holiest temple of the Muisca, the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]] in sacred City of the Sun [[Sogamoso|Suamox]] had been destroyed by fire when the Spanish conquerors looted the shrine and has been rebuilt based on archaeological research by [[Eliécer Silva Celis]]. The temple is part of the [[Archaeology Museum, Sogamoso|Archaeology Museum]] of the city in Boyacá.&lt;ref name=PueblosSogamoso&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/sogamoso.html Temple of the Sun - Sogamoso] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mummies ===
[[File:Momia-museo-del-oro-2500px.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The '''Muisca mummies''' were placed in a typical position, with the hands in front of the chin and the legs folded onto the abdomen]]
{{main article|Muisca mummification}}
Mummification was a tradition that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, the habit of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD.&lt;ref name=Ortega_p8/&gt; The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved members of the society by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry the body and the [[phenol]] conserve the organs and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours.&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p71&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, or in some cases placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]].&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p68/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Cuenca, 2007, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izquierdo Peña, 2009, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the mummies was with their arms folded across the chest and the hands around the chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. The habit of mummification continued well into the [[New Kingdom of Granada|colonial period]]; the youngest mummies found date from the second half of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p68&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García, 2012, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p74&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare the dead for the afterlife, the mummies were surrounded with ceramic pots containing food, ''tunjos'' and cotton bags and mantles.&lt;ref name=Ortega_p8&gt;Ortega Loaiza et al., 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[guecha warrior]]s were richly venerated with golden arms, crowns, emeralds and cotton.&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p72&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''caciques'' and ''zaque'' and ''zipa'' died, their mummified bodies were placed in mausoleums and surrounded with golden objects. The highest regarded members of society were accompanied by their [[Women in Muisca society#Polygamy|many wives]], by [[Muisca warfare|slaves]] and their children. The mummy of a baby described from a cave in [[Gámeza]], Boyacá, had a [[teether]] around the neck.&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p69&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Other mummies of children were richly decorated with gold and placed in caves, as was the case with a young girl described by [[Liborio Zerda]].&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p71/&gt;

The art of mummification was also practiced by other [[Chibcha language|Chibcha-speaking]] groups in the Eastern Ranges; the [[Guane people|Guane]] mummies are well studied, and also the [[U'wa people|U'wa]] and farther north the [[Chitarero people|Chitarero]] of the department of [[Norte de Santander]] mummified their dead.&lt;ref name=BancoMomia&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/museo-del-oro/coleccion/D00009 Momia] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Villa_p52&gt;Villa Posse, 1993, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; The Carib-speaking [[Muzo people|Muzo]] buried their mummies with the head towards the west, while the [[Zenú]] and [[Panche people|Panche]], like the Muisca commonly oriented the faces of their mummies to the east. Some of the Muisca mummies were directed towards the south.&lt;ref name=GranEpoca&gt;{{es}} [http://www.lagranepoca.com/archivo/30748-estudio-tumbas-muiscas-evoca-mito-leyenda-del-dorado.html Estudio de tumbas Muiscas evoca el mito de la Leyenda del Dorado]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the guecha warriors fought battles with neighbouring groups, most notably the Panche, and also against the Spanish conquistadors, they carried the mummies of their ancestors on their backs, to impress the enemy and receive fortune in battle.&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p68/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p72/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martínez Martín, s.a., p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Correa, 2005, p.204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trimborn, 2005, p.305&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Golden Trumpet - Museo del Oro - Bogotá.jpg|right|thumb|300px|'''Trumpets''' were made of ceramics or of '''gold''' as in this case in the Muisca exhibition of the Museo del Oro]]
{{main article|Muisca music}}
The Muisca played music, sang and danced mainly as part of religious, burial and initiation rituals, with harvests and sowing and after the victory in [[Muisca warfare|battles]].&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p230&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p231&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.231&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the construction of their houses, the Muisca performed music and dances. The early Spanish chronicles noted that the music and singing was monotonous and sad.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://tierradevientos.blogspot.com.co/2011/06/musica-andina-en-colombia.html Monotonous music of the Muisca]&lt;/ref&gt; As musical instruments they used drums, flutes made of shells or ceramics, trumpets of gold, [[Siku (instrument)|zampoñas]] and ocarinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/bogot/evento/ritual-m-sica-y-sacrificios-humanos-en-los-muiscas-del-siglo-xvi Music of the Muisca] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the rituals, the people would be dressed in feathers, animal skins (mainly [[jaguar]]) and decorated their bodies with paint. At the dances the women and men held hands and both the commoners and the higher social classes participated in these activities. The main [[Muisca religion|deities]] associated with the dances were [[Huitaca (goddess)|Huitaca]] and [[Nencatacoa]].&lt;ref name=Escobar&gt;Escobar, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-5089300 Huitaca, la diosa muisca en el Palacio Liévano] - [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ceramics ===
[[File:Múcuras precolombinas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Collection of '''ceramic vases''' (''múcuras'') made by the Muisca]]
{{see also|Muisca economy#Ceramics}}
The use of ceramics on the Altiplano started in the Herrera Period, with the oldest evidences of ceramic use dated at 3000 BP. The many different clays of the rivers and lakes of the valleys on the high plateau made a variety of ceramic types possible.

The Muisca constructed ceramic pottery for cooking, the extraction of [[halite|salt]] from brines, as decorative ritual pieces and for the consumption of their alcoholic beverage; [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]]. Large ceramic jars were found around the sacred [[Muisca astronomy|archaeoastronomical site]] of ''[[El Infiernito]]'', used for massive rituals where the people celebrated their festivities drinking chicha.&lt;ref name=Langebaek_p291&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 2005, p.291&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Muisca music|musical instruments]] such as [[ocarina]]s were made of ceramics. The ceramic pots and sculptures were painted with zoomorphic figures that were common in the Muisca territory; [[frog]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s. Main ceramic production centres were located close to the abundance of clays, in [[Tocancipá]], [[Gachancipá]], [[Cogua]], [[Guatavita]], [[Guasca]] and [[Ráquira]].&lt;ref name=Pena_p8/&gt;

{{see also|Muisca economy#Weaving}}
The Muisca, as the indigenous groups in the west of Colombia, developed a variety of textiles from [[fique]] or [[cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 1970, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p289&gt;Fernández Sacama, 2013, p.289&lt;/ref&gt; Cords were made of fique or human hair.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p289/&gt; The people of the cold climate Altiplano did not have a major [[cotton]] production, yet traded most of their cotton with their neighbours; the [[Muzo people|Muzo]] in the west, [[Panche people|Panche]] in the southwest, [[Guane people|Guane]] in the northwest, and the [[Guayupe people|Guayupe]] in the east.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p289/&gt; From the raw cotton, the [[Women in Muisca society|Muisca women]] made fine cotton mantles that were traded on the many markets in the Muisca territory.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 1993, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

The mantles of the Muisca were decorated with various colours. The colours were obtained from seeds; the seed of the [[avocado]] for green, flowers; [[saffron]] for orange and [[Baptisia australis|indigo weed]] for blue, fruits, crust and roots of plants, from animals as the [[cochineal]] insect producing purple colours, and minerals as the blue and green clays of [[Siachoque]], the coloured earth of [[Sutamarchán|Suta]] and the yellow sediments of [[Soracá]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p290&gt;Fernández Sacama, 2013, p.290&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[curuba]], the flowers of the [[potato]] plant (''[[Solanum andigenum]]'') and other colouring materials (''[[Rumex obtusifolia]]'', ''[[Bixa orellana]]'', ''[[Arrabidaea chica]]'' and more) were used.&lt;ref name=Cortes_p62&gt;Cortés Moreno, 1990, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; The colours were applied using pencils, applying coloured threads or using stamps.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p291&gt;Fernández Sacama, 2013, p.291&lt;/ref&gt; The textiles were produced using various techniques, similar to the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] of southern South America and the Mesoamerican cultures.&lt;ref name=Cortes_p64&gt;Cortés Moreno, 1990, p.64&lt;/ref&gt; Small textiles functioned as money, just like the ''[[Muisca economy#Trade|tejuelos]]'' of gold or [[Nemocón|salt]] was used.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 1993, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture of mantle-making in the [[Muisca mythology]] is said to have been taught by [[Bochica]], who trained the people in the use of [[spindle (textiles)|spindles]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p287&gt;Fernández Sacama, 2013, p.287&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nencatacoa]] protected the weavers and painters of the mantles.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p288&gt;Fernández Sacama, 2013, p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hieroglyphs ===
[[File:Muisca cyphers acc acosta humboldt zerda.svg|thumb|right|300px|While the Muisca didn't have a formal script, they used hieroglyphs for their '''numerals''', depicted as rock art, on ceramics and textiles]]
{{main article|Muisca numerals}}
A script for text was not used by the Muisca, but the numerals were written with hieroglyphs. They have been analysed by various authors, such as [[Joaquín Acosta]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Liborio Zerda]], and appear as rock art and on textiles. The frog is the most important and is represented in the numbers from one (''ata'') to twenty (''gueta'') five times, because the Muisca didn't have hieroglyphs for the numbers 11 to 19, so used the numerals one to nine again in combination with ten; fifteen was thus ten-and-five; ''qhicħâ hɣcſcâ''.&lt;ref name=Humb1&gt;Humboldt, 1807, Part 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lugo&gt;{{es}} [http://www.cubun.org/desarrollos/numeros.php Muisca numbers according to Bernardo de Lugo]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body art ===
Tattoos were common for the Muisca and an expression of their identity.&lt;ref&gt;Pineda Camacho, 2005, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://loschibchasomuiscas.blogspot.com.co/ Los Chibchas o Muiscas]&lt;/ref&gt; The people used ''[[Bixa orellana]]'' to paint their bodies, just like the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], [[Island Caribs|Carib]] and [[Tupi people|Tupi]].&lt;ref name=Uscategui_p336&gt;Uscategui Mendoza, 1961, p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rock art ===

Many examples of rock art by the Muisca have been discovered on the Altiplano. The first rock art has been discovered by [[conquistador]] [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] during the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]].&lt;ref name=Munoz_p5&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rock art]] consists of [[petroglyphs]] (carvings) and [[petrograph]]s (drawings). The petrographs were made using the [[index finger]].&lt;ref name=Rico_p88&gt;Rico Ramírez, 2013, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneer in the study of the rock art has been [[Miguel Triana]].&lt;ref&gt;Triana, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; Later contributions have been done by Diego Martínez, [[Eliécer Silva Celis]] and others.&lt;ref name=Rico_p87&gt;Rico Ramírez, 2013, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that the rock art has been made under the influence of [[ayahuasca]] (yahé).&lt;ref name=Rico_p84&gt;Rico Ramírez, 2013, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock art of Soacha-Sibaté, in the southwest of the Bogotá savanna, has been studied in detail between 1970 and 2006, after initial studies by Triana.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz_p2&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; In these petrographs certain motives have been described; ''triangular heads'' are pictographs of human figures where the heads are painted in a triangular shape. They are applied using red colours and demonstrate various sizes. Similar motives are noted in [[Mongua]], [[Tenjo]] and [[Tibacuy]].&lt;ref name=Munoz_p14&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases of the rock art on the Altiplano, the body extremities, such as hands, are shown in simple shapes. In some cases however, the hands are elaborated with much more detail using spirals, concentric circles and more strokes, identified as ''complex hands''. Apart from Sibaté, these shapes are encountered also in [[Saboyá]] and [[Tibaná]] in Boyacá.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p15&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; A third class of petrographs has been named ''radial representations''. This motive shows the main figures with concentric square or circular lines drawn around them.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p16&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The concentric circular drawings have been interpreted as representing the main deities of the Muisca religion; [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]] (the Moon) and [[Sué]], her husband the Sun.&lt;ref name=Contreras_p148&gt;Contreras Díaz, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rhomboidal motives'' are found in Sibaté, but their exact purpose has not yet been concluded.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p17&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Both in Soacha and in Sibaté a fifth type of petrographs has been identified; ''winged figures''. These motives resemble the birds that are described in ''tunjos'' and ceramics of the Altiplano.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p17/&gt;

The same scholar has performed detailed analysis of the rock art in Facatativá; the [[Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park]]. The many petrographs in this location are painted using red, yellow, ochre, blue, black and white colours.&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p42&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p44&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p45/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p55&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; The motives show a possible [[tobacco]] plant, commonly used by the Muisca, zig-zag patterns, anthropomorphic figures, concentric lines similar to those in Soacha and Sáchica, zoomorphic motives and anthropo-zoomorphic composites in the shape of frogs.&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p45&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p55/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p43&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p48&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p49&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p58&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p59&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p63&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in the 1960s by [[Eliécer Silva Celis]] on the rock art of Sáchica showed [[Plant morphology|phytomorphic]] designs, masked human figures, singular and concentric rings, triangulated heads, and faces where the eyes and noses were drawn, but the mouths absent.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Celis, 1962, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the petrographs found here are abstract figures.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Celis, 1962, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The colours red, black and white dominate the rock paintings in Sáchica. The black has been analysed also at ''El Infiernito'' and is though to refer to a pre-Muisca origin.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Celis, 1962, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Radial structures drawn on the heads of the anthropomorphic petrographs are interpreted as feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Celis, 1962, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers were precious objects for the Muisca and used by the ''xeques'' and ''caciques'' during the ''El Dorado'' ritual in Lake Guatavita.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Celis, 1962, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand imprints, similar to the famous [[Cueva de las Manos]] in Argentina, yet less pronounced and in quantity, have been discovered on rock faces in Soacha and [[Motavita]].&lt;ref&gt;Martínez &amp; Botiva, 2004b, p.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Muisca rock art on the Altiplano ====
As of 2006, 3487 locations of rock art had been discovered in Cundinamarca alone, of which 301 on the [[Bogotá savanna]].&lt;ref name=Munoz_p10&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Other locations have been found over the years.&lt;ref name=ICANH/&gt;&lt;ref name="Munoz_p10"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Botiva&gt;Martínez &amp; Botiva, 2004a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;López Estupiñán, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martínez &amp; Botiva, 2004b, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The rock art of the Archaeological Park of Facatativá is heavily vandalised.&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p11&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for the preservation of the unique cultural heritage have been formulated since the mid 2000s.&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p23&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The petrographs of [[Soacha]] are endangered by the [[mining]] activities in the fastly growing [[suburb]] of [[Bogotá]], as is happening with other mining districts; [[Chía, Cundinamarca|Chía]], [[Sibaté]], [[Tunja]], [[Sáchica]] and others.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p3&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centre of Bogotá the process of production of ''[[tunjo]]s'' is still alive. Using the same methods as the Muisca must have used, the votive offer figurines are crafted.&lt;ref name=CooperLangebaek/&gt; Artistic representations of Muisca creativity are not as common as the Maya, Aztec and Inca. Still, modern interpretations of their art are produced. In [[Bosa (Bogotá)|Bosa]], a locality in the west of [[Bogotá]], a [[mural]] depicts the various [[Muisca religion#Deities|deities]]. Another mural showing the gods and goddesses of the Muisca is made in the [[Hotel Tequendama]], named after [[Andean preceramic|preceramic]] archaeological site and rock shelter [[Tequendama]], in the centre of Bogotá. Other stylistic art of these deities are produced by professional graphic designers in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;Guzmán, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Muisca are featured as one of the [[List of Europa Universalis IV playable nations|playable nations]] in the videogame ''[[Europa Universalis IV]]'', where a specially developed expansion set ''[[El Dorado]]'' can be played; seven cities of gold in the Americas with the leaders of the main civilisations represented.&lt;ref name=EUDorado&gt;[https://www.paradoxplaza.com/europa-universalis-iv-el-dorado ''El Dorado'' expansion set] - [[Paradox Interactive]] - ''[[Europa Universalis IV]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the main game, all the [[Muisca rulers]], from [[Michuá]] and [[Meicuchuca]] till [[Tisquesusa]], [[Sagipa]] and [[Aquiminzaque]] are included.

'''Censorship of music''' refers to the practice of editing of [[music|musical works]] for various reasons, stemming from a wide variety of motivations, including moral, political, or religious reasons. Censorship can range from the complete government-enforced legal prohibition of a musical work, to private, voluntary removal of content when a musical work appears in a certain context.

==Motivations==
===Decency===
Songs are commonly edited for broadcast on [[radio]] and [[television]] to remove content that may be considered objectionable to an outlet's [[target audience]]—such as [[profanity]], or references to subjects such as [[sexual activity|sex]] and [[recreational drug|drug usage]]. This is typically done to comply with any relevant [[broadcast law]] or [[codes of conduct]], and to make the songs more marketable to a mainstream audience.&lt;ref name=MIAcensdoubstandard/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt; Songs edited for content in this manner by are often referred to as a "[[clean version]]" or a "[[radio edit]]" (the latter also referring to songs that may be edited for length on radio airplay, and in the past, space limitations on 45 RPM [[vinyl record]]s).&lt;ref name=cp-attentionspans&gt;{{cite news|title=QuickHitz offers radio hit parade edited for short attention spans|url=http://www.theprovince.com/news/QuickHitz+offers+radio+parade+edited+short+attention+spans/10102495/story.html|accessdate=20 August 2014|agency=Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3395823.stm|title=Banned on the run|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common editing techniques include distorting vocals to obscure offending words (including muting, [[bleep censor|bleeping]], and [[backmasking]]), or replacing them with alternative lyrics.&lt;ref name="guardian-sandm"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ewing|first=Tom|title=How pop is provoking the censors again|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/09/rihanna-lyrics-censorship-radio-one|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of censorship required may vary between broadcasters, depending on [[standards and practices]] and their target audience; for example, [[Radio Disney]] imposes stricter content guidelines than conventional U.S. radio stations, as it primarily targets a youth audience and family listening.&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/11/08/454606994/the-art-of-the-clean-version|title=The Art Of The 'Clean Version'|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, some radio stations may relegate unedited versions of tracks containing objectionable content to airplay during [[Watershed (broadcasting)|time periods deemed appropriate]], such as late-night hours.&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban"/&gt; Joel Mullis, an Atlanta sound engineer who became well-known in the industry for his work on radio edits, noted that his job was often complicated by differing standards between broadcasters (such as [[BET]] and [[MTV]]), requiring different edits to meet their individual needs. Mullis' edit of the [[Ying Yang Twins]]' "[[Wait (The Whisper Song)]]" was constructed by splicing in vocals from other Ying Yang Twins songs, but Mullis eventually had to bring the group back to his studio after facing demands for additional edits.&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt;

In some cases, a [[record label]] may choose to withhold a release entirely if they believe that its subject matter would be too controversial; [[Ice-T]] and [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]] both had [[gangsta rap]] albums withheld or indefinitely delayed by [[Warner Bros. Records]] over content concerns, with Ice-T's [[Home Invasion (album)|''Home Invasion'']] delayed due to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] and controversy over "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]"—a song by Ice-T's metal band [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]], and Paris's ''[[Sleeping with the Enemy (album)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]'' over its songs "[[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] Killa" and "Coffee, Doughnuts, &amp; Death". [[Insane Clown Posse]] faced similar issues after they signed to [[Disney]]-owned [[Hollywood Records]]; despite compliance with the label's demands to censor specific songs and lyrics, ''[[The Great Milenko]]'' was recalled almost immediately after its release (but not before selling 18,000 copies out of 100,000 shipped). All three acts moved to different labels (including [[Priority Records]] and [[Island Records]]), which released their respective albums without objections.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/violent-j-breaks-down-insane-clown-posses-joker-card-lps-20150213/the-great-milenko-1997-20150213|title=Violent J Gives the Twisted Stories Behind ICP's Best LPs|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/1997/07/25/great-milenko/|title=The Great Milenko|date=1997-07-25|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/09/controversial-rap-album-covers/paris-sleeping-with-the-enemy|title=A History of Scandalous Rap Album Covers: Paris, Sleeping with the Enemy (1992)|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Notable examples ====
Multiple edits of [[CeeLo Green]]'s song "[[Fuck You (CeeLo Green song)|Fuck You]]" exist, including one which changed the titular lyric to "Forget You", and one which muted "fuck" without replacing it. Green also performed a [[Parody music|parody]] of the song about [[Fox News]] in an appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/11/10/cee-lo-green-colbert-fox-news/|title=Cee-Lo Green swaps 'Fox News' for 'F--k You' on 'Colbert'|last=|first=|date=2010-11-10|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129454158|title=Cee Lo's Viral Hit: Blunt and Sweet|date=August 26, 2010|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/08/30/cee.lo.song.video/index.html|title=Cee Lo's YouTube hit you won't hear on radio|last=Brown|first=Damon|date=August 30, 2010|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Black Eyed Peas]] re-wrote "Let's Get Retarded"—a song from their album ''[[Elephunk]]'', as "[[Let's Get It Started]]" to serve as a promotional song for television coverage of the [[2004 NBA Playoffs]].

Songs containing potentially objectionable [[double entendre]]s or [[mondegreen]]s have also been subject to censorship. For example, the title and chorus of [[Britney Spears]]' single "[[If U Seek Amy]]" was intended to be misheard as "[[Sexual intercourse|F-U-C-K me]]"; her label issued a radio edit which changed the word "seek" to "see", in order to remove the wordplay.&lt;ref name=nzherald&gt;{{cite web | author=Guy Adams | title=Britney forced to rerecord 'sexually offensive' song | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]| date=January 21, 2009 | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10552846 | accessdate=December 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mtvone"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gil Kaufman | title=Britney Spears' 'If U Seek Amy' Poses Censorship Problems For Radio | work=MTV.com |publisher=MTV Networks| date=February 12, 2009 | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1602458/20090109/spears_britney.jhtml | accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns were raised by radio stations over The Black Eyed Peas' "[[Don't Phunk With My Heart]]" upon its release, as the word "phunk" (a deliberate misspelling of "funk") could be misinterpreted by listeners as sounding like the word "fuck".&lt;ref name=mtvone/&gt; [[Meghan Trainor]] recorded an alternate version of her debut single "[[All About That Bass]]" for Radio Disney and conservative [[adult contemporary]] stations, which removed the song's suggestive metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6266667/ac-radio-disney-are-all-about-that-edited-bass|title=AC, Radio Disney Are All About That (Edited) 'Bass'|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt;

Censorship of music is not limited to lyrical content; [[MTV]] edited the [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] song "[[Paper Planes]]" to replace sounds of gunfire in its chorus with alternative sound effects, and remove a reference to cannabis. Similar sound edits occurred when M.I.A. performed the same song on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' (broadcast by then-corporate sibling [[CBS]]). M.I.A. subsequently criticized both MTV and ''Late Show'' for censoring her song.&lt;ref name=MIAcensdoubstandard&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom  |last=Breihan |title=M.I.A. and the Double Standard of MTV Censorship|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/statusainthood/archives/2007/12/mia_and_the_dou.php|archivedate=February 19, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219004257/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/statusainthood/archives/2007/12/mia_and_the_dou.php|dead-url=yes|work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIAPlanesBlognytobserver"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://observer.com/2007/12/tube-surfing-mias-paper-planes/ | title=Tube Surfing: M.I.A.'s 'Paper Planes' | author=Gillian Reagen | work=[[The New York Observer]] | date=December 17, 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====
Some listeners have expressed dissatisfaction over the editing of songs for radio airplay, arguing that it compromises the artistic integrity of the original song, and encourage listeners to seek out alternative platforms that are not subject to such censorship, such as digital streaming. At the same time, edits are considered a necessary concession to receive the radio airplay that can influence a song's overall performance.&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt; [[N.W.A.]]'s debut album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' (which had attracted controversy for its song "[[Fuck tha Police]]") contains a song entitled "[[Express Yourself (N.W.A song)|Express Yourself]]", which criticizes radio censorship of music as inhibiting [[free expression]], and also criticizes other rappers for releasing inoffensive songs without profanity in order to receive radio airplay. Despite its themes, "Express Yourself" is the only song on the album to not contain profanities.&lt;ref name="smh-expressyourself"/&gt;

=== Sensitivity ===
Some songs may be pulled or downplayed by broadcasters if they are considered to be inappropriate to play in the aftermath of specific events. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], many broadcasters altered their music programming for these reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Neil | title = The Pop Life; After the Horror, Radio Stations Pull Some Songs | work= [[The New York Times]]| date = November 19, 2001 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E2D9153BF93AA2575AC0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all| accessdate = August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]], whose program directors compiled an [[2001 Clear Channel memorandum|internal list]] of "lyrically questionable" songs. The list included all [[Rage Against the Machine]] songs, as well as various songs with themes related to war, destruction, flight, or [[New York City]]. ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' noted several unusual choices on the list, including "[[Walk Like an Egyptian]]", two [[Cat Stevens]] songs (Stevens had converted to the [[Islamic faith]] and changed his name to Yusuf Islam), and [[John Lennon]]'s "explicitly pacifist anthem '[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Eliza|title=It's the End of the World as Clear Channel Knows It|work=[[Slate.com|Slate]]|date=September 17, 2001|url=http://slate.com/id/1008314/|accessdate=September 17, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071015200337/http://slate.com/id/1008314/| archivedate= October 15, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="austin-imagine"&gt;{{cite web

Following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in February 2003, [[Mark Wills]]' "[[19 Somethin']]" was temporarily pulled by some radio stations as it contains a lyric referencing the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 2003|title=Singles minded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OA8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=19+Somethin+pulled+columbia+disaster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0AH0eUw4-7&amp;sig=3-MHmFYaADmGOfeiaIBV_wn0K4Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixmsaT0ObUAhUo34MKHbvADQ4Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage|journal=Billboard|volume=|pages=55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s then-upcoming music video for "[[American Life (song)|American Life]]" generated controversy due to its politicized and "unpatriotic" imagery (such as a [[fashion show]] featuring women dressed in military equipment, and a scene where the singer throws a [[grenade]]-shaped [[lighter]] to a [[George W. Bush]] lookalike to light his [[cigar]]), which were considered to be especially sensitive in the wake of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]]. Due to the negative response, Madonna pulled the video prior to its planned premiere, as she did not want to "risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2003/04/01/madonna-pulls-controversial-american-life-video/|title=Madonna pulls controversial ''American Life'' video|date=2003-04-01|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/antiwar.artsfeatures|title=Madonna takes swipe at Bush|last=Child|first=Ben|date=2003-02-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the NFL still allowed a [[cover version]] of the song to be played, in 2012 the league instructed its teams to "avoid" playing the song entirely, following negative reception from British media over its continued use by the [[New England Patriots]], and the possibility it could be played during [[Super Bowl XLVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/6273999/why-convicted-child-sex-offender-gary-glitters-hey|title=Why Convicted Child-Sex Offender Gary Glitter’s ‘Hey Song’ Is Still Getting Played|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/gary-glitter-10-1269123|title=NFL bosses ban Gary Glitter's 'Rock And Roll Part II' from the Super Bowl|date=2012-02-02|work=NME|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Censorship in Australia}}
The [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and the Australian Music Retailers Association (AMRA) maintain a self-regulatory system known as the "Recorded Music Labelling Code of Practice", which utilizes a three-tier ratings system for objectionable content in music recordings. "Level 1" applies to content of a "moderate impact" (including "infrequent aggressive or strong coarse language; or
moderate-impact references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes"), "Level 2" for "strong impact" ("frequent aggressive or strong coarse language", or strong references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes), and "Level 3" for "high impact" content (graphic and high-impact references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes). The Level 3 classification was introduced in March 2003, and requires purchasers to be over the age of 18. The code bans the distribution or sale of any recording with material that exceeds Level 3 classification, which includes content "which promote, incite, instruct or exploitatively or gratuitously depict drug abuse, cruelty, suicide, criminal or sexual violence, child abuse, incest, bestiality or any other revolting or abhorrent activity in a way that causes outrage or extreme disgust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2453315.stm |title= Australia plans CD 'censorship' |work= BBC News |date= 2002-11-12|access-date= 2018-03-22 |language= en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/senate/legal_and_constitutional_affairs/completed_inquiries/2010-13/classificationboard/report/~/media/wopapub/senate/committee/legcon_ctte/completed_inquiries/2010-13/classification_board/report/c09.ashx |title= Inquiry |last=|first= |date= |website= Parliament of Australia |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date= March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian customs law also bans the import of any product that "describe[s], depict[s], express[es] or otherwise deal[s] with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-singapore-pornography/singapore-pilot-fined-in-australia-for-laptop-child-porn-idUKSIN10289320080213|title=Singapore pilot fined in Australia for laptop child porn|agency=Reuters|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, copies of an album by [[grindcore]] band Intense Hammer Rage were seized by the [[Australian Customs Service]], and the three band members were each fined [[Australian dollar|AUD$]]500 each for violating customs law.

In May 1990, Nick Franklin, acting news director of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s radio station [[Triple J]], was suspended by the ABC's management after having played a portion of [[N.W.A.]]'s song "[[Fuck tha Police]]". The song had received airplay on the station for several months, but ABC Radio head Malcom Long requested that the song be given a "rest"; in the offending segment, Franklin discussed the song's vulgar lyrics and subject matter. In protest of the suspension, Triple J staff went on strike, and the station [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunted]] by playing the N.W.A. song "Express Yourself" on a loop. The stunt ended after the ABC resolved the dispute and reinstated Long. The song was ultimately played 82 times in a row.&lt;ref name="smh-expressyourself"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/express-yourself-the-day-triple-j-played-the-same-nwa-song-82-times-in-a-row-20150902-gjdk0d.html|title=Express yourself: The day Triple J played the same N.W.A. song 82 times in a row|last=Casimir|first=Paul Chamberlin and Jon|date=2015-09-02|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Censorship in Canada}}

In Canada, content broadcast by radio and television is self-regulated under the code of ethics of the [[Canadian Association of Broadcasters]] by a group known as the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC), which acts upon complaints submitted by the general public. The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) can intervene in more substantial cases.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; 

In 2011, the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic]] panel of the CBSC, in response to a complaint against [[CHOZ-FM]], ruled that the original version of [[Dire Straits]]' 1985 single, "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" violated the ethics code, because of its use of the word "[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]"—a homophobic slur. However, the CRTC called upon the CBSC to review the decision with a national panel, as it "elicited a strong public reaction and created uncertainty for private radio stations across the country." In particular, the CRTC asked the CBSC to consider the overall context of the slur in relation to the rest of the song, as well as how the word was used at the time of the song's release.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/CRTC+asks+review+Dire+Straits+song/4144591/story.html|title=CRTC asks for review of Dire Straits song ban|last=Abma|first=Derek|agency=Postmedia News|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBSC overturned the ruling; while panellists agreed that the slur was inappropriate, it was considered to be satirical and non-hateful in context. It was also noted that lead singer [[Mark Knopfler]] had substituted the word himself with alternatives (such as "queenie") during live performances, which was considered an admission that his original choice in words was in bad taste. The CBSC stated that it was up to individual stations whether or not they would play the unedited version.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The ruling and controversy were ridiculed by critics; veteran Canadian radio personality [[Alan Cross]] commented that the controversy made Canada look "silly", remarking that "I talked to people from the U.S. and the U.K. and they were like, 'What's wrong with you people? Don't you get it? It's a joke. It's a satire. You didn't understand the context?" ''[[National Post]]'' columnist Chris Selley described the CBSC's new ruling as a "comedy classic" and "colossal waste of time", explaining that "it's one thing for a censor to decide whether something is legitimately artistic; it's another for it to declare whether or not it enjoys the art, as if it somehow mattered."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/opinion/chris-selley-broadcast-standards-ruling-on-money-for-nothing-a-comedy-classic|title=Chris Selley: Broadcast Standards ruling on Money for Nothing a comedy classic|date=2011-09-01|work=National Post|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/canada-lifts-ban-on-dire-straits-money-for-nothing-20110901|title=Canada Lifts Ban on Dire Straits' 'Money for Nothing'|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{See also|Censorship in China}}
During the rule of [[Mao Zedong]], "[[Yellow Music]]" became subject to criticism and censure, since the [[Communist Party of China]] saw Shanghai ''[[shidaiqu]]'' [[C-pop|pop music]]&lt;ref name="shanghai"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/article/367361/shanghai-love |title=From Shanghai with love |date=31 December 2001 |work=South China Morning Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; as indecent, and critics saw the sentiments of love songs as appealing only to the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]''. The genre was also criticized over its connections to American [[jazz]] music, due to [[Anti-American sentiment]] from the [[Korean War]]. This resulted in many artists associated with shidaiqu, including [[Li Jinhui]] (who had been credited as a leading figure in the genre) and [[Chen Gexin]], being branded as "[[Right-wing politics|rightists]]" and persecuted. Shanghai pop was displaced by [[Political music in China|revolutionary music]] that promoted [[Maoism]] and other ideologies of the Communist Party. In 1966, [[Tian Han]]—writer of the Chinese national anthem "[[March of the Volunteers]]"—was imprisoned over his allegorical play ''Xie Yaohuan'' (which was critical of Mao's regime) in one of the opening salvos of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. His works were banned, leading to "[[The East Is Red (song)|The East is Red]]"—a song which glorified Mao's [[cult of personality]], being used as the ''de facto'' national anthem at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiQJmCxVICcC&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Jazz Planet |editor= E.

The [[BBC]] was historically known for [[List of songs banned by the BBC|censoring]] various songs from being played on its [[BBC Radio|radio]] and [[BBC Television|television]] stations; from the 1930s through 1960s, the BBC had banned songs such as "[[Hold My Hand (1953 song)|Hold My Hand]]" for its religious references, pop arrangements of classical tunes (though barring "[[Sabre Dance]]" because it was "not a well-loved classic whose perversion we would be encouraging"), and during [[World War II]], songs that were "slushy in sentiment", such as "[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]", due to concerns that it would affect the morale of soldiers. "[[Mack the Knife]]" was also banned from airplay outside of ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', as the BBC felt it would be offensive outside of the context of the play.&lt;ref name="Unfit for aunties"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/unfit-for-aunties-airwaves-the-artists-censored-by-the-bbc-765106.html|title=Unfit for Auntie's airwaves: The artists censored by the BBC|date=14 December 2007|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Kinks]]' "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]" was briefly banned under the BBC's anti-[[product placement]] rules, as its lyrics contain references to the brand name [[Coca-Cola]].

The [[Sex Pistols]]' 1977 single "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" was controversial upon its release, as it was critical of the British government and monarchy (among other things, referring to the United Kingdom as a "fascist regime"), and was released during the year of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|silver jubilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1219770.stm |title= Sex Pistols cover tops chart |publisher= BBC |accessdate= 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "God Save the Queen" was banned by the BBC and all [[independent local radio]] stations, but still peaked at #2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] during the week of the official Jubilee celebration. It was alleged that the chart's rules were changed for that week only to exclude sales from record shops that sold their own records (in this case, [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]), in a deliberate effort to prevent the controversial song from reaching the number-one spot and causing wider offence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2010060.stm|title=Bragg attacks Pistols' royal views|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/apr/12/artsfeatures.popandrock|title=Leaders of the banned|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=2002-04-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/music-charting-the-number-ones-that-somehow-got-away-1145809.html|title=Music: Charting the number ones that somehow got away|date=1998-02-20|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] song "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]" generated controversy due to its suggestive lyrics; the chorus contained double entendres such as "when you want to suck to it" and "when you want to come", which were interpreted as being oblique references to [[oral sex]] and [[ejaculation]] respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/27/radio-1-relax-ban-john-peel-1984-archive|title=Shake-up planned at Radio 1 after Relax ban|last=Harron|first=Mary|date=1984-01-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1984, Radio 1 morning DJ [[Mike Read]] stopped the song on-air during a chart rundown to point out its "obscene" lyrics, and announced that he would no longer play the song during his show. The BBC subsequently restricted the song to evening airplay. When the band made statements in a ''[[Daily Express]]'' interview confirming the possibility of sexual connotations in the lyrics, the BBC banned "Relax" entirely. The ban only [[Streisand effect|increased interest]] in the single, causing it to become the number-one song in Britain only two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/959284.stm|title='Banned' Frankie tops chart|date=6 October 2000|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In December 2007, BBC Radio 1 began to play a version of [[The Pogues]]' popular Christmas song "[[Fairytale of New York]]" that censored the words "faggot" and "slut" from one of its verses. The BBC cited concerns over the homophobic slurs as reasoning, despite the song having historically been played without censorship. The BBC reversed the decision after it was criticized by listeners, the band itself, and the mother of the song's featured vocalist [[Kirsty MacColl]]. Radio 1 controller [[Andy Parfitt]] argued that "While we would never condone prejudice of any kind, we know our audiences are smart enough to distinguish between maliciousness and creative freedom. In the context of this song, I do not feel that there is any negative intent behind the use of the words, hence the reversal of the decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/dec/18/bbc.radio|title=Radio 1 censors Christmas standard|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=2007-12-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7150693.stm|title=Radio 1 backs down in Pogues row|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the song's [[Sadomasochism|subject matter]] was deemed too inappropriate for airplay pre-watershed, BBC Radio 1 played an edited version of [[Rihanna]]'s song "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]" during the daytime hours, and referred to the song using the alternate title "Come On". As Rihanna objected to the censorship of the song's title, the BBC later compromised by referring to the song as "S&amp;M (Come On)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657491/rihanna-s-and-m-renamed.jhtml|title=Rihanna's 'S&amp;M' Renamed Again By BBC Radio|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=2011-08-02|work=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/music/854875-rihannas-s-m-outrage-exposed-as-pr-stunt|title=BBC Radio 1 ban 'S&amp;M' from daytime radio|date=2011-07-02|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reasons, Ofcom deemed the song's music video to be unfit for broadcast pre-watershed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the 2013 death of former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], "[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]" from the film [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|''The Wizard of Oz'']] reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart, as the result of a social media campaign celebrating the death of the controversial PM. BBC Radio 1 did not play the full song during ''[[The Official Chart]]'' programme, and instead played a short snippet accompanied by a ''[[Newsbeat]]'' report about the campaign. The action led to complaints that the BBC were deliberately censoring the song due to its negativity in this context, noting that "[[I'm in Love with Margaret Thatcher]]" (which also charted, albeit lower, as part of a campaign to counter the aforementioned "Witch" campaign)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title="I'm In Love with Margaret Thatcher" anthem aiming to rival 'witch' song in charts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/9990386/Im-In-Love-with-Margaret-Thatcher-anthem-aiming-to-rival-witch-song-in-charts.html|work=Daily Telegraph|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was played in full earlier in the show.

"[[Liar Liar GE2017]]", a song released during the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]] that is critical of prime minister [[Theresa May]], was not played by British radio stations due to broadcasting regulations in force during electoral campaigns, which forbid political advertising and require impartial coverage.&lt;ref name="wp-liarliar"&gt;{{cite web|date=31 May 2017|last=Taylor|first=Adam|title=A song that calls Britain’s Theresa May a liar is climbing the charts — but it isn’t being played on the radio|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/31/a-song-that-calls-britains-theresa-may-a-liar-is-climbing-the-charts-but-it-isnt-being-played-on-the-radio/|website=Washington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611100420/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/31/a-song-that-calls-britains-theresa-may-a-liar-is-climbing-the-charts-but-it-isnt-being-played-on-the-radio/|archive-date=11 June 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the suppression, the song still managed to reach #4 on the UK Singles Chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/40129621/theresa-may-protest-track-liar-liar-ge2017-number-four-on-official-singles-chart|title=Theresa May protest track, Liar Liar GE2017, number four on Official Singles Chart|date=2017-02-06|website=BBC Newsbeat|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC), founded by [[Tipper Gore]], published the "Filthy Fifteen"—a list of fifteen songs it deemed to be the most objectionable due to their references to drugs and alcohol, sexual acts, violence, or "[[occult]]" activities.&lt;ref name="NPR-pal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/pmrcs-filthy-15-where-are-they-now-20150917|title=PMRC's 'Filthy 15': Where Are They Now?|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group pushed for the adoption of a [[Content rating|ratings system]], and for lyrics to be printed on the back covers of albums so they could be previewed by parents.&lt;ref name="NPR-pal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) opposed these proposals; during a [[United States Senate|Senate]] hearing on the matter in September, musicians such as [[John Denver]] and [[Frank Zappa]] argued that such guidelines would inhibit [[free expression]]. Zappa, in particular, argued that the PMRC's proposal for a method to "assist baffled parents in the determination of the 'suitability' of records listened to by 'very young children'" would reduce American music to "the intellectual level of a [[Saturday morning cartoon]]".&lt;ref name="NPR-pal" /&gt;

Following the hearings, the RIAA introduced a standard [[Parental Advisory]] label (which took its current form, reading "Parental Advisory — Explicit Content", in 1994 following subsequent hearings), which is designed to be applied to the cover art of songs and albums which may contain objectionable content; the RIAA recommends that it be used on releases containing "strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse to such an extent as to merit parental notification." The Parental Advisory label is a voluntary scheme; some retailers—particularly [[Walmart]]—adopted policies to enforce the label program by not stocking music releases which carried it.&lt;ref name="Program"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/toolsforparents.php?content_selector=parental_advisory|title=Parental Advisory Label ("PAL") Program|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=July 5, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701220958/http://riaa.com/toolsforparents.php?content_selector=parental_advisory|archivedate=July 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR-pal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/10/29/130905176/you-ask-we-answer-parental-advisory---why-when-how|title=You Ask, We Answer: 'Parental Advisory' Labels — The Criteria And The History|last=Cole|first=Tom|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 2004 during the MTV-produced [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime-show controversy|Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]] (which was televised by its corporate sister [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]), [[Janet Jackson]]'s breast was exposed by [[Justin Timberlake]] at the conclusion of the show, in an apparent "[[wardrobe malfunction]]".&lt;ref name="rs-ripples"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/nipple-ripples-10-years-of-fallout-from-janet-jacksons-halftime-show-20140130|title=Nipple Ripples: Revisiting Janet Jackson's Wardrobe Malfunction|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the show, as well as other recent incidents surrounding [[fleeting expletive|unexpected use of profanities]] by those appearing on live television programs (referred to as a "fleeting expletive"), the FCC launched a major crackdown against indecent material broadcast on terrestrial radio and television stations.

===Iran===
[[File:Googoosh in concert.jpg|thumb]]
Although music has been big element when it comes to the pre-Islamic cultures of Iran it became confined in courts or performed by street artists after Iran spread. Music played a large role in the lives of Islamic people. However, they were eventually told they must do without it. In fact it got to the point where music was entirely eliminated meaning no concerts were allowed of any kind and musical instruments were to be destroyed back in the late 70’s. Iran’s reason for eliminating music was because it was believed to be betraying their country and its youth. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leone|first=Massimo|date=November 2012|title=My schoolmate: protest music in present-day Iran|url=http://ky5ry5jk2j.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=My+Schoolmate%3A+Protest+Music+in+Present-Day+Iran&amp;rft.jtitle=Critical+Discourse+Studies&amp;rft.au=Leone%2C+Massimo&amp;rft.date=2012&amp;rft.issn=1740-5904&amp;rft.eissn=1740-5912&amp;rft.volume=9&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=347&amp;rft.externalDocID=R04953625&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=My schoolmate: protest music in present-day Iran|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hemmasi|first=Farzaneh|date=Winter 2013|title=Intimating Dissent: Popular Song, Poetry, and Politics in Pre-Revolutionary Iran|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/ethnomusicology.57.1.0057|journal=Intimating Dissent: Popular Song, Poetry, and Politics in Pre-Revolutionary Iran|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nencatacoa''' or '''Nem-catacoa''' was the [[deity|god]] and protector of the mantle makers, artists and festivities in the [[Muisca religion and mythology|religion of the Muisca]].&lt;ref name=p57/&gt; The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and their [[Muisca Confederation|confederation]] were one of the four advanced civilizations of the Americas; as much as the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Mayas]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]] but other than the other three, they did not construct grand architecture. Their gold working however was well-known and respected which made Nencatacoa an important deity and protector.&lt;ref name=p57/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:BOG 04 2012 Museo de Oro 1177.JPG|thumb|260px|left|Golden mask in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ritual gold mask&lt;/small&gt;]]
Nencatacoa was represented in the form of a forest animal, made of gold and covered with a mantle. Nencatacoa looked most like a fox or a bear,&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/nencatacoa.html Description Nencatacoa] – Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt; because as [[Pedro Simón]] noted, "an animal in that shape would appear multiple times".&lt;ref name=p57/&gt;

He was the protector god of the weavers, an industry that was very important among the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], who used a great variety of materials but mostly cotton and [[fique]].&lt;ref name=p57/&gt;
[[File:Totuma con chicha.png|thumb|right|260px|''[[Chicha]]''; alcoholic drink from fermented maize, main ingredient of the festivities around '''Nencatacoa''']]
Nencatacoa was also the protector of artists and painters who realized their beautiful creations on the cloths, the [[Muisca economy#Ceramics|ceramics]], [[Muisca economy#Gold|gold metallurgy]], [[sculptures]] and [[petroglyph]]s with different [[anthropomorphic]], [[zoomorphic]] and [[ideogram]]atic figures.&lt;ref name=p58&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch. 9, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Nencatacoa was the god of festivities, drunkenness and dance. Traditions tell us that he partied with the people without caring about anything else. The Muisca drank ''[[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]]'', a type of alcoholic drink based on the fermentation and cooking of maize. When the indigenous peoples were constructing their houses he helped them with lifting the heavy poles. Even during the construction of their houses (''bohíos'') and temples, the Muisca drank a lot of chicha.&lt;ref name=p58/&gt;

Also to celebrate the completion of temples, houses or roads and with the arrival of new ''[[cacique]]s'' the Muisca drank a lot of ''chicha''. At times of sowing and harvest, they celebrated with dancing, singing, music (with drums and flutes) and honoured the gods, in particular Nencatacoa.&lt;ref name=p60&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch. 9, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Nencatacoa thus appeared to be similar in style and association to the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] god [[Dionysus]] and the [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[Bacchus]]. [[List of Muisca scholars|Chronicler]] Pedro Simón described about the Muisca that when they were partying and dancing around the fire and the wind blew that was a sign that Nencatacoa was participating.&lt;ref name=p60/&gt;

[[Image:People's Architect of the USSR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''People's Architect of the USSR'' medal]]
'''People's Architect of the USSR''' ({{lang-ru|Народный архитектор СССР}}), also sometimes translated as '''National Architect of the USSR''', was an honorary title granted to [[architect]]s of the [[Soviet Union]]; it was established on August 12, 1967 by [[Leonid Brezhnev]].
It was bestowed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR owing proposals addressed by the ''State Construction Committee'' or by the ''Soviet Architects' Union''.  The [[Supreme Soviet]] could possibly refuse these designations.

A diploma of the [[Supreme Soviet]]'s presidency was given to those who were appointed ''People's Architect of the USSR''  jointly with the medal and its concerning certificate.
The title was bestowed to architects who had achieved stunning results in Soviet [[architecture]]'s development either applying their expertise and creativity to the [[urban planning]] or to the design of important building compounds for civil, industrial or rural use.

Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1990), by a decree of the [[Russian presidency]], it was created the new title of ''[[Honorary titles of the Russian Federation|Meritorious Architect of the Russian Federation]]''.

== Design ==
The medal was made of [[tombac]] and its shape was quadrangular (22,5 x 23,5&amp;nbsp;mm) with twisted corners. 
The central part was occupied by the inscription "Народный архитектор СССР" (''People's Architect of the USSR'') and, below, the [[hammer and sickle]] symbol. 
Symbol and inscription and were embossed, with convex letters. The medal was suspended to a single red silk fringe (18&amp;nbsp;mm × 21&amp;nbsp;mm) to whom it was attached by a metallic buckle decorated with [[bay laurel]] leaves.

'''Polo''' is a municipality of the [[Barahona Province]] in southwestern [[Dominican Republic]], known for its green and high mountains and for growing fine coffee.

The small town of Polo is also known for having '''El Polo Magnético''' (the magnetic pole), an area on a mountain near the village. If a car is stopped at the right place, and put in neutral, the car seems to be rolling up the hill. This is type of [[optical illusion]] known as a [[gravity hill]] which is caused by the shape of the slope and the surrounding landscape.

'''Rosicrucian Park''' is the headquarters of the English Grand Lodge for the Americas of the [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]], located in [[San Jose, California]].

==History==
The Rosicrucian Park was established in 1927 by [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]]. It grew from one single lot to a 5-acre city block.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Singh, [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.12.02/rosicrucian-0237.html Ring Around the Rosy Cross], ''Metroactive.com'', 9 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]] was built in 1932, the Planetarium in 1936, the research library opened in June 1939. The Akhenaton Shrine was built in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3012.html Rosicrucian Park], ''Us-history.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peace Garden was added to the park in 2004 and dedicated by [[Rosicrucian]] [[Imperator]] [[Christian Bernard]]. In 2013, a new Alchemy Museum was announced for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Singh, [http://www.metroactive.com/features/columns/Alchemy-Museum-Rosicrucian-Park.html Alchemy Museum Coming to Rosicrucian Park], ''Metroactive.com'', 22 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rosicrucianpark.org/alchemy-museum|title=New Rosicrucian Alchemy Museum|last=Rosicrucian Order|first=AMORC|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening ceremony for the preliminary exhibit in the Lecture Gallery of the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]] occurred during the Summer solstice of June 2015. The new museum in the former Rose-Croix University International building will include a working alchemy laboratory. The Alchemy garden in front of the new museum is composed of four elemental gardens representing the four elements.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Singh, [http://www.metroactive.com/features/columns/Alchemy-Museum-Rosicrucian-Egyptian-Museum.html Alchemy for You], ''Metroactive.com'', 1 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Singh, [http://www.metroactive.com/features/columns/Rosicrucian-alchemy-museum-garden.html Alchemy Garden Opens in San Jose], ''Metroactive.com'', 23 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2015, the Park reduced its water consumption by 4.5 million gallons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecologicalconcerns.com/rosicrucian-park-and-egyptian-museum-reduced-water-usage-by-4-5-million-gallons/ Rosicrucian Park and Egyptian Museum Reduced Water Usage by 4.5 Million Gallons], ''Ecologicalconcerns.com'', 16 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The park takes up nearly an entire city block and includes the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]], the administration building for the Order, the Rosicrucian Planetarium, the Rosicrucian Peace Garden, the Rosicrucian Research Library, the Grand Temple, and a central fountain plaza and gardens. A [[rose]] garden is incorporated in the Park next to the Research Library. A [[Metasequoia glyptostroboides|dawn redwood]] grows outside of the Rosicrucian Research Library as a memorial to [[Harvey Spencer Lewis|H. Spencer Lewis]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Clara|date=March 1980|title=Tree from the Dawn of Time|url=|journal=Rosicrucian Digest|volume=58 March 1980|pages=22-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was planted in 1950 from a seedling from the lot brought from China by Dr. Ralph Chaney,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1951|title=Temple Echoes|url=|journal=Rosicrucian Digest|volume=Vol 29 #5|pages=180|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and donated by an unnamed donor to H. Spencer Lewis's widow for this purpose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The park also includes the Akhenaten Shrine (named for the [[18th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]]), which contains the ashes of AMORC founder [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]] and other former officials of the order.

With the exception of the planetarium, all buildings in Rosicrucian Park were constructed with exteriors inspired by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian architectural tradition. In tribute to their claimed Egyptian heritage, [[cyperus papyrus]] plants are also incorporated into the landscaping.

The '''Russian geoglyph''' refers to a [[geoglyph]] on slopes of the [[Zyuratkul National Park|Zyuratkul Mountains]] in the [[Chelyabinsk]] region in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="Janus"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/49389775/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.UHqQb1Ea6Xn Janus, Owen., Mysterious elk-shaped structure discovered in Russia Huge geoglyph may predate Peru's famous Nazca Lines by thousands of years, Live Science on NBC News, 2012-10-12.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BPCNtomB?url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/49389775/ns/technology_and_science-science/ |date=October 14, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and discovery==

The geoglyph depicts accurate contours of an animal similar to an [[elk]] or [[moose]], with four legs, two [[antler]]s and a long [[snout]]. It may also have had a [[tail]], however this has now been obscured. It was first detected in 2011 by [[Alexander Shestakov]] using [[satellite imagery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2820317/World-s-oldest-geoglyph-CHILDREN-Enormous-moose-symbol-visible-space-built-6-000-years-ago-using-tiny-tools.html |title=World's oldest geoglyph was made by CHILDREN: Enormous moose symbol visible from space was built 6,000 years ago using tiny tools |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |first=Will |last=Stewart |date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notified researchers who surveyed the outline using a [[paraglider]] and [[seaplane]]. Research has continued into the site under [[Stanislav Grigoriev]] from the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] Institute of History and Archaeology. Grigoriev published an article with [[Nikolai Menshenin]] from the State Centre for Monument Protection about the discovery in the ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' journal in spring 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/grigoriev331/ Grigoriev, Stanislav, A. &amp; Menshenin, Nikolai M., Discovery of a geoglyph on the Zjuratkul Ridge in the southern Urals, Antiquity, Volume 086, Issue 331, March, 2012.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BPT1Os6J?url=http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/grigoriev331/ |date=October 14, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavation==

Excavations have unearthed stones laying {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} wide, precisely under the contour at a depth of {{convert|30|cm|in}} to {{convert|40|cm|in}}. The borders consist of large stones with a center filled with smaller ones. Builders of the object cut off a soil layer down to virgin clay and placed stones into this trench.&lt;ref name="Janus"/&gt;

The stones are now covered by a layer of patina with a dark shade. Earlier they were lighter and were perfectly visible from the ridge because the huge size of the drawing. It has a width of {{convert|195|m|ft}}, length of {{convert|218|m|ft}}, and a diagonal of {{convert|275|m|ft}}. Excavations in the summer of 2012 have revealed small walls and remains of what are thought to be passageways on the areas around the [[hoof]] and [[snout]] of the animal. Grigoriev remarked that ''"the hoof is made of small crushed stones and clay. It seems to me there were very low walls and narrow passages among them. The same situation in the area of a muzzle: crushed stones and clay, four small broad walls and three passages."'' The geolyph is thought to have been created by a ''"[[megalith]]ic culture"'' operating in the area during the past and connected with other [[Megaliths in the Urals]] and on Vera Island. In the period of its creation the soil layer was only {{convert|10|cm|in}}, and today it is {{convert|40|cm|in}} to {{convert|50|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="Janus"/&gt;

==Dating==

Grigoriev has found over forty stone tools resembling [[pickaxe]]s during recent excavations that Grigoriev suggests show a style of [[Lithic reduction]] dating to the [[Neolithic]] or [[Chalcolithic]] periods between 4000 and 2000 BCE. Further accuracy regarding the dating of the geoglyph is hoped to be obtained from an ongoing study using [[pollen core]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Janus"/&gt; This suggested dating would place the construction of the {{convert|900|ft|m}} geoglyph many centuries before that of the [[Nazca lines]] in [[Peru]], the [[Blythe geoglyphs]] in [[California]] and several in [[England]], making it one of the oldest examples of [[land art]] in the world.&lt;ref name="Janus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skynews.com.au/offbeat/article.aspx?id=805328 Sky News Australia, Russian geoglyph may be older than 500BC, 2012-10-13.] ( {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BP4VUIdj?url=http://www.skynews.com.au/offbeat/article.aspx?id=805328 |date=October 14, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Russian postmodernism''' refers to the [[culture|cultural]], [[art|artistic]], and [[philosophy|philosophical]] condition in [[Russia]] since the downfall of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[dialectical materialism]].  With respect to statements about post-Soviet philosophy or [[sociology]], the term is primarily used by non-Russians to describe the state of [[economic]] and [[political]] uncertainty they observe since the fall of [[communism]] and the way this uncertainty affects Russian identity.  'Postmodernism' is, however, a term often used by Russian [[literary criticism|critics]] to describe contemporary Russian art and [[Russian literature|literature]].

==Artistic origins==
In art, [[postmodernism]] entered the Soviet Union in the 1960s after the end of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] move toward liberalization with the advent of the [[Russian Conceptualism|Russian conceptualist]] movement.  Beginning as an underground political-artistic move against the use of [[Socialist realism]] as a method of social control and becoming a full-fledged movement with the [[Moscow Conceptualists]], Russian conceptualism used the [[symbol]]ism of Socialist realism against the Soviet government.

'''Slanguage''' is an exhibition space and [[artist collective]] in [[Wilmington, Los Angeles]], [[California]] founded by Mario Ybarra and Karla Diaz in 2002. Slanguage works with community artists, [[curator]]s and [[historian]]s on projects and workshops. Slanguage describes its art-making practice as a "three pronged approach" including "education, community-building, and interactive exhibitions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slanguagestudio.com/about/|title=About »  Slanguage Studio|website=slanguagestudio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slanguage divides its space between experiments with media and ideas, and public performances and exhibitions. ''[[The New York Times]]'' cited Slanguage as an example of an "ever more important" type of exhibition space that provides a forum for work "uncongenial to an increasingly conservative art establishment" and for the work of students graduating from art schools "in numbers the commercial gallery system cannot begin to absorb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/arts/art-architecture-doing-their-own-thing-making-art-together.html|title=ART/ARCHITECTURE; Doing Their Own Thing, Making Art Together|first=Holland|last=Cotter|date=7 June 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September through November, 2009, Slanguage was the resident artist group with [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], as part of MOCA's Engagement Party program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130818033130/http://sites.moca.org/party/2013/01/09/slanguage/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/slanguage-at-engagement-party/|title=SLANGUAGE at Engagement Party - Announcements - e-flux|website=www.e-flux.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Slanguage projects include Sweeney Tate, a 2007 art installation at [[Tate Modern]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tateshots-sweeney-tate|title=TateShots: Sweeney Tate - Tate|website=www.tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Peacock Doesn’t See Its Own Ass/Let’s Twitch Again: Operation Bird Watching in London, for the [[Serpentine Gallery]]'s Uncertain States of America exhibition in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2006/08/uncertain_states_of_america_9.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904001948/http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2006/08/uncertain_states_of_america_9.html |archive-date=2013-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slanguagestudio.com/projects/|title=Projects Slanguage Studio|website=slanguagestudio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Symphony of Science''' is a music project created by [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]-based [[electronic musician]] John D. Boswell. The project seeks to "spread scientific knowledge and philosophy through musical remixes."  Boswell uses  [[pitch correction|pitch-corrected]] audio and video samples from television programs featuring popular scientists and educators. The audio and video clips are mixed into [[mashup (digital)|digital mashup]]s and scored with Boswell's original compositions. Two of Boswell's music videos, "A Glorious Dawn" and "We are All Connected", feature appearances from [[Carl Sagan]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Bill Nye]], and [[Stephen Hawking]]. The audio and video is sampled from popular science television shows including ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'', ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]'', ''[[The Eyes of Nye]]'', ''[[The Elegant Universe]]'', and ''[[Stephen Hawking's Universe]]''.

[[Unruly Media]], a video tracking service, first charted "A Glorious Dawn" on September 21, 2009. A month later, the video had received more than a million views and was ranked in the music category on [[YouTube]] as one of the top rated videos of all time.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  On November 9, 2009, [[Third Man Records]] released a [[7-inch]] single of "A Glorious Dawn" for the 75th anniversary of the birth of Carl Sagan.

==John D. Boswell==
Composer John Boswell had been experimenting with sampling and remixing for some time before creating his first YouTube videos. Boswell had worked with [[Auto-Tune]] in the past and thought people might be interested in hearing American astronomer Carl Sagan sing.  He first saw ''Cosmos'' in 2004 and soon after bought the set of DVDs. Boswell looked through these episodes for "profound quotes" that lacked music in the background.  Once he found these quotes, Boswell Auto-Tuned Sagan's voice and picked from the best ones.  After completing what became "A Glorious Dawn", Boswell posted the video on YouTube in September 2009 and to his surprise, the video went viral within a week.&lt;ref name="GWC"&gt;{{cite podcast |url =http://www.galacticawatercooler.com/2009/10/24/gwc-podcast-191/ |title = GWC Podcast #191 |website=Galactic Watercooler |date = 2009-10-24 |accessdate = October 25, 2009}} Interview with John Boswell.

John Boswell attended [[Gonzaga Preparatory School]]&lt;ref name="Sowa" /&gt; and graduated from college with a degree in economics. Soon after, Boswell started Colorpulse, an [[electronica]] music project, and began to focus on production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symphonyofscience.com/about.html |title=About |last=Boswell |first=John |work=The Symphony of Science - Spreading scientific knowledge and philosophy through music |accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He released an album in 2010, titled ''Escaping the Tangle'', which included some of these productions. Boswell lives in [[Bellingham, Washington]].&lt;ref name="Sowa" /&gt;  His current music project, Symphony of Science, "aims to spread scientific knowledge and philosophy through musical remixes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/melodysheep |title=Melodysheep |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to "deliver scientific knowledge and philosophy in musical form".&lt;ref name="sos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symphonyofscience.com |title=Spreading scientific knowledge and philosophy through music |publisher=The Symphony of Science |date= |accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his first few videos, Boswell began seeking permission to use the clips he uses in his project.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In addition to Symphony of Science, Boswell is also working on a project called ''Remixes for the Soul'', which he works on, in addition to Symphony of Science, under the moniker of melodysheep.

{{quote|An anomaly of gravity so strange. Nothing is more seductive.

There are monsters out in the cosmos that can swallow entire stars. That can destroy space itself completely invisible. Anything that strays too close will be pulled in millions and millions of black holes zipping around our galaxy, nothing there to light them up. Millions and millions of black holes zipping around our galaxy, nothing there to light them up.&lt;ref name="sos" /&gt;}}

==Reviews==
Musician [[Carrie Brownstein]] found the idea behind Symphony of Science "quite beautiful and amazing in both its sincerity and aims". She also enjoyed the "hip-hop stylings" of the camera angle on Bill Nye while he is moving his hands around and expressing himself on "We Are All Connected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2009/10/the_symphony_of_science.html |title=The Symphony Of Science |last=Brownstein |first=Carrie |authorlink=Carrie Brownstein |date=2009-10-20 |work= |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |accessdate=2009-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Nick Sagan]], son of Carl Sagan, was impressed with "A Glorious Dawn", giving it a favorable review and stamp of approval. Sagan writes, "John Boswell over at Colorpulse Music is a mad genius, sampling both ''Cosmos'' and Stephen Hawking's ''Universe'' series into three minutes and thirty-four seconds of pure, concentrated awesomeness... Love it, love it, love it. Dad would have loved it, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicksagan.blogs.com/nick_sagan_online/2009/09/a-glorious-dawn.html |title=A Glorious Dawn |last=Sagan |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Sagan |date=2009-09-25 |work= |publisher=Nick Sagan Online |accessdate=2009-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columnist Franklin Harris argues that Boswell's videos show that science can arouse the minds of artists just as much as religion and mythology have in the past. Harris calls the videos "art for the Information Age, inspired by science".&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Gap between art, science no longer so wide |last=Harris |first=Franklin |newspaper=[[The Decatur Daily]] |date=2009-10-22 |url=http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20091022/ARTICLES/910225006/1006 |publisher=Tennessee Valley Printing Company }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tang dynasty tomb figures''' are pottery figures of people and animals made in the [[Tang dynasty]] of China (618–906) as [[grave good]]s to be placed in tombs.  There was a belief that the figures represented would become available for the service of the deceased in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 24, 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are made of [[Molding (process)|moulded]] [[earthenware]] with colour generally being added, though often not over the whole figure, or in naturalistic places.  Where the colouring was in paint it has often not survived, but in many cases it was in ''[[sancai]]'' ("three-colour") [[ceramic glaze]], which has generally lasted well.

The figures, called ''mingqui'' in Chinese, were most often of servants, soldiers (in male tombs) and attendants such as dancers and musicians, with many no doubt representing [[courtesan]]s. In burials of people of high rank there may be soldiers and officials as well. The animals are most often horses, but there are surprising numbers of both [[Bactrian camel]]s and their [[Central Asian]] drivers, distinguished by thick beards and hair, and their facial features.  The depictions are [[realism (arts)|realistic]] to a degree unprecedented in [[Chinese art]],&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 78&lt;/ref&gt; and the figures give archaeologists much useful information about life under the Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 80; Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also figures of the imaginary monster "earth spirits" and the fearsome human [[Lokapala]] (or ''tian wang''), both usually in pairs and acting as tomb guardians to repel attacks by both spirits and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 78–79; Tang, 46–63&lt;/ref&gt;   Sets of the twelve imaginary beasts of the [[Chinese Zodiac]] are also found, usually unglazed.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 62; Michaelson, 102–103&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures represent a development of earlier traditions of Chinese tomb figures,&lt;ref&gt;Colburn Clydesdale&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Tang elaborate glazed figures are restricted to north China, very largely to the areas around the capitals.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, 133&lt;/ref&gt; They "virtually disappear" from 755 when the highly disruptive [[An Lushan Rebellion]] began,&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 26&lt;/ref&gt; which probably affected the kilns in [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] making the pieces as well as their elite clientele.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 81&lt;/ref&gt;  A much diminished tradition continued in later dynasties until the Ming.  The use of ''sancai'' glazing on figures was restricted to the upper classes,&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 78&lt;/ref&gt; and production was controlled by the imperial bureaucracy,&lt;ref&gt;McGregor&lt;/ref&gt; but a single burial of a member of the imperial family might contain many hundreds of figures.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and meaning ==
A thousand years before the Tang figures, the [[Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng]] (d. about 433 BC) contained the bodies of 22 musicians, as well as the instruments they played.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Traces of wooden figures wearing textiles are known from similar dates, and the First Emperor's [[Terracotta Army]] is famous;&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 32–42&lt;/ref&gt; his funeral also involved the killing and burial of many servants and animals, including all his childless concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 36&lt;/ref&gt; The excavated [[Han dynasty]] tombs we know about contained bronze or pottery figures of horses,&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 47–48; Watson (1973), 110, 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; and often groups of soldiers, well below life-size, in the tombs of commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 24, 44–46; Watson (1973), 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;  Lower down the social scale, pottery models of houses and animals were very common, and continued into the Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 117, 121; Colburn Clydesdale&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of the short-lived but effective [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618), the pattern of Tang tomb figures was essentially established, though the [[polychromy]] of ''sancai'' colours did not appear until the Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 136; Tang, 16–22, 46&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Xian 2006 6-5.jpg|thumb|[[Lokapala]] guardian figure]]

The size and number of the figures in a grave depended on the rank of the deceased, as did the number that were glazed.  Servants and farm animals were often glazed, painted or [[slip-painting|slip-painted]] white, or brown in the case of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 78–79; Tang, 46–63&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures were paraded on carts as part of the funeral procession.  They were then lined up outside the tomb before the coffin was taken inside. Once this was in place they were taken inside the tomb and arranged in the tomb, often along the sloping access way to the underground burial chamber, or in an ante-chamber to it.  In large tombs there were niches built into the tomb walls for them to occupy.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recent years most pieces came from excavations that were not done by archaeologists and knowledge of the context of pieces was lacking. The important tomb of the Tang Princess [[Li Xianhui]] (or Yongtai) from 705 was discovered in 1960 in the imperial [[Qianling Mausoleum]] complex, and professionally excavated from 1964, the first of a number of excavations of major tombs, though others have been left deliberately undisturbed.  It had been robbed in the past, probably soon after the burial, and items in precious materials taken, but the thieves had not bothered with the 777 unglazed and painted and around 60 glazed tomb figures (now mostly [[Shaanxi History Museum]]).  These were mostly in "solid ranks" in stepped niches off the long sloping entrance way.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 136–137; on other tombs, Hay, throughout, especially 19–35. His fig. 24 shows a niche as found, with its figures.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grand tombs were conceived as "a personalized paradise mirroring the best aspects of the earthly world", approached by a [[spirit road]] with stone statues, and ministered to by priests in temples and altars around the mound.&lt;ref&gt;Eckfield, "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Underground, they also contained extensive frescos with painted representations of the same types of figure as the pottery, and the images in the two media worked together to recreate a palace geography evoking the residence and lifestyle of the deceased before death.  The entrance ramp recreated the approach to a grand palace, the sections with frescos and figure niches reflecting the various enclosures and courtyards of the sprawling palace complexes of Tang royalty. Niches with horses and grooms were nearer the entrance than those with musicians and court ladies; niches were typically flanked by frescos of attendants in charge of that area.  This was imagined as much from the tomb chamber outwards as from the tomb entrance inwards; despite Chinese concepts of Hell and paradise, the spirit of the deceased was believed to continue to inhabit and roam the tomb, and the intention was to provide suitable facilities of all kinds.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, throughout; Eckfield, throughout, concentrating on the mural programmes&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, within tomb complexes such as the Qianling Mausoleum complex, visits by the deceased to the neighbouring tombs of the imperial family, accompanied by huge processions, were envisaged, and saddled pottery horses stood waiting for the entourage, for visits or hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, 46–49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

The size of figures varies considerably, from about 10 to 110 centimetres high for a standing human figure, and about 55 to 120 or more for the largest types, the beasts and guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60; Grove: "Earthenware figures, varying in height from c. 150&amp;nbsp;mm to c. 1.5 m", but 12&amp;nbsp;cm is a common height&lt;/ref&gt;  Different scales of figures were usually mixed within tombs, depending on the status of the people or animals depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 79&lt;/ref&gt; There is some indication that glazed and unglazed figures may have been made at different kilns.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 45&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures are low-fired earthenware, since strength and durability were not required. The clay body fires to a "whitish" colour, except for a smaller group of less fine reddish pieces, normally covered in white [[slip (pottery)|slip]].&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 46, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures are moulded, usually from several pieces, with the head always made separately, and the larger animals in the most parts.  The various pieces were [[luting|luted]] together before firing, with the opportunity taken to vary identical figures by joining the heads at slightly different angles.  The clay was often worked by hand, luting on small extra details and textures, and sometimes working on the surface with tools.  In earlier figures a joint line running up the side of the body can often be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 45–46; Medley, 77–78; Vainker, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  The two types of guardian figures For an unknown reason, the heads of horses either face straight ahead or turn to the left; they  almost never turn to the right.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

When the clay work was complete, a white [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] was applied all over, then any glaze was added to the figure before firing. Smaller figures might have a clear or slightly yellow glaze, and in larger ones the glaze was often kept off the face and hands, which were painted after firing.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Sui and early Tang figures, before ''sancai'' was used, normally have the transparent glaze.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 46&lt;/ref&gt;  The application of the coloured glazes can be very variable; in many pieces the colours are carefully applied to different parts of the figures, but in others "they have been splashed on without regard for design or contour".&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[cobalt]] blue was added to the ''sancai'' palette during the period, and at least one horse is partly coloured blue.&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 80; Vainker, 80, [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=257839&amp;partId=1 British Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some figures had elements in wood, such as weapons, [[polo]]-sticks, or rope halters for horses and camels, which have not survived.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 163.jpg|thumb|Group of fashionably-dressed female attendants]]
The best period for the figures lasted only about 50 years, to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] of 755, a period of innovation, unprecedented realism and an interest in showing [[psychology|psychological types]] in several media for [[Chinese art]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1974), 70–76; McGregor&lt;/ref&gt; The figures share with Buddhist monumental sculpture of the period conventions, derived from further west, that show "appropriate detail of muscle which yet departs from reality at many points". The horse figures reflect the same ideal as seen in contemporary paintings, and it is uncertain in which medium the type first arose.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1974), 75–76, 76 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

With exception of the Zodiac figures, which were also the only type to increase in popularity after the Tang, the figures are "more closely related to the metropolitan and Buddhist attitudes than to the magical aspects of rural beliefs and a pattern of behaviour governed by superstitions or shamanistic beliefs of the local farming communities", which partly accounts for their failure to return after the 750s,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 62–63, 63 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; along with a preference for new types of grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of figures ==
The group of 13 [[Tang dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun]], a general who died in 728, represent a fine group of the usual major figures, all in ''sancai''. There are four tomb guardians, and pairs of officials (these are all on a similar scale), horses and camels, plus three grooms, this group on a considerably smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=227685&amp;partId=1 BM collection database, see curator's note]; McGregor&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
The earliest figures, from the 7th century, are "rather simple and less well-executed than later ones".&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;  The women are tall and slim, whereas by the mid-8th century a plumper figure had become the norm, with faces that are "fat, heavily brooding and vacuous".&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 46–48 (48 quoted); Grove&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this change in taste was provoked by the famous imperial concubine [[Yang Guifei]], who had a full figure, although it seems to begin by about 725,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 47; Michaelson, 61–62, 70&lt;/ref&gt; when she was a child.

There may be groups of women as dancers or small seated orchestras of musicians, and some sitting figures appear to be beautifying themselves.  More rarely, there are female riders and [[polo]] players, wearing male dress, which was usual for Tang women when riding, and apparently a fashion in the capital on other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 49–51; Michaelson, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;  The period was one of unusual freedom for well-off women in China, and the figures reflect this.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 46–51; Michaelson, 59–60, 70–73, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Men ===
Tang society, at least in [[Chang'an]], the capital,&lt;ref&gt;[[Luoyang]] was capital for 684–705&lt;/ref&gt; was very cosmopolitan, and drew much of its prosperity from the [[Silk Road]].  Foreigners from further west seem to have been common as servants, in particular as grooms for horses and drivers of the camels which were the main form of transport on the overland Silk Road. Tang art liked to depict foreign figures, usually men, with standard characteristics for their faces and dress; [[Persia]]n and [[Sogdia]]n types can be distinguished, both with big bushy beards, and often fierce and vigorous expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 51–56; Michaelson, 79–82, 86–87; Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  Such figures sometimes contain clear elements of [[caricature]].&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Male figures are often given more varied and active poses, and worked in more detail than those of women, but are harder to date as the changes in women's costume were not matched in male fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 55&lt;/ref&gt; As well as many types of servants there are military officers in armour, officials, and sometimes foreign ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 51–55&lt;/ref&gt;  The function of the officials is to present the case for the deceased to the fierce [[Yama (East Asia)|judge of the afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Animals ===
[[File:Tang Kamel mit Führer Museum Rietberg RCH 516.jpg|thumb|Loaded camel with rider, in this case Chinese]]
The most common animals, and the most likely to be large and carefully modelled and decorated, are horses and camels.  Both sorts range from animals without harness and saddlery to those with elaborately detailed trappings, and carrying riders or, in the case of camels, heavy loads of goods. At least two famous camels carry a small human orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 58–59; [[:File:Sancai musicians on camel, front.jpg|example]], [[:File:Sancai musicians on camel, side.jpg|another view]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dogs and farm animals, apart from some bulls at up to about 30&amp;nbsp;cm high, are more likely to be small and unglazed.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with guardian figures and officials, statues of horses are the main type of tomb figure that is also known in other media, such as [[gilt-bronze]] or stone, and some rich tombs also contain such figures in metal.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 57–58; Michaelson, 47–48 for a Han example&lt;/ref&gt;  The camels may sometimes belong to tombs of people rich from trade,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 58&lt;/ref&gt; but also seem to have been associated with wealth generally.  They are often shown with heads raised and their mouths open, and in the finest models the shaggy areas at the neck and top of the legs are carefully textured in the clay.  The horses are the "[[heavenly horses]]" from [[Ferghana]] in the west, which under the Tang dynasty were more common in China and ceased to be a highly prized rarity.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;  These were also made in pottery under the [[Han dynasty]]; the Tang examples are more realistic,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 56&lt;/ref&gt; if perhaps less expressive.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Tomb guardians ===
[[File:Zhenmushou 02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Unglazed face of an earth spirit of the semi-human type]]
Four tomb guardians were standard in rich tombs, typically one at each corner: a pair each of "earth spirits" or ''zhenmushou'', and the ''[[lokapala]]'' or ''zhenmuyong'' warrior guardians.  The figures are typically the largest and most elaborate in a tomb, and must often have been much the most difficult to model and fire. They are more likely to be glazed in ''sancai'', although many very elaborately made examples are not.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60; Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures may have been believed to protect the living by keeping the spirits of the dead from inappropriately roaming the world outside the tomb, as well as protecting the tomb from intrusions by robbers or spirits;&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; the earth spirits were apparently associated with the first role, and the ''lokapala'' with the second.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60; Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''lokapala'' was also found above ground in Buddhist temples, in stone or wood.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to represent a merger of traditional [[Daoist]] guardians, dating back to the [[Han dynasty]], and the Buddhist ''[[dvarapala]]'' or "Heavenly Kings", of which there were in theory four, though often only two were depicted in other Buddhist cultures.  These too were shown as "a fabulous crested semi-human being with bulging eyes, furiously gaping mouth and massive powerful arms and legs".&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60, quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Indian versions emphasized royal attributes, in China they were "transformed into dynamic idealized generals",&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 139–140, 139 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  with elaborate armour, often with added sprigged reliefs.

In the early part of the Tang their pose was less dramatic, standing with straight legs and holding a weapon (now usually lost) at rest. In the 8th century the elaborarate ''[[contrapposto]]'' poses were developed, typically with one foot higher than the other, as it rests on an animal or dwarfish conquered demon, and one arm held high, brandishing a weapon, while the other is bent and rests on the hip, in a pose combining fierceness and nonchalance.&lt;ref&gt;Grove; Tang, 60; Watson (1973), 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth spirits are still more fantastic, with animal bodies, often including wings sprouting from the tops of the forelegs. The heads are often different, with one semi-human and another perhaps based on a snarling lion.  Both have "horns and crests like flames or huge cockscombs",&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60&lt;/ref&gt; typically even larger in the lion-like type, while the semi-human type may have huge wide ears. Often the faces of the lion type are glazed, and the semi-human type not. Although mentioned in literature from the Han onwards, they only appear in art from the 6th century onwards,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60&lt;/ref&gt; apparently developing from masks worn in the "devil-clearing ceremony at the New Year.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 144&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also more conventional figures of snarling lions, relatively small and usually in '''[[sancai]]'' glaze.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Like the sets of zodiac figures, these continued after the Tang, which the elaborate "earth spirits" and ''[[lokapala]]'' did not.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60–62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting history ==
[[File:ShiErShengXiao Shaanxi History Museum.JPG|thumb|left|A set of [[Chinese Zodiac]] figures]]
Tang figures were not of much interest to traditional Chinese connoisseurs of pottery, and are still relatively little collected by Chinese collectors because they are made specifically for use in burials, and so considered unlucky;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 74&lt;/ref&gt; however they are popular exhibits in Chinese museums.  They became extremely popular with Western collectors from about the 1910s,&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1974), 74; Wang, 74–75; Reitlinger (1963), 18&lt;/ref&gt; especially figures of horses, partly because they harmonized well with modern Western art and decor.  By 1963, [[Gerald Reitlinger]] could write that "no [[Mayfair]] flat is complete without a T'ang camel".&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger (1963), 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Prices, which peaked at a top level of about £600 a figure in the early 1920s, fell in the 1930s and 40s, but rose sharply in the 1960s, with a record auction price in 1969 of £16,000 for a horse.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger (1963), 310–312; Reitlinger (1970), 429–431&lt;/ref&gt;

From about the late 1990s it was realized that there were large numbers of fakes on the market, and there was also an upsurge in new discoveries as construction in China boomed, and the market was hit by increased supply coinciding with a falling from fashion. For all these reasons, the figures have not shared in the huge increase in Chinese art prices since the 1990s, which has been driven by Chinese collectors.  The record price for a horse remains £3,740,000,&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 75, as of 2012&lt;/ref&gt; from a sale by the [[British Rail Pension Fund]] at [[Sotheby's]] in 1989. In 2002 the dealer who had sold this piece to the pension fund in the 1970s said that he thought that in 2002 it would be "lucky" to reach a price of £1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 75; [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/items-and-icons-chinese-art-1151571.html "Items and Icons: Chinese art"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 21 March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tendril perversion''', often referred to in context as simply '''perversion''', is a geometric phenomenon found in [[helix|helical]] structures such as plant [[tendril]]s, in which a helical structure forms that is divided into two sections of opposite [[chirality]], with a transition between the two in the middle.&lt;ref name=MacMillan2002/&gt; A similar phenomenon can often be observed in kinked helical cables such as [[telephone handset]] cords.&lt;ref name="LiuEtAl"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0093183| pmid = 24759785| title = Structural Transition from Helices to Hemihelices| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = e93183| year = 2014| last1 = Liu | first1 = J. | last2 = Huang | first2 = J. | last3 = Su | first3 = T. | last4 = Bertoldi | first4 = K. | last5 = Clarke | first5 = D. R. | pmc=3997338|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...993183L }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phenomenon was known to [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref name=Goriely2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/research/researchgroups/applied/siam/resources/SIAM_Day_2013_AGoriely_lecture.pdf|title=Inversion, Rotation, and Perversion in Mechanical Biology: From Microscopic Anisotropy to Macroscopic Chirality | author=Alain Goriely | date = 2013 | page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote in 1865,

{{cquote|
A tendril ... invariably becomes twisted in one part in one direction, and in another part in the opposite direction...
This curious and symmetrical structure has been noticed by several botanists, but has not been sufficiently
explained.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin, "On the movements and habits of climbing plants", ''Journal of the Linnean Society'', 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The term "tendril perversion" was coined by Goriely and Tabor in 1998 based on the word ''perversion'' found in the 19th Century science literature. "Perversion" is a transition from one chirality to another and was known to [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who attributed it to the [[topologist]] [[J. B. Listing]].&lt;ref name=Goriely2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise of Electricity and Magnetism|author=James Clerk Maxwell|year=1873|publisher=Clarendon Press|place=Oxford|page=|quote=The operation of passing from one system to the other is called by Listing, ''Perversion''. The reflection of an object in a mirror image is a perverted image of the object.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tendril perversion can be viewed as an example of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], in which the strained structure of the tendril adopts a [[minimum total potential energy principle|configuration of minimum energy]] while preserving zero overall twist.&lt;ref name="MacMillan2002" /&gt; 

Tendril perversion has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. Gerbode et al. have made experimental studies of the coiling of [[cucumber]] tendrils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1223304| pmid = 22936777| title = How the Cucumber Tendril Coils and Overwinds| journal = Science| volume = 337| issue = 6098| pages = 1087–91| year = 2012| last1 = Gerbode | first1 = S.

Generalized tendril perversions were put forward by Silva et al., to include perversions that can be intrinsically produced in elastic filaments, leading to a multiplicity of geometries and dynamical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Pedro E.

'''''The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs''''' (1876) is an epic poem of over 10,000 lines by [[William Morris]] that tells the tragic story, drawn from the [[Volsunga Saga]] and the [[Poetic Edda|Elder Edda]], of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] hero [[Sigmund]], his son [[Sigurd]] (the equivalent of Siegfried in the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring of the Nibelung]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Siegfried | encyclopedia=Collins English Dictionary | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/1578714/A_comparison_of_Wagners_RING_and_William_Morriss_SIGURD_THE_VOLSUNG_Chapter_1 | title=A Comparison of Richard Wagner's Der Ring Des Nibelungen and William Morris's Sigurd the Volsung | publisher=University of Leeds | year=1993 | accessdate=3 February 2013 | author=Ennis, Jane Susanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Sigurd's wife [[Gudrun]]. It sprang from a fascination with the Volsung legend that extended back twenty years to the author's youth, and had already resulted in several other literary and scholarly treatments of the story. It was Morris's own favorite of his poems, and was enthusiastically praised both by contemporary critics and by such figures as [[T. E. Lawrence]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].&lt;ref name="Henderson 1967 170"&gt;{{cite book |title=William Morris: His Life, Work and Friends |last=Henderson |first=Philip |year=1967 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn= |page=170 |accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen 1991 46"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Medievalism of Lawrence of Arabia |last=Allen |first=M.

== Synopsis ==

=== Book I: Sigmund ===
The poem opens with the marriage of king [[Völsung|Volsung]]'s daughter [[Signy]] to [[Siggeir]], king of the [[Goths]]. The bridal feast is interrupted by the arrival of a stranger, the god [[Odin]] in disguise, who drives a sword into a tree-trunk. Though everyone tries to draw the sword, Volsung's son [[Sigmund]] is the only man who can do it. The disappointed Siggeir takes his new wife home, inviting Volsung to visit him. When Volsung does so he is killed by Siggeir, and his sons are taken prisoner. While in captivity they are all killed by a wolf, apart from Sigmund who escapes into the forest. Signy sends Sigmund her two sons to help him in avenging their family, but Sigmund only accepts [[Sinfjötli|Sinfjotli]], the hardier of the two. Sigmund and Sinfjotli kill Siggeir and burn down his hall, then return to their ancestral home, the hall of the Volsungs. Sigmund marries [[Borghild]], while Sinfjotli goes abroad with Borghild's brother, quarrels with him, and kills him. On his return Sinfjotli is poisoned by Borghild, and she is turned out by Sigmund, who instead marries [[Hjördís|Hiordis]]. Sigmund is killed in battle, and the pregnant Hiordis is taken to live in the hall of King [[Yngvi and Alf|Elf]] in Denmark.

=== Book II: Regin ===
There she gives birth to [[Sigurd]]. Sigurd is raised by [[Regin]], a cunning old man, and when he grows to manhood he asks for a horse from King Elf. Elf bids him choose the one he likes best, and Sigurd takes the best horse, and names it [[Grani]]. Sigurd is now urged by Regin to attack [[Fafnir]], a dragon who guards a hoard of gold. This treasure is a curse to all who possess it. Fafnir, Regin says, was originally a human being; indeed, the dragon was Regin's brother and thus the gold rightfully belongs to Regin. He tries and fails to forge an adequate sword for Sigurd, but Sigurd produces the shattered fragments of Odin's sword, which he has inherited from Sigmund, and from these fragments Regin forges a mighty sword, named "[[Gram (mythology)|the Wrath]]" by Sigurd. Sigurd makes his way to Fafnir's lair, kills him, drinks his blood, and roasts and eats his heart. This gives him the power to understand the voices of birds and to read the hearts of men. He now understands that Regin intends to kill him, and so he kills Regin and takes Fafnir's treasure for himself. On his journey homeward Sigurd comes across an unearthly blaze on the slopes of [[Hindarfjall|Hindfell]]. He rides straight into it and comes unharmed to the heart of the fire, where he finds a beautiful sleeping woman clad in armour. He wakes her, and she tells him that she is [[Brynhildr|Brynhild]], a handmaiden of Odin whom he has left here as a punishment for disobedience. They pledge themselves to each other, Sigurd places a ring from Fafnir's hoard on her finger, and he leaves.

=== Book III: Brunhild ===
The scene changes to the court of [[Gjúki|Giuki]], the [[Nibelung|Niblung]] king. Giuki's daughter [[Gudrun]] has a dream in which she encounters a beautiful but ominous falcon and takes it to her breast. Anxious to learn the meaning of the dream she rides to visit Brynhild, who tells her that she will marry a king, but that her life will be darkened by war and death. Gudrun returns home. Sigurd revisits Brynhild and they again declare their love for each other. He then rides to the Niblung court, where he joins them in making war on the Southland, winning great glory for himself. The witch [[Grimhild]], Gudrun's mother, gives Sigurd a potion that makes him fall in love with Gudrun. Completely under her spell, he marries her and sets out to win Brynhild for Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnar]]. Visiting Brynhild again, this time magically disguised as Gunnar, and again penetrating the fire that surrounds her, he reminds her that she is promised to whoever can overcome the supernatural fire, and so deceives her into reluctantly vowing to marry Gunnar. Brynhild goes to the Niblung land and carries out her promise. She is distraught at this tragic outcome, and doubly so when Gudrun spitefully tells her of the trick by which Sigurd deceived her into an unwanted wedding. Brynhild now urges Gunnar and his brothers [[Högne|Hogni]] and Guttorm to kill Sigurd. Guttorm murders Sigurd as he lies in bed, but the dying Sigurd throws his sword and kills Guttorm as he leaves. Brynhild, filled with remorse, commits suicide so that she and Sigurd can be burned on a single funeral pyre.

=== Book IV: Gudrun ===
The widowed Gudrun now marries Brynhild's brother, king [[Attila the Hun|Atli]], but as the years pass by her memories of Sigurd do not fade, and she longs for vengeance. She reminds Atli of Fafnir's hoard and urges him to win it for himself. Atli invites the surviving Niblung brothers to a feast, and when they arrive he threatens them with death if they do not give him the treasure. Gunnar and Hogni defy him to do his worst, and a battle breaks out in Atli's hall. The Niblung brothers are overwhelmed by superior force, tied up and killed. Atli holds a victory-feast, at the end of which he and all his court lie sleeping drunkenly in the hall. Gudrun, having lost everyone she loves, burns down the hall, kills Atli with a sword-thrust, and throws herself from a cliff to her death.

== Composition ==

While still working on the prose translation Morris wrote to [[Charles Eliot Norton]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I had it in my head to write an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render the best parts of it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=William Morris |last=Thompson |first=Edward P. |year=1976 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0-8047-1509-2 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Morris visited Iceland in 1871 and 1873. Also in 1873 he was aware that [[Richard Wagner]] was writing [[Der Ring des Nibelungen]], and wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I look upon it as nothing short of desecration to bring such a tremendous and world-wide subject under the gaslights of an opera: the most [[rococo]] and degraded of all forms of art – the idea of a sandy-haired German tenor tweedledeeing over the unspeakable woes of Sigurd, which even the simplest words are not typical enough to express!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life of William Morris, vol. 1 |last=Mackail |first=J. W. |year=1901 |publisher=Longmans |location=London |page=319 |url= https://archive.org/details/lifeofwilliammor01mackuoft|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Morris began work on ''Sigurd the Volsung'' in October 1875, completing it the following year. In the end the poem extended to over 10,000 lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harvey |first1=Charles |last2=Press |first2=Jon |title=William Morris: Design and Enterprise in Victorian England |year=1991 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=0-7190-2418-8 |page=232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He took both the ''Volsunga Saga'' and the corresponding poems of the ''Poetic Edda|Elder Edda'' as his basic sources, but felt free to alter them as he thought necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Old Norse Made New: Essays on the Post-Medieval Reception of Old Norse Literature and Culture |last=Clark |first=David |author2=Phelpstead, Carl  |year= 2007 |publisher=Viking Society for Northern Research |location=London |isbn=0-903521-76-8 |page=54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is in rhyming [[hexameter]] [[couplet]]s, often with [[anapaest]]ic movement and a feminine [[caesura]]. In keeping with the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] theme Morris used [[kenning]]s, a good deal of [[alliteration]], and wherever possible words of [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=English Poetry in the Later Nineteenth Century |last=Evans |first=Ifor |year=1966 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |location=New York |isbn=0-404-18399-9 |page=122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a difficult and archaic diction,&lt;ref name="Arvidsson"/&gt; involving such lines as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The folk of the war-wand's forgers wrought never better steel&lt;br/&gt;Since first the burg of heaven uprose for man-folk's weal.&lt;ref&gt;Bk. 1, line 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and
&lt;blockquote&gt;So they make the yoke-beasts ready, and dight the wains for the way.&lt;ref&gt;Bk. 3, line 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Critical reception ==

According to Morris' daughter [[May Morris|May]] it was the work he "held most highly and wished to be remembered by".&lt;ref name="Henderson 1967 170"/&gt; Contemporary reviewers mostly agreed. In America ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'' compared it to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s ''[[Idylls of the King]]'', writing that
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Sigurd, the Volsung'' is the second great English epic of our generation...and it ranks after Tennyson's "Arthuriad" in order of time only. It fully equals that monumental work in the force and pathos of the story told, while it surpasses it in unity and continuity of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Edmund Gosse]], in ''The Academy'', enthused: "The style he has adopted is more exalted and less idyllic, more rapturous and less luxurious – in a word, more spirited and more virile than that of any of his earlier works."&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Literary World'' agreed that it was "the manliest and the loveliest work of Mr. Morris's genius", going on to predict that "Whatever its immediate reception may be, William Morris's ''Sigurd'' is certain eventually to take its place among the few great epics of the English tongue."&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner pp. 243–245&lt;/ref&gt; The note of caution as to the reaction of the 19th century reading public was sounded more strongly by several other critics.  [[Theodore Watts-Dunton|Theodore Watts]] wrote in ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'', "That this is a noble poem there can be no doubt; but whether it will meet with ready appreciation and sympathy in this country is a question not so easily disposed of."  He thought it "Mr. Morris's greatest achievement", but worried about the choice of metre, which he thought monotonous in effect.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner pp. 230–232&lt;/ref&gt; In an unfavourable review for ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', Henry Hewlett complained that "The narrative seldom rises above mediocrity...the memory finds little to carry away, and the ear still less to haunt it."  He was particularly repulsed by the Dark Age outlook he believed Morris to have adopted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A poem...which, like ''Sigurd'', reflects, with hard, uncompromising realism, an obsolete code of ethics, and a barbarous condition of society, finds itself irreconcilably at discord with the key of nineteenth-century feeling.  Deprived of its strongest claim to interest, a sympathetic response in the moral and religious sentiment of its readers, it can only appeal to the intellect as a work of art, or as a more or less successful attempt at antiquarian restoration.  It may be admired and applauded by the lettered few; but it will not be taken to the nation's heart.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner pp. 261–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By contrast, the ''[[North American Review]]'' believed it to be Morris's method "To reproduce the antique, not as the ancients felt it, but as we feel it,– to transfuse it with modern thought and emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

After Morris's death interest in his poems began to fade, but a few enthusiasts for ''Sigurd the Volsung'' continued to speak out in its favour. [[Arthur Symons]] wrote in 1896 that ''Sigurd the Volsung'' "remains his masterpiece of sustained power", and in 1912 the young [[T. E. Lawrence]] called it "the best poem I know"&lt;ref name="Allen 1991 46"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Two Literatures |last=Symons |first=Arthur |year=1897 |publisher=Leonard Smithers |location=London |page=157 |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924013257666 |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[philology|philologist]] [[E. V. Gordon]] ''Sigurd the Volsung'' is "incomparably the greatest poem – perhaps the only great poem – in English which has been inspired by [[Old Norse literature|Norse literature]]", and [[George Bernard Shaw]] went so far as to call it "the greatest epic since [[Homer]]".&lt;ref name="De Gruyter, Walter, Inc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=William Morris: Design and Enterprise in Victorian Britain |last=Harvey |first=Charles |author2=Press, Jon  |year=1991 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=0-7190-2418-8 |page=74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the novelist [[Eric Linklater]], while acknowledging that "Morris tells his story with endless invention, with a brilliant profusion of detail", complained that the poem's "Thames-side heroism" conveyed too facile a sense of tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |author-link1=Jacqueline Simpson |title=The Northmen Talk |location=London |publisher=Phoenix House |publication-date=1965 |page=x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has never had a wide readership, and contemporary judgements on ''Sigurd'' tend to depend upon the judge's opinion of Morris's verse in general. Some find its length and archaic diction off-putting, but many modern critics agree with Morris that it is his finest poem.&lt;ref name="Gentry 2002 273"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Work of William Morris |last=Thompson |first=Paul |year=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn=0-19-283149-6  |page=197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harvey |first1=Charles |last2=Press |first2=Jon |title=William Morris: Design and Enterprise in Victorian England |year=1991 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=0719024196 |page=232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The McKay One-Volume International Encyclopedia |last=Horsley |first=Edith M. |year=1970 |publisher=McKay |location=New York |page=754 |accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions ==
[[File:Kelmscott Press Typefaces Detail.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Type faces designed by Morris for the Kelmscott Press.]]
The poem was published by Ellis and White in November 1876, although the date appeared on the imprint as 1877. They issued a second edition in 1877 and a third in 1880. The book was brought out again in 1887 by Reeves and Turner, and in 1896 by [[Longman]].&lt;ref name="Old Norse"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://morrisedition.lib.uiowa.edu/sigurdIvariants.html Morris Online Edition].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, two years after Morris's death, a revised text was published by the Kelmscott Press in an edition limited to 160 paper copies and 6 vellum copies, with wood cuts by Sir [[Edward Burne-Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copac.ac.uk/search?rn=6&amp;au=william+morris&amp;pub=kelmscott+press&amp;ti=sigurd+the+volsung&amp;sort-order=ti%2C%2Ddate |title=Catalogue entry at Copac |publisher=Copac.ac.uk |accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 Longman issued an edition in which some passages were replaced with prose summaries by Winifred Turner and Helen Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofsigurdv00morr |title=Reprint edition from Archive.org |accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 the same firm reprinted the original version as volume 12 of ''The Collected Works of William Morris'', with an introduction by May Morris; in the absence of a critical edition this is the one generally cited by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copac.ac.uk/search?rn=33&amp;au=morris&amp;ti=sigurd+niblungs&amp;sort-order=date |title=Catalogue entry at Copac |publisher=Copac.ac.uk |accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years ''Sigurd the Volsung'' has been frequently reprinted, sometimes in the Turner and Scott abridged version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3Asigurd+the+volsung+au%3Awilliam+morris&amp;fq=yr%3A1990..2010+%3E&amp;qt=advanced&amp;dblist=638 |title=WorldCat Catalogue entry |accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openlibrary.org/search?q=william+morris+sigurd+volsung&amp;ftokens=%2Ctepxelncbajj&amp;remove=&amp;offset=0 |title=Open Library Catalogue entry |accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.ac.uk/search?&amp;au=william+morris&amp;date=1990%2D2010&amp;ti=sigurd+the+volsung&amp;sort-order=ti%2C%2Ddate |title=Copac Catalogue entry |accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on later fantasy writers ==
Magnússon and Morris remained the only English translation of [[Volsunga saga]] until [[Margaret Schlauch]]'s version in 1930. As such it influenced such writers as [[Andrew Lang]], who adapted it in his ''Red Fairy Book'', and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], who read it in his student days.&lt;ref name="Byock 1990 31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpenter 2000 77"/&gt; In a [[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|letter]], Tolkien mentions that he wished to imitate Morris's romances,&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, [[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]], letter no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed among his works is a version of the [[Sigurd]] story, ''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun]]'' (published posthumously in 2009).&lt;ref name=TolkienSigurd/&gt; Stefan Arvidsson compares Morris's ''Sigurd'' and Tolkien's ''Legend'':

{{quote|In contrast to Morris’ work, written as it is in heavily archaic, difficult-to-penetrate prose, Tolkien's recently-published draft&lt;ref name=TolkienSigurd&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien. ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun.'' 2009. ASIN: B004SHWTNM&lt;/ref&gt; was closer in both style and content to the heroic sagas of The Poetic Edda.&lt;ref name="Arvidsson"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art22%282%29-tolkien_wagner.html | title=Greed and the Nature of Evil: Tolkien versus Wagner | author=Arvidsson, Stefan | journal=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture |date=Spring 2010 | volume=22 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other authors have been inspired more or less directly by the [[Volsung cycle]], following Morris' lead. For example, [[Kevin Crossley-Holland]] published his own translation of the myths, ''Axe-age, Wolf-age.''&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Crossley-Holland, ''Axe-age, Wolf-age, a Selection from the Norse Myths'', Andrew Deutsch, London, 1985, {{ISBN|0-571-14844-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fight for Right ==

In 1916, during [[World War I]], composer [[Edward Elgar]] set to music words taken from ''The Story of Sigurd'', producing the song "[[Fight for Right]]". It was dedicated to Members of the Fight for Right Movement, a pro-war organisation dedicated to continuation of the war until victory. William Morris' words were deemed fitting to express this idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]], ''Portrait of Elgar'' (Oxford University Press, 1968) {{ISBN|0-19-315414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts''' (TIPA) was founded by [[Tenzin Gyatso]], [[the 14th Dalai Lama]] on reaching [[McLeod Ganj]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[India]] in exile from [[Tibet]] in August 1959. It was then called  Tibetan Music, Dance and Drama Society, which was one of the first institutes set up by the Dalai Lama,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qMqBvtL_nI0C&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Norbulingka+Institute&amp;as_brr=0#PPA514,M1 Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts] ''Frommer's India'', by Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, Niloufer Venkatraman, Shonar Joshi.

==Opera company==
The new opera company employed both professional and amateur performers and entertained the Tibetan refugee camps and staged numerous performances of the folk [[Lhamo]] operas. These performances lasted all day and were "a reminder of home" for refugees.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Depictions of '''tobacco smoking in art''' date back at least to the pre-Columbian [[Maya civilization]], where smoking had religious significance. The motif occurred frequently in painting of the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]], in which people of lower social class were often shown smoking [[pipe smoking|pipes]]. In European art of the 18th and 19th centuries, the social location of people – largely men – shown as smoking tended to vary, but the stigma attached to women who adopted the habit was reflected in some artworks. Art of the 20th century often used the [[cigar]] as a [[status symbol]], and parodied images from [[tobacco advertising]], especially of women. Developing health concerns around tobacco smoking also influenced its artistic representation. Recently tobacco has impacted on art in a quite different way, with the conversion of many [[Cigarette machine|cigarette vending machines]] into [[Art-o-mat]] outlets, selling miniature artworks the shape and size of a [[cigarette]] packet.

==Maya art==
[[File:Smoking Monkey.jpg|thumb|alt=Maya vase.| Vase of the Smoking Monkey. A ceramic artifact from the Maya lowlands created in the late Classic period. A spider monkey possibly representing a deity smokes a cigarette.]]

[[Maya civilization|Mayas]] were perhaps the first people to represent tobacco smoking in art. Mayas smoked heavily, and they believed that their gods did too.&lt;ref name=c&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "Tobacco and Religion." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 27-36. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religious ritual]]s often involved [[tobacco]]: offerings were given to certain gods and tobacco smoke warded off evil deities.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; Many tribes viewed tobacco as a supernatural, magical substance (perhaps because of its strong physiological and sometimes [[hallucinogen]]ic effects).&lt;ref name=c/&gt; Because of tobacco's significance, it is not surprising that Mayas produced artistic representations of smoking.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; The artwork mostly portrays religious rituals and myths involving [[god]]s or [[lord]]s because ordinary people and actions were considered too unimportant and unworthy for time consuming art pieces.&lt;ref name= b&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "The Classification of Archaeological Material." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 111-13. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous depictions of smoking can be found from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic epoch]] (3rd through 8th centuries). Though what substance deities and people are smoking cannot be said for certain, scholars generally conclude that the smoked substance is tobacco after studying archaeological materials.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; The representations are occasionally confusing as the Mayas portrayed [[smoke]] and [[cigar]]s in varied ways.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; Smoke can be illustrated with black dots, black and red dots (with red indicating sparks), converging scrolls, or converging coils.&lt;ref name= b/&gt;&lt;ref name= a&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "Scenes Almost Certainly Representing the Act of Smoking." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 114-45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Converging scrolls also sometimes represent [[foliage]], speech, fire, smells, and other things.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; Cigars are usually funnel-shaped (or torch-shaped) and vary greatly in size.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; [[Cigarette]]s (small, slender cigars in this case) resemble modern cigarettes (narrow, long rectangles) or elongated ovals.&lt;ref name= b/&gt;

===Codices===
Mayas created [[Codex|codices]] chronicling their history and culture, and they constructed pages from ''copo'' - plant fiber on bark or deerskin with lime.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; Though [[Missionary|missionaries]] destroyed many codices, one of the remaining codices (the Codex Madrid ) contains depictions of smoking.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; Gods smoke cigars on pages 79b, 86b, 87, and 88.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; The Codex Madrid also contains [[glyph]]s thought to mean “smoking.” &lt;ref&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "Tobacco and the Mayas." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 11-26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stone monuments and frescos===
The Sanctuary of the [[Temple of the Cross]] at [[Palenque]] (a Maya city in current [[Mexico]]) houses a monument called “El Fumador” (Spanish for “The Smoker”). The stone door panel features an elderly deity blowing smoke from a large cigar. Because of the cigar's funnel shape (which compares to cigars currently used by rural [[South America]]n tribes) and the outward flaring smoke, scholars believe the monument depicts a religious ritual similar to those performed by other [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; No other stone monuments depicting smoking are known, but there may have been others.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

The only known Maya painting to depict smoking is found at [[Tulum]] (a Maya city on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in current Mexico). The Temple of the Diving God houses the [[fresco]], and the painting features monsters (perhaps birds) smoking large cigars.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

===Ceramics and other artwork===
Mayans also portrayed smoking on [[ceramic]] objects including boxes, plates, vases, and bowls.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; The ceramics were carved or painted multiple colors (typically black, white, and red). Important ceramics featuring smoking include the Vase of the Dancing Lord, the Reynolds vase (at the [[Museum of the American Indian]]), Plate of the Smoking God, the Woman, and the Monkey (at the National Museum of Guatemala), Vase of the Smoking Monkey, and Bowl of the Eleven Deities, Five of Them Smoking.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

The Vase of the Danse Macâbre depicts a smoking [[skeleton]] carrying a jar or pouch and another skeleton and two [[jaguar]]s also holding pouches or jars. The carried objects are believed to hold tobacco or tobacco mixed with other substances.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; They display the sign of darkness, so tobacco may have been associated with rituals relating to death.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

Though the majority of depictions show gods and lords, some artifacts portray the everyday. For example, the Plate of the Smoking Husband depicts a man smoking a cigarette and his wife rolling dough inside their home.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

Other artifacts depicting smoking have also been found including a shell carving, which is now housed at the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

==Dutch art during the Golden Age==
[[File:Smell.jpg|thumb|alt=Smell.|''Smell'' (1637) by Jan Miense Molenaar. This oil painting exemplifies tobacco's usage in comedic Dutch works.]]

The ordinary person in the 17th century [[Dutch Republic]] viewed tobacco as a novelty and associated smoking with [[social deviance]]. A divide existed between the medicinal use of tobacco, which was widely accepted, and recreational use, which was seen as low class and inappropriate for more respected citizens including church and government leaders.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Johann Neander's ''Tabacologia'', written in 1622, demonstrates the prevalent belief that tobacco held curative and preventative properties for a wide range of diseases.&lt;ref name= ivan&gt;Gaskell, Ivan. "Tobacco, Social Deviance, and Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century." Looking at Seventeenth-Century Dutch Art: Realism Reconsidered. Ed. Wayne E. Franits. New York: Cambridge UP, 1997. 68-77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, smoking's prevalence among [[sailor]]s, [[soldier]]s, and the [[Rural poverty|rural poor]] along with its [[Substance intoxication|intoxicating]] effects led to an association with the lowliest people.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Thus, smoking became a tool for artists to designate someone's rank in society, and painters including [[Adriaen Brouwer]], the Ostade brothers, and [[David Teniers II]] employed smoking in their portrayals of the low classes. Smoking also became a comedic prop for painters especially in festival and burlesque paintings.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; [[Ivan Gaskell]] (Curator of Paintings, Sculpture, and Decorative Arts in the [[Harvard Art Museums]]) argues that "If we trace the imagery of topsy-turvydom in Dutch art we find tobacco to be a key element in scenes of comic disorder".&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;

[[Jan Steen]], perhaps the most famous comic painter during the 17th century, often included [[pipe smoking]], which took on sexual connotations in his paintings of [[brothel]]s and [[tavern]]s. For example, a man packing tobacco into a pipe along with pipes leaning against [[chamberpot]]s symbolized sexual [[flirtation]]s and [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]].&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; These were often used for a comic effect, especially in illustrations of robbers stealing from intoxicated patrons of brothels and taverns.

Moreover, women smoking in Steen's paintings subverted [[cultural norms]] and added an additional comic effect as men almost exclusively smoked during that time period. Short pipes, especially, implied the most debased women and the ugliest [[prostitute]]s.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Moreover, pipes, especially a pair of crossed pipes, symbolized rhetoricians—guilds of actors and poets that held festivals emphasizing pleasure.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Several of Steen's paintings were created to illustrate [[proverb]]s including: "as the old sing, so the young pipe (soo de ouden songen, soo pijpen de jongen)" &lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;—meaning the youth will pick up poor habits like smoking by imitating adults. Finally, Steen often included negative implications of smoking even when he painted smoking for a comic effect by depicting smokers next to a [[beggar]]’s crutches or whipping branches to reiterate to the viewer that smoking will lead to “punishment, poverty, and beggary".&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;

Because of economic interests in importing tobacco from the [[New World]] to [[Europe]] and even starting domestic tobacco farming, [[Amsterdam]] merchants worked to reduce smoking stigmatization.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; By the late 17th century, smoking long-stemmed and polished pipes became acceptable for more respectable males while the lower classes smoked from cruder and shorter pipes. [[Snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]] also gained popularity, and depictions of smoking and tobacco in paintings and drawings became more representative of the mundane and everyday than comically absurd situations and social outcasts.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;

==18th century to 21st century==
[[File:Munch SelfBurningCigarette.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Munch Self-Portrait.|Edvard Munch ''Self-Portrait with Burning Cigarette'']]

Following the [[Golden Age]], tobacco usage in artwork lost prominence. The decline of smoking representations is most likely due to the influence of [[Rococo]] age elegance, which made snuff the preferred choice.&lt;ref name= tempel&gt;Tempel, Benno. "Symbol and File: Smoking in Art since the Seventeenth Century." ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mM5bYb_uVcwC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=Tempel,+Benno.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Vx9OUeenEMHs0QGcqoGQAg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tempel%2C%20Benno.&amp;f=false Smoke: a Global History of Smoking]''. Ed. Sander L. Gilman and Xun Zhou. London: Reaktion, 2004. 206-217. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; Though snuff usage increased, snuff portrayals never became as common as those of cigars, cigarettes, and pipes in European paintings. Against norms of the time period, French artist [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], who was inspired by Golden Age artwork, occasionally included pipes in his pieces.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; One such painting is a [[still life]] entitled ''Smoking Kit with Drinking Pot.'' The pipe in this piece lacks symbolic meaning.

In the late 18th century and early 19th century, smoking took on new and varied symbolic meanings. During this time period, men were the primary smokers, and smoking was not an acceptable habit for women who were expected to be ideal mothers or mistresses.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; In the [[Romantic period]], people believed smoking held a close association with [[intellectualism]]. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Stéphane Mallarmé]]'' exemplifies art from this time. The painting shows an upper class man with a lit cigar in his hand and that same hand resting on top of an open book. His eyes are look into the distance seeming to be deep in thought. Benno Tempel (curator of the [[Kunsthal]], [[Rotterdam]]) argues that smoking in this painting symbolizes a modern lifestyle even though smoking had been around for centuries.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Stéphane Mallarmé (Manet).jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Stéphane Mallarmé.| Édouard Manet's ''Portrait of Stéphane Mallarmé'']]

The [[Impressionism|impressionists]] painted scenes of everyday life that included cigars, cigarettes, or pipes, but they did not put symbolic importance in them.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; The [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionists]] returned symbolic meaning to smoking instruments. One notable painting was done by [[Vincent van Gogh]] called ''Skull with a Burning Cigarette''. Although this painting seems to be an anti-smoking warning, it was actually representative of the [[black humor]] and [[practical joke]]s popular during that time.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; [[Edvard Munch]] launched this trend with his painting ''Self-Portrait''. It shows the artist with a cigarette against a dark background and an eerie look across his face. Munch used smoke to symbolize psychological problems.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

By the 20th century, cigarettes, cigars, and pipes all had their own specific meanings and connotations that developed across history. By playing off these meanings, artists conveyed a fuller understanding of an artwork to the viewer. For example, the cigar came to represent a social [[status symbol]], and artists included cigars in paintings to show emphasize social classes and power differences. [[Heinrich Maria Davringhausen]]’s ''The Black Marketeer'' depicts a boss with a boxful of cigars and a lit one at the edge of his desk. This demonstrates the unequal social relationship between the employer and the employee.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; [[Pablo Picasso]] also used the pipe in his piece called ''The Poet''. This painting relies on the inseparable connection between literature and the pipe to provide the viewer with a better understanding of the painting.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

===Pop art===
With the rise of [[Pop art|Pop Art]], art pieces became more cynical. Pop art culture targeted clichés that evolved from the [[tobacco industry]]. [[Mel Ramos]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]] are two notable artists who poked fun at the industry.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Following the stigmatization of tobacco in America, pop art has shed a negative light on smoking. [[Claes Oldenburg]]’s sculpture ''Giant Fagends'' depicts how [[Tobacco addiction|cigarette addiction]] exemplifies the American's wasteful [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; [[Duane Hanson]]’s ''Supermarket Shopper'' shows a miserable middle-aged woman to represent how present day Americans view smokers: ruled by the addiction and lack will-power.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

===Modern art===

Various forms of [[modern art]] have also included cigarettes. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]] displayed Jac Leiner's ''Lung'' in March 2009. This piece features 1200 [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] packs neatly folded and strung together. Leiner illustrates her own personal addiction by presenting the sickening amount of cigarettes that she unconsciously consumed over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Guy. "Jac Leirner's Lung."

This piece portrays an incompletely painted man on a large canvas with the title of the painting written across the top. It demonstrates the addictive power of cigarettes because the artist cannot overcome the addiction to finish something that he presumably loves to do: paint.&lt;ref name= polke&gt;Polke, Sigmar.

==Smoking, women, and art==
During the 17th century, Dutch paintings with women and pipes symbolized misfortune. Women in these paintings are rarely the ones in possession of the pipe, and the Dutch artists meant to send a moral message that foolish behaviors like smoking will lead people into [[wikt:hardship|hardship]]s.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

Artwork in the 18th century included pipes to convey an [[exoticism]] and [[eroticism]] even though depictions of smoking went out of fashion in the Western World.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; An example is [[Jean-Étienne Liotard]]’s ''A French Woman in Turkish Costume in a Harmam Instructing her Servant'', which features a woman with a long pipe standing in a position of authority.

In the 19th century, artists, [[Caricature|caricaturists]], fine [[Pottery|potters]], and even [[novelist]]s depicted women smoking. Though portrayals of women smokers became more common, they were shown in a negative light because smoking was still not acceptable for women.&lt;ref name= mitchell&gt;Mitchell, Dolores. "Women and Nineteenth- Century Images of Smoking." Smoke: a Global History of Smoking. Ed. Sander L. Gilman and Xun Zhou. London: Reaktion, 2004. 206-217. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, artwork that incorporated smoking was kept in rooms reserved only for men including smoking saloons, [[billiard room]]s, and libraries.&lt;ref name=tempel/&gt; Impressionists employed pipes to distinguish males from females and emphasize their different [[social status]]es. In [[Georges Seurat]]’s ''A Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte'', the male in the white suit holds a cigar, and even in this snapshot of everyday life, there is an implicit [[hierarchy]] between him and the woman who is with him.&lt;ref name=tempel/&gt;

Prostitutes were the first women in this time period to be depicted with pipes, cigars, or cigarettes as seen in artwork from Vincent van Gogh and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. The women used smoke and make-up (as seen from their very white faces) to attract male clients.&lt;ref name=tempel/&gt; Some artists wanted to change social norms and de-stigmatize smoking for women. [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]] was one notable woman who studied illustrating for many years in [[Paris]] and then discovered [[photography]]. Her piece titled ''Self- Portrait'' depicts her holding a cigarette in one hand and a [[beer stein]] in the other. She is not dressed provocatively like most females who were associated with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and cigarettes during this time. Instead, she realistically captures aspects of her life and complicates the society's understanding of [[middle class]] women.&lt;ref name= mitchell/&gt; Jane Atché commercially published color [[lithograph]]s of women smokers without any sexual connotations. Her prints offered sophisticated woman who enjoyed cigarettes.&lt;ref name= mitchell/&gt;
[[File:Auguste Levêque -Suzanne02.jpg|thumb|Painting by Auguste Levêque. ''Portrait of Suzanne'']]

Resulting from new representations of women smokers from artists like Frances Benjamin Johnston and Jane Atché, smoking became more socially acceptable for women. Eventually, smoking grew into a phenomenon for women. Tobacco products took on varied meanings in the 20th century. During the [[Roaring Twenties]], women smoked cigarettes to appear chic and sophisticated.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Yet, paintings with female prostitutes holding with cigars took on a negative meaning because women from low classes were not meant to have objects connected with the upper class. These pieces showed women as seductresses who tricked men into giving them wealth and power.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

Smoking began losing its attractiveness as the 20th century progressed, and art followed this trend. Artists mocked the cigarette industry for using highly [[Sexualization|sexualized]] images of women in [[advertising]].&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Mel Ramos created artwork depicting naked women on cigars. Tom Wesselmann exploited the clichés of sex and cigarettes by painting an exposed breast behind an ashtray.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Present day artists acknowledge smoking as a health risk, but some want to fight modern, [[taboo]] perceptions of tobacco instead of demonizing smoking. [[Sarah Lucas]]’s photo titled "Fighting Fire with Fire" shows herself with a cigarette in the corner of her mouth. This one picture sums up the evolution of the relationship between woman, smoking, and art. According to Benno Tempel, this photo shows that “at times when society tries to create taboos, art can break through them”.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

==Art-o-mat==
[[Art-o-mat]] machines sell pocket-size art pieces for $5.00 throughout the world. The apparatuses are converted [[Cigarette machine|cigarette vending machines]], which are now banned in the [[United States]]. Currently, 90 machines exist with one in [[Quebec]], one in [[Vienna]], and the rest throughout the United States. Private businesses, cultural centers, art museums, universities, and other locations possess Art-o-mats, and they receive $1.50 for each piece sold. Some renowned sites include New York City's [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Los Angeles]].

Over three hundred artists from ten different countries have created original artwork for the machines. $2.50 goes to the artist whenever someone buys their work. The pieces come in white containers the size of a cigarette pack (roughly two inches by three inches) and wrapped in [[cellophane]]. They range from miniature sculptures to jewelry to tiny paintings. Almost every media imaginable has been used including wood, glass, watercolors on canvas, clay, Styrofoam, magnets, stained-glass, and bronze.&lt;ref name= newsweek/&gt; Contributing sculptor Jules Vital said, “This project gives artists the opportunity to get their work into major venues, and it's cheap for buyers.".&lt;ref name= newsweek&gt;Rankine, Jerome. "Must Have: Pull Lever, Get Culture." Newsweek. Newsweek, Inc., 22 September 2003. Web. 28 April 2010. &lt;http://www.newsweek.com/id/60175&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clark Whittington]] built the first machine for his 1997 art show at a café in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. The original machine sold Whittington's black &amp; white photographs for $1.00, and Cynthia Giles, the owner of the café, requested that the machine remain after the show ended. Shortly afterward, Whittington formed Artists in Cellophane (A.I.C.) with other artists from the Winston-Salem area to build more art vending machines and to create pieces for them.

Today, A.I.C. sponsors the Art-o-mat machines with the goal of increasing art consumption by packaging art in an easily accessible manner. Whittington hopes collectors will form a habit of art buying and become interested in buying larger pieces from local artists.&lt;ref&gt;Cosgrove-Mather, Bootie. "Art-O-Mat Aims For Collectors."

A.I.C. seeks to unite art with consumerism and commerce and looks to expand to new locations and recruit new artists.&lt;ref&gt;"The Story behind Art-o-mat." Art-o-mat. Artists in Cellophane.

[[Image:Solvognen-00100.tif|thumb|280px|The gilded side of the Trundholm sun chariot.]]
[[Image:Solvognen Do 2010 1278.tif|thumb|280px|The left side of the disk shows no traces of gilding.]]

The '''Trundholm sun chariot''' ({{lang-da|Solvognen}}), is a [[Nordic Bronze Age]] artifact discovered in [[Denmark]]. It is a representation of the  [[sun chariot]],  a [[bronze]] statue of a [[horse]] and a large bronze disk, which are placed on a device with spoked [[wheels]].

The sculpture was discovered with no accompanying objects in 1902 in a [[peat bog]] on the Trundholm moor in [[Odsherred]] in the northwestern part of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], (approximately {{Coord|55|55|N|11|37|E|}}). It is now in the collection of the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]].

==Description==
The horse stands on a bronze rod supported by four wheels. The rod below the horse is connected to the disk, which is supported by two wheels. All of the wheels have four [[spoke]]s.  The artifact was cast in the [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax]] method.

The whole object is approximately {{convert|54|x|35|x|29|cm|in|abbr=on}} in size (width, height, depth).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsbutikken.dk/default.aspx?load=main&amp;Data=ProductInfo&amp;key=180029&amp;group=kopier2 Nationalmuseet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The disk has a diameter of approximately {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}. It is gilded on one side only, the right-hand side (when looking at the horse from behind). It consists of two bronze disks that are joined by an outer bronze ring, with a thin sheet of gold applied to one face. The disks were then decorated with punches and gravers with zones of motifs of concentric circles, with bands of zig-zag decoration between borders.  The gold side has an extra outer zone which may represent rays, and also a zone with concentric circles linked by looping bands that "instead of flowing in one direction, progress like the steps of the dance, twice forward and once back".  The main features of the horse are also highly decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 184-185&lt;/ref&gt;

The two sides of the disk have been interpreted as an indication of a belief that the [[sun]] is drawn across the heavens from East to West during the day, presenting its bright side to the Earth and returns from West to East during the night, when the dark side is being presented to the Earth. A continuation around a globe would have the same result.  It is thought that the chariot was pulled around during religious rituals to demonstrate the motion of the sun in the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 184; see also Nationalmuseet video&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
The sculpture is dated by the National Museum to about 1400 BC,&lt;ref&gt;http://natmus.dk/historisk-viden/danmark/oldtid-indtil-aar-1050/bronzealderen-1700-fkr-500-fkr/solvognen/&lt;/ref&gt; though other dates have been suggested. It was found before pollen-dating was developed, which would have enabled a more confident dating.

A model of a [[horse-drawn vehicle]] on spoked wheels in Northern Europe at such an early time is surprising; they would not be expected to appear until the end of the Late Bronze Age, which ranges from 1100 BC to 550 BC.  This and aspects of the decoration may suggest a Danubian origin or influence in the object, although the Nationalmuseet is confident it is of Nordic origin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719103334/http://www.nationalmuseet.dk/sw59869.asp Nationalmuseet video]; Sandars, 183-185 favours Danubian influence, and a date at the end of the 13th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible function as a calendar==
[[File:Trundholm sun chariot animation.gif|thumb|Rotating image]] 
Klaus Randsborg, professor of archeology at the [[University of Copenhagen]],  has pointed out that the sum of an addition of the number of spirals in each circle of the disk, multiplied by the number of the circles in which they are found, counted from the middle (1x1 + 2x8 + 3x20 + 4x25), results in a total of 177, which comes very close to the number of days in six [[synodic]] months, only 44 min 2.8 s shorter each.

The [[synodic cycle]] is the time that elapses between two successive conjunctions of an object in the sky, such as a specific star, with the sun. It is the time that elapses before the object will reappear at the same point in the sky when observed from the Earth, so it is the ''apparent'' orbital period observed from Earth.

He asserts his belief that this demonstrates that the disk was designed by a person with some measure of astronomic knowledge and that the sculpture may have functioned as a calendar.

==Sun chariot in Indo-European mythology==
{{main|Sun chariot}}

===Norse mythology===

The chariot has  been interpreted as a possible [[Bronze Age]] predecessor to [[Skinfaxi]],&lt;ref name=LINDOW272&gt;[[John Lindow|Lindow, John]]. (2001) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KlT7tv3eMSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs]'', page 272. [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|0-19-515382-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the horse that pulled [[Dagr]], the personification of day, across the sky.

===Celtic Pantheon===
The sky god [[Taranis]] is typically depicted with the attribute of a spoked wheel.

===Rigveda===
[[File:Surya chariot.jpg|thumb|right|Surya's chariot]]
{{Main|Historical Vedic religion}}
The [[Rigveda]] also reflects the mytheme of the Sun chariot. [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].85 mentions the sun god's bride as  seated on a chariot pulled by two steeds.
The relevant verses are the following (trans.  Griffith):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
10. Her spirit was the bridal car; the covering thereof was heaven:
     Bright were both Steeds that drew it when [[Surya]] approached her husband's home.&lt;br&gt;
11. Thy Steeds were steady, kept in place by holy verse and Sama-hymn:
     All car were thy two chariot wheels: thy path was tremulous in the sky,&lt;br&gt;
12. Clean, as thou wentest, were thy wheels, wind was the axle fastened there.
     Surya, proceeding to her Lord, mounted a spirit-fashioned car.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Rig Veda|book=Mandala 10/Hymn 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Washi eggs''' are commonly created at [[Easter]] using Japanese [[washi]] paper (as used for [[Origami]]), glue and varnish.  They are made into ornaments and decorations.

==Technique==

A Washi egg is made by first blowing the egg to remove its contents. A rectangle of washi paper, large enough to cover the egg is folded in half, and cut nearly to the midline every quarter inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) to form a fringe of narrow strips.

'''Sir William Allan''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (1782 &amp;ndash; 23 February 1850) was a distinguished Scottish historical painter known for his scenes of Russian life. He became president of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] and was made a Royal Academician.

==Life and work==
[[File:Sir William Allan - Sir Walter Scott, 1771 - 1832. Novelist and poet - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Sir Walter Scott, novelist and poet - painted by Sir William Allan]]

Allan was born in [[Edinburgh]], the son of William Allan Snr., macer, an officer of the [[Court of Session]]. He was educated at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|High School, Edinburgh]], under William Nicol (1744?-1797), the companion of [[Robert Burns]]. Showing an aptitude for art, he was apprenticed to a coach-painter, and studied under [[John Graham (painter)|John Graham]] at the [[Edinburgh College of Art|Trustees' Academy]], with [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]], [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]], and [[Alexander George Fraser]].{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

After a few years he came to [[London]], and entered the schools of the [[Royal Academy]]. His first exhibited picture was a ''Gipsy Boy with an Ass'' (1803), in the style of [[John Opie]]. 

In 1805 he travelled, by ship, to [[Russia]], but was wrecked at [[Klaipėda|Memel]], where he raised funds for the remaining journey by painting portraits of the Dutch consul and others. He then proceeded overland to [[St. Petersburg]], passing through a great portion of the Russian army on its way to [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]. At the Russian capital he found friends, including Sir [[Alexander Crichton]], physician to the imperial family. Having learned Russian, he travelled in the interior of the country, and spent several years in the [[Ukraine]], making excursions to [[Turkey]], [[Tartary]], and elsewhere, studying the culture of [[Cossacks]], [[Circassians]], and [[Tartars]], and collecting arms and armour. In 1809 his picture ''Russian Peasants keeping their Holiday'' was exhibited at the Royal Academy. 

His wish to return home in 1812 had to be postponed due to the [[French invasion of Russia]], many of the horrors of which he witnessed first-hand.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}
[[File:Allan, David - Bashkirs - 1814.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Bashkirs'' (1814, [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]])]]

Allan was able to return to Edinburgh in 1814, and, in 1815, his picture ''Circassian Captives'' attracted notice at the Royal Academy, though it did not find a purchaser. However, Sir [[Walter Scott]], [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] (1785–1854) and his brother [[James Wilson (zoologist)|James]] (1795–1856), [[John Gibson Lockhart|John Lockhart]], and others, raised a lottery for it, with 100 subscribers at £10 10s. each, and the picture was won by [[Francis Wemyss-Charteris, 9th Earl of Wemyss]]. Allan remained in Edinburgh, and though his pictures (including ''Tartar Robbers dividing their Spoil'') did not find purchasers amongst his countrymen, some of them were bought by the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Grand Duke Nicholas]] when he visited Edinburgh. Allan afterwards painted some scenes from Scottish history suggested by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, such as ''Death of Archbishop Sharpe'' and ''Knox admonishing Mary Queen of Scots'' (exhibited in 1823 and engraved by [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]]). His ''Death of the Regent Murray'' (exhibited 1825) was purchased by the [[Duke of Bedford]] for 800 guineas, and gained the artist his election as an associate of the Royal Academy. 

In 1826 he was appointed master of the Trustees' School, Edinburgh, an office which he held until a few years before his death.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

Soon afterwards Allan's health gave way, and he was threatened with blindness. To recuperate he went to [[Rome]], and, after spending a winter there, proceeded to [[Naples]], [[Constantinople]], [[Asia Minor]], and [[Greece]]. In 1826 he exhibited ''Auld Robin Gray'' and in 1829 ''Prophet Jonah''. In 1830 he returned to Edinburgh, restored to health. His picture ''Slave Market, Constantinople'' was purchased by Alexander Hill, the publisher, and ''Byron in a Fisherman's Hut after swimming the Hellespont'' (exhibited 1831) by R. Nasmyth, who also bought Allan's portraits of Burns and Sir Walter Scott, which were engraved by John Burnet.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

In 1832 Allan was living at 8 Scotland Street in Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.nls.uk/83399643|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|page=4|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834 he visited [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]]. In 1835 he was elected a Royal Academician, and in 1838, on the death of Sir [[George Watson (painter)|George Watson]], was made president of the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1841 he went to St. Petersburg, and in the same year succeeded Wilkie as [[Painter and Limner|limner to the queen]] in Scotland, an office which was, as usual, followed (in 1842) by a knighthood.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/20105/page/1504 London Gazette, 3 June 1842, page 1504.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 Sir William exhibited ''Battle of Waterloo from the English side'', which was purchased by the [[Duke of Wellington]]. The next year he went again to St. Petersburg, where he painted, for the Czar, ''Peter the Great teaching his Subjects the Art of Shipbuilding''. The last large work which he finished was a second view of the battle of Waterloo, this time from the French side. It was exhibited at [[Westminster Hall]] in 1846, in competition for the decorations of the Houses of Parliament, but was unsuccessful. He visited Germany and France in 1847.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

In his final years Sir William lived at 72 Great King Street, a substantial Georgian townhouse over five storeys, in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Second New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1849&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[Bronchitis]] at his Edinburgh home on 23 February 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Tait's Edinburgh Magazine March 1850&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death Sir William was engaged on a large picture of the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

He is buried in [[Dean Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]] against the north wall of the original cemetery backing onto the late Victorian extension.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1639">The '''Yuan Center of Art''' ({{zh|北京元艺术中心}}) is a multifunctional arts center and gallery located in the [[Haidian District|Haidian]] district of [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The center houses four large exhibition halls for visual art, an experimental theatre, conference and symposia spaces, and a restaurant. The design concept of the building integrates the elements of architectural [[minimalism]] with a traditional Chinese construction pattern called “jiugongge”.  A recent show, entitled ''After Culture: An Exhibition of Contemporary Chinese Painting'', featured the work of several major Chinese artists, including [[Ma Kelu]], [[Shang Yang]], [[Ma Lu]], [[Ding Fang]], and [[Peng Si]]. It was curated by [[Peng Feng]], the prominent art critic and Professor of [[Aesthetics]] at [[Peking University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchhouseforasianart.org/scholars.html Western and Chinese Scholars], Research House for Asian Art, Peking University&lt;/ref&gt; who also serves on the Yuan Center's directorial board.

A leading exhibitor of contemporary [[Chinese art]], the Yuan Center is located near the center of Beijing, unlike the [[798 Art Zone]] in outlying [[Dashanzi]].
