The '''argument from free will''', also called the '''paradox of free will''' or '''[[Theological determinism|theological fatalism]]''', contends that [[omniscience]] and [[free will]] are [[Incompatible-properties argument|incompatible]] and that any conception of [[God]] that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently [[Contradiction|contradictory]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the various [[Omniscience#Controversies|controversies]] over claims of God's omniscience, in particular the critical notion of [[predestination|foreknowledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/ Foreknowledge and Free Will]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow|title=Foreknowledge and Free Will|last=Swartz|first=Norman|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

==Omniscience and free will==
[[File:Chess-king.JPG|thumb|right|150px|If God made the game, its rules, and the players, then how can any player be free?]]
Some arguments against the [[existence of God]] focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing [[free will]] and God's [[omniscience]]. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

[[Moses Maimonides]] formulated an argument regarding a person's free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:

{{quote|… "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that the man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand how he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A logical formulation of this argument might go as follows:&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;
# God knows choice "C" that a human would claim to "make freely".
# It is now necessary that C.
# If it is now necessary that C, then C cannot be otherwise (this is the definition of “necessary”). That is, there are no actual "possibilities" due to predestination.
# If you cannot do otherwise when you act, you do not act freely (Principle of Alternate Possibilities)
# Therefore, when you do an act, you will not do it freely.

[[Norman Swartz]], however, contends that the above arguments commit the [[modal fallacy]]. In particular, he asserts that these arguments assume that if C is true, it becomes necessary for C to be true, which is incorrect as C is contingent (see [[Modal logic | modal logic]]). Otherwise, one can argue that the future is set already regardless of his actions.&lt;ref name=iep /&gt;

Other means of reconciling God's omniscience with human free will have been proposed. Some have attempted to redefine or reconceptualize free will:
* God can know in advance what I will do, because free will is to be understood only as freedom from [[coercion]], and anything further is an illusion. This is the move made by [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic]] philosophies.
* The sovereignty (autonomy) of God, existing within a free agent, provides strong inner compulsions toward a course of action (calling), and the power of choice (election). The actions of a human are thus determined by a human acting on relatively strong or weak urges (both from God and the environment around them) and their own relative power to choose.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosopher's Handbook'', Stanley Rosen, ed., Random House Reference, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposition first offered by [[Boethius]]&lt;ref&gt;''Consolatio Philosophiae'', Boethius, book 5:4&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also ''[[Divine Providence]]'' versus the concept of [[Destiny|Fate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C. S. Lewis]], suggests that God's perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', Lewis argues that God is actually outside time and therefore does not "foresee" events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:
{{quote|But suppose God is outside and above the Time-line. In that case, what we call "tomorrow" is visible to Him in just the same way as what we call "today". All the days are "Now" for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday, He simply sees you doing them: because, though you have lost yesterday, He has not. He does not "foresee" you doing things tomorrow, He simply sees you doing them: because, though tomorrow is not yet there for you, it is for Him. You never supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He knows your tomorrow's actions in just the same way—because He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your action till you have done it: but then the moment at which you have done it is already "Now" for Him.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 p.149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A common objection is to argue that [[Molinism]], or the belief that God can know counterfactually the actions of his creations, is true. This has been used as an argument by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[William Lane Craig]], amongst others.

==Freewill argument for the nonexistence of God==
[[Dan Barker]] suggests that this can lead to a "Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God"&lt;ref&gt;''The Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God'' by Dan Barker, [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] [https://ffrf.org/legacy/about/bybarker/fang.php]&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that God's omniscience is incompatible with God having free will and that if God does not have freewill God is not a [[personal God|personal being]].

Theists generally agree that God is a personal being and that God is [[omniscience|omniscient]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[Richard Swinburne]] ''Does God Exist?'' of ''The Catechism of the Catholic Church''&lt;/ref&gt; but there is some disagreement about whether "omniscient" means:
# "knows everything that God chooses to know and that is logically possible to know"; Or instead the slightly stronger:
# "knows everything that is logically possible to know"&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These two terms are known as ''inherent'' and ''total'' omniscience, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21239">An '''auteur''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|t|ɜːr}}; {{IPA-fr|otœʁ|lang}}, {{lit.}} '[[author]]') is an artist, such as a [[film director]], who applies a highly centralized and subjective control to many aspects of a collaborative creative work; in other words, a person equivalent to an author of a novel or a play.{{sfn|Santas|2002|p=18}} The term is commonly referenced to [[filmmakers]] or directors with a recognizable style or thematic preoccupation.{{sfn|Min|Joo|Kwak|2003|p=85}}

Auteurism originated in the French [[film criticism]] of the late 1940s as a [[value system]]{{sfn|Caughie|2013|pp=22–34, 62–66}} that derives from the [[film criticism]] approach of [[André Bazin]] and [[Alexandre Astruc]]—dubbed '''auteur theory'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; by the American critic [[Andrew Sarris]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Auteur theory|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Andrew|last=Sarris|authorlink=Andrew Sarris|coauthors=|date=Winter 1962–1963|title=Notes on the Auteur Theory in 1962|journal=Film Culture|volume=27|issue=|pages=1–8|id=|url=https://dramaandfilm.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2011/06/Sarris-Notes-on-the-Auteur-Theory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was invented to distinguish [[French New Wave]] filmmakers from [[studio system|studio-system]] directors that were part of the [[Hollywood]] establishment,{{sfn|Santas|2002|p=18}} and has since been applied to producers of [[popular music]] as well as to [[video games|video-game]] creators.

==Film==
{{see also|List of film auteurs}}

=== Origin ===
[[File:Truffaut-BeauSerge.jpg|thumb|Film director and critic [[François Truffaut]] in 1965]]

Even before the auteur theory was clearly defined, the director was considered to be the most important among the people working on a film. Early German film theorist [[Walter Julius Bloem]] credited this to film being an art for the masses, and the masses being accustomed to regard someone who gives the final product (in this case, the director) as an artist, and those who contribute before (i.e. screenwriters) as apprentices.{{sfn|Bloem|1924}} &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battaglia|first=James|date=May 2010|title=Everyone's a Critic: Film Criticism Through History and Into the Digital Age|url=http://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=honors|journal=Senior Honors Theses|volume=|pages=32|via=Digital Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[James Agee]], one of the most famous film critics of the 1940s, said that "The best films are personal ones, made by forceful directors."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Around the same time, the French film critics [[André Bazin]] and [[Roger Leenhardt]] became advocates for the theory that it is the director that brings the film to life and uses the film to express their thoughts and feelings about the subject matter as well as a worldview as an auteur. They emphasised that an auteur can use lighting, camerawork, staging and editing to add to their vision.{{sfn|Thompson|Bordwell|2010|pp=381–383}}

===Development of theory===
The French magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' was founded in 1951 and quickly became a focal point for discussion on the role of directors in cinema. In [[François Truffaut]]'s 1954 essay "Une certaine tendance du cinéma français" ("A certain tendency in French cinema"), he criticized the prevailing "Cinema of Quality" trend in French cinema, saying that filmmakers were being unadventurous by adapting literary classics into unimaginative films. Truffaut said that these films treated the director as only a ''metteur en scene'', a "stager" who simply adds the performers and pictures to an already completed script.{{sfn|Thompson|Bordwell|2010|p=382}} Truffaut coined the phrase ''La politique des auteurs'' ("The policy of the authors") to describe his view, in which he expressed a clear preference for directors who operated with autonomy, vision and a signature style. These discussions were part of the beginning of the [[French New Wave]] in cinema.

From 1960, with his first self-directed film ''[[The Bellboy]]'', [[Jerry Lewis]] was one of the earliest Hollywood studio-system actor-turned-directors to be critiqued as an auteur. His attention to both the business and creative sides of production: writing, directing, lighting, editing and art direction coincided with the rise of the auteur theory. He earned consistent praise by French critics in both ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' and ''[[Positif (magazine)|Positif]]''. His singular ''[[mis-en-scene]]'', and skill behind the camera, was aligned with [[Howard Hawks]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Satyajit Ray]]. [[Jean-Luc Godard]] said, “Jerry Lewis...is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn’t falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ...Lewis is the only one today who’s making courageous films. He’s been able to do it because of his personal genius”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Hillier, ed.|title=Cahiers du Cinema 1960–1968 New Wave, New Cinema, Re-evalutating Hollywood (Godard in interview with Jacques Bontemps, Jean-Louis Comolli, Michel Delahaye, and Jean Narboni)|year=1987|page=295|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674090620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularization and impact===
[[Andrew Sarris]] coined the phrase "auteur theory" to translate ''la politique des auteurs'' and is credited for popularizing it in the United States and English-speaking media. He first used the phrase in his 1962 essay ''Notes on the Auteur Theory'' in the journal ''[[Film Culture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began applying its methods to Hollywood films, and expanded his thoughts in his book ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968'' (1968). The impact of Sarris' work was that critical and public attention on each film focused less on its stars and more on the overall product.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In the 1960s and the 1970s, the filmmaking industry was revitalized by a new generation of directors. Known as the [[New Hollywood]] era, these directors were given increased control over their projects.&lt;ref&gt;David A Cook, "Auteur Cinema and the film generation in 70s Hollywood", in The New American Cinema by Jon Lewis (ed), Duke University Press, New York, 1998, pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;Stefan Kanfer, The Shock of Freedom in Films, Time Magazine, Dec 8, 1967, Accessed 25 April 2009, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844256-7,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Studios showed an increase willingness to let directors take risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phase came to end in the 1980s, when high-profile financial failures like ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' prompted studios to reassert control.

=== Criticism ===
The auteur theory had detractors from the beginning. [[Pauline Kael]] was an early opponent and she debated it with Andrew Sarris in the pages of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and various film magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/movies/12powe.html A Survivor of Film Criticism’s Heroic Age]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/node/44957 Pauline and Me: Farewell, My Lovely]&lt;/ref&gt; Kael opposed privileging the director and instead argued that a film should be seen a collaborative process. In her 1971 essay ''[[Raising Kane]]'' (1971), on [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', she points out how the film made extensive use of the distinctive talents of co-writer [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kael, Pauline, "[[Raising Kane]]", ''The New Yorker'', February 20, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Corliss]] and [[David Kipen]] have argued that writing is more important to a film's success than the directing.&lt;ref&gt;Kipen,  David (2006). ''The Schreiber Theory: A Radical Rewrite of American Film History'', p.38. Melville House {{ISBN|0-9766583-3-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diane Garrett. "[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117930243.html?categoryid=1010&amp;cs=1 Book Review: The Schreiber Theory]." ''Variety'', April 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="corliss-obit"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/25/business/media/richard-corliss-71-longtime-film-critic-for-time-dies.html|title = Richard Corliss, 71, Longtime Film Critic for Time, Dies|last = Weber|first = Bruce|date = April 24, 2015|work = The New York Times|access-date = May 17, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2006 book, Kipen coined the term [[Schreiber theory]] to refer to the theory that the screenwriter is the principal author of a film.

Film historian [[Georges Sadoul]] pointed out that the main author of a film is not necessarily the director, but can be the main actor, screenwriter, producer, or even the author of the original story (in case of literary adaptations). Also, he argued that the film can only be seen as a work of collective and not as a work of a single person.{{sfn|Sadoul|1972}} Film historian [[Aljean Harmetz]], referring to the creative input of producers and studio executives in classical Hollywood, argues that the auteur theory "collapses against the reality of the studio system".&lt;ref&gt;Aljean Harmetz, ''Round up the Usual Suspects'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticize the auteur theory, and the practice of praising auteurs, for being male-dominated. Writing for ''[[IndieWire]]'' in 2013, Maria Giese noted that pantheons of auteur directors rarely included a single woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/12/auteur-directors-any-american-women-169108/|title=Auteur  Directors: Any American Women?|last=Giese|first=Maria|date=2013-12-09|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some point to the broader lack of women directors; the under-representation of [[women in film]] has been called the [[celluloid ceiling]]. In 2016, just 7% of all directors for the top 250 grossing movies were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/women-filmmakers-2016-statistics-show-female-directors-declined-number-963729|title=Study: Female Filmmakers Lost Ground in 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point to the lack of women in film schools, which has since changed. Now, Professor Martha Lauzen of [[San Diego State University]] says that women are represented in film schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/31/female-film-makers|title=Why are there so few female film-makers?|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|date=2010-01-31|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
There are references in law,{{vague|reason=The law where?|date=August 2016}} where a directed film is treated as a work of art and the auteur, as the creator of the film, is the original [[copyright]] holder. Under [[European Union law]], the film director is considered the author or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory.{{sfn|Kamina|2002|p=153}}

== Popular music ==
[[File:Phil Spector.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Record producer [[Phil Spector]] in 1964]]

The references of auteur theory are occasionally applied to musicians, musical performers and music producers. From the 1960s, [[Phil Spector]] is considered the first auteur among producers of popular music.{{sfn|Eisenberg|2005|p=103}}{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=38}} Author Matthew Bannister named him the first "star" producer.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=38}} Journalist [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]] wrote: "Spector created a new concept: the producer as overall director of the creative process, from beginning to end. He took control of everything, he picked the artists, wrote or chose the material, supervised the arrangements, told the singers how to phrase, masterminded all phases of the recording process with the most painful attention to detail, and released the result on his own label.".{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=15-16}}

Another early [[pop music]] auteur was [[the Beach Boys]]' multi-tasking leader [[Brian Wilson]],{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} who himself was mentored by Spector.{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|pp=32–33}} Before the [[progressive pop]] of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music.{{sfn|Willis|2014|p=217}} Wilson became the first rock producer to [[Recording studio as an instrument|use the studio as a discrete instrument]],{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|pp=32–33}} thus making the Beach Boys one of the first rock groups to exert studio control.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=193}} Music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on his influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Jason Guriel wrote that Wilson "paved the way for auteurs like [[Kanye West]] ... anticipat[ing] the rise of the producer ... [and] the modern pop-centric era, which privileges producer over artist and blurs the line between entertainment and art. ... Anytime a band or musician disappears into a studio to contrive an album-length mystery, the ghost of Wilson is hovering near."&lt;ref name="Guriel2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guriel|first1=Jason|title=How Pet Sounds Invented the Modern Pop Album|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/how-pet-sounds-invented-the-modern-pop-album/482940/|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video games ==
{{See also|Art game|Video games as an art form}}

In broadening the use of the terms associated with auteur theory, it has also been applied to the audio-visual environment as encountered in video games. Japanese developer [[Hideo Kojima]] (''[[Metal Gear]]'' series) is considered to be the first auteur of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hideo Kojima - video gaming's first auteur - Screen Robot|url=http://screenrobot.com/hideo-kojima-video-gamings-first-auteur/|website=Screen Robot|accessdate=7 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other auters include [[Tetsuya Nomura]] (''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series), [[Fumito Ueda]] (''[[Ico]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'', ''[[The Last Guardian]]''), [[Jon Van Caneghem]] (''[[Might and Magic]]'' series), [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] (''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-09-final-fantasy-xv-and-the-last-guardian-the-last-of-their-kind | title = Final Fantasy XV and The Last Guardian: The Last of their Kind | first = Rob | last = Fahey | date = 9 December 2016 | accessdate = 9 December 2016 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ragnar Tørnquist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the creator of Dreamfall got back to his roots - Polygon|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/4/25/4261002/the-longest-journey-of-ragnar-tornquist|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''binary clock''' is a [[clock]] that displays the time of day in a [[binary numeral system|binary]] format.  Originally, such clocks showed ''each decimal digit'' of sexagesimal time as a binary value, but presently binary clocks also exist which display hours, minutes, and seconds as binary numbers. Most binary clocks are [[Digital data|digital]], although [[analog signal|analog]] varieties exist. True binary clocks also exist, which indicate the time by successively halving the day, instead of using hours, minutes, or seconds. Similar clocks, based on [[Gray code]]d binary, also exist. 

== Binary-coded decimal clocks ==
[[File:Binary clock.svg|thumbnail|right|Reading a [[binary-coded decimal|BCD]] [[clock]]: Add the values of each column of [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] to get six decimal digits. There are two columns each for [[hour]]s, [[minute]]s and [[second]]s.]]
[[File:Digital-BCD-clock.jpg|thumbnail|right|Both clocks read 12:15:45.]]

Most common binary clocks  use six columns of [[LED]]s to represent [[0 (number)|zeros]] and [[1 (number)|ones]]. Each column represents a single decimal digit, a format known as [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD). The bottom row in each column represents 1 (or 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), with each row above representing higher powers of two, up to 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (or 8). 

To read each individual digit in the time, the user adds the values that each illuminated [[light-emitting diode|LED]] represents, then reads these from left to right. The first two columns represent the [[hour]], the next two represent the [[minute]] and the last two represent the [[second]]. Since zero digits are not illuminated, the positions of each digit must be memorized if the clock is to be usable in the dark.

== Binary-coded sexagesimal clocks ==

[[File:Binary clock samui moon.jpg|thumbnail|right|Time Technology's Samui Moon binary-coded sexagesimal wristwatch. This clock reads 3:25.]]

Binary clocks that display time in binary-coded [[sexagesimal]] also exist. Instead of representing each digit of traditional sexagesimal time with one binary number, each component of traditional sexagesimal time is represented with one binary number, that is, using up to 6 bits instead of only 4.

For 24-hour binary-coded sexagesimal clocks, there are 11 or 17 LED lights to show us the time.  There are 5 LEDs to show the hours, there are 6 LEDs to show the minutes, and there are 6 LEDs to show the seconds. 6 LEDs to show the seconds are not needed in 24-hour binary-coded sexagesimal clocks with 11 LED lights.

He grew up in largely rural Hungary and served in the Hungarian military during World War II. When Russia invaded Hungary in April 1945, he and his family fled to [[Occupation of Austria|Allied-occupied Austria]] and lived in a displaced persons camp for six years. In 1951, they emigrated to Chicago, sponsored by the Presbyterian church. Within the year his former commanding officer suggested to the U.S. government that they hire Bánáthy as a Hungarian instructor at the [[Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]] in [[Monterey, California]]. While living in Monterey, he founded the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program]]. 

His program gained national attention, and the [[Boy Scouts of America]] conducted research into incorporating leadership training into its programs. The Boy Scouts of America's [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] and [[National Youth Leadership Training|junior leader training]] programs had until then focused primarily on [[Scoutcraft]] skills, not leadership. [[William Hillcourt|William "Green Bar Bill" Hillcourt]] among others resisted the change.

After 20 years, Bánáthy left the renamed [[Defense Language Institute]] and went to work for the [[Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development|Far West Laboratory for Research and Development]] in Berkeley and later San Francisco. He retired from Far West in 1989 but maintained an active interest in social systems and science, including attending many conferences and advising students and others in those fields. In 1992, he helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association within his native country. In 2003, Bánáthy and Eva moved to live with their son Tibor in Chico, California. After a brief and unexpected illness, Bánáthy died on September 4, 2003.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

== Biography ==
Béla Bánáthy was born in 1919 in [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], Hungary, as the oldest of four sons. His father Peter was a minister of the [[Reformed Church in Hungary]] and his mother Hildegard Pallmann was a teacher.&lt;ref name=jenink&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Biography of Béla H.

When Bánáthy was about six years old, their family informally [[Adoption|adopted]] Tamas Feri. Tamas was about 13 years old and from a poor gardener's family. Tamas took Bánáthy on his first overnight camp out with his patrol to a small forest near [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]]. Bánáthy's father became the Scoutmaster of the "small scouts" troop (similar to American [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]]). When Bánáthy was nine years old, he became the troop leader.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

The family moved about {{convert|84|km|mi}} from Bánáthy's birthplace of Gyula, to [[Makó]], Hungary, about {{convert|202|km|mi}} southeast of [[Budapest]]. He joined the regular scout program of the [[Hungarian Scout Association]] and "Csanad Vezer" Troop 92. During the 1930s, the troop had more than 50 Scouts and 30 "small scouts". They held their monthly troop meetings on Sunday in a large [[Gymnasium (school)|gimnazium]] and met weekly every Saturday as a patrol. Bánáthy reported: "Our weekly patrol meetings focused on [[scoutcraft]] and Scout spirit and guiding us to move through the various stages of advancement in rank."&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;

The Hungarian Scout program had four stages. During the first three years, Bánáthy advanced three stages. The last stage required Bánáthy to earn 25 merit badges. This last stage was called [[Turul]], after the mythical bird of Hungary.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt; From spring to fall, as weather permitted, the patrol had many outings. Every summer the troop went on a two- to three-week long summer camp.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt; Bánáthy and his troop attended the [[4th World Scout Jamboree]] in 1933. Up until this time, he had intended to follow his father into the ministry, but changed his mind.&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;

Bánáthy later wrote,
{{quote|The highlight of the Jamboree for me was meeting [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden Powell]], the Chief Scout of the World. One day, he visited our camp with the Chief Scout of Hungary, [[Count]] [[Pál Teleki]] (who later became our Prime Minister), and the chief of the camp staff, [[Vitez]] Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff officer of the Hungarian Royal Army. A few years later he became the [[commander]] of the [[Ludovica Military Academy|Royal Ludovika Akademia]] (when I was a student there). In the 1940s, he became the Chief Scout of Hungary. (I was serving on his staff as head of national junior leadership training.)

For me the Jamboree became a crucial career decision point. I resolved to choose the military as a life work... There were two sources of this decision. One was my admiration of [[Lord Baden-Powell]], and his life-example as a hero of the British Army and the founder and guide of scouting. The other was the influence of Captain Varkonyi, a staff officer of the Jamboree, who was assigned to our Subcamp. We spent hours in conversation about scouting and the military as a career, as a major service in the character development of young Hungarian adults. After the Jamboree we corresponded for a while. By the end of the year I shared my decision with my parents.&lt;ref name=pinebhb&gt;{{cite web | title=Béla's Story: Scouting in Hungary, 1925-1937 |url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bhb.htm| author=Lew Orans| accessdate=2008-08-15| date=1996-12-14 |archivedate= February 28, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030228062045/http://pinetreeweb.com/bhb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While at the Jamboree, Bánáthy briefly met Joseph Szentkiralyi, another Scout from Hungary. Hungarian [[Sea Scout]] Paul Ferenc Sujan and American Maurice Tripp also attended. More than 20 years later, these three men collaborated in helping Bánáthy build a leadership program for youth in the United States.

Also in 1933, Bánáthy attended the regional patrol leader training week. Later in 1934, Bánáthy and six other members of his troop traveled to the National Jamboree in Poland. They camped in a large pine forest and visited [[Kraków]] and [[Warsaw]]. The Polish government hosted a banquet for all of the Scouts in the [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]].&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;  In 1934, he was awarded the best notebook prize of the national spring leadership camp and in 1935, he was invited to serve on the junior staff of the same camp at [[Hárshegy]], [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt; In 1935, the troop traveled to the [[Bükk Mountains]] in northeastern Hungary for their summer camp. As a Senior Patrol leader, Bánáthy and two others took a bicycle tour in advance of the summer camp to preview the camping site.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;

===Military service during World War II===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}

In 1937, Bánáthy entered the [[:hu:Ludovika Akadémia]] as was the custom for young men aspiring to military careers.&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt; In 1940, at age 21, he was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Mechanized infantry|armored infantry]].

The Hungarian Army expanded rapidly from an initial force of 80,000, but when fighting started, the rank-and-file of the army had undergone only eight weeks of training.&lt;ref name=mollo/&gt;

In 1941, Bánáthy's unit advanced as part of German [[Army Group South]] to within {{convert|140|km|mi}} of Moscow, during a severe November ice storm.  In 1942, as a soldier in the 109,000 strong [[Second Army (Hungary)|Second Hungarian Army]] (Second Magyar Honved), Bánáthy returned to the Russian front. They fought in the [[Battle of Voronezh (1942) |Battle of Voronezh]] at the Don River bend, supporting the German attack. They were charged with protecting the [[Italian Army in Russia|8th Italian Army's]]'s northern flank between the [[Liski, Voronezh Oblast|Novaya Pokrovka]] on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] to [[Rossosh]],&lt;ref&gt;Haupt, Army Group South. p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; part of the larger force defending the drive by the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 6th Army]] against Soviet General [[Vasily Chuikov]]'s [[62nd Army (Soviet Union)|62nd Army]], which was defending [[Stalingrad]]. Bánáthy was seriously wounded during the action, and he returned from the front to Budapest where he spent seven months recuperating. He married his fiancé, Eva Balazs, with his arm in a sling on December 5, 1942 in Budapest.&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;&lt;ref name=evanaturalization/&gt; 

Bánáthy was promoted as a [[junior officer]] of the [[Military of Hungary|Royal Hungarian Army]] and served on the faculty of the Ludovika Akademia under his mentor, [[Commandant]] Colonel-General Kisbarnaki General Farkas. Farkas sought a volunteer to teach junior leader training at the academy and Bánáthy volunteered. Farkas also asked Bánáthy to organize a Scout Troop for young men, 19 years and older, which was a common practice within the [[Magyar Cserkészszövetség|Hungarian Scout Association]] at the time.&lt;ref name="teleki"&gt;{{cite book | author = Balázs Ablonczy  | title = Pál Teleki (1879-1941)-The Life of a Controversial Hungarian Politician  | publisher =Columbia University Press  |location= New York  | year = 2006  | isbn=978-0-88033-595-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–134}} Bánáthy became committed to training the young men in officer's leadership skills; he served as the voluntary national director for youth leadership development and a member of the National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association.&lt;ref name=vitae/&gt;

In July 1944 Farkas was Commander of the Hungarian VI Army Corps, which had been [[garrison]]ed at [[Debrecen]]. He replaced General Beregfy, who was loyal to the fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. During that month, Farkas' VI Army Corp was instrumental in repelling a [[Red Army]] attack across the [[Carpathian mountains]].&lt;ref name=farkas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvg.hu/english/20070102_kisbarnaki_farkas.aspx| title=Was Kisbarnaki Farkas a war criminal?

He also knew he would likely be executed if captured. Bánáthy was able to get his wife Eva, one-year-old son [[Béla A. Bánáthy|Béla]] and two-week-old son László out of Budapest. Bánáthy's family, along with other officers and their families, found shelter at first in farmhouses, and later in bunkers, caves, and trenches.

When the Hungarian Second Army was disbanded on 1 December 1944 due to a lack of equipment and personnel, the remaining units of the Second Army, including Bánáthy's, were transferred to the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Third Army]]. The [[Siege of Budapest]] began when the city was encircled on 29 December 1944 by the [[Red Army]]. Bánáthy fought with the remainder of his unit against the Russians until after Budapest fell on 13 February 1945. The Axis was striving to protect the last oil fields they controlled in western Hungary around [[Lake Balaton]]. By late March 1945, most of what was left of the Hungarian Third Army was surrounded and destroyed about {{convert|40|km|mi}} to the west of Budapest in an advance by the Soviet 46th Army towards Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Hans. ''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.'' p 199. {{ISBN|978-0-517-12399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining shattered units fought on as they retreated progressively westward through the [[Transdanubian Mountains]] towards Austria.

Bánáthy's family and others of the remainder of his and other military units made their way west, along with tens of thousands of other refugees, about {{convert|250|km|mi}} into Austria, trying to stay ahead of advancing Russian troops. Temperatures through the time of their flight remained near {{convert|0|C|F}}.

===Life in displaced persons camp===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0100, Bayern, Hof Moschendorf, Flüchtlingslager.jpg|thumb|Refugee family in their quarters in Bavaria after the war ended in 1945.]]

Bánáthy reunited with his family in Austria. As the war ended and [[Occupation of Austria|Austria was occupied]] in April 1945 by the French, British, Soviet and US military forces, the family was placed in an Allied [[displaced persons camp]]. They were housed in a single {{convert|6|by|10|ft|m}} room in a wooden barrack; it served as their bedroom, kitchen, living room and firewood storage area. Food was extremely scarce and at times they subsisted on around 600 calories per person per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Arthur A. |last=Noyes |title=Austrian Food Must Be Cut, UNRRA Says |date=March 7, 1946 |publisher= |url=http://www.usfava.com/USFA_Articles6c.htm#article9|work=Stars and Stripes |pages= |accessdate=2008-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724223427/http://www.usfava.com/USFA_Articles6c.htm |archivedate=July 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were among 1.4 million displaced persons in Austria at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Early Occupation Period|url= http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont_USFA.htm|date= 2001-09-23|accessdate= 2009-09-11|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091205185731/http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont_USFA.htm|archivedate= 2009-12-05|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; during a worldwide food shortage as a result of the war. Food was also severely restricted by punitive U.S. policies including [[Morgenthau Plan#JCS 1067|directive JCS 1067]]. In 1947 German citizens were surviving on 1040 calories a day, but the Allies were also suffering from food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John | last = Dietrich | title = The Morgenthau Plan: Soviet Influence on American Postwar Policy | publisher = Algora Publishing | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-892941-90-2|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bánáthy later traded for milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As extremely little food was available in the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back to live with the older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the [[Cold War]] ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Occupation Zone]] to another.&lt;ref name=evaobit&gt;{{cite web|title=Eva Banathy Obituary|url=http://www.brusiefh.com/obituaries/Eva-Banathy-1216-2/#!/Obituary|website=Brusie Funeral Home|accessdate=7 April 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408082650/http://www.brusiefh.com/obituaries/Eva-Banathy-1216-2/#!/Obituary|archivedate=8 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hqmhbk.com/current.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712224600/http://www.hqmhbk.com/current.html |archivedate=July 12, 2011|title=Current Events|last=Borbas|first=K.|translator=L.B.G.

In 1948, shortly after their third son Tibor was born, the Banathy family was moved to another camp, near a [[Marshall Plan]] warehouse. Bánáthy was assigned to unload sacks of wheat from railroad cars. He contacted the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement|World Scouting Movement]] for assistance and began to organize  [[scouting in displaced persons camps|scouting in the DP camps]]. During 1947, Bánáthy was named the Hungarian Scout Commissioner for Austria; he led training for Hungarian Scout leaders along with his former commanding officer Farkas.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt;  He was ordained by the [[World Council of Churches]] and became minister for youth among Hungarian refugees. Banathy served as director of religious education of the Protestant Refugee Service of Austria, was editor of a religious youth service and of a Scout publication.&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt;

In 1948 Bánáthy's fourth son Robert was born. Bánáthy soon found work as a [[Draughtsman|technical draftsman]] in the statistical office of a U.S. Army warehouse.&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt;&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vitae&gt;{{cite web | title = C.

Seven-year-old Béla and six-year-old László Banathy, along with their Pallendal grandmother and two aunts, were put aboard a freight train and sent toward Russia.

===Begins teaching Hungarian language===
When World War II ended, General Farkas was designated as the U.S. Army's liaison to former Hungarian [[prisoners of war]]. In 1951 he recommended Bánáthy as a [[Hungarian language]] instructor, and Bánáthy was invited to teach at the [[U.S. government]]'s [[Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]] in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt; Bánáthy moved to Monterey in June 1951, a pivotal change in his life. At the Army Language School, he met Joseph Szentkiralyi ([[Americanization (immigration)|Americanized]] as St. Clair), the founder of the Hungarian Department. They soon figured out they had met at the [[4th World Scout Jamboree]] in 1933. The wives of the two men also realized they had been girlhood friends in grammar school in Budapest.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; Using her  experience managing the Pallendal family restaurant in Budapest before World War II, Eva took work as a waitress in a restaurant on the Monterey Peninsula.

Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name="herald2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Iron Curtain Parted, Sons Join Parents in Monterey after Nine-year Separation|date=1956-09-17|publisher=Monterey Peninsula Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally able to arrange for 13-year-old [[Béla A. Bánáthy|Béla]] and 11-year-old László to emigrate to the United States&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt; A photograph of the two boys greeting their mother was featured in ''[[Life Magazine]].''

== Professional life ==
Bánáthy was an educator, a systems and design scientist, and an author. At the [[Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]], he taught in the Hungarian language department, later becoming its chairman.

=== White Stag Leadership Development Program ===
{{Main article|White Stag Leadership Development Program}}

[[File:White stag founders 1968 fort ord.jpg|thumb|237px|Joe St. Clair, Fran Peterson, Maury Tripp, and Béla H. Bánáthy at the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program]] [[Indaba]] held at [[Fort Ord]], California, during November 1962. These four men, along with Paul Sujan, helped develop new [[National Youth Leadership Training|junior leader training]] and [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] programs that for the first time focused on leadership skills, not [[Scoutcraft]] leadership skills.]]
In 1957 Bánáthy began enlarging a concept for a leadership development program. As Council Training Chairman in the [[Monterey Bay Area Council]] of the [[Boy Scouts of America]], he received strong support from the Council Executive and Council Executive Board for his proposal to train boys in leadership skills. He was assisted by fellow Hungarians Joe Szentkiralyi (aka St. Clair, Chair of the Hungarian Language Department at the Army Language school) and Paul Sujan (Hungarian Language Instructor at the Army Language school); Fran Peterson (a member of the National Council and a Scoutmaster from Chular, California); and Maury Tripp (a Scouter from Saratoga, California, a member of the National Council, and a research scientist).&lt;ref name=wshistory /&gt;{{third party inline|date=March 2017}} "Lord Baden-Powell was my personal idol and I long felt a commitment to give back to Scouting what I had received", Bánáthy said.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news | title=Special Leadership Camps Held at Pico Blanco | author = Helene H. Parsons | publisher = Monterey Peninsula Herald | date = 1977-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his [[master's degree]] program in counseling psychology at [[San José State University]], he wrote a thesis titled "A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting".&lt;ref name="a_design"&gt;{{cite book |title = A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting |author = Béla Bánáthy |publisher = Monterey Bay Area Council |year = 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book described the founding principles of the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program|White Stag program]], which was later adapted by the National Council of the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref name="a_report"/&gt; Prior to Bánáthy's work, the adult [[Wood Badge]] and the [[National Youth Leadership Training|junior leader training]] programs had focused on teaching [[Scoutcraft]] skills and some aspects of the [[Scout method|Patrol Method]]. His research and findings on teaching principles and competencies of leadership had a huge impact on these two programs, shifting their focus to leadership skills.&lt;ref name=barnardhistory&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Wood Badge in the United States |url=http://www.woodbadge.org/history.html |year=2002 |author=Mike Barnard |work=Wood Badge.org |accessdate=April 6, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206114428/http://www.woodbadge.org/history.html |archivedate=December 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bsawbhistory"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Wood Badge in the United States|asin=B0013ENRE8|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some individuals on the national staff and many volunteers across the nation resisted the idea of changing the focus of Wood Badge from training leaders in Scoutcraft to leadership skills. Among them was [[William Hillcourt|William "Green Bar Bill" Hillcourt]], who had been the first United States Wood Badge Course Director in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Bar Bill Hillcourt's Impact on Wood Badge |url=http://www.woodbadge.org/hillcourt.html |year=2001 |author=Mike Barnard |work=Wood Badge.org |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316152939/http://www.woodbadge.org/hillcourt.html |archivedate=March 16, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although officially retired, he had many loyal followers. He was adamant that Wood Badge should continue to teach Scoutcraft skills and tried to persuade the national council to stick to that tradition, but his objections were ignored.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt;

The leadership competencies Banathy articulated became the ''[[de facto]]'' method for Scout adult and junior leader training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Troop Leader Development Staff Guide |publisher=Boy Scouts of America|year=1974|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2008, the White Stag program celebrated its 50th anniversary.) In 1960, the Monterey Bay Area Council recognized Béla for his exceptional service to youth and awarded him the [[Silver Beaver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jim|first=Himlyn|title=Image History of the Monterey Bay Area Council Silver Beaver Recipients|url=http://himlyn.com/mbac_history/silverbeaver.html|accessdate=11 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320224723/http://himlyn.com/mbac_history/silverbeaver.html|archivedate=20 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, due to the success of the White Stag program, Bánáthy was appointed to the [[Interamerican Scout Region (World Organization of the Scout Movement)|Interamerican Scout Committee]] and participated in three interamerican "Train the Trainer" events in [[Scouting in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Scouting in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], and [[Scouting in Venezuela|Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt; He guided their national training teams in designing leadership development by design programs. Béla also taught in [[Sunday School]] and was on the Board of the [[United Methodist Church]] of the Wayfarer in [[Carmel, California]].

===Systems science===

In the 1960s Bánáthy began teaching courses in [[applied linguistics]] and [[systems science]] at [[San José State University]]. In 1962 he was named Dean and Chairman of the East Europe and Middle East Division at the Army Language School, overseeing ten language departments. In 1963 he completed his master's degree in [[psychology]] at San Jose State University, and in 1966 he received a [[doctorate]] in [[education]] for a [[transdisciplinary]] program in education, systems theory, and linguistics from the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] in Berkeley. During the mid-1960s Bánáthy was named Chair of Western Division of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences|Society for General Systems Research]]. He published his first book, ''Instructional Systems,'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;

===Large complex systems===

During the 1960s and 1970s, Bánáthy was a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and as he continued teaching at San Jose State University. In 1969, he left the renamed Defense Language Institute and became a Program Director, and later Senior Research Director and Associate Laboratory Director, at the [[Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development|Far West Laboratory for Research and Development]] (now [[WestEd]]) in Berkeley (later moved to San Francisco). He "directed over fifty research and development programs, designed many curriculum projects and several large scale [[complex system]]s, including the design and implementation of a Ph.D. program in educational research and development for [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]".&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, he focused his research on the application of systems and design theories and methodologies in social, social service, educational, and human development systems. In the 1980s he developed and guided a Ph.D. curriculum in humanistic systems inquiry and social systems design for the [[Saybrook Graduate School]].&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

=== International Systems Institute ===

In 1981, he founded the International Systems Institute&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt; (ISI), a non-profit, public benefit scientific and educational corporation in [[Carmel, California]], USA. He organized its first meeting at [[Fuschl am See]], [[Austria]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;

Banathy introduced a unique and never-before used approach to organizing the International Systems Institute conferences. Banathy observed that in traditional conferences, a few usually well-respected or prestigious individuals would apply to present "pre-packaged new ideas" to others. In typical conferences, presenting almost always carries more prestige than listening; the few presenters share their wisdom with the many. This one-to-many or "hierarchical knowledge distribution system" slowed the sharing and spreading of ideas about which many people cared deeply if not passionately, as there was always limited opportunity for interchange among participants. This interaction was usually wedged into the interstices of the formal schedule in the form of informal, spontaneous gatherings for which no record existed.&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;

The notion that presenting is more important than listening aroused lifelong antipathy in Bánáthy. When he formulated the leadership competencies of the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program]] in the 1960s, he described the passing of knowledge from one to another as "Manager of Learning". He wrote extensively about how the focus should be on the learner, not the teacher.&lt;ref name="a_report"&gt;{{cite book | title = Report on a Leadership Development Experiment| author = Béla Banathy| publisher = Monterey Bay Area Council | year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bánáthy advanced a different vision for conferences, one that would allow everyone to fully engage. He proposed that everyone be given the opportunity to prepare and distribute papers to all participants in advance of the conference. And instead of listening to speeches, conference attendees took part in extended, non-hierarchical conversations about the conference papers. The conference proceedings were the result of these conversations.  Bánáthy felt strongly that systems scholars from all over the world should be given ongoing opportunities to engage in extended conversations so they might put their expertise "actively into the service of humanity worldwide".&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;

Bánáthy wrote: "We aspire to reap the 'reflecting and creating power' of groups that emerge in the course of disciplined and focused conversations on issues that are important to us and to our society". Participants at International Systems Institute gatherings have, since the original meeting organized by Bánáthy in 1982, organized them around this principle and referred to them as "conversations".&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;

===General Evolutionary Research Group===
In 1984, Bánáthy was co-founder with general evolution theorist [[Ervin László]] and others of the initially secret General Evolutionary Research Group, or General Evolutionary Research Group.&lt;ref name="GERG" /&gt; A member of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences|Society of General Systems Research]] since the 1960s, he was Managing Director of the Society in the early 1980s, and in 1985 he became its president.&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt; He then served on its Board of Trustees. During the 1980s, he served on the Executive Committee of the [[International Federation of Systems Research]].&lt;ref name="GERG" /&gt; In 1989, he retired from Far West Labs and returned to live on the Monterey Peninsula. He continued to serve as Professor Emeritus for the Saybrook Graduate School, counseling Ph.D. students. He also continued his work with the annual ISI international systems design conversations, and authored a number of articles and books about systems, design, and evolutionary research. He served two terms as president of the International Federation of Systems Research during 1994-98.&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt;

He coordinated over twenty international systems research conferences held in eight countries, including the 1994 Conversation on Systems Design conversation held at Fuschl Am See, Austria, sponsored by the International Federation of Systems Research.&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ifsr.org/node/33 Fuschl Conversations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017153101/http://www.ifsr.org/node/33 |date=2008-10-17 }}." ''[[International Federation for Systems Research]].'' November 25, 2007.

==Final years==

In 1992, Bánáthy, a long-standing member of the Hungarian Scout Association Abroad ([[Külföldi Magyar Cserkészszövetség]]), traveled from his [[Monterey, California]] home in the United States to Hungary following its renewed freedom. There, he helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association within his native country.&lt;ref name=wshistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitestag.org/history/history.html |title=White Stag History Since 1933 |first1=Joe |last1=St. Clair |first2=Alan |last2=Miyamoto |first33=Fran |last3=Peterson |accessdate=2008-10-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920115949/http://www.whitestag.org/history/history.html |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}{{third party inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third party inline|date=March 2017}}

Bánáthy spent considerable time during the last few years of his life caring for his wife Eva in their home in [[Carmel, California]]. She had been in poor health for a number of years after a stroke. In the summer of 2003 Bánáthy and his wife moved to live with their son Tibor in [[Chico, California]]. After a brief and unexpected illness, Bánáthy died on September 4, 2003. He and Eva had been married 64 years at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;!--THIS OBIT APPEARS FINE, AS IT IS A REPRINT OF AN INDEPENDENTLY PUBLISHED NEWS ARTICLE.--&gt;

'''Cildo Meireles''' (born 1948) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[conceptual art]]ist, [[installation artist]] and [[sculptor]]. He is noted especially for his installations, many of which express resistance to political oppression in Brazil. These works, often large and dense, encourage a phenomenological experience via the viewer's interaction.

==Life==
Meireles was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1948. From an early age, Meireles showed a keen interest in drawing and spatial relations. He was especially interested in how this has been explored in animated film.&lt;ref name="Farmer"&gt;Farmer, John Allen. “Through the Labyrinth: An Interview with Cildo Meireles.” Art Journal 59, no. 3 (2000): 34-43&lt;/ref&gt; His father, who encouraged Meireles' creativity, worked for the Indian Protection Service and their family traveled extensively within rural Brazil.&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/cildomeireles/about.shtm Tate: About Cildo Meireles]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Nuria Enguita, Meireles described a time when he was "seven or eight" and living in the countryside that had a huge impact on him. He said that he was startled by an impoverished man wandering through the trees. The next day, the young Meireles went to investigate, but the man was gone and only a small but perfect hut the man had apparently made the night before remained. Meireles said that this hut "was perhaps the most decisive thing for the path [he] followed in life...The possibility one has of making things and leaving them for others."&lt;ref name="Enguita"&gt;Enguita, Nuria. "Places for Digressions." in ''Cildo Meireles'' by Cildo Meireles. Valencia: IVAM, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in rural Brazil, Meireles learned the beliefs of the [[Tupi people]] which he later incorporated into some of his works in order to highlight their marginalization in, or complete disappearance from, Brazilian society and politics.&lt;ref name="g"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/11/cildo-meireles Guardian: Living dangerously]&lt;/ref&gt; Installations which contain allusions to the Tupi include ''Southern Cross'' (1969–70) and ''Olvido'' (1990). Meireles cites [[Orson Welles]]' 1938 radio broadcast ''[[War of the Worlds]]'' as one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century because it "seamlessly dissolved the border between art and life, fiction and reality."&lt;ref name="Farmer"/&gt; Recreating this concept of total audience investment was an important artistic goal of Meireles that is seen throughout his body of work.

He began his study of art in 1963 at the District Federal Cultural Foundation in [[Brasilia]], under the Peruvian painter and ceramist [[Felix Barrenechea]].&lt;ref&gt;Angélica Madeira: [http://www.unb.br/ics/sol/urbanidades/angelicamadeira.htm Conceptual Art in an authoritarian political context. Brazil, Brasília: 1967 – 1979]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, Meireles discovered the work of [[Hélio Oiticica]] and [[Lygia Clark]], thereby introducing him to the Brazilian [[Neo-Concrete]] movement.&lt;ref name="Mosquera"&gt;Cameron, Dan, Paulo Herkenoff, and Gerardo Mosquera. Cildo Meireles. London: Phaidon Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These artists, as well as Meireles, were all concerned with blurring the boundary between what is art and what is life, and responding to current political situations within their pieces.&lt;ref name="Farmer"/&gt;

Meireles unintentionally participated in a political demonstration in April 1964, when he was sixteen years old. He has cited this moment has his "political awakening" and began to take an interest in student politics.&lt;ref name="Mosquera"/&gt; In 1967 he moved to Rio de Janeiro and studied at the [[Escola Nacional de Belas Artes]].&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

Meireles currently lives and works in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name="tate"/&gt;

==Career==

Meireles has stated that drawing was his main artistic medium until 1968, when he altogether abandoned expressionistic drawing in favor of designing things that he wanted to physically construct.&lt;ref name="Mosquera" /&gt; A topic that he especially explored in his art was the concept of the ephemeral and the non-object, art that only exists with interaction, which prompted him to create installation pieces or situational art.&lt;ref name="Farmer"/&gt; This led to his ''Virtual Spaces'' project, which he began in 1968. This project was "based on Euclidian principles of space" and sought to show how objects in space can be defined by three different planes. He modeled this concept as a series of environments made to look like corners in rooms.&lt;ref name="Mosquera"/&gt;

Following the [[military coup]] in 1964, Meireles became involved in political art. When Meireles was "first getting started as an artist," governmental censorship of various forms of media, including art, was standard in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;Frank, Patrick. ''Readings in Latin American Modern Art''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008. 223-226.&lt;/ref&gt; Meireles found ways to create art that was subversive but subtle enough to make public by taking inspiration from Dadaist art, which he notes had the ability to seem "tame" and "ironic."&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;  In the early 1970s he developed a political art project that aimed to reach a wide audience while avoiding [[censorship]] called ''Insertions Into Ideological Circuits'', which was continued until 1976. Many of his installation pieces since this time have taken on political themes, though now his art is "less overtly political."&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;

He was one of the founders of the Experimental Unit of the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro in 1969 and in 1975, edited the art magazine ''Malasartes''.&lt;ref name=biog&gt;[http://www.mcu.es/promoArte/docs/Cildo_Meireles.pdf Spanish Culture Ministry: Biography] (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Meireles was honoured with a [[Prince Claus Award]] and in 2008 he won the Velazquez Plastic Arts Award, presented by the Ministry of Culture of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcu.es/premios/VelazquezPremiados.html Premio Velázquez de Artes Plásticas] (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key Works==

===''Red Shift'' (1967-84)===
A large-scale, three-room exploration of an entirely red environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/cildomeireles/rooms/room4.shtm Tate: Room 4 (Red Shift)]&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the installation refers both to the scientific concept of chromatic shift (or [[chromatic aberration]]) as well as to the idea of a "shift" as a displacement or deviation.&lt;ref name="Brito"&gt;Brito, Ronaldo. "''Desvio para o vermelho'' (Red Shift), 1967-84". ''Espaço de Arte Brasileira Contemporânea'', Museu de Arte Moderna. Rio de Janeiro: 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first room, called ''Impregnation'', is approximately 50 m² and filled with a number of everyday, domestic objects in a variety of different shades of red. The effect is an overwhelming visual saturation of the color. Upon entering the room, the participant experiences an initial shock from the visual inundation of red. Dan Cameron writes that "one's gaze is literally thwarted in an effort to gain a purchase on the specificity of things."&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;Cameron, Dan. "''Desvio para o vermelho (Red Shift)'', 1967-84." in ''Cildo Meireles'' by Dan Cameron, Paulo Herkenhoff, and Gerardo Mosquera. London: Phaidon Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its lack of chromatic differentiation, the environment appears to lack depth. Cameron argues that the longer a participant stays in the room the more aware they become of the color's negative, unsettling psychological impact on them.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt;

The second room is called ''Spill/Environment'' and consists solely of a large pool of red ink spilled from a small bottle on the floor, evoking mental associations with blood. The amount of liquid on the floor in comparison to the amount which the bottle could conceivably hold is disproportionate. The redness on the floor extends throughout the small room to the edge of the darkened third room, an effect which lends itself to feelings of foreboding and uncertainty.

The third room, ''Shift'', contains a washbasin attached to the wall at a 30° angle illuminated by a direct beam of overhead light. A red stream pours into the washbasin from a tap, also at a 30° angle, allowing the liquid to pool in the sink before draining. The feelings of disturbance experienced by the participant throughout the installation culminate in this final room. Since the room is completely dark, the sole focus is placed on the washbasin.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; While the connotations of blood which appear throughout the installation are at first rather vague, like in the initial saturation of red in the first room and in the ink spill of the second room, in the third room this association with blood becomes much more explicit, creating a final, visceral reaction to the color within the participant.

Art historian Anne Dezeuze has commented that the "cinematic" installation as a whole articulates a certain sense of menace within participants because of the intense repetition of the color red throughout the three rooms.&lt;ref name="Dezeuze"&gt;Dezeuze, Anna. "Cildo Meireles." ''Artforum International'' 47, no. 8 (2009): 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of Meireles' other artworks, ''Red Shift'' takes on political undertones when examined in light of Brazil's military dictatorship which lasted throughout the creation and exhibition of this piece.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; For instance, the red liquid pouring into the washbasin has been seen by some art historians as a visual representation of the blood of victims murdered by government authorities.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt;

===''Southern Cross'' (1969-70)===
A minimalist sculpture, on a Lilliputian scale: Meireles calls it an example of “humiliminimalism” – a humble brand of minimalism. He wanted it to be even smaller, “but when [he] sanded it down to [his] nails, [he] lost patience and stopped at nine millimeters." Unlike most minimalist sculptures it is no mere object, but it is meant to be as richly symbolic, sensuous and potent as an amulet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= A Tiny Wooden Cube as a Site of Crosscultural Friction and Collision|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?page_id=13616|work=InEnArt|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each half of the tiny 9mm by 9mm by 9mm cube is made of pine and oak. These two types of wood are considered sacred by the Tupi people of Brazil.&lt;ref name="Herkenhoff"&gt;"A Labyrinthine Ghetto: The Work of Cildo Meireles." in ''Cildo Meireles'' by Dan Cameron, Paulo Herkenhoff, and Gerardo Mosquera. London: Phaidon Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to an unofficial geographical (and metaphysical) region that lies to the west of [[Tordesillas]]. According to Meireles in a statement he made about the artwork in 1970, this region is "the wild side, the jungle in one's head, without the lustre of intelligence or reason...our origins." It is a place where "there are only individual truths."&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; In the same statement, he notes that he wants ''Southern Cross'' to be perceived as a physical representation of the memory of the Tupi ("people whose history is legends and fables") and a warning to modernity of the growing self-confidence of the primordial which will eventually result in an overtaking of the urban by the natural.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; Meireles' statement is also political. It is a caution against indifference, especially against indifference towards Brazil's fading indigenous population. The tiny cube is meant to be placed alone in the middle of an empty room in order to emphasize the reality and the power of indigenous belief systems in the context of Eurocentric modernism.

===''Insertions Into Ideological Circuits'' (1970-76)===
An art project with political undertones that was designed to reach a mass-audience. This project manifested in multiple ways, two of the most well-known being the ''Coca-Cola'' project, and the ''Banknote'' project. ''Insertions Into Ideological Circuits'' was based upon three principles as defined by Meireles: 1) In society there are certain mechanisms for circulation (circuits); 2) these circuits clearly embody the ideology of the producer, but at the same time they are passive when they receive insertions into the circuit; 3) and this occurs whenever people initiate them.&lt;ref name="Meireles"&gt;''Cildo Meireles.'' Valencia: IVAM, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of ''Insertions...'' was to literally insert some kind of counter-information or critical thought into a large system of circulated information. Meireles inserted something that is physically the same, though ideologically different, into a pre-existing system in order to counteract the original circuit without disrupting it. The project was achieved by printing images and messages onto various items that were already widely circulated and which had value discouraging them being destroyed, such as [[Coca-Cola]] bottles (which were recycled by way of a deposit scheme) and banknotes. Meireles screen-printed texts onto the [[Coca-Cola]] bottles that were supposed to encourage the buyer to become aware of their personal role in a consumerist society.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; The project simultaneously conveyed anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist messages. Building off of that concept, Meireles also used money as a theme and produced his own replica banknotes and coins (1974–1978) which appeared very similar to genuine Brazilian and US currency but with zero denominations clearly written on them, e.g. ''Zero Dollar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/cildomeireles/rooms/room1.shtm Tate: Room 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Putting an Olive Stone into a Bottle|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?p=13218|work=InEnArt|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mieireles also wrote critiques of the Brazilian government on the banknotes, such as "Who killed Herzog?" (in reference to journalist [[Vladimir Herzog]]), "Yankees go home!" and "Direct elections."&lt;ref name="Mosquera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dezeuze"/&gt;

===''Through'' (1983-89)===
A labyrinthine structure which invites the visitor to walk across eight tons of broken plate glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/cildomeireles/rooms/room2.shtm Tate: Room 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The maze is composed of "velvet museum ropes, street barriers, garden fences, blinds, railings, and aquariums" and in the center of it is a three-meter ball of cellophane.&lt;ref name="Merewether"&gt;Meireles, Cildo and Charles Merewether. “Memory of the Senses.” Grand Street, no. 64 (1998): 221-223&lt;/ref&gt; Meireles notes that an essential part of ''Through'' is the sense of psychological unease that comes from the participant's realization of the different sensory capacities and capabilities between the eyes and the body.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; For instance, the eyes can see through the glass parts of the work, but the body is physically impeded from passing through parts of the space. Furthermore, the sound of crunching glass underfoot while navigating the maze can be off-putting. He wanted the participant to experience psychological tension between the appreciation of the sonic and the appreciation of the visual. The work, Meireles says, "is based on the notion of an excess of obstacles and prohibitions."&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; Meireles drew some of his inspiration for this installation from writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]], whose subject matter sometimes included the concept of the [[labyrinth]].  Meireles also wanted the participant to experience feelings of awareness and attentiveness that come from walking a labyrinth.&lt;ref name="Farmer"/&gt;

===''Babel'' (2001)===
A tower of hundreds of radios, each just audible and tuned to stations of different languages to evoke resonances of the [[Tower of Babel]] in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/cildomeireles/rooms/room6.shtm Tate: Room 6 (Babel)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, before the destruction of the Tower of Babel by God, every person on Earth spoke the same language. Meireles' ''Babel'' acknowledges the multiplicity of language that resulted from the Tower's destruction in the story. The artwork contradicts the notion of one universal language, emphasizing that the pursuit of commonality is futile. Paul Herkenhoff points out that ''Babel'' also has autobiographical meaning for Meireles, as radio was a common method of widespread communication in Brazil during the artist's youth.&lt;ref name="Herkenhoff2"&gt;Herkenhoff, Paulo. "Learning and Dislearning to be Global: Questions at 44°53′ N, 93°13′ W, and 22°54′24″ S, 43°10′21″ W." ''How Latitudes Become Forms''. [http://latitudes.walkerart.org/images/text/herkenhoff_lattitudes.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The work also speaks to globalization. Meireles parallels the unity of humanity before the fall of the Tower of Babel with the present-day unity which has resulted from globalization despite numerous language barriers.

==Exhibitions==

Meireles considers his first exhibition to have occurred in 1965, when one of his canvases and two of his drawings were accepted by the Segundo Salão Nacional de Arte Moderna in Brasilia.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt;

A retrospective of his work was presented at the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]] in New York in 1999 and then traveled to the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro and the [[São Paulo Museum of Modern Art]]. In conjunction with the exhibition, a book entitled ''Cildo Meireles'', was published by [[Phaidon Press]] (1999).

The first extensive presentation of the artist’s work in the UK opened at [[Tate Modern]] in October 2008. Meireles was the first Brazilian artist to be given a full retrospective by [[Tate]].&lt;ref name="g"/&gt; This exhibition then moved to the Museu d'Art Contemporani in Barcelona, and later to the Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC) in Mexico City until January 10, 2010.

Meireles' most recent exhibition took place in Milan's HangarBicocca museum from March 27 to July 20, 2014. It featured twelve of his most renowned works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hangarbicocca.org/exhibitions/what-s-on/Cildo-Meireles-Installations/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113631/http://www.hangarbicocca.org/exhibitions/what-s-on/Cildo-Meireles-Installations/ |archivedate=2014-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3819">'''Citizen diplomacy''' (people's diplomacy) is the political concept of average citizens engaging as representatives of a country or cause either inadvertently or by design.&lt;ref name="usstateyouarea"&gt;{{cite web|title=You Are A Citizen Diplomat|url=http://diplomacy.state.gov/discoverdiplomacy/references/169794.htm|website=United States Department of State|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen diplomacy may take place when official channels are not reliable or desirable; for instance, if two countries do not formally recognize each other's governments, citizen diplomacy may be an ideal tool of statecraft. Citizen diplomacy does not have to be direct negotiations between two parties, but can take the form of: scientific exchanges, cultural exchanges, and international athletic events.

Citizen diplomacy can complement official diplomacy or subvert it. Some nations ban track-two efforts like this when they run counter to official foreign policy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Citizen Diplomacy is the concept that the individual has the right, even the responsibility, to help shape U.S. foreign relations, "one handshake at a time." Citizen diplomats can be students, teachers, athletes, artists, business people, humanitarians, adventurers or tourists. They are motivated by a responsibility to engage with the rest of the world in a meaningful, mutually beneficial dialogue.&lt;ref name="U.S. Center for Citizen Diplomacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscenterforcitizendiplomacy.org/|title=U.S. Center for Citizen Diplomacy|accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the pioneers of citizen diplomacy, physicist [[Robert W. Fuller]], traveled frequently to the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1970s and 1980s in the effort to alleviate the [[Cold War]]. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Fuller continued this work in political hot spots around the world and developed the idea of reducing [[rankism]] to promote peace. The phrase "citizen diplomacy" was first coined by [[David M. Hoffman]] in an article about Fuller's work which appeared in ''[[Co-Evolution Quarterly]]'' in 1981.{{cn|date=December 2017}}  [[Anti-nuclear]] groups like [[Clamshell Alliance]] and ECOLOGIA have sought to thwart US policy through "grassroots" initiatives with Soviet and (later) former Soviet groups.

'''Conspiracies against the laity''' is a term coined by [[George Bernard Shaw]] in his 1906 play [[The Doctor's Dilemma (play)|The Doctor's Dilemma]]. The conspiracies refer to the methods used by professions to acquire prestige, power and wealth.

On the subject of such conspiracies, [[Tim Harford]] argued the following in his 2006 book [[The Undercover Economist]]: "... doctors, actuaries, accountants and lawyers manage to maintain high wages through... erecting virtual 'green belts' to make it hard for competitors to set up shop. Typical virtual green belts will include very long qualification periods and professional bodies that give their approval only to a certain number of candidates per year. Many of the organisations that are put forth to protect us from 'unqualified' professionals in fact serve to maintain the high rates of the 'qualified' to whom we are directed."

Shaw's sentiments echo Adam Smith's earlier writing: "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data compression ratio''', also known as '''compression power''', is a [[computer science]] term used to quantify the reduction in data-representation size produced by a data compression algorithm.  The data compression ratio is analogous to the physical [[compression ratio]] used to measure substances.

==Definition==
Data compression ratio is defined as the ratio between the ''uncompressed size'' and ''compressed size'':&lt;ref name=CompressionRatioBroadcastEngineering&gt;{{cite news |title=Pixel grids, bit rate and compression ratio |publisher=Broadcast Engineering |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/storage-amp-networking/pixel-grids-bit-rate-and-compression-ratio |date=2007-12-01 |accessdate=2013-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010224651/http://broadcastengineering.com/storage-amp-networking/pixel-grids-bit-rate-and-compression-ratio |archivedate=2013-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CompressionRatioDigitalVideoandHD"&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital Video and HD: Algorithms and Interfaces|author=[[Charles Poynton]]|date=2012-02-07|publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann Publishers]]|edition=2nd|isbn=9780123919267}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-06-05--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CompressionRatioHEVCdraft10&gt;{{cite news |title=High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) text specification draft 10 (for FDIS &amp; Consent) |publisher=JCT-VC |url=http://phenix.it-sudparis.eu/jct/doc_end_user/current_document.php?id=7243 |date=2013-01-17 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CompressionRatioLogitechAVCStandard&gt;{{cite news |title=The H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) Standard |publisher=Logitech |url=http://www.logitech.com/assets/45120/logitechh.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CompressionRatioSonyBroadcastApplications&gt;{{cite news |title=White Paper on Performance Characteristics of MPEG-2 Long GoP vs AVC-I video compression techniques for Broadcast Applications |publisher=[[Sony]] |url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsccms/assets/files/micro/xdcam/solutions/MPEG-2_Long_GoP_vs_AVC_Comp-Strategies.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Compression\;Ratio} = \frac{\rm Uncompressed\;Size}{\rm Compressed\;Size}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a representation that compresses a 10 MB file to 2 MB has a compression ratio of 10/2 = 5, often notated as an explicit ratio, 5:1 (read "five" to "one"), or as an implicit ratio, 5/1. Note that this formulation applies equally for compression, where the uncompressed size is that of the original; and for decompression, where the uncompressed size is that of the reproduction. 

Sometimes the '''space savings''' is given instead, which is defined as the reduction in size relative to the uncompressed size: 

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm Space\;Savings} = 1 - \frac{\rm Compressed\;Size}{\rm Uncompressed\;Size}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a representation that compresses a 10MB file to 2MB would yield a space savings of 1 - 2/10 = 0.8, often notated as a percentage, 80%.

For signals of indefinite size, such as [[streaming audio]] and video, the compression ratio is defined in terms of uncompressed and compressed [[Bit rate|data rates]] instead of data sizes: 

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Compression\;Ratio} = \frac{\rm Uncompressed\;Data\;Rate}{\rm Compressed\;Data\;Rate}&lt;/math&gt;

and instead of space savings, one speaks of '''data-rate savings''', which is defined as the data-rate reduction relative to the uncompressed data rate: 

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm Data\;Rate\;Savings} = 1 - \frac{\rm Compressed\;Data\;Rate}{\rm Uncompressed\;Data\;Rate}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, uncompressed songs in CD format have a data rate of 16 bits/channel x 2 channels x 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz ≅ 1.4 Mbit/s, whereas [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] files on an iPod are typically compressed to 128 kbit/s, yielding a compression ratio of 10.9, for a data-rate savings of 0.91, or 91%. 

When the uncompressed data rate is known, the compression ratio can be inferred from the compressed data rate.

==Lossless vs. Lossy==
[[Lossless compression]] of digitized data such as video, digitized film, and audio preserves all the information, but it does not generally achieve compression ratio much better than 2:1 because of the intrinsic [[information entropy|entropy]] of the data. Compression algorithms which provide higher ratios either incur very large overheads or work only for specific data sequences (e.g. compressing a file with mostly zeros).&lt;ref &gt;S. Mittal and J. Vetter, "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7110612 A Survey Of Architectural Approaches for Data Compression in Cache and Main Memory Systems]", IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[lossy compression]] (e.g. [[JPEG]] for images, or [[MP3]] and [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] for audio) can achieve much higher compression ratios at the cost of a decrease in quality, such as Bluetooth audio streaming, as visual or audio compression artifacts from loss of important information are introduced. A compression ratio of at least 50:1 is needed to get [[1080i]] video into a 20 Mbit/s [[MPEG transport stream]].&lt;ref name=CompressionRatioBroadcastEngineering/&gt;

==Uses==
The data compression ratio can serve as a measure of the [[complexity]] of a data set or signal, in particular it is used to approximate the [[algorithmic information theory|algorithmic complexity]]. It is also used to see how much of a file is able to compressed without increasing its original size.

'''Deicide''' is the killing (or the killer) of a [[deity|god]]. The concept may be used for any act of killing a god, including a [[life-death-rebirth deity]] who is killed and then [[Resurrection|resurrected]].

==Etymology==
The term deicide was coined in the 17th century from [[medieval Latin]] ''*deicidium'', from ''de-us'' "god" and ''-cidium'' "cutting, killing."

==New Testament accounts==
{{See also|Jewish deicide|Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|Pilate's court}}
According to the New Testament accounts, the Judean (or Jewish) authorities in Jerusalem, the [[Pharisees]], charged Jesus with [[blasphemy]], a [[List of capital crimes in the Torah|capital crime under biblical law]], and sought his execution. According to {{bibleverse||John|18:31}}, the Judean (Jewish) authorities claimed to lack the authority to have Jesus put to death, though it is doubtful what legal basis such a claim would have had; the [[Jesus Seminar]] historicity project notes for {{bibleverse||John|18:31}}: "''it's illegal for us:'' The accuracy of this claim is doubtful." in their ''Scholars Version''. Additionally, {{bibleverse||John|7:53-8:11}} records them asking [[Jesus]] about stoning the [[adulteress]] and {{bibleverse||Acts|6:12}} records them ordering the [[stoning]] of [[Saint Stephen]].

They brought Jesus to [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman [[Prefect]] of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]], who was hesitant and let the people decide if Jesus were to be executed. According to the Bible, Pontius Pilate only ordered Jesus to be flogged. Washing his hands, Pilate said he would not take the blame for Jesus' death, to which the crowd replied, "[[Blood curse|His blood is upon us and our children]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:24-25|NAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilate is portrayed in the Gospel accounts as a reluctant accomplice to Jesus' death. Modern scholars say it is most likely that a Roman Governor such as Pilate would have no problem in executing any leader whose followers posed a potential threat to Roman rule.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} It has also been suggested that the Gospel accounts may have downplayed the role of the Romans in Jesus' death during a time when Christianity was struggling to gain acceptance in the Roman world.&lt;ref&gt;''Anchor Bible Dictionary'' vol. 5. (1992) pg. 399-400. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian analysis==
{{See also|Substitutionary atonement}}
The [[Catholic Church]] and other [[Christian denominations]] suggest that Jesus' death was necessary to take away the collective sin of the human race. The crucifixion is seen as an example of Christ's eternal love for mankind and as a self-sacrifice on the part of God for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Book of Concord, [http://bookofconcord.org/creeds.php "The Three Ecumenical or Universal Creeds,"] The Book of Concord Website, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gnostic]] [[Gospel of Judas]] contends that Jesus commanded [[Judas Iscariot]] to set in motion the chain of events that would lead to his death.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,190826,00.html "Ancient Manuscript Suggests Jesus Asked Judas to Betray Him,"] Fox News Website, Thursday, April 06, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a verse from a hymn written in 1892 for use in the [[Church of England]] to call upon God to convert the Jews to Christianity:
:Though the Blood betrayed and spilt,
:: On the race entailed a doom,
: Let its virtue cleanse the guilt,
:: Melt the hardness, chase the gloom;
: Lift the veil from off their heart,
:: Make them Israelites indeed,
: Meet once more for lot and part
:: With Thy household's genuine seed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/t/t/ttcforon.htm "Thou, the Christ Forever One"], words by [[Bill Bright|William Bright]], from ''Supplemental Hymns to [[Hymns Ancient and Modern]]'', 1889)&lt;/ref&gt;

Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of [[Hebrew Scripture]], Augustine countered that God had chosen the [[Jews]] as a special people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]. ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (Penguin Group, 2005) p 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely "Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at "the end of time", argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. (1999) ''The Spanish Inquisition'', Stroud, pp. 33–35, {{ISBN|0752417703}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews "survive but not thrive" (it is repeated by author [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]] in his book ''Constantine's Sword'', for example)&lt;ref&gt;James Carroll, ''Constantine's Sword'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1864878,00.html Paula Fredriksen, interviewed by David Van Biema, "Was Saint Augustine Good for the Jews?"] in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], December 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen interviewed by Van Biema, "Was Saint Augustine Good for the Jews?"&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law]], '''desuetude''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|sj|uː|ɪ|tj|uː|d|,_|ˈ|d|ɛ|s|w|ɪ|-}}; {{ety|fr|désuétude}}, {{ety|la|desuetudo|outdated, no longer custom}}) is a doctrine that causes [[statute]]s, similar legislation, or legal principles to lapse and become unenforceable by a long habit of [[Unenforced law|non-enforcement]] or lapse of time.  It is what happens to laws that are not [[repeal]]ed when they become [[Obsolescence|obsolete]].  It is the [[legal doctrine]] that long and continued non-use of a law renders it invalid, at least in the sense that courts will no longer tolerate punishing its transgressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kill All the Lawyers?: Shakespeare's Legal Appeal|pages=47|last=Kornstein|first=Daniel|isbn=9780803278219|year=2005|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|location=[[Lincoln, Nebraska]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of inserting [[Sunset provision|sunset clause]]s into a constitution or charter of rights (as in Canada since 1982) or into regulations and other delegated/subordinate legislation made under an act (as in Australia since the early 1990s) can be regarded as a statutory codification of this {{lang|la|[[jus commune]]}} doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Terrorism as a Challenger for National Ans International Law|pages=208|chapter=Specifics of National Legislation in Regard to Terrorism|last=Walter|first=Christian|isbn=9783540212256|year=2004|publisher= Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH &amp; Co.|location= Heidelberg, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English and Scots law==
The doctrine of desuetude has not historically been favoured in the [[common law]] tradition.  In 1818, the English court of [[King's Bench]] held in the case of ''[[Ashford v Thornton]]'' that [[trial by combat]] remained available at a [[defendant]]'s option in a case where it was available under the common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Hall| first = Sir John | year = 1926| title = Trial of Abraham Thornton | publisher = William Hodge &amp; Co|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of desuetude has more currency in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition, which is more regulated by legislative codes and less bound by precedent. The doctrine went into decline after the Middle Ages, when the idea became prevalent that the king's assent was required to nullify a law.&lt;ref name="Oglesby"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Law and the Search for Normative Order|last=Oglesby|first=R. R.|pages=110|year=1971|isbn=9789024750795|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=The Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine lasted longer in Scotland where it appeared to operate as a form of repeal. In Scotland, non-use is not the same as desuetude. Disuse must be accompanied by other identifiable provisions that would make the enforcement of the statute inconsistent: neglect over such a period of time that it would appear that a contrary custom had developed; and that a contrary practice had developed which is inconsistent with the law. Regarding the Scottish application, Lord McKay stated in ''Brown vs. Magistrates of Edinburgh'':&lt;ref name="Oglesby"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Brown v Magistrates of Edinburgh'' [1931] S.L.T. 456, per Lord MacKay at 558.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Desuetude requires for its operation a very considerable period, not merely of neglect, but a contrary usage of such a character as practically to infer such completely established habit of the community as to set up a counter law or establish a quasi repeal.}}

==United States law==
Desuetude does not apply to requirements of the United States Constitution.  In ''[[Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York]]'', 397 U.S. 664, 678 (1970), the [[United States Supreme Court]] asserted that:  "It is obviously correct that no one acquires a vested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by long use, even when that span of time covers our entire national existence and indeed predates it."

It may, however, have validity as a doctrine in defense of penal prosecution.  In 1825, the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] declined to enforce the traditional punishment of [[Cucking stool|ducking]] for women convicted as [[common scold]]s, stating that "total disuse of any civil institution for ages past, may afford just and rational objections against disrespected and superannuated ordinances."  ''Wright v. Crane'', 13 Serg. &amp; Rawle 220, 228 (Pa. 1825).

The seminal modern case under U.S. state law is a [[West Virginia]] opinion regarding desuetude, ''Committee on Legal Ethics v. Printz'', 187 W.Va. 182, 416 S.E.2d 720 (1992). In that case, the [[West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] held that penal statutes may become void under the doctrine of desuetude if:

# The statute proscribes only acts that are ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' (wrong because prohibited by statute) and not ''[[malum in se]]'' (intrinsically wrong);
# There has been open, notorious and pervasive violation of the statute for a long period; and 
# There has been a conspicuous policy of nonenforcement of the statute.

This holding was reaffirmed in 2003 in ''State ex rel. Canterbury v. Blake'', 584 S.E.2d 512 (W. Va. 2003).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtswv.gov/supreme-court/docs/spring2003/31150.htm ''Canterbury v. Blake''] West Virginia Judiciary website&lt;/ref&gt;

While it may not be a violation of due process to enforce a desuetudinal law, the fact that a law has long gone unenforced may present a bar to [[Standing (law)|standing]] in a suit to prevent its future enforcement.  In ''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'', the Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to Connecticut's ban on [[birth control]], writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The undeviating policy of nullification by Connecticut of its anti-contraceptive laws throughout all the long years that they have been on the statute books bespeaks more than prosecutorial paralysis ... "Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy ..."  &amp;ndash; or not carrying it out &amp;ndash; "are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text."&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=367&amp;invol=497 ''Poe v. Ullman''] [[FindLaw]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Connecticut's birth control law was enforced, and struck down, in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/381/479 ''Griswold v. Connecticut''] [[Legal Information Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3333">In mathematics, a '''divisibility sequence''' is an [[integer sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; indexed by [[positive integer]]s ''n'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\text{if }m\mid n\text{ then }a_m\mid a_n&lt;/math&gt;

for all&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n''.  That is, whenever one index is a multiple of another one, then the corresponding term also is a multiple of the other term.  The concept can be generalized to sequences with values in any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] where the concept of [[divisibility]] is defined.

A '''strong divisibility sequence''' is an integer sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that for all positive integers&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'',

:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a_m,a_n) = a_{\gcd(m,n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Every strong divisibility sequence is a divisibility sequence: if &lt;math&gt;m\mid n&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\gcd(m,n) = m&lt;/math&gt;. Then by the strong divisibility property, &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a_m,a_n) = a_m&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;a_m\mid a_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* Any constant sequence is a strong divisibility sequence.
* Every sequence of the form &lt;math&gt;a_n = kn&lt;/math&gt;, for some nonzero integer ''k'', is a divisibility sequence.
* Every sequence of the form &lt;math&gt;a_n = A^n - B^n&lt;/math&gt; for integers &lt;math&gt;A&gt;B&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is  a divisibility sequence.
* The [[Fibonacci numbers]] {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} form a strong divisibility sequence.
* More generally, any [[Lucas sequence]] of the first kind {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'',''Q'')}} is a divisibility sequence. Moreover, it is a strong divisibility sequence when {{math|1=gcd(''P'',''Q'')=1}}.
* [[Elliptic divisibility sequence]]s are another class of such sequences.

The '''domestic pigeon''' (''Columba livia domestica'') is a [[Columbidae|pigeon]] [[subspecies]] that was derived from the [[rock dove]] (also called the [[rock pigeon]]). The rock pigeon is the world's oldest [[domesticated]] bird. [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablets mention the domestication of pigeons more than 5,000 years ago, as do [[Egypt]]ian [[hieroglyph]]ics.&lt;ref name="Blechman"&gt;{{cite book| last =Blechman | first =Andrew | title =Pigeons-The fascinating saga of the world's most revered and reviled bird. | publisher =University of Queensland Press | year =2007| location =St Lucia, Queensland | url =http://andrewblechman.com/pigeons/learn_more.html| isbn =978-0-7022-3641-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that domestication of pigeons occurred as early as 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Blechman" /&gt;

Pigeons have made contributions of considerable importance to humanity, especially in times of war.&lt;ref name="Levi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levi |first=Wendell |title= The Pigeon|year= 1977|publisher= Levi Publishing Co, Inc|location= Sumter, S.C.|isbn=0-85390-013-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In war the homing ability of pigeons has been put to use by making them messengers. So-called [[war pigeon]]s have carried many vital messages and some have been decorated for their services. Medals such as the [[Croix de guerre]], awarded to [[Cher Ami]], and the [[Dickin Medal]] awarded to the pigeons [[G.I. Joe (pigeon)|G.I. Joe]] and [[Paddy (pigeon)|Paddy]], amongst 32 others, have been awarded to pigeons for their services in saving human lives.

==Reproduction==
Domestic pigeons reproduce in a similar way to the wild [[rock pigeon#Reproduction|rock pigeon]]. Generally humans will select breeding partners. [[Crop milk]] or [[pigeon milk]] produced by both male and female parent birds may occasionally be replaced with [[Crop milk#Hand-rearing pigeon chicks|artificial substitutes]]. Pigeons are extremely protective of their eggs, and in some cases will go to severe lengths to protect their productive eggs and have been known to seek revenge on those who interfere with their productive process. Baby pigeons are called ''squeakers'' or ''squabs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Gorman | first =Kate | title =Bird lady of Haslet helps to elevate occasions | publisher =Star Telegram (Jun 15, 2008) | url =http://www.star-telegram.com/407/story/700926.html | accessdate =2008-06-25 }}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained domestic pigeons are able to return to the home loft if released at a location that they have never visited before and that may be up to [[1 E6 m|1000 km]] away. A special breed, called [[homing pigeon]]s has been developed through selective breeding to carry messages and members of this variety of pigeon are still being used in the sport of [[pigeon racing]] and the [[release dove|white release dove]] ceremony at weddings and funerals.

The ability a pigeon has to return home from a strange location necessitates two sorts of information. The first, called "map sense" is their geographic location. The second, "compass sense" is the bearing they need to fly from their new location in order to reach their home. Both of these senses, however, respond to a number of different cues in different situations. The most popular conception of how pigeons are able to do this is that they are able to sense the [[Earth's magnetic field]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Von Middendorff|first=A.|year=1859|title=Die Isepiptesen Rußlands|journal=Mémoires de l'Académie impériale des Sciences de St. Pétersbourg, VI, Ser. Tome|volume=8|pages=1–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viguier|first=C.|year=1882|title= Le sens de l’orientation et ses organes chez les animaux et chez l’homme|journal= Revne Philosophique de la France et de l'Étranger|volume=14|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = W. | last2 = Wiltschko | first2 = R. | year = 1996 | title = Magnetic Orientation in Birds | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 199 | issue = | pages = 29–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with tiny magnetic tissues in their head ([[magnetoception]]){{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. This is all the more surprising as they are not a [[bird migration|migratory]] species, which is a fact used by some ornithologists to dispute this theory{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Another theory is that pigeons have compass sense, which uses the position of the sun, along with an internal clock, to work out direction. However, studies have shown that if magnetic disruption or clock changes disrupt these senses, the pigeon can still manage to get home. The variability in the effects of manipulations to these sense of the pigeons indicates that there is more than one cue on which navigation is based and that map sense appears to rely on a comparison of available cues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = W. | last2 = Wiltschko | first2 = R. | year = 2003 | title = Avian navigation: from historical to modern concepts | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 257–272 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other purposes of pigeon breeding==

===For food===
{{Main|Squab}}
Pigeons are also bred for meat, generally called squab and harvested from young birds. Pigeons grow to a very large size in the nest before they are [[fledge]]d and able to fly, and in this stage of their development (when they are called squabs) they are prized as food. For commercial meat production a breed of large white pigeon, named "[[King (pigeon)|King pigeon]]," has been developed by selective breeding. Breeds of pigeons developed for their meat are collectively known as [[utility pigeons]].

===Exhibition breeds===
{{Main|Fancy pigeon}}
[[Pigeon keeping|Pigeon fanciers]] developed many exotic forms of pigeon. These are generally classed as [[fancy pigeon]]s. Fanciers compete against each other at exhibitions or shows and the different forms or [[breed]]s are judged to a [[Breed standard|standard]] to decide who has the best bird. Among those breeds are the [[English carrier pigeon]]s, a variety of pigeon with [[wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] and a unique, almost vertical, stance ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071210183002/http://members.aol.com/duiven/highlight/carrier/carrier.htm pictures]). There are many ornamental breeds of pigeons, including the "Duchess" breed, which has as a prominent characteristic feet that are completely covered by a sort of fan of feathers. The [[fantail pigeon]]s are also very ornamental with their fan-shaped tail feathers.

===Flying/Sporting===
[[File:Domestic Pigeon Flock.jpg|thumb|right|Domestic pigeons in flight]]
{{Main|Flying/Sporting pigeons}}
Pigeons are also kept by enthusiasts for the enjoyment of [[Flying/Sporting pigeons|Flying/Sporting]] competitions. Breeds such as [[tippler]]s are flown in endurance contests by their owners.

==Experimentation==
Domestic pigeons are also commonly used in laboratory experiments in biology, medicine and [[cognitive science]].

===Cognitive science===
Pigeons have been trained to distinguish between [[cubism|cubist]] and [[impressionism|impressionist]] paintings, for instance. In Project Sea Hunt, a US coast guard search and rescue project in the 1970s/1980s, pigeons were shown to be more effective than humans in spotting shipwreck victims at sea.&lt;ref name=uscg&gt;{{cite web

Pigeons are able to acquire orthographic processing skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Damian Scarf|author2=Karoline Boy|author3=Anelisie Uber Reinert|author4=Jack Devine|author5=Onur Güntürkün|author6=Michael Colombo|title=Orthographic processing in pigeons (Columba livia)|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2016|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/13/1607870113.full|access-date=24 September 2016|doi=10.1073/pnas.1607870113|pmc=5056114}}&lt;/ref&gt; which form part of the ability to read, and basic numerical skills equivalent to those shown in primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Damian Scarf|author2=Harlene Hayne|author3=Michael Colombo|title=Pigeons on par with primates in numerical competence|journal=Science|date=2016|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6063/1664|access-date=24 September 2016|doi=10.1126/science.1213357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal predator killing by enthusiasts==
In the [[United States]], some pigeon keepers illegally trap and kill [[hawk]]s and [[falcon]]s to protect their pigeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | last =Milstein
 | first =Michael
 | title =Fight pits pigeon, hawk lovers
 | publisher =The Oregonian

 | accessdate =2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In American pigeon-related organizations, some enthusiasts have openly shared their experiences of killing hawks and falcons, although this is frowned upon by the majority of fanciers. None of the major clubs condone this practice. It is estimated that almost 1,000 birds of prey have been killed in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and that 1,000–2,000 are killed in southern [[California]] annually. In June 2007, three Oregon men were indicted with misdemeanour violations of the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]] for killing birds of prey. Seven Californians and a [[Texas|Texan]] were also charged in the case.

In the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region of the [[United Kingdom]] pigeon fanciers have been blamed for a trap campaign to kill [[peregrine falcon]]s. Eight illegal spring-loaded traps were found close to peregrine nests and at least one of the protected birds died. The steel traps are thought to have been set as part of a "concerted campaign" to kill as many of the birds as possible in the West Midlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Smith | first =Lewis | title =Pigeon fanciers blamed for trap campaign to kill peregrine falcons | publisher =Times Online  | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4029413.ece | format =Online news  | accessdate =2008-06-20  | location=London | date=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pigeon related illness==
[[File:Chicago pigeon in flight 2.jpg|thumb|Chicago-native ''Columba livia domestica'' in flight.]]
Pigeon breeders sometimes suffer from an ailment known as ''[[bird fancier's lung]]'' or ''pigeon lung''. A form of [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], ''pigeon lung'' is caused by the inhalation of the avian proteins found in feathers and dung. It can sometimes be combated by wearing a filtered mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other pigeon related pathogens causing lung disease are ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'' (which causes [[psittacosis]], ''[[Histoplasma capsulatum]]'' (which causes [[histoplasmosis]] and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', which causes [[cryptococcosis]].

==Feral pigeons==
{{Main|Feral pigeon}}
[[File:WinterPigeons02.jpg|right|thumb|Feral rock pigeons commonly show a very wide range of plumage variation.]]

Many domestic birds have escaped or been released over the years, and have given rise to the [[feral]] pigeon. These show a variety of plumages, although some look very much like pure rock pigeons. The scarcity of the pure wild species is partly due to interbreeding with feral birds. Domestic pigeons can often be distinguished from feral pigeons because they usually have a metal or plastic band around one (sometimes both) legs which shows, by a number on it, that they are registered to an owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Porter | first =Cynthya | title =Goodview man finds racing pigeon | publisher =Winona Post | url =http://www.winonapost.com/stock/functions/VDG_Pub/detail.php?choice=25710&amp;home_page=1&amp;archives= | accessdate =2008-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''entitlement''' is a [[provision (accounting)|provision]] made in accordance with a [[law|legal framework]] of a society. Typically, entitlements are based on concepts of [[principle]] ("[[rights]]") which are themselves based in concepts of [[social equality]] or [[enfranchisement]]. In recent decades the meaning of the word has been extended to encompass informal expectations of social relationships, social conventions and [[social norms]] which are considered unreasonable or unduly prescriptive upon others{{clarify|date=October 2018}}{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

== Psychology ==
[[Psychoanalysis]] differentiated among children three main varieties of the sense of entitlement: normal; inflated; and compromised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; A normal or healthy sense of entitlement included an expectation of responsiveness from significant others,&lt;ref&gt;A. Goldberg, ''Advances in Self-Psychology'' (2013) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; a sense of agency, and a sense of one's right to one's own feelings - all forming positive elements in [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Ronningstam, ''Identifying and Understanding the Narcissistic Personality'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The inflated sense of entitlement sought special privileges for the individual alone, perhaps to compensate for childhood suffering or [[narcissistic injury]]; while the compromised sense involved an inability to expect the basic rights enjoyed by those around one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy]] distinguished in adult life between (ethically) ''earning'' entitlement in relationships, through care and consideration, and a subjective feeling of entitlement the real basis for which may be very different.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 109-10&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the depressive may have an unjustifiably low sense of entitlement, the manic an exaggeratedly high one.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The gambler may feel ''entitled'' to expect a big win, to compensate for childhood deprivation; those who clamour most loudly for such reimbursement from fate may in fact unconsciously doubt their entitlement to anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis''. (London 1946) p. 372 and p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

An inflated sense of what is sometimes called ''psychological entitlement''&lt;ref&gt;L. Ashner, ''When is Enough, Enough?'' (1997) p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; - unrealistic, [[exaggerated]], or rigidly held - is especially prominent among narcissists.  According to the [[DSM-5]], individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] (NPD) are likely to have a "sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others", typically without commensurate qualities or accomplishments:&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{citation|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.)|location=Arlington|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|pages=669–672|isbn=0890425558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{citation|author=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Narcissistic personality disorder: Symptoms|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|date=18 Nov 2014|accessdate=29 Apr 2016|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/con-20025568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to [[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin]], the [[narcissistic]] personality attempts to protect the [[vulnerable self]] by building layers of [[grandiosity]] and a huge sense of entitlement.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Farrell, ''Acts of Trust'' (2010) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

While an earned sense of entitlement is usually seen as more beneficent than purely psychological entitlement, it can also have a destructive counterpart in the sense of a felt entitlement to revenge based on the accumulation of grievances.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection''' is an idea about [[genetic variance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12206233 | volume=56 | title=Perspective: Here's to Fisher, additive genetic variance, and the fundamental theorem of natural selection | journal=Evolution | pages=1313–6 | last1 = Crow | first1 = JF | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2002)056[1313:phstfa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.498.9934&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection Revisited by Sabin Lessard]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[population genetics]] developed by the [[statistics|statistician]] and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Ronald Fisher]]. The proper way of applying the abstract mathematics of the theorem to actual biology has been a matter of some debate.

It states:

:"The rate of increase in [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of any [[organism]] at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time."&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;[[R.A. Fisher|Fisher, R.A.]] (1930) ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'', Clarendon Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

Or in more modern terminology:

:"The rate of increase in the mean fitness of any organism at any time ascribable to natural selection acting through changes in [[gene frequencies]] is exactly equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time".&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = A.W.F. | authorlink = A.W.F. Edwards | year = 1994 | title = The fundamental theorem of natural selection | url = | journal = Biological Reviews | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 443–474 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1994.tb01247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The theorem was first formulated in Fisher's 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt; Fisher likened it to the [[Second law of thermodynamics|law of entropy]] in [[physics]], stating that "It is not a little instructive that so similar a law should hold the supreme position among the biological sciences". The model of [[Quasi-linkage equilibrium]] was introduced by [[Motoo Kimura]] in 1965 as an approximation in the case of [[weak selection]] and weak [[epistasis]].&lt;ref  name="kimura"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimura|first=Motoo|title=Attainment of quasi linkage equilibrium when gene frequencies are changing by natural selection|journal=Genetics|year=1965|volume=52|pages=875–890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghKrimbas2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Rama S.|last2=Krimbas|first2=Costas B.|title=Evolutionary Genetics: From Molecules to Morphology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flmuDNNpYTIC&amp;pg=PA267|date=28 March 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57123-4|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely as a result of Fisher's feud with the American geneticist [[Sewall Wright]] about [[adaptive landscapes]], the theorem was widely misunderstood to mean that the average fitness of a population would always increase, even though models showed this not to be the case.&lt;ref name="Provine2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Provine|first=William B.|title=The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics: With a New Afterword|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Mj0ptluGeQC&amp;pg=PA163|date=May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-68464-2|pages=140–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[George R. Price]] [[Price equation|showed]] that Fisher's theorem was indeed correct (and that Fisher's proof was also correct, given a typo or two), but did not find it to be of great significance. The sophistication that Price pointed out, and that had made understanding difficult, is that the theorem gives a formula for part of the change in gene frequency, and not for all of it. This is a part that can be said to be due to natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = G.R. | authorlink = George R.

More recent work (reviewed by Grafen in 2003) builds on Price's understanding in two ways. One aims to improve the theorem by completing it, i.e. by finding a formula for the whole of the change in gene frequency, and accounting for the effects of mutations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Basener, W.F. &amp; Sanford, J.C., P.|year=2017|title=The fundamental theorem of natural selection with mutations|journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology|doi=10.1007/s00285-017-1190-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The other argues that the partial change is indeed of great conceptual significance, and aims to extend similar partial change results into more and more general population genetic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=Alan |date=21 August 2003 |title=Fisher the evolutionary biologist |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~grafen/cv/fisher.pdf |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society|The Statistician]] |publisher=[[Royal Statistical Society]] |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=319-329 |doi=10.1111/1467-9884.00362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to confounding factors, tests of the fundamental theorem are quite rare though Bolnick in 2007 did test this effect in a natural population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bolnick D.

In [[mathematics]], a '''function'''&lt;ref&gt;The words '''map''', '''mapping''', '''transformation''', '''correspondence''', and '''operator''' are often used synonymously. {{harvnb |Halmos |1970 |p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity. For example, the position of a [[planet]] is a ''function'' of time. [[History of the function concept|Historically]], the concept was elaborated with the [[infinitesimal calculus]] at the end of the 17th century, and, until the 19th century, the functions that were considered were [[differentiable function|differentiable]] (that is, they had a high degree of regularity). The concept of function was formalized at the end of the 19th century in terms of [[set theory]], and this greatly enlarged the domains of application of the concept. 

A function is a process or a relation&lt;!-- Please, do not link to [[Binary relation]], this is not the technical meaning that is intended--&gt; that associates each element {{mvar|x}} of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}},  the ''domain'' of the function, to a single element {{mvar|y}} of another set {{mvar|Y}} (possibly the same set), the ''codomain'' of the function. If the function is called {{mvar|f}}, this relation is denoted {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''{{space|hair}}(''x'')}} (read {{mvar|f}} of {{mvar|x}}), the element {{mvar|x}} is the ''[[argument of a function|argument]]'' or ''input'' of the function, and {{mvar|y}} is the ''value of the function'', the ''output'', or the ''image'' of {{mvar|x}} by {{mvar|f}}.&lt;ref name=MacLane&gt;{{cite book | last = MacLane | first = Saunders | authorlink = Saunders MacLane | last2 = Birkhoff | first2 = Garrett | author2-link = Garrett Birkhoff | title = Algebra | publisher = Macmillan | edition = First | year = 1967 | location = New York | pages = 1–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol that is used for representing the input is the [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] of the function (one often says that {{mvar|f}} is a function of the variable {{mvar|x}}).

A function is uniquely represented by its [[graph of a function|graph]] which is the set of all [[pair (mathematics)|pairs]] {{math|(''x'', ''f''{{space|hair}}(''x''))}}. When the domain and the codomain are sets of [[number]]s, each such pair may be considered as the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of a point in the plane. In general, these points form a curve, which is also called the graph of the function. This is a useful representation of the function, which is commonly used everywhere, for example in newspapers.

Functions are widely used in [[science]], and in most fields of mathematics. Their role is so important that it has been said that they are "the central objects of investigation" in most fields of mathematics.{{sfn |Spivak |2008 |p=39}}

| caption2  = This diagram, representing the set of pairs {(1,D), (2,B), (2,C)}, does ''not'' define a function. One reason is that 2 is the first element in more than one ordered pair, {{nowrap|(2, B)}} and {{nowrap|(2, C)}}, of this set.  Two other reasons, also sufficient by themselves, is that neither 3 nor 4 are first elements (input) of any ordered pair therein.
}}
Intuitively, a function is a process that associates to each element of a set {{math|''X''}} a unique element of a set {{math|''Y''}}.

Formally, a function {{math|''f''}} from a set {{math|''X''}} to a set {{math|''Y''}} is defined by a set {{mvar|G}} of ordered pairs {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} such that {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}, {{math|''y'' ∈ ''Y''}}, and every element of {{math|''X''}} is the first component of exactly one ordered pair in {{mvar|G}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=A. G. |title=Numbers, sets, and axioms: the apparatus of mathematics |page=83 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-24509-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXfmTHXvRXMC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%22function+is+a+relation%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for every {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''X''}}, there is exactly one element {{math|''y''}} such that the ordered pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} belongs to the set of pairs defining the function {{math|''f''}}. The set {{mvar|G}} is called the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]]. Formally speaking, it may be identified with the function, but this hides the usual interpretation of a function as a process. Therefore, in common usage, the function is generally distinguished from its graph. Functions are also called ''[[Map (mathematics)|map]]s'' or ''mappings''. However, some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. M. Apostol|title=Mathematical Analysis|year=1981|publisher=Addison-Wesley|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; reserve the word ''mapping'' to the case where the codomain ''Y'' belongs explicitly to the definition of the function. In this sense, the graph of the mapping recovers the function as the set of pairs.

In the definition of function, {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are respectively called the ''domain'' and the ''codomain'' of the function {{mvar|f}}. If {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} belongs to the set defining {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|y}} is the ''image'' of {{mvar|x}} under {{mvar|f}}, or the ''value'' of {{mvar|f}} applied to the ''argument'' {{mvar|x}}. Especially in the context of numbers, one says also that {{mvar|y}} is the value of {{mvar|f}} for the ''value {{mvar|x}} of its variable'', or, still shorter, {{mvar|y}} is the ''value of'' {{mvar|f}} ''of'' {{mvar|x}}, denoted as {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}.

The domain and codomain are not always explicitly given when a function is defined, and, without some (possibly difficult) computation, one knows only that the domain is contained in a larger set. Typically, this occurs in [[mathematical analysis]], where "a function {{nowrap|from {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}} "}} often refers to a function that may have a proper subset of {{mvar|X}} as domain. For example, a "function from the reals to the reals" may refer to a [[real-valued function|real-valued]] function of a [[function of a real variable|real variable]], and this phrase does not mean that the domain of the function is the whole set of the [[real number]]s, but only that the domain is a set of real numbers that contains a non-empty [[open interval]]. For example, if {{mvar|f}} is a function that has the real numbers as domain and codomain, then a function mapping the value {{mvar|x}} to the value &lt;math&gt;g(x)=\tfrac 1{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is a function {{mvar|g}} from the reals to the reals, whose domain is the set of the reals {{mvar|x}}, such that {{math|''f''(''x'') ≠ 0}}. In many cases, the exact domains are difficult to determine, but this is rarely a problem for working with such functions.

The [[range (mathematics)|range]] of a function is the set of the images of all elements in the domain. However, ''range'' is sometimes used as a synonym of codomain, generally in old textbooks.

===Relational approach===
Any subset of the Cartesian product of a domain &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a codomain &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is said to define a [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;R\subseteq (X\times Y)&lt;/math&gt; between these two sets. It is immediate that an arbitrary relation may contain pairs that violate the necessary conditions for a function, given above. 

A [[binary relation#univalent|univalent relation]] is a relation such that
:&lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R\; \land \;(x,z) \in R\quad\Rightarrow \quad y=z.&lt;/math&gt;
Univalent relations may be identified to functions whose domain is a subset of {{mvar|X}}.

A [[binary relation#left-total|left-total relation]] is a relation such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in X \;\exists y \in Y\colon (x,y)\in R.&lt;/math&gt;
Formal functions may be strictly identified to relations that are both univalent and left total. Violating the left-totality is similar to giving a convenient encompassing set instead of the true domain, as explained above.

Various properties of functions and function composition may be reformulated in the language of relations. For example, a function is [[injective function|injective]] if the [[converse relation]] &lt;math&gt;R^{\text{T}}\subseteq (Y\times X)&lt;/math&gt; is univalent, where the converse relation is defined as &lt;math&gt;R^{\text{T}} = \{(y,x)\colon (x,y) \in R\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=RM&gt;[[Gunther Schmidt]]( 2011) ''Relational Mathematics'', Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications, vol. 132, sect 5.1 Functions, pages 49 to 60, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|978-0-521-76268-7}}  [http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/relational-mathematics?format=HB CUP blurb for ''Relational Mathematics'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==

There are various standard ways for denoting functions. The most commonly used notation is functional notation, which defines the function using an equation that gives the names of the function and the argument explicitly.  This gives rise to a subtle point, often glossed over in elementary treatments of functions: ''functions'' are distinct from their ''values''.  Thus, a function {{math|''f''}} should be distinguished from its value {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} at the value {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in its domain.  To some extent, even working mathematicians will conflate the two in informal settings for convenience, and to avoid the use of pedantic language.  However, strictly speaking, it is an [[abuse of notation]] to write "let &lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the function {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} ", since {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} should both be understood as the ''value'' of ''f'' at ''x'', rather than the function itself.  Instead, it is correct, though pedantic, to write "let &lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the function defined by the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,}} valid for all real values of {{math|''x''}} ".  

This distinction in language and notation becomes important in cases where functions themselves serve as inputs for other functions.  (A function taking another function as an input is termed a ''[[Functional (mathematics)|functional]]''.)  Other approaches to denoting functions, detailed below, avoid this problem but are less commonly used.

===Functional notation===
First used by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1734,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=19 |title=Calculus of a Single Variable |author=Ron Larson, Bruce H. Edwards |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2010 |isbn=9780538735520}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is often useful to use a symbol for denoting a function. This symbol consists generally of a single letter in [[italic font]], most often the lower-case letters {{math|''f'', ''g'', ''h''}}. Some widely used functions are represented by a symbol consisting of several letters (usually two or three, generally an abbreviation of their name). By convention, the symbol for standard functions is set in [[roman type]], such as "{{math|sin}}" for the [[sine function]], in contrast to functions defined on an ''ad hoc'' basis.

The notation (read: "{{mvar|y}} equals {{mvar|f}} of {{mvar|x}}")
:&lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; 
means that the pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} belongs to the set of pairs defining the function {{mvar|f}}. If {{mvar|X}} is the domain of {{mvar|f}}, the set of pairs defining the function is thus, using [[set-builder notation]],
:&lt;math&gt;\{(x, f(x))\colon x\in X\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Often, a definition of the function is given by what ''f'' does to the explicit argument ''x.''  For example, a function ''f'' can be defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sin(x^2+1)&lt;/math&gt;

for all real numbers ''x.''  In this example, ''f'' can be thought of as the [[Function (Mathematics)#Function composition|composite]] of several simpler functions: squaring, adding 1, and taking the sine.  However, only the sine function has a common explicit symbol (sin), while the combination of squaring and then adding 1 is described by the polynomial expression &lt;math&gt;x^2+1&lt;/math&gt;.  In order to explicitly reference functions such as squaring or adding 1 without introducing new function names (e.g., by defining function ''g'' and ''h'' by &lt;math&gt;g(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(x)=x+1&lt;/math&gt;), one of the methods below (arrow notation or dot notation) could be used.  

Sometimes the parentheses of functional notation are omitted when the symbol denoting the function consists of several characters and no ambiguity may arise.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\sin x&lt;/math&gt; can be written instead of &lt;math&gt;\sin(x).&lt;/math&gt;

===Arrow notation===
For explicitly expressing domain {{math|''X''}} and the codomain {{math|''Y''}} of a function {{math|''f''}}, the arrow notation is often used (read: {{nowrap|"the function {{math|''f''}} from {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}"}} or {{nowrap|"the function {{math|''f''}} mapping elements of  {{mvar|X}} to elements of {{mvar|Y}}"}}):

:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;X ~ \stackrel{f}{\to} ~ Y.&lt;/math&gt;

This is often used in relation with the arrow notation for elements (read: "{{mvar|f}} maps {{mvar|x}} to {{math|''f''{{space|hair}}(''x'')}}"), often stacked immediately below the arrow notation giving the function symbol, domain, and codomain: 
:&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if a multiplication is defined on a set {{mvar|X}}, then the [[square function]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sqr}&lt;/math&gt; on {{mvar|X}} is unambiguously defined by (read: "the function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sqr}&lt;/math&gt; from {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|X}} that maps {{mvar|x}} to {{math|''x'' ⋅ ''x''}}")
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{sqr}\colon X &amp;\to X\\
x &amp;\mapsto x\cdot x,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

the latter line being more commonly written 
:&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto x^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Often, the expression giving the function symbol, domain and codomain is omitted.  Thus, the arrow notation is useful for avoiding introducing a symbol for a function that is defined, as it is often the case, by a formula expressing the value of the function in terms of its argument.  As a common application of the arrow notation, suppose &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\times X\to Y;\;(x,t) \mapsto f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is a two-argument function, and we want to refer to a [[Partial application|partially applied function]] &lt;math&gt;X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; produced by fixing the second argument to the value {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} without introducing a new function name.  The map in question could be denoted &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x,t_0)&lt;/math&gt; using the arrow notation for elements.  Note that the expression &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x,t_0)&lt;/math&gt; (read: "the map taking {{math|''x''}} to &lt;math&gt;f(x,t_0)&lt;/math&gt;") represents this new function with just one argument, whereas the expression &lt;math&gt;f(x_0,t_0)&lt;/math&gt; refers to the value of the function {{math|''f''}} at the {{nowrap|point &lt;math&gt;(x_0,t_0)&lt;/math&gt;.}}

===Index notation===

Index notation is often used instead of functional notation. That is, instead of writing {{math|''f''{{space|hair}}(''x'')}}, one writes &lt;math&gt;f_x.&lt;/math&gt; 

This is typically the case for functions whose domain is the set of the [[natural number]]s. Such a function is called a [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]], and, in this case the element &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; is called the {{mvar|n}}th element of sequence.

The index notation is also often used for distinguishing some variables called [[parameter]]s from the "true variables". In fact, parameters are specific variables that are considered as being fixed during the study of a problem.  For example, the map &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; (see above) would be denoted &lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt; using index notation, if we define the collection of maps &lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt; by the formula &lt;math&gt;f_t(x)=f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,t\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Dot notation===

In the notation 
&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x),&lt;/math&gt;
the symbol {{mvar|x}} does not represent any value, it is simply a [[placeholder name|placeholder]] meaning that, if {{mvar|x}} is replaced by any value on the left of the arrow, it should be replaced by the same value on the right of the arrow. Therefore, {{mvar|x}} may be replaced by any symbol, often an [[interpunct]] "{{math| ⋅ }}". This may be useful for distinguishing the function {{math|''f''{{space|hair}}(⋅)}} from its value {{math|''f''{{space|hair}}(''x'')}} at {{mvar|x}}. 

For example, &lt;math&gt; a(\cdot)^2&lt;/math&gt; may stand for the function &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto ax^2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \int_a^{\, (\cdot)} f(u)\,du&lt;/math&gt; may stand for a function defined by an integral with variable upper bound: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\mapsto \int_a^x f(u)\,du&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Specialized notations ===
There are other, specialized notations for functions in sub-disciplines of mathematics.  For example, in [[linear algebra]] and [[functional analysis]], [[linear form]]s and the [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]] they act upon are denoted using a [[dual pair]] to show the underlying [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]].  This is similar to the use of [[bra–ket notation]] in quantum mechanics.  In [[Mathematical logic|logic]] and the [[theory of computation]], the function notation of [[lambda calculus]] is used to explicitly express the basic notions of function [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] and [[Function application|application]].  In [[category theory]] and [[homological algebra]], networks of functions are described in terms of how they and their compositions [[Commutative property|commute]] with each other using [[commutative diagram]]s that extend and generalize the arrow notation for functions described above.

==Specifying a function==
According to the definition of a function, a specific function is, in general, defined by associating to every element of its domain one element of its codomain. When the domain and the codomain are sets of numbers, this association may take the form of a computation taking as input any element of the domain and producing an output in the codomain. This computation may be described by a formula. (This is the starting point of [[algebra]], where many similar numerical computations can be replaced by a single formula that describes these computations by means of [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] that represent computation inputs as unspecified numbers). This type of specification of a function frequently uses previously defined auxiliary functions. 

For example, the function {{mvar|f}} from the [[real number|real]]s to the reals, defined by the formula 
&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt{1+x^2},&lt;/math&gt;
employs, as auxiliary functions, the [[square function]] (mapping all the reals to the non-negative reals), the [[square root function]] (mapping the non-negative reals to the non-negative reals), and the addition of real numbers. The whole set of real numbers may be taken as the domain of {{mvar|f}}, even though the domain of the square root function is restricted to the non-negative real numbers; the image of {{mvar|f}} consists of the reals that are not less than one.

A computation that  defines a function may often be described by an [[algorithm]], and any kind of algorithm may be used. Sometimes, the definition of a function may involve elements or properties that can be defined, but not computed. For example, if one considers the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; of the programs in a given programming language that take an integer as input. The ''terminating function'' is the function that returns 1 if a program of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; runs forever when executed on a given integer input, and returns 0 otherwise. It is a basic theorem of [[computability theory]] that there does not exist an algorithm for computing this function. More generally, computability theory is the study of  [[computable function]]s, that is, the functions that can  be computed by an algorithm.

The above ways of defining functions define them "pointwise", that is, each value is defined independently of the other values. This is not necessarily the case.

When the domain of a function is the set of nonnegative integers or, more generally, when the domain is a [[well order|well ordered set]], a function may be defined by [[induction (mathematics)|induction]] or [[recursion]], meaning (roughly) that the calculation of the value of the function for some given input requires values of the function for ''lesser'' inputs. For example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]] is a function from the natural numbers into themselves that is defined by two starting values and a formula, recurring to the two immediately preceding arguments (see [[Function_(mathematics)#Index notation|above]] for the use of indices for the argument of a function): 
:&lt;math&gt;F_0=0,\quad F_1=1, \quad\text{and}\quad F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}\quad \text{for } n&gt;1.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[calculus]], the usual functions considered have extensive regularities. That is, the value of the function at a point is related to the values of the function at neighboring points. This allows defining them by [[functional equation]]s (for example, the [[gamma function]] is the unique [[meromorphic function]] such that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z+1)=z\Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt; for any complex {{mvar|z}} that is not a non-positive integer), by [[differential equation]]s (for example, the [[natural logarithm]] is the solution of the differential equation &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(\ln x)}{dx}=\frac 1x&lt;/math&gt; such that {{math|1=ln(1) = 0}}), by [[integral equations]] or by [[analytic continuation]].

==Representing a function==

As functions may be complicated objects, it is often useful to draw the [[graph of a function]] for getting a global view of its properties. Some functions may also represented [[histogram]]s

===Graph===
{{main|Graph of a function}}

Given a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y,&lt;/math&gt; its ''graph'' is, formally, the set 

:&lt;math&gt;G=\{(x,y)\colon x\in X \text{ and } y=f(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the frequent case where {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are subsets of the [[real number]]s (or may be identified to such subsets), an element &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in G&lt;/math&gt; may be identified with the point of coordinates {{math|''x'', ''y''}} in the [[Cartesian plane]]. Marking these points provides a drawing, generally a curve, that is also called the ''graph of the function''. For example the graph of the [[square function]]

:&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[parabola]] that consists of all points of coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x, x^2)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in \R.&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to draw effectively the graph of a function only if the function is sufficiently regular, that is, either if the function is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] (or [[piecewise]] differentiable) or if its domain may be identified with the integers or a subset of the integers.

If either the domain or the codomain of the function is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n,&lt;/math&gt; the graph is a subset of a [[Cartesian space]] of higher dimension, and various technics have been developed for drawing it, including the use of colors for representing one of the dimensions.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Histogram===
{{main|Histogram}}

Histograms are often used for representing functions whose domain is finite, or is the [[natural number]]s or the [[integer]]s. In this case, an element {{mvar|x}} of the domain is represented by an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of the {{mvar|x}}-axis, and a point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} of the graph is represented by a [[rectangle]] with basis the interval corresponding to {{mvar|x}} and height {{mvar|y}}.

In [[statistic]], histogram are often used for representing very irregular functions. For example, for representing the function that associates his weight to each member of some population, one draws the histogram of the function that associates to each weight interval the number of people, whose weights belong to this interval. 

There are many variants of this method, see [[Histogram]] for details.

==General properties==

This section describes general properties of functions, that are independent of specific properties of the domain and the codomain.

===Canonical functions===
Some functions are uniquely defined by their domain and codomain, and are sometimes called ''canonical'': {{anchor|Empty function}}

* For every set {{mvar|X}}, there is a unique function, called the '''empty function''' from the [[empty set]] to {{mvar|X}}. This function is not interesting by itself, but useful for simplifying statements, similarly as the [[empty sum]] (equal to 0) and the [[empty product]] equal to 1.
* For every set {{mvar|X}} and every [[singleton set]] {{math|{''s''}{{void}}}}, there is a unique function, called the '''canonical surjection''', from {{mvar|X}} to {{math|{''s''}{{void}}}}, which maps to {{mvar|s}} every element of {{mvar|X}}. This is a surjection (see below), except if {{mvar|X}} is the empty set.
* Given a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y,&lt;/math&gt; the '''canonical surjection''' of {{mvar|f}} onto its ''image'' &lt;math&gt;f(X)=\{f(x)\mid x\in X\}&lt;/math&gt; is the function from {{mvar|X}} to {{math|''f''(''X'')}} that maps {{mvar|x}} to {{math|''f''(''x'')}}
* For every [[subset]] {{mvar|X}} of a set {{mvar|Y}}, the '''[[canonical injection]]''' of {{mvar|X}} into {{mvar|Y}} is the injective (see below) function that maps every element of {{mvar|X}} to itself.
* The [[identity function]] of {{mvar|X}}, often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}_X&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical injection of {{mvar|X}} into itself.

===Equality of functions===
Two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are equal if their domain and codomain sets agree and their output values agree on the whole domain. Formally, ''f''=''g'' if ''f''(''x'')=''g''(''x'') for all ''x''∈''X'', where ''f'':''X''→''Y'' and ''g'':''X''→''Y''.

===Function composition===
{{Main|Function composition}}

Given two functions &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\colon Y\to Z&lt;/math&gt; such that the domain of {{mvar|g}} is the codomain of {{mvar|f}}, their ''composition'' is the function &lt;math&gt;g \circ f\colon X \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the value of &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by first applying {{math|''f''}} to {{math|''x''}} to obtain {{math|1=''y'' =''f''(''x'')}} and then applying {{math|''g''}} to the result {{mvar|y}} to obtain {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''g''(''f''(''x''))}}. In the notation the function that is applied first is always written on the right.

The composition &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt; is an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] on functions that is defined only if the codomain of the first function is the domain of the second one. Even when both &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; satisfy these conditions, the composition is not necessarily [[commutative property|commutative]], that is, the functions &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; need not be equal, but may deliver different values for the same argument. For example, let {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = ''x'' + 1}}, then &lt;math&gt;g(f(x))=x^2+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(g(x)) = (x+1)^2&lt;/math&gt; agree just for &lt;math&gt;x=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The function composition is [[associative property|associative]] in the sense that, if one of &lt;math&gt;(h\circ g)\circ f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h\circ (g\circ f)&lt;/math&gt; is defined, then the other is also defined, and they are equal. Thus, one writes 
:&lt;math&gt;h\circ g\circ f = (h\circ g)\circ f = h\circ (g\circ f).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[identity function]]s &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}_X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}_Y&lt;/math&gt; are respectively a [[right identity]] and a [[left identity]] for functions from {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}. That is, if {{mvar|f}} is a function with domain {{mvar|X}}, and codomain {{mvar|Y}}, one has 
&lt;math&gt;f\circ \operatorname{id}_X = \operatorname{id}_Y \circ f = f.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;gallery widths="250" heights="300"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Image and preimage===
{{Main|Image (mathematics)}}
Let &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y.&lt;/math&gt; The ''image'' by {{mvar|f}} of an element {{mvar|x}} of the domain {{mvar|X}} is {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. If {{math|''A''}} is any subset of {{math|''X''}}, then the ''image'' of {{mvar|A}} by {{mvar|f}}, denoted {{math|''f''(''A'')}} is the subset of the codomain {{math|''Y''}} consisting of all images of elements of {{mvar|A}}, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;f(A)=\{f(x)\mid x\in A\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''image'' of {{math|''f''}} is the image of the whole domain, that is {{math|''f''(''X'')}}. It is also called the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of {{mvar|f}}, although the term may also refer to the codomain.&lt;ref name = "standard"&gt;''Quantities and Units - Part 2: Mathematical signs and symbols to be used in the natural sciences and technology'', page 15.  ISO 80000-2 (ISO/IEC 2009-12-01)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the ''[[inverse image]]'', or ''[[preimage]]'' by {{mvar|f}} of a subset {{math|''B''}} of the codomain {{math|''Y''}} is the subset of the domain {{math|''X''}} consisting of all elements of {{math|''X''}} whose images belong to {{math|''B''}}. It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B).&lt;/math&gt;  That is 
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B) = \{x \in X \mid f(x) \in B\}.&lt;/math&gt;
For example, the preimage of {4, 9} under the [[square function]] is the set {−3,−2,2,3}. 

By definition of a function, the image of an element {{math|''x''}} of the domain is always a single element of the codomain. However, the preimage of a single element {{mvar|y}}, denoted &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x),&lt;/math&gt; may be [[empty set|empty]] or contain any number of elements. For example, if {{mvar|f}} is the function from the integers to themselves that map every integer to 0, then {{math|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(0) = '''Z'''}}. 

If &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a function, {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are subsets of {{math|''X''}}, and {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} are subsets of {{math|''Y''}}, then one has the following properties:
* &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq B \Longrightarrow f(A)\subseteq f(B)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C\subseteq D \Longrightarrow f^{-1}(C)\subseteq f^{-1}(D)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq f^{-1}(f(A))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C \supseteq f(f^{-1}(C))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(f^{-1}(f(A)))=f(A)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(f(f^{-1}(C)))=f^{-1}(C)&lt;/math&gt;

The preimage by {{mvar|f}} of an element {{mvar|y}} of the codomain is sometimes called, in some contexts, the [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] of {{math|''y''}} under {{mvar|''f''}}.  

If a function {{mvar|f}} has an inverse (see below), this inverse is denoted &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt; In this case &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(C)&lt;/math&gt; may denote either the image by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; or the preimage by {{mvar|f}} of {{mvar|C}}. This is not a problem, as these sets are equal. The notation &lt;math&gt;f(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(C)&lt;/math&gt; may be ambiguous in the case of sets that contain some subsets as elements, such as &lt;math&gt;\{x, \{x\}\}.&lt;/math&gt; In this case, some care may be needed, for example, by using square brackets &lt;math&gt;f[A], f^{-1}[C]&lt;/math&gt; for images and preimages of subsets, and ordinary parentheses for images and preimages of elements.

===Injective, surjective and bijective functions===

Let &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a function.

The function {{mvar|f}} is ''[[injective function|injective]]'' (or ''one-to-one'', or is an ''injection'') if {{math|''f''(''a'') &amp;ne; ''f''(''b'')}} for any two different elements {{math|''a''}} and {{mvar|''b''}} of {{mvar|X}}. Equivalently, {{mvar|f}} is injective if, for any &lt;math&gt;y\in Y,&lt;/math&gt; the preimage &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; contains at most one element. An empty function is always injective. If {{mvar|X}} is not the empty set, and if, as usual, the [[axiom of choice]] is assumed, then {{mvar|f}} is injective if and only if there exists a function &lt;math&gt;g\colon y\to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g\circ f=\operatorname{id}_X,&lt;/math&gt; that is, if {{mvar|f}} has a [[left inverse function|left inverse]]. The axiom of choice is needed, because, if {{mvar|f}} is injective, one defines {{mvar|g}} by &lt;math&gt;g(y)=x&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;y=f(x),&lt;/math&gt; and by &lt;math&gt;g(y)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;y\not\in f(X),&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is an ''arbitrarily chosen'' element of {{mvar|X}}.

The function {{mvar|f}} is ''[[surjective]]'' (or ''onto'', or is a ''surjection'') if the range equals the codomain, that is, if {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''Y''}}. In other words, the preimage &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; of every &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty. If, as usual, the axiom of choice is assumed, then {{mvar|f}} is surjective if and only if there exists a function &lt;math&gt;g\colon y\to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=\operatorname{id}_Y,&lt;/math&gt; that is, if {{mvar|f}} has a [[left inverse function|right inverse]]. The axiom of choice is needed, because, if {{mvar|f}} is injective, one defines {{mvar|g}} by &lt;math&gt;g(y)=x,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an ''arbitrarily chosen'' element of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y).&lt;/math&gt;

The function {{mvar|f}} is ''[[bijective]]'' (or is ''bijection'' or a ''one-to-one correspondence'') if it is both injective and surjective. That is {{mvar|f}} is bijective if, for any &lt;math&gt;y\in Y,&lt;/math&gt; the preimage &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; contains exactly one element. The function {{mvar|f}} is bijective if and only if it admits an [[inverse function]], that is a function &lt;math&gt;g\colon y\to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g\circ f=\operatorname{id}_X,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=\operatorname{id}_Y.&lt;/math&gt; (Contrarily to the case of injections and surjections, this does not require the axiom of choice.)

Every function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; may be [[factorization|factorized]] as the composition {{math|''i'' ∘ ''s''}} of a surjection followed by an injection, where {{mvar|s}} is the canonical surjection of {{mvar|X}} onto {{math|''f''(''X'')}}, and {{mvar|i}} is the canonical injection of {{math|''f''(''X'')}} into {{mvar|Y}}. This is the ''canonical factorization'' of {{mvar|f}}.

"One-to-one" and "onto" are terms that were more common in the older English language literature; "injective", "surjective", and "bijective" were originally coined as French words in the second quarter of the 20th century by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki group]] and imported into English.  As a word of caution, "a one-to-one function" is one that is injective, while a "one-to-one correspondence" refers to a bijective function.  Also, the statement "{{math|''f''}} maps {{math|''X''}} ''onto'' {{math|''Y''}}" differs from "{{math|''f''}}  maps {{math|''X''}} ''into'' {{math|''B''}}" in that the former implies that {{math|''f''}} is surjective), while the latter makes no assertion about the nature of {{math|''f''}} the mapping.  In a complicated reasoning, the one letter difference can easily be missed. Due to the confusing nature of this older terminology, these terms have declined in popularity relative to the Bourbakian terms, which have also the advantage to be more symmetrical.

===Restriction and extension{{anchor|Restrictions and extensions}}===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Subgroup]], [[Restriction]], [[Quadratic form]] --&gt;
{{main|Restriction (mathematics)}}
If &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a function, and {{mvar|S}} is a subset of {{mvar|X}}, then the ''restriction'' of {{mvar|f}} to {{mvar|S}}, denoted {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is the function from {{mvar|S}} to {{mvar|Y}} that is defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;f_{|S}(x)= f(x)\quad \text{for all } x\in S.&lt;/math&gt;

This often used for define partial inverse functions: if there is a subset {{mvar|S}} of a function {{mvar|f}} such that {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is injective, then the canonical surjection of {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on its image {{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') = ''f''(''S'')}} is a bijection, which has an inverse function from {{math|''f''(''S'')}} to {{mvar|S}}. This is in this way that [[inverse trigonometric functions]] are defined. The [[cosine function]], for example, is injective, when restricted to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|(–0, {{pi}})}}; the image of this restriction is the interval {{math|(–1, 1)}}; this defines thus an inverse function from {{math|(–1, 1)}} to {{math|(–0, {{pi}})}}, which is called [[arccosine]] and denoted {{math|arccos}}.

Function restriction may also be used for "gluing" functions together: let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X=\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i&lt;/math&gt; be the decomposition of {{mvar|X}} as a [[set union|union]] of subsets. Suppose that a function &lt;math&gt;f_i\colon U_i\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is defined on each &lt;math&gt;U_i,&lt;/math&gt; such that, for each pair of indices, the restrictions of &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;U_i\cap U_j&lt;/math&gt; are equal. Then, this defines a unique function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f_{|U_i} =f_i&lt;/math&gt; for every {{mvar|i}}. This is generally in this way that functions on [[manifold]]s are defined.

An ''extension'' of a  function {{mvar|f}} is a function {{mvar|g}} such that {{mvar|f}} is a restriction of {{mvar|g}}. A typical use of this concept is the process of [[analytic continuation]], that allows extending functions whose domain is a small part of the [[complex plane]] to functions whose domain is almost the whole complex plane.

Here is another classical example of a function extension that is encountered when studying [[homography|homographies]] of the [[real line]]. An ''homography'' is a function &lt;math&gt;h(x)=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}&lt;/math&gt; such that {{math|''ad'' – ''bc'' ≠ 0}}. Its domain is the set of all [[real number]]s different from &lt;math&gt;-d/c,&lt;/math&gt; and its image is the set of all real numbers different from &lt;math&gt;a/c.&lt;/math&gt; If one extends the real line to the [[projectively extended real line]] by adding {{math|∞}} to the real numbers, one may extend {{mvar|h}} for being a bijection of the extended real line to itself, by setting &lt;math&gt;h(\infty)=a/c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(-d/c)=\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

==Multivariate function {{anchor|MULTIVARIATE_FUNCTION}}==
[[File:Binary operations as black box.svg|thumb|A binary operation is a typical example of a bivariate, function which assigns to each pair &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; the result &lt;math&gt;x\circ y&lt;/math&gt;.]]
A '''multivariate function''', or '''function of several variables''' is a function that depends on several arguments. Such functions are commonly encountered. For example, the position of a car on a road is a function of the time and its speed.

More formally, a function of {{mvar|n}} variables is a function whose domain is a set of [[tuple|{{mvar|n}}-tuples]].
For example, multiplication of [[integer]]s is a function of two variables, or '''bivariate function''', whose domain is the set of all pairs (2-tuples) of integers, and whose codomain is the set of integers. The same is true for every [[binary operation]]. More generally, every [[mathematical operation]] is defined as a multivariate function.

The [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;X_1\times\cdots\times X_n&lt;/math&gt; of {{mvar|n}} sets &lt;math&gt;X_1, \ldots, X_n&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all {{mvar|n}}-tuples &lt;math&gt;(x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i\in X_i&lt;/math&gt; for every {{mvar|i}} with &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, a function of {{mvar|n}} variables is a function
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon U\to Y,&lt;/math&gt;
where the domain {{mvar|U}} has the form
:&lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X_1\times\cdots\times X_n.&lt;/math&gt;
When using function notation, one usually omits the parentheses surrounding tuples, writing &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f((x_1,x_2)).&lt;/math&gt;

In the case where all the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; are equal to the set &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; of [[real number]]s, one has a [[function of several real variables]]. If the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; are equal to the set &lt;math&gt;\C&lt;/math&gt; of [[complex number]]s, one has a [[function of several complex variables]].

It is common to also consider functions whose codomain is a product of sets. For example, [[Euclidean division]] maps every pair {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} of integers with {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}} to a pair of integers called the ''quotient'' and the ''remainder'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \text{Euclidean division}\colon\quad \Z\times (\Z\setminus \{0\}) &amp;\to \Z\times\Z\\
  (a,b) &amp;\mapsto (\operatorname{quotient}(a,b),\operatorname{remainder}(a,b)).
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The codomain may also be a [[vector space]]. In this case, one talks of a [[vector-valued function]]. If the domain is contained in a [[Euclidean space]], or more generally a [[manifold]], a vector-valued function is often called a [[vector field]].

==In calculus==

The idea of function, starting in the 17th century, was fundamental to the new [[infinitesimal calculus]] (see [[History of the function concept]]). At that time, only [[real-valued function|real-valued]] functions of a [[function of a real variable|real variable]] were considered, and all functions were assumed to be [[smooth function|smooth]]. But the definition was soon extended to [[#Multivariate function|functions of several variables]] and to [[function of a complex variable]].  In the second half of 19th century, the mathematically rigorous definition of a function was introduced, and functions with arbitrary domains and codomains were defined. 

Functions are now used throughout all areas of mathematics.  In introductory [[calculus]], when the word ''function'' is used without qualification, it means a real-valued function of a single real variable.  The more general definition of a function is usually introduced to second or third year college students with STEM majors, and in their senior year they are introduced to calculus in a larger, more rigorous setting in courses such as [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]].

===Real function===

[[File:Sine cosine one period.svg|thumb|right|Graph of two trigonometric functions: [[sine]] and [[cosine]].]]
A ''real function'' is a [[real-valued function|real-valued]] function of a [[function of a real variable|real variable]], that is, a function whose codomain is the [[real number|field of real numbers]] and whose domain is a set of [[real number]]s that contains an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]. In this section, these functions are simply called ''functions''.

The functions that are most commonly considered in mathematics and its applications have some regularity, that is they are [[continuous function|continuous]], [[differentiable function|differentiable]], and even [[analytic function|analytic]]. This regularity insures that these functions can be visualized by their [[#graph|graphs]]. In this section, all functions are differentiable in some interval.

Functions enjoy [[pointwise operation]]s, that is, if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are functions, their sum, difference and product are functions defined  by 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(f+g)(x)&amp;=f(x)+g(x)\\
(f-g)(x)&amp;=f(x)-g(x)\\
(f\cdot g)(x)&amp;=f(x)\cdot g(x)\\
\end{align}.&lt;/math&gt;
The domains of the resulting functions are the [[set intersection|intersection]] of the domains of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}}. The quotient of two functions is defined similarly by 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac fg(x)=\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},&lt;/math&gt;
but the domain of the resulting function is obtained by removing the [[zero of a function|zeros]] of {{mvar|g}} from the intersection of the domains of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}}.

The [[polynomial function]]s are defined by [[polynomial]]s, and their domain is the whole set of real numbers. They include [[constant function]]s, [[linear function]]s and [[quadratic function]]s. [[Rational function]]s are quotients of two polynomial functions, and their domain is the real numbers with a finite number of them removed to avoid [[division by zero]].  The simplest rational function is the function &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto \frac 1x,&lt;/math&gt; whose graph is an [[hyperbola]], and whose domain is the whole [[real line]] except for 0.

The [[derivative]] of a real differentiable function is a real function. An [[antiderivative]] of a continuous real function is a real function that is differentiable in any [[open interval]] in which the original function is continuous. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto\frac 1x&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, and even differentiable, on the positive real numbers. Thus one antiderivative, which takes the value zero for {{math|1=''x'' = 1}}, is a differentiable function called the [[natural logarithm]].

A real function {{mvar|f}} is [[monotonic function|monotonic]] in an interval if the sign of &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}&lt;/math&gt; does not depend of the choice of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in the interval. If the function is differentiable in the interval, it is monotonic if the sign of the derivative is constant in the interval. If a real function {{mvar|f}} is monotonic in an interval {{mvar|I}}, it has an [[inverse function]], which is a real function with domain {{math|''f''(''I'')}} and image {{mvar|I}}. This is how [[inverse trigonometric functions]] are defined in terms of [[trigonometric functions]], where the trigonometric functions are monotonic. Another example: the natural logarithm is monotonic on the positive real numbers, and its image is the whole real line; therefore it has an inverse function that is a [[bijection]] between the real numbers and the positive real numbers. This inverse is the [[exponential function]].

Many other real functions are defined either by the [[implicit function theorem]] (the inverse function is a particular instance) or as solutions of [[differential equation]]s. For example the [[sine]] and the [[cosine]] functions are the solutions of the [[linear differential equation]] 
:&lt;math&gt;y''+y=0&lt;/math&gt;
such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 0=0, \quad \cos 0=1, \quad\frac{\partial \sin x}{\partial x}(0)=1, \quad\frac{\partial \cos x}{\partial x}(0)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

When working with complex numbers different types of functions are used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=L. Ahlfors|title=Complex Analysis|year=1966|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=21|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 

* Complex-valued functions, functions that return complex values 
::&lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;
:for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; an arbitrary set, or perhaps a subset of the real numbers. 
* Or a function for which both domain and range are subsets of the complex numbers.
::&lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Complex variable functions that return, say real numbers or other values
::&lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{C}\to X&lt;/math&gt;.
The study of complex functions is a vast subject in mathematics with many applications, and that can claim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B. Conway|title=Functions of one complex variable|year=1978|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=vii|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be an ancestor to many other areas of mathematics, like [[homotopy theory]], and [[manifolds]].

==Function space==
{{Main|Function space|Functional analysis}}
In [[mathematical analysis]], and more specifically in [[functional analysis]], a '''function space''' is a set of [[scalar-valued function|scalar-valued]] or [[vector-valued function]]s, which share a specific property and form a [[topological vector space]]. For example, the real [[smooth function]]s with a [[compact support]] (that is, they are zero outside some [[compact set]]) form a function space that is at the basis of the theory of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].

Function spaces play a fundamental role in advanced mathematical analysis, by allowing the use of their algebraic and [[topology|topological]] properties for studying properties of functions. For example, all theorems of existence and uniqueness of solutions of [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] or [[partial differential equation]]s result of the study of function spaces.

==Generalizations==
===Natural extension===
It is rather frequent that a function with domain {{mvar|X}} may be naturally extended to a function whose domain is a set {{mvar|Z}} that is built from {{mvar|X}}.

For example, for any set {{mvar|X}}, its [[power set]] {{math|{{mathcal|P}}(''X'')}} is the set of all subsets of {{mvar|X}}. Any function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y,&lt;/math&gt; may be extended to a function on power sets by 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\mathcal P(X) \to \mathcal P(Y) \\
&amp;S \mapsto f(S)
\end {align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''f''{{space|hair}}(''S'')}} is the image by {{mvar|f}} of the subset {{mvar|S}} of {{mvar|X}}.

According to the definition, a function {{mvar|f}} maps each element from its domain {{mvar|X}} to some element of its codomain {{mvar|Y}}. It is often convenient to extend this meaning to apply to arbitrary subsets of the domain, which are, as immediately can be checked, mapped to subsets of the codomain, thus considering a function &lt;math&gt;\tilde f,&lt;/math&gt; mapping its domain, the powerset  {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|X}}) of {{mvar|f}} 's domain {{mvar|X}}, to its codomain, a subset of the powerset {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|Y}}) of {{mvar|f}} 's codomain {{mvar|Y}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal P(X) \to \mathcal P(Y) \\
S \mapsto f(S).
\end {align}&lt;/math&gt;
Under slight [[abuse of notation]] this function on subsets is often denoted also by {{mvar|f}}.

Another example is the following. If the function
&lt;math&gt;f\colon R\to S&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[ring homomorphism]], it may be extended to a function on [[polynomial ring]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R[x]&amp;\to S[x]\\
\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i&amp;\mapsto \sum _{i=0}^n f(a_i)x^i,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
which is also a ring homomorphism.

===Multi-valued functions===
{{main|Multi-valued function}}
[[File:Function with two values 1.svg|thumb|right|Together, the two square roots of all nonnegative real numbers form a single smooth curve.]]
[[File:Xto3minus3x.svg|thumb|right]]
Several methods for specifying functions of real or complex variables start from a local definition of the funcion at a point or on a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of a point, and then extend by continuity the function to a much larger domain. Frequently, for a starting point &lt;math&gt;x_0,&lt;/math&gt; there are several possible starting values for the function. 

For example, in defining the [[square root]] as the inverse function of the square function, for any positive real number &lt;math&gt;x_0,&lt;/math&gt; there are two choices for the value of the square root, one of which is positive and denoted &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {x_0},&lt;/math&gt; and another which is negative and denoted &lt;math&gt;-\sqrt {x_0}.&lt;/math&gt; These choices define two continuous functions, both having the nonnegative real numbers as a domain, and having either the nonnegative or the nonpositive real numbers as images. When looking at the graphs of these functions, one can see that, together, they form a single [[smooth curve]]. It is therefore often useful to consider these two square root functions as a single function that has two values for positive {{mvar|x}}, one value for 0 and no value for negative {{mvar|x}}.

In the preceding example, one choice, the positive square root, is more natural than the other. This is not the case in general. For example, let consider the [[implicit function]] that maps {{mvar|y}} to a [[root of a function|root]] {{mvar|x}} of &lt;math&gt;x^3-3x-y =0&lt;/math&gt; (see the figure on the right). For {{math|1=''y'' = 0}} one may choose either &lt;math&gt;0, \sqrt 3,\text{ or } -\sqrt 3&lt;/math&gt; for {{mvar|x.}} By the [[implicit function theorem]], each choice defines a function; for the first one, the (maximal) domain is the interval {{math|[–2, 2]}} and the image is {{math|[–1, 1]}}; for the second one, the domain is {{math|[–2, ∞)}} and the image is {{math|[1, ∞)}}; for the last one, the domain is {{math|(–∞, 2]}} and the image is {{math|(–∞, –1]}}. As the three graphs together form a smooth curve, and there is no reason for preferring one choice, these three functions are often considered as a single ''multi-valued function'' of {{mvar|y}} that has three values for {{math|–2 &lt; ''y'' &lt; 2}}, and only one value for {{math|''y'' ≤ –2}} and {{math|''y'' ≥ –2}}.

Usefulness of the concept of multi-valued functions is clearer when considering complex functions, typically [[analytic function]]s. The domain to which a complex function may be extended by [[analytic continuation]] generally consists of almost the whole [[complex plane]]. However, when extending the domain through two different paths, one often gets different values. For example, when extending the domain of the square root function, along a path of complex numbers with positive imaginary parts, one gets {{mvar|i}} for the square root of –1; while, when extending through complex numbers with negative imaginary parts, one gets {{math|–''i''}}. There are generally two ways of solving the problem. One may define a function that is not [[continuous function|continuous]] along some curve, called a [[branch cut]]. Such a function is called the [[principal value]] of the function. The other way is to consider that one has a ''multi-valued function'', which is analytic everywhere except for isolated singularities, but whose value may "jump" if one follows a closed loop around a singularity. This jump is called the [[monodromy]].

==In [[foundations of mathematics]] and [[set theory]]==

The definition of a function that is given in this article requires the concept of [[set (mathematics)|set]], since the domain and the codomain of a function must be a set. This is not a problem in usual mathematics, as it is generally not difficult to consider only functions whose domain and codomain are sets, which are well defined, even if the domain is not explicitly defined. However, it is sometimes useful to consider more general functions. 

For example the [[singleton set]] may be considered as a function &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto \{x\}.&lt;/math&gt; Its domain would include all sets, and therefore would not be a set. In usual mathematics, one avoids this kind of problem by specifying a domain, which means that one has many singleton functions. However, when establishing foundations of mathematics, one may have to use functions whose domain, codomain or both are not specified, and some authors, often logicians, give precise definition for these weakly specified functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gödel |1940 |p=16}}; {{harvnb |Jech |2003 |p=11}}; {{harvnb |Cunningham |2016 |p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These generalized functions may be critical in the development of a formalization of foundations of mathematics. For example, the [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], is an extension of the set theory in which the collection of all sets is a [[Class (set theory)|class]]. This theory includes the [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory#NBG's axiom of replacement|replacement axiom]], which may be interpreted as "if {{mvar|X}} is a set, and {{mvar|F}} is a function, then {{math|''F''[''X'']}} is a set".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15235">A '''heat kernel signature (HKS)''' is a feature descriptor for use in deformable [[Shape analysis (digital geometry)|shape analysis]] and belongs to the group of [[spectral shape analysis]] methods. For each point in the shape, HKS defines its [[feature vector]] representing the point's local and global geometric properties. Applications include segmentation, classification, structure discovery, shape matching and shape retrieval.

HKS was introduced in 2009 by Jian Sun, Maks Ovsjanikov and [[Leonidas Guibas]].&lt;ref name="sun2009concise"&gt;{{cite conference

== Overview ==
[[Shape analysis (digital geometry)|Shape analysis]] is the field of automatic digital analysis of shapes, e.g., 3D objects. For many shape analysis tasks (such as shape matching/retrieval), [[feature vector]]s for certain key points are used instead of using the complete [[3D model]] of the shape. An important requirement of such feature descriptors is for them to be invariant under certain transformations. For [[rigid transformation]]s, commonly used feature descriptors  include [[shape context]], spin images, integral volume descriptors and multiscale local features, among others.&lt;ref name="bronstein2011spectral" /&gt; HKS allows [[isometric transformation]]s which generalizes rigid transformations.

HKS is based on the concept of [[heat diffusion]] over a surface. Given an initial heat distribution &lt;math&gt; u_0(x)&lt;/math&gt; over the surface, the heat kernel &lt;math&gt; h_t(x,y) &lt;/math&gt; relates the amount of heat transferred from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; after time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The heat kernel is invariant under isometric transformations and stable under small perturbations to the isometry.&lt;ref name="sun2009concise" /&gt; In addition, the heat kernel fully characterizes shapes up to an isometry and represents increasingly global properties of the shape with increasing time.&lt;ref name="grigor2006heat"&gt;{{cite conference

 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;h_t(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is defined for a pair of points over a temporal domain, using heat kernels directly as features would lead to a high complexity. HKS instead restricts itself to just the temporal domain by considering only &lt;math&gt;h_t(x,x)&lt;/math&gt;. HKS inherits most of the properties of heat kernels under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="sun2009concise" /&gt;

== Technical details ==
The [[heat diffusion]] equation over a [[Compact space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (possibly with a boundary) is given by,
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\Delta - \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \right) u(x,t) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]] and &lt;math&gt;u(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the heat distribution at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The solution to this equation can be expressed as,&lt;ref name="sun2009concise" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
u(x,t) = \int h_t(x,y)u_0(y)dy.
&lt;/math&gt;
The eigen decomposition of the heat kernel is expressed as,
:&lt;math&gt;
h_t(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \exp(-\lambda_i t) \phi_i(x) \phi_i(y)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; are the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; eigenvalue and eigenfunction of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. The heat kernel fully characterizes a surface up to an isometry: For any [[surjective map]] &lt;math&gt;T:M\rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; between two Riemannian manifolds &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;h_t(x,y) = h_t(T(x),T(y))&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is an isometry, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="sun2009concise" /&gt; For a concise feature descriptor, HKS restricts the heat kernel only to the temporal domain,
:&lt;math&gt;
h_t(x,x) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \exp(-\lambda_i t) \phi_i^2(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
HKS, similar to the heat kernel, characterizes surfaces under the condition that the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are non-repeating. The terms &lt;math&gt;\exp(-\lambda_i t)&lt;/math&gt; can be intuited as a bank of low-pass filters, with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; determining the cutoff frequencies.&lt;ref name="bronstein2011spectral"/&gt;

=== Practical considerations ===
Since &lt;math&gt;h_t(x,x)&lt;/math&gt; is, in general, a non-parametric continuous function, HKS is in practice represented as a discrete sequence of &lt;math&gt;\{h_{t_1}(x,x),\ldots,h_{t_n}(x,x)\}&lt;/math&gt; values sampled at times &lt;math&gt;t_1,\ldots,t_n&lt;/math&gt;.

In most applications, the underlying manifold for an object is not known. The HKS can be computed if a [[Polygon mesh|mesh]] representation of the manifold is available, by using a discrete approximation to &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and using the discrete analogue of the heat equation. In the discrete case, the Laplace–Beltrami operator is a sparse matrix and can be written as,&lt;ref name="sun2009concise" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
L = A^{-1}W
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a positive diagonal matrix with entries &lt;math&gt;A(i,i)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the area of the triangles in the mesh sharing the vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetric semi-definite weighting matrix. &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; can be decomposed into &lt;math&gt;L = \Phi \Lambda \Phi^T A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; arranged in the ascending order, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix with the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors. The discrete heat kernel is the matrix given by,
:&lt;math&gt;
K_t = \Phi \exp(-t\Lambda) \Phi^T.
&lt;/math&gt;
The elements &lt;math&gt;k_t(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; represents the heat diffusion between vertices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; after time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The HKS is then given by the diagonal entries of this matrix, sampled at discrete time intervals. Similar to the continuous case, the discrete HKS is robust to noise.&lt;ref name="sun2009concise" /&gt;

=== Non-repeating eigenvalues ===
The main property that characterizes surfaces using HKS up to an isometry holds only when the eigenvalues of the surfaces are non-repeating. There are certain surfaces (especially those with symmetry) where this condition is violated. A sphere is a simple example of such a surface.

=== Time parameter selection ===
The time parameter in the HKS is closely related to the scale of global information. However, there is no direct way to choose the time discretization. The existing method chooses time samples logarithmically which is a heuristic with no guarantees&lt;ref name="aubry2011wks"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time complexity ===
The discrete heat kernel requires eigendecomposition of a matrix of size &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of vertices in the mesh representation of the manifold. Computing the eigendecomposition is an expensive operation, especially as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; increases.
Note, however, that because of the inverse exponential dependence on the eigenvalue, typically only a small (less than 100) eigenvectors are sufficient to obtain a good approximation of the HKS.

=== Non-isometric transformations ===
The performance guarantees for HKS only hold for truly isometric transformations. However, deformations for real shapes are often not isometric. A simple example of such transformation is closing of the fist by a person, where the geodesic distances between two fingers changes.

== Relation with other methods&lt;ref name="bronstein2011spectral" /&gt; ==

=== Curvature ===
The (continuous) HKS at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h_t(x,x)&lt;/math&gt; on the Riemannian manifold is related to the [[scalar curvature]] &lt;math&gt;s(x)&lt;/math&gt; by,
:&lt;math&gt;
h_t(x,x) = \frac{1}{4\pi t} + \frac{s(x)}{12\pi} + O(t).
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, HKS can as be interpreted as the curvature of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at scale &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Wave kernel signature (WKS) ===
The WKS&lt;ref name="aubry2011wks" /&gt; follows a similar idea to the HKS, replacing the heat equation with the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger wave equation]],
:&lt;math&gt;
\left( i\Delta + \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \right) \psi(x,t) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the complex wave function. The average probability of measuring the particle at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is given by,
:&lt;math&gt;
p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f^2(\lambda_i) \phi_i^2(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the initial energy distribution. By fixing a family of these energy distributions &lt;math&gt;f_i(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the WKS can be obtained as a discrete sequence &lt;math&gt;\{ p_{f_1}(x),\ldots,p_{f_n}(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;. Unlike HKS, the WKS can be intuited as a set of band-pass filters leading to better feature localization. However, the WKS does not represent large-scale features well (as they are ''filtered'' out) yielding poor performance at shape matching applications.

=== Global point signature (GPS) ===
Similar to the HKS, the GPS&lt;ref name="rustamov2007gps"&gt;{{cite conference
 | author = Rustamov, R.M.
 | year = 2007
 | title = Laplace–Beltrami eigenfunctions for deformation invariant shape representation
 | booktitle = Proceedings of the fifth Eurographics symposium on Geometry processing
 | pages = 225–233
 | publisher = Eurographics Association 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator. GPS at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of scaled eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami operator computed at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The GPS is a global feature whereas the scale of the HKS can be varied by varying the time parameter for heat diffusion. Hence, the HKS can be used in partial shape matching applications whereas the GPS cannot.

=== Spectral graph wavelet signature (SGWS) ===
SGWS&lt;ref name="Li13SGWS"&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=C. Li |author2=A. Ben Hamza | year = 2013
 | title = A multiresolution descriptor for deformable 3D shape retrieval
 | journal = The Visual Computer
 | pages = 513–524
}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a general form for [[Spectral shape analysis|spectral descriptors]], where one can obtain HKS by specifying the filter function. SGWS is a multiresolution local descriptor that is not only isometric invariant, but also compact, easy to compute and combines the advantages of both band-pass and low-pass filters.

== Extensions ==

=== Scale invariance ===
Even though the HKS represents the shape at multiple scales, it is not inherently scale invariant. For example, the HKS for a shape and its scaled version are not the same without pre-normalization. A simple way to ensure scale invariance is by pre-scaling each shape to have the same surface area (e.g. 1). Using the notation above, this means:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 s &amp;= \sum_j A_j \\
 A &amp;= A / s \\
 \lambda_i &amp;= s \lambda_i \text{ for each } i \\
 \phi_i &amp;= \sqrt{s} \phi_i \text{ for each } i \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, scale-invariant version of the HKS can also be constructed by generating a [[Scale space representation]].&lt;ref name="bronstein2010si"&gt;{{cite conference
 |author1=Bronstein, M.M.  |author2=Kokkinos, I.
 | year = 2010
 | title = Scale-invariant heat kernel signatures for non-rigid shape recognition
 | booktitle = Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010
 | pages = 1704–1711
 | publisher = IEEE
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the scale-space, the HKS of a scaled shape corresponds to a translation up to a multiplicative factor. The Fourier transform of this HKS changes the [[Time translation|time-translation]] into the complex plane, and the dependency on translation can be eliminated by considering the modulus of the transform.
{{YouTube|id=kDfxrrh1h38|title=Demo of Scale-invariant HKS}}. 
An alternative scale invariant HKS can be established by working out its construction through a scale invariant metric, as defined in &lt;ref name="raviv2013scale"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Y. Aflalo,  R. Kimmel and R. Raviv

 | journal = SIAM Journal of Imaging Science (SIAG on Imaging Science 2016 Best Paper Prize)
 | pages = 6(3):1579-1597
 | publisher = SIAM
}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Volumetric HKS ===
The HKS is defined for a boundary surface of a 3D shape, represented as a 2D Riemannian manifold. Instead of considering only the boundary, the entire volume of the 3D shape can be considered to define the volumetric version of the HKS.&lt;ref name="raviv2010volumetric"&gt;{{cite conference
 | author = Raviv, D. and Bronstein, M.M. and Bronstein, A.M. and Kimmel, R.
 | year = 2010
 | title = Volumetric heat kernel signatures
 | booktitle = Proceedings of the ACM workshop on 3D object retrieval
 | pages = 30–44
 | publisher = ACM
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Volumetric HKS is defined analogous to the normal HKS by considering the heat equation over the entire volume (as a 3-submanifold) and defining a [[Neumann boundary conditions|Neumann boundary condition]] over the 2-manifold boundary of the shape. Volumetric HKS characterizes transformations up to a volume isometry, which represent the transformation for real 3D objects more faithfully than boundary isometry.&lt;ref name="raviv2010volumetric" /&gt;

=== Shape Search ===
The scale-invariant HKS features can be used in the [[bag of words model in computer vision|bag-of-features]] model for shape retrieval applications.&lt;ref name="bronsteing2011google"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Bronstein, A.M. and Bronstein, M.M. and Guibas, L.J. and Ovsjanikov, M.
 | year = 2011
 | title = Shape google: Geometric words and expressions for invariant shape retrieval
 | journal = ACM Transactions on Graphics
 | volume = 30
 | number = 1
 | publisher = ACM
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The features are used to construct geometric words by taking into account their spatial relations, from which shapes can be constructed (analogous to using features as words and shapes as sentences). Shapes themselves are represented using compact binary codes to form an indexed collection. Given a query shape, similar shapes in the index with possibly isometric transformations can be retrieved by using the Hamming distance of the code as the nearness-measure.

[[Image:Heliocentric.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Andreas Cellarius|Andreas Cellarius's]] illustration of the Copernican system, from the ''Harmonia Macrocosmica'' (1708).]]

'''Heliocentrism'''{{efn|Optionally capitalised, ''Heliocentrism'' or ''heliocentrism'', according to [[#soed|The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (6th ed., 2007)]]. The term is a learned formation based on   [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἥλιος|ἥλιος]]}} ''[[Helios]]'' "Sun" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κέντρον|κέντρον]]}} ''kentron'' "center"; the adjective ''heliocentric'' is first recorded in English (as ''heliocentrick'') in 1685, after [[New Latin]] ''heliocentricus'', in use from about the same time ([[Johann Jakob Zimmermann]], ''Prodromus biceps cono ellipticæ et a priori demonstratæ planetarum theorices'', 1679, p. 28). 
The abstract noun in ''[[-ism]]'' is more recent, recorded from the late 19th century (e.g. in Constance Naden, ''Induction and Deduction: A Historical and Critical Sketch of Successive Philosophical Conceptions Respecting the Relations Between Inductive and Deductive Thought and Other Essays'' (1890), p. 76: "Copernicus started from the observed motions of the planets, on which astronomers were agreed, and worked them out on the new hypothesis of Heliocentrism"), modelled after German ''Heliocentrismus'' or ''Heliozentrismus'' (c. 1870).}} is the [[astronomy|astronomical]] model in which the [[Earth]] and planets revolve around the [[Sun]] at the center of the [[Solar System]]. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to [[Geocentric model|geocentrism]], which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by [[Aristarchus of Samos]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFDreyer1953|Dreyer (1953)]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/n148/mode/2up pp.135–48]; [[#CiTEREFLinton2004|Linton (2004)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=B4br4XJFj0MC&amp;pg=PA38 pp.38–9)].  The work of Aristarchus's in which he proposed his heliocentric system has not survived.  We only know of it now from a brief passage in [[Archimedes]]'s ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's heliocentrism attracted little attention—possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Lucio Russo]], the heliocentric view was expounded in [[Hipparchus]]'s work on gravity. (source: Lucio Rosso, ''The Forgotten Revolution, How Science was Born in 300BC and Why it had to be Reborn'', pp 293-296)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the 16th century that a [[mathematical model]] of a heliocentric system was presented, by the [[Renaissance]]&lt;!-- do not add a nationality claim --&gt; mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], leading to the [[Copernican Revolution]]. In the following century, [[Johannes Kepler]] introduced [[Elliptic orbit|elliptical orbits]], and [[Galileo Galilei]] presented supporting observations made using a [[telescope]].

With the observations of [[William Herschel]], [[Friedrich Bessel]], and other astronomers, it was realized that the sun, while near the [[barycenter]] of the solar system, was not at any center of the universe.

==Ancient and medieval astronomy==
[[Image:geoz wb en.svg|thumb|250px|A hypothetical geocentric model of the solar system (upper panel) in comparison to the heliocentric model (lower panel).]]
While the [[sphericity of the Earth]] was widely recognized in Greco-Roman astronomy from at least the 3rd century BC, the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|daily rotation]] and [[Earth's orbit|yearly orbit around the Sun]] was never universally accepted until the [[Copernican Revolution]].

While a moving Earth was proposed at least from the 4th century BC in [[Pythagoreanism]], and a fully developed heliocentric model was developed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]] in the 3rd century BC, these ideas were not successful in replacing the view of a static spherical Earth, and from the 2nd century AD the predominant model, which would be inherited by medieval astronomy, was the [[Ptolemaic system|geocentric model]] described in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''.

The Ptolemaic system was a sophisticated astronomical system that managed to calculate the positions for the planets to a fair degree of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ptolemy himself, in his ''[[Almagest]]'', points out that any model for describing the motions of the planets is merely a mathematical device, and since there is no actual way to know which is true, the simplest model that gets the right numbers should be used.&lt;ref&gt;
In Book 1 section 7 he admits that a model in which the earth revolves with respect to the stars would be simpler but doesn't go as far as considering a heliocentric system.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, he rejected the idea of a [[Earth rotation|spinning earth]] as absurd as he believed it would create huge winds. His [[Ptolemy#Astronomy|planetary hypotheses]] were sufficiently real that the distances of moon, sun, planets and stars could be determined by treating orbits' [[Celestial spheres#Antiquity|celestial spheres]] as contiguous realities. This made the stars' distance less than 20 [[Astronomical Units]],&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Duke, [http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~dduke/ptolemy.html Ptolemy's Universe]&lt;/ref&gt; a regression, since [[Aristarchus of Samos]]'s heliocentric scheme had centuries earlier [[#Classical Antiquity|necessarily]] placed the stars at least two orders of magnitude more distant.

Problems with Ptolemy's system were well recognized in medieval astronomy, and an increasing effort to criticize and improve it in the late medieval period eventually led to the [[Copernican heliocentrism]] developed in Renaissance astronomy.

===Classical Antiquity===

====Pythagoreans====
The non-geocentric model of the [[Universe]] was proposed by the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean]] philosopher [[Philolaus]] (d. 390 BC), who taught that at the center of the Universe was a "central fire", around which the [[Earth]], [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[planets]] revolved in uniform circular motion.  This system postulated the existence of a counter-earth collinear with the Earth and central fire, with the same period of revolution around the central fire as the Earth.  The Sun revolved around the central fire once a year, and the stars were stationary.  The Earth maintained the same hidden face towards the central fire, rendering both it and the "counter-earth" invisible from Earth.  The Pythagorean concept of uniform circular motion remained unchallenged for approximately the next 2000 years, and it was to the Pythagoreans that Copernicus referred to show that the notion of a moving Earth was neither new nor revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. ''A History of Mathematics.'' Wiley, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler gave an alternative explanation of the Pythagoreans' "central fire" as the Sun, "as most sects purposely hid[e] their teachings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Johannes Kepler|title=Epitome of Copernican Astronomy, Book IV, Part 1.2|year=1618–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heraclides Ponticus|Heraclides of Pontus]] (4th century BC) said that the [[Earth's rotation|rotation of the Earth]] explained the apparent daily motion of the celestial sphere. It used to be thought that he believed [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]] to revolve around the Sun, which in turn (along with the other planets) revolves around the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| volume = 23| issue = 4| page = 233| last = Eastwood| first = B.

====Aristarchus of Samos====
[[Image:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus's]] 3rd century BC calculations on the relative sizes of the Earth, Sun and Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy]]

The first person known to have proposed a heliocentric system, however, was [[Aristarchus of Samos]] (''c''. 270 BC). Like [[Eratosthenes]], Aristarchus calculated the size of the Earth, and measured the [[On the Sizes and Distances (Aristarchus)|sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon]]. From his estimates, he concluded that the Sun was six to seven times wider than the Earth, and thought the larger object would have the most attractive force.

His writings on the heliocentric system are lost, but some information about them is known from a brief description by his contemporary, [[Archimedes]], and from scattered references by later writers. Archimedes' description of Aristarchus's theory is given in the former's book, ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''. The entire description comprises just three sentences, which [[Thomas Little Heath|Thomas Heath]] translates as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Heath ([[#CITEREFHeath1913|1913]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/aristarchusofsam00heatuoft#page/302/mode/2up 302]). The italics and parenthetical comments are as they appear in Heath's original.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--- This is a verbatim quotation of Heath's text.  As such, it should preserve the spelling—of such words as "centre", — which he actually used.--&gt;
{{quote|You are aware ['you' being King Gelon] that "universe" is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere, the centre of which is the centre of the earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the centre of the sun and the centre of the earth.  This is the common account (τά γραφόμενα), as you have heard from astronomers.  But Aristarchus brought out ''a book consisting of certain hypotheses'', wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the "universe" just mentioned. His hypotheses are that ''the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved, that the earth revolves about the sun on the circumference of a circle, the sun lying in the middle of the orbit'', and that the sphere of the fixed stars, situated about the same centre as the sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the centre of the sphere bears to its surface.|''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'' (''Arenarius'' I, 4-7)}}

Aristarchus presumably took the stars to be very far away because he was aware that their [[parallax#Stellar parallax|parallax]]&lt;ref&gt;That is, an apparent movement of the stars relative to the [[celestial pole]]s and [[celestial equator|equator]], and to each other, caused by the Earth's revolution around the Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; would otherwise be observed over the course of a year. The stars are in fact so far away that stellar parallax only became detectable when sufficiently powerful [[telescope]]s had been developed.

No references to Aristarchus's heliocentrism are known in any other writings from before the [[common era]].  The earliest of the handful of other ancient references occur in two passages from the writings of [[Plutarch]].  These mention one detail not stated explicitly in Archimedes's account—&lt;ref&gt;Although it could obviously be reasonably inferred therefrom.&lt;/ref&gt; namely, that Aristarchus's theory had the Earth rotating on an axis. The first of these reference occurs in ''On the Face in the Orb of the Moon'':&lt;ref&gt;Heath ([[#CITEREFHeath1913|1913]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/aristarchusofsam00heatuoft#page/304/mode/2up 304]). Most modern scholars share Heath's opinion that it is Cleanthes in this passage who is being held as having accused Aristarchus of impiety (see Gent &amp; Godwin [[#CITEREFPlutarch1883|1883]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/plutarchsmorals51883plut#page/240/mode/2up 240]; Dreyer [[#CITEREFDreyer1953|1906]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/138/mode/1up 138]; Prickard, [[#CITEREFPlutarch1911|1911]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/plutarchonfacewh00plut#page/20/mode/1up 20]; Cherniss [[#CITEREFPlutarch1957|1957]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/moraliainfifteen12plutuoft#page/54/mode/2up 55]; for example). The manuscripts of Plutarch's ''On the Face in the Orb of the Moon'' that have come down to us are corrupted, however, and the traditional interpretation of the passage has been challenged by [[Lucio Russo]], who insists that it should be interpreted as having Aristarchus rhetorically suggest that ''Cleanthes'' was being impious for wanting to shift the ''Sun'' from its proper place at the center of the universe (Russo, [[#CITEREFRusso2013|
2013]], p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ld8lBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82 82]; Russo &amp; Medaglia, [[#CITEREFRussoMedaglia1996|1996]], pp.113-7).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Only do not, my good fellow, enter an action against me for impiety in the style of [[Cleanthes]], who thought it was the duty of Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe, this being the effect of his attempt to save the phenomena by supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis.|''On the Face in the Orb of the Moon'' (''De facie in orbe lunae'', c. 6, pp. 922 F - 923 A.) }}
Only scattered fragments of Cleanthes's writings have survived in quotations by other writers, but in ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', [[Diogenes Laertius]] lists ''A reply to Aristarchus'' (Πρὸς Ἀρίσταρχον) as one of Cleanthes's works,&lt;ref&gt;Hicks ([[#CITEREFDiogenes Laertius1972|1972]], Bk 7, ch 5, p.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0258:book=7:chapter=5&amp;highlight=aristarchus 281])&lt;/ref&gt; and some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Edwards ([[#CITEREFEdwards1998|1998]], p.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&amp;pg=PA68 68] and n.104, p.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&amp;pg=PA455 455]), for instance.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that this might have been where Cleanthes had accused Aristarchus of impiety.

The second of the references by Plutarch is in his ''Platonic Questions'':&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Heath ([[#CITEREFHeath1913|1913]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/aristarchusofsam00heatuoft#page/305/mode/2up 305]).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Did Plato put the earth in motion, as he did the sun, the moon, and the five planets, which he called the instruments of time on account of their turnings, and was it necessary to conceive that the earth "which is globed about the axis stretched from pole to pole through the whole universe" was not represented as being held together and at rest, but as turning and revolving (στρεφομένην καὶ ἀνειλουμένην), as Aristarchus and [[Seleucus of Seleucia|Seleucus]] afterwards maintained that it did, the former stating this as only a hypothesis (ὑποτιθέμενος μόνον), the latter as a definite opinion (καὶ ἀποφαινόμενος) ?| ''Platonic Questions'' (''Platonicae Quaestiones'' viii. I, 1006 C)}}
The remaining references to Aristarchus's heliocentrism are extremely brief, and provide no more information beyond what can be gleaned from those already cited. Ones which mention Aristarchus explicitly by name occur in [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aëtius]]'s ''Opinions of the Philosophers'', [[Sextus Empiricus]]'s ''Against the Mathematicians'',&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; and an anonymous scholiast to Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer ([[#CITEREFDreyer1953|1906]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/139/mode/1up 139])&lt;/ref&gt; Another passage in Aëtius's ''Opinions of the Philosophers'' reports that Seleucus the astronomer had affirmed the Earth's motion, but does not mention Aristarchus.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

====Seleucus of Seleucia====

Since [[Plutarch]] mentions the "followers of Aristarchus" in passing, it is likely that there were other astronomers in the Classical period who also espoused heliocentrism, but whose work was lost. The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who is known to have supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (b. 190 BC), a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] astronomer who flourished a century after Aristarchus in the [[Seleucid empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Murdin|first1=Paul|editor1-last=Murdin|editor1-first=Paul |title=Seleucus of Seleucia (c. 190 BC-?) |journal=Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics|pages=3998|doi=10.1888/0333750888 |isbn=978-0-333-75088-9 | bibcode=2000eaa..bookE3998.|year=2000|citeseerx=10.1.1.255.9251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seleucus was a proponent of the heliocentric system of Aristarchus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ics.forth.gr/~vsiris/ancient_greeks/hellinistic_period.html|title=Index of Ancient Greek Philosophers-Scientists|website=Ics.forth.gr|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127034924/http://users.ics.forth.gr/~vsiris/ancient_greeks/hellinistic_period.html|archivedate=January 27, 2018|accessdate=20 November 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seleucus may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a [[geometry|geometric]] model for the heliocentric theory and developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model.

Alternatively, his explanation may have involved the phenomenon of [[tide]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucio Russo]], ''Flussi e riflussi'', Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, {{ISBN|88-07-10349-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which he supposedly theorized to be caused by the attraction to the [[Moon]] and by the revolution of the [[Earth]] around the Earth and Moon's [[Barycenter|center of mass]].

====Late Antiquity====
There were occasional speculations about heliocentrism in Europe before Copernicus. In [[Carthage#Roman Carthage|Roman Carthage]], the [[pagan]] [[Martianus Capella]] (5th century A.D.) expressed the opinion that the planets Venus and Mercury did not go about the Earth but instead circled the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;William Stahl, trans., ''Martianus Capella and the Seven Liberal Arts'', vol. 2, ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'', 854, 857, New York: Columbia Univ.

The Ptolemaic system was also received in [[Indian astronomy]].
[[Aryabhata]] (476–550), in his magnum opus ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (499), propounded a planetary model in which the Earth was taken to be [[Earth's rotation|spinning on its axis]] and the periods of the planets were given with respect to the Sun.{{sfn|Thurston|1994|p=188}} He also made many astronomical calculations, such as the times of the [[solar eclipse|solar]] and [[lunar eclipse|lunar]] [[eclipse]]s, and the instantaneous motion of the Moon.{{sfn|Joseph|2000|pp=393–4, 408}} Early followers of Aryabhata's model included [[Varahamihira]], [[Brahmagupta]], and [[Bhaskara II]].

===Medieval Islamic world===

[[File:Lunar eclipse al-Biruni.jpg|200px|thumb|An illustration from [[al-Biruni]]'s astronomical works explains the different [[Lunar phase|phases of the moon]] with respect to the position of the Sun.]]
Al-Biruni discussed the possibility of whether the Earth rotated about its own axis and orbited the Sun, but in his ''Masudic Canon'' (1031),&lt;ref name="Covington 2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Covington|first=Richard|title=Rediscovering Arabic Science|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200703/rediscovering.arabic.science.htm|website=Aramco World|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he expressed his faith in a geocentric and stationary Earth.&lt;ref&gt;E.

King and Mary Helen Kennedy, ed., ''Studies in the Islamic Exact Sciences,'' Beirut, 1983, pp. 573–595.&lt;/ref&gt; He was aware that if the Earth rotated on its axis, it would be consistent with his astronomical observations,&lt;ref&gt;G. Wiet, V. Elisseeff, P. Wolff, J. Naudu (1975). ''History of Mankind, Vol 3: The Great medieval Civilisations'', p. 649.

In the 12th century, non-heliocentric alternatives to the Ptolemaic system were developed by some Islamic astronomers, such as [[Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji]], who considered the Ptolemaic model mathematical, and not physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Thomas Hockey|last=Samsó|first=Julio|title=Biṭrūjī: Nūr al‐Dīn Abū Isḥāq &amp;#91;Abū Jaʿfar&amp;#93; Ibrāhīm ibn Yūsuf al‐Biṭrūjī|encyclopedia=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers|publisher=Springer|year=2007|location=New York|pages=133–4|url=http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Bitruji_BEA.htm|isbn=978-0-387-31022-0|ref=harv|display-editors=etal}} ([http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Bitruji_BEA.pdf PDF version])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DSB /&gt; His system spread throughout most of Europe in the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued to the 16th century.&lt;ref name=DSB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Samsó|first=Julio|title=Al-Bitruji Al-Ishbili, Abu Ishaq|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]| publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|year=1970–80|isbn=978-0-684-10114-9|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830904829.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maragheh observatory|Maragha]] school of astronomy in [[Ilkhanid]]-era Persia further developed "non-Ptolemaic" planetary models involving [[Earth's rotation]]. Notable astronomers of this school are [[Al-Urdi]] (d. 1266) [[Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī|Al-Katibi]] (d. 1277),&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/Hikmat3ayn Hikmat al-'Ain]'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|Al-Tusi]] (d. 1274).

The arguments and evidence used resemble those used by Copernicus to support the Earth's motion.&lt;ref name=Ragep&gt;{{Citation |last=Ragep |first=F.

The criticism of Ptolemy as developed by Averroes and by the Maragha school explicitly address the [[Earth's rotation]] but it did not arrive at explicit heliocentrism.&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;Toby E.

The observations of the Maragha school were further improved at the Timurid-era [[Ulugh Beg Observatory|Samarkand observatory]] under [[Ali Qushji|Qushji]] (1403–1474).

===Later medieval period===
[[Image:Nicholas of Cusa.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Nicholas of Cusa]], 15th century, asked whether there was any reason to assert that any point was the center of the universe.]]
European scholarship in the later medieval period actively received astronomical models developed in the Islamic world and by the 13th century was well aware of the problems of the Ptolemaic model. In the 14th century, bishop [[Nicole Oresme]] discussed the possibility that the Earth rotated on its axis, while Cardinal [[Nicholas of Cusa]] in his ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|Learned Ignorance]]'' asked whether there was any reason to assert that the Sun (or any other point) was the center of the universe.  In parallel to a mystical definition of God, Cusa wrote that "Thus the fabric of the world (''machina mundi'') will ''quasi'' have its center everywhere and circumference nowhere,"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas of Cusa, ''De docta ignorantia'', 2.12, p. 103, cited in Koyré (1957), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; recalling [[Hermes Trismegistus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ritmanlibrary.com/founder/god-is-an-infinite-sphere/|title=Favourite quote of founder Joost R.

In India, [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444–1544), in his ''Aryabhatiyabhasya'', a commentary on Aryabhata's ''Aryabhatiya'', developed a computational system for a geo-heliocentric planetary model, in which the planets orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the [[Tychonic system|system later proposed]] by [[Tycho Brahe]]. In the ''[[Tantrasamgraha]]'' (1501), Somayaji further revised his planetary system, which was mathematically more accurate at predicting the heliocentric orbits of the interior planets than both the Tychonic and [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican models]],{{sfn|Joseph|2000}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Model of planetary motion in the works of Kerala astronomers|last=Ramasubramanian|first=K.|journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India|volume=26|pages=11–31 [23–4]|bibcode=1998BASI...26...11R|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not propose any specific models of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;K.

Some historians maintain that the thought of the [[Maragheh observatory]], in particular the mathematical devices known as the [[Urdi lemma]] and the [[Tusi couple]],  influenced Renaissance-era European astronomy, and thus was indirectly received by Renaissance-era European astronomy and thus by [[Copernicus]].&lt;ref name="Saliba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = V. | last2 = Kennedy | first2 = E.

The state of knowledge on planetary theory received by Copernicus is summarized in [[Georg von Peuerbach]]'s ''Theoricae Novae Planetarum'' (printed in 1472 by [[Regiomontanus]]). By 1470, the accuracy of observations by the Vienna school of astronomy, of which Peuerbach and Regiomontanus were members, was high enough to make the eventual development of heliocentrism inevitable, and indeed it is possible that Regiomontanus did arrive at an explicit theory of heliocentrism before his death in 1476, some 30 years before Copernicus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler]], ''The Sleepwalkers'', Penguin Books, 1959, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the influence of the criticism of Ptolemy by Averroes on Renaissance thought is clear and explicit, the claim of direct influence of the 
Maragha school, postulated by [[Otto E. Neugebauer]] in 1957, remains an open question.&lt;ref name="Huff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.K. Singh, M.

It has been argued that Copernicus could have independently discovered the Tusi couple or took the idea from [[Proclus]]'s ''Commentary on the First Book of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Veselovsky | first1 = I.

Another possible source for Copernicus's knowledge of this mathematical device is the ''Questiones de Spera'' of [[Nicole Oresme]], who described how a reciprocating linear motion of a celestial body could be produced by a combination of circular motions similar to those proposed by al-Tusi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kren | first1 = Claudia | year = 1971 | title = The Rolling Device of Naṣir al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī in the ''De spera'' of Nicole Oresme | url = | journal=Isis | volume = 62 | issue = 4| pages = 490–498 | doi = 10.1086/350791 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copernican heliocentrism===
{{Main|Copernican heliocentrism}}

[[File:Kopernikus, Nikolaus - Reußner 1578 Portrait1.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1578){{efn|The image shows a woodcut by Christoph Murer, from Nicolaus Reusner's ''Icones'' (printed 1578), allegedly after a (lost) self-portrait by Copernicus himself; the Murer portrait became the template for a number of later (17th century) woodcuts, copper engravings and paintings of Copernicus.}}]]
[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in his ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' ("On the revolution of heavenly spheres", first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg), presented a discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century had presented his geocentric model in his ''[[Almagest]]''.
Copernicus discussed the philosophical implications of his proposed system, elaborated it in geometrical detail, used selected astronomical observations to derive the parameters of his model, and wrote astronomical tables which enabled one to compute the past and future positions of the stars and planets.  In doing so, Copernicus moved heliocentrism from philosophical speculation to predictive geometrical astronomy. In reality, Copernicus's system did not predict the planets' positions any better than the Ptolemaic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henry|first=John|title=Moving heaven and earth : Copernicus and the solar system|date=2001|publisher=Icon|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84046-251-7|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory resolved the issue of planetary [[retrograde motion]] by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent, rather than [[reality|real]]: it was a [[parallax]] effect, as an object that one is passing seems to move backwards against the horizon. This issue was also resolved in the geocentric [[Tychonic system]]; the latter, however, while eliminating the major [[epicycle]]s, retained as a physical reality the irregular back-and-forth motion of the planets, which Kepler characterized as a "[[pretzel]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, ([[#CITEREFGingerich2004|2004, p. 51]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Copernicus cited Aristarchus in an early (unpublished) manuscript of ''De Revolutionibus'' (which still survives), stating: "Philolaus believed in the mobility of the earth, and some even say that Aristarchus of Samos was of that opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, O. "Did Copernicus Owe a Debt to Aristarchus?" Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol.16, NO.1/FEB, P. 37, 1985.  As mentioned earlier in this article, Philolaus had the Earth moving round a Central Fire which was not the Sun, so Copernicus's reference to Aristarchus's model as possibly geodynamic does not necessarily imply that he thought it was heliocentric.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the published version he restricts himself to noting that in works by [[Cicero]] he had found an account of the theories of [[Hicetas]] and that [[Plutarch]] had provided him with an account of the [[Pythagoreans]], [[Heraclides Ponticus]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Ecphantus]]. These authors had proposed a moving earth, which did not, however, revolve around a central sun.

The first information about the heliocentric views of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was circulated in manuscript completed some time before May 1, 1514.&lt;ref&gt;A library catalogue of a 16th-century historian, Matthew of Miechow, bears that date and contains a reference to the manuscript,  so it must have begun circulating before that date (Koyré, [[#CITEREFKoyré1973|1973, p.85]]; Gingerich, [[#CITEREFGingerich2004|2004, p.32]]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although only in manuscript, Copernicus' ideas were well known among astronomers and others. His ideas contradicted the then-prevailing understanding of the Bible. In the [[King James Bible]] (first published in 1611), First Chronicles 16:30 states that "the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved." Psalm 104:5 says, "[the Lord] Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever." Ecclesiastes 1:5 states that "The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose."

Nonetheless, in 1533, [[Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter]] delivered in Rome a series of lectures outlining Copernicus' theory. The lectures were heard with interest by [[Pope Clement VII]] and several Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFSpeller2008|Speller]] (2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jviElHq-kEcC&amp;pg=PA51 p.51])&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 1536, [[Archbishop of Capua]] [[Nikolaus von Schönberg]] wrote a letter to Copernicus from Rome encouraging him to publish a full version of his theory.

However, in 1539, [[Martin Luther]] said:

{{quote|"There is talk of a new astrologer who wants to prove that the earth moves and goes around instead of the sky, the sun, the moon, just as if somebody were moving in a carriage or ship might hold that he was sitting still and at rest while the earth and the trees walked and moved. But that is how things are nowadays: when a man wishes to be clever he must . . . invent something special, and the way he does it must needs be the best! The fool wants to turn the whole art of astronomy upside-down. However, as Holy Scripture tells us, so did Joshua bid the sun to stand still and not the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast161/Unit3/response.html|title=Religious Objections to Copernicus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was reported in the context of a conversation at the dinner table and not a formal statement of faith. [[Melanchthon]], however, opposed the doctrine over a period of years.&lt;ref&gt;Melanchthon, Elements of Physics, 1st. edition, 1549&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Revolution in Science, I. Bernard Cohen, page 497.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication of de Revolutionibus (1543)===
[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] published the definitive statement of his system in [[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|''De Revolutionibus'']] in 1543. Copernicus began to write it in 1506 and finished it in 1530, but did not publish it until the year of his death. Although he was in good standing with the Church and had dedicated the book to [[Pope Paul III]], the published form contained an unsigned preface by [[Andreas Osiander|Osiander]] defending the system and arguing that it was useful for computation even if its hypotheses were not necessarily true. Possibly because of that preface, the work of Copernicus inspired very little debate on whether it might be [[heresy|heretical]] during the next 60 years. There was an early suggestion among [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] that the teaching of heliocentrism should be banned, but nothing came of it at the time.

Some years after the publication of ''De Revolutionibus'' [[John Calvin]] preached a sermon in which he denounced those who "pervert the order of nature" by saying that "the sun does not move and that it is the earth that revolves and that it turns".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Rosen-1995|Rosen (1995, p.159).]] Rosen disputes the earlier conclusion of another scholar that this was referring specifically to Copernicus's theory.  According to Rosen, Calvin had very likely never heard of Copernicus and was referring instead to "the traditional geokinetic cosmology".&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Calvin is ''not'' responsible for another famous quotation which has often been misattributed to him: "Who will venture to place the authority of Copernicus above that of the Holy Spirit?" It has long been established that this line cannot be found in any of Calvin's works.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Edward (1960), ''Calvin’s attitude toward Copernicus'' in ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', volume 21, no. 3, July, pp.431–441. Reprinted in [[#Reference-Rosen-1995|Rosen (1995, pp.161–171)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, Owen (2004), ''The Book Nobody Read''. New York: Walker and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooykaas, R.

===Tycho Brahe's geo-heliocentric system (c. 1587)===
{{main|Tychonic system}}
[[Image:Tychonian system.svg|thumb|In this depiction of the Tychonic system, the objects on blue orbits (the Moon and the Sun) revolve around the Earth. The objects on orange orbits (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) revolve around the Sun. Around all is a sphere of fixed stars, located just beyond Saturn.]]

Prior to the publication of ''De Revolutionibus'', the most widely accepted system had been proposed by [[Ptolemy]], in which the [[Earth]] was the center of the universe and all celestial bodies orbited it. [[Tycho Brahe]], arguably the most accomplished astronomer of his time, advocated against Copernicus's heliocentric system and for an alternative to the Ptolemaic geocentric system:  a geo-heliocentric system now known as the [[Tychonic system]] in which the five then known planets orbit the sun, while the sun and the moon orbit the earth.

Tycho appreciated the Copernican system, but objected to the idea of a moving Earth on the basis of physics, astronomy, and religion. The [[Aristotelian physics]] of the time (modern Newtonian physics was still a century away) offered no physical explanation for the motion of a massive body like Earth, whereas it could easily explain the motion of heavenly bodies by postulating that they were made of a different sort substance called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] that moved naturally.  So Tycho said that the Copernican system "... expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Gingerich, ''The eye of heaven: Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler'', New York: American Institute of Physics, 1993, 181, {{ISBN|0-88318-863-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Tycho took issue with the vast distances to the stars that Aristarchus and Copernicus had assumed in order to explain the lack of any visible parallax. Tycho had measured the apparent sizes of stars (now known to be illusory – see stellar [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]), and used geometry to calculate that in order to both have those apparent sizes and be as far away as heliocentrism required, stars would have to be huge (much larger than the sun; the size of Earth's orbit or larger). Regarding this Tycho wrote, "Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference."&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Ann, "Tycho Brahe's critique of Copernicus and the Copernican system", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 51, 1990, 364.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also cited the Copernican system's "opposition to the authority of Sacred Scripture in more than one place" as a reason why one might wish to reject it, and observed that his own geo-heliocentric alternative "offended neither the principles of physics nor Holy Scripture".&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, O. &amp; Voelkel, J. R., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JHA....29....1G# ''J. Hist. Astron.'', Vol. 29, 1998], page 1, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuit astronomers in Rome were at first unreceptive to Tycho's system; the most prominent, [[Christopher Clavius|Clavius]], commented that Tycho was "confusing all of astronomy, because he wants to have [[Mars]] lower than the Sun."&lt;ref&gt;Fantoli, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the advent of the telescope showed problems with some geocentric models (by demonstrating that Venus circles the sun, for example), the Tychonic system and variations on that system became very popular among geocentrists, and the Jesuit astronomer [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] would continue Tycho's use of physics, stellar astronomy (now with a telescope), and religion to argue against heliocentrism and for Tycho's system well into the seventeenth century (see [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Riccioli]]).

===Galileo Galilei and 1616 ban against Copernicanism===
{{main|Galileo affair}}
[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|right|In the 17th century AD [[Galileo Galilei]] opposed the Roman Catholic Church by his strong support for heliocentrism]]Galileo was able to look at the night sky with the newly invented telescope. He published his discoveries that the Sun rotated and that Venus exhibited a full range of phases in his ''[[Letters on Sunspots]]'' (1613). These discoveries were not consistent with the Ptolemeic model of the Solar System. As the Jesuit astronomers confirmed Galileo's observations, the Jesuits moved toward Tycho's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Koestler, The Sleepwalkers (Penguin Arkana, 1989 p. 433)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1615 "[[Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina]]", Galileo defended heliocentrism, and claimed it was not contrary to Holy Scripture. He took [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s position on Scripture: not to take every passage literally when the scripture in question is in a Bible book of poetry and songs, not a book of instructions or history. The writers of the Scripture wrote from the perspective of the terrestrial world, and from that vantage point the sun does rise and set. In fact, it is the Earth's rotation which gives the impression of the sun in motion across the sky.

In February 1615, prominent Dominicans including Thomaso Caccini and Niccolò Lorini brought Galileo's writings on heliocentrism to the attention of the Inquisition, because they appeared to violate Holy Scripture and the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].&lt;ref name="Langford 1992, p.56-57"&gt;Langford (1992), p.56-57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.240)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp.110−111)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=297 (1907, 19:297−298)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208071722/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=297 |date=December 8, 2015 }} {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal and Inquisitor [[Robert Bellarmine]] was called upon to adjudicate, and wrote in April that treating heliocentrism as a real phenomenon would be "a very dangerous thing," irritating philosophers and theologians, and harming "the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp.110−115)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1616 Msgr. [[Francesco Ingoli]] addressed an essay to Galileo disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the ban against Copernicanism that followed in February.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 68-69)]] Ingoli's essay was published in English translation for the first time in 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the "chief direct basis" for the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-2010|Finocchiaro (2010, pp. 72)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism.  It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned the problem that heliocentrism requires the stars to be much larger than the sun.  Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory "clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 71)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ingoli included four theological arguments in the essay, but suggested to Galileo that he focus on the physical and mathematical arguments. Galileo did not write a response to Ingoli until 1624.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 66-76, 164-175, 187-195)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1616, the Inquisition assembled a committee of theologians, known as qualifiers, who delivered their unanimous report condemning heliocentrism as "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture." The Inquisition also determined that the Earth's motion "receives the same judgement in philosophy and ... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=320 (1907, 19:320)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513100630/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=320 |date=May 13, 2016 }}, [http://esmateria.com/2014/02/28/una-errata-reproducida-durante-siglos-cambia-la-censura-de-la-iglesia-a-galileo/ Domínguez (2014)]; [https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6168 arXiv:1402.6168 Original text of the decision]&lt;/ref&gt; Bellarmine personally ordered Galileo

{{quote|"to abstain completely from teaching or defending this doctrine and opinion or from discussing it... to abandon completely... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing."|Bellarmine and the Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, 1616&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2010, p.218"&gt;Heilbron (2010), p.218&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In March, after the Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, the papal [[Theologian of the Pontifical Household|Master of the Sacred Palace]], [[Congregation of the Index]], and Pope banned all books and letters advocating the Copernican system, which they called "the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to Holy Scripture."&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2010, p.218"/&gt;&lt;ref name=retrying&gt;{{cite book|last=Finochiario|first=Maurice|title=Retrying Galileo|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1618 the Holy Office recommended that a modified version of Copernicus' ''De Revolutionibus'' be allowed for use in calendric calculations, though the original publication remained forbidden until 1758.&lt;ref name=retrying /&gt;

In ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' (1609), [[Johannes Kepler]] had used an elliptical orbit to explain the motion of Mars. In ''[[Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae]]'' (1617–1621) he developed a heliocentric model of the Solar System in which all the planets have elliptical orbits. This provided significantly increased accuracy in predicting the position of the planets. Kepler's ideas were not immediately accepted. Galileo for example completely ignored Kepler's work. Kepler proposed heliocentrism as a physical description of the Solar System and ''Epitome astronomia Copernicanae'' was placed on the index of prohibited books despite Kepler being a Protestant.

[[Pope Urban VIII]] encouraged Galileo to publish the pros and cons of heliocentrism. Galileo's response, ''[[Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems]]'' (1632), clearly advocated heliocentrism, despite his declaration in the preface that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I will endeavour to show that all experiments that can be made upon the Earth are insufficient means to conclude for its mobility but are indifferently applicable to the Earth, movable or immovable...&lt;ref name="Salusbury"&gt;''[[q:The Systeme of the World: in Four Dialogues|The Systeme of the World: in Four Dialogues]]'' (1661) Thomas Salusbury translation of ''Dialogo sopra i Due Massi Sistemi del Mondo'' (1632)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and his straightforward statement,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I might very rationally put it in dispute, whether there be any such centre in nature, or no; being that neither you nor any one else hath ever proved, whether the World be finite and figurate, or else infinite and interminate; yet nevertheless granting you, for the present, that it is finite, and of a terminate Spherical Figure, and that thereupon it hath its centre...&lt;ref name="Salusbury"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some ecclesiastics also interpreted the book as characterizing the Pope as a simpleton, since his viewpoint in the dialogue was advocated by the character [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicio]]. Urban VIII became hostile to Galileo and he was again summoned to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers'' (Penguin Arkana, 1989 p. 491)&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo's trial in 1633 involved making fine distinctions between "teaching" and "holding and defending as true". For advancing heliocentric theory Galileo was forced to recant Copernicanism and was put under house arrest for the last few years of his life.

According to J. L. Heilbron, informed contemporaries of Galileo's "appreciated that the reference to heresy in connection with Galileo or Copernicus had no general or theological significance."&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron ([[#CITEREFHeilbron1999|1999]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=mZWy0xPxj3EC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.203])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Reason===
{{see|Age of Reason|17th-century philosophy|Scientific revolution}}
[[René Descartes]] postponed, and ultimately never finished, his treatise ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', which included a heliocentric model,&lt;ref name=Weintraub&gt;Weintraub, David A. ''Is Pluto a Planet'', p. 66, Princeton University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but the Galileo affair did little to slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe, as Kepler's ''Epitome of Copernican Astronomy'' became increasingly influential in the coming decades.&lt;ref&gt;"Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion: 1609–1666", J. L. Russell, British Journal for the History of Science, Vol. 2, No. 1, June 1964&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1686 the model was well enough established that the general public was reading about it in ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'', published in France by [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] and translated into English and other languages in the coming years.  It has been called "one of the first great popularizations of science."&lt;ref name=Weintraub /&gt;

In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', which provided an explanation for Kepler's laws in terms of [[universal gravitation]] and what came to be known as [[Newton's laws of motion]]. This placed heliocentrism on a firm theoretical foundation, although Newton's heliocentrism was of a somewhat modern kind. Already in the mid-1680s he recognized the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Wilson, "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", pages 233–274 in [[#Reference-Taton&amp;Wilson-1989|R Taton &amp; C Wilson (eds) (1989)]], ''The General History of Astronomy'', Volume 2A, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA233 at page 233]&lt;/ref&gt; For Newton it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World", and this centre of gravity "either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line". Newton adopted the "at rest" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest.&lt;ref name=newt-hc&gt;(text quotations from 1729 translation of Newton ''Principia'', Book 3 (1729 vol.2) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA233 at pages 232–233]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Church remained opposed to heliocentrism as a literal description, but this did not by any means imply opposition to all astronomy; indeed, it needed observational data to maintain its calendar. In support of this effort it allowed the cathedrals themselves to be used as solar observatories called ''[[Sundial#Meridian lines|meridiane]]''; i.e., they were turned into "reverse [[sundial]]s", or gigantic [[pinhole camera]]s, where the Sun's image was projected from a hole in a window in the cathedral's lantern onto a meridian line.

In 1664, [[Pope Alexander VII]] published his ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] Alexandri VII Pontificis Maximi jussu editus'' (Index of Prohibited Books, published by order of Alexander VII, [[Pontifex Maximus|P.M.]]) which included all previous condemnations of heliocentric books.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pontifical Decrees Against the Doctrine of the Earth's Movement, and the Ultramontane Defence of Them", Rev. William Roberts, 1885, London&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-eighteenth century the Church's opposition began to fade.  An annotated copy of Newton's ''Principia'' was published in 1742 by Fathers le Seur and Jacquier of the Franciscan Minims, two Catholic mathematicians, with a preface stating that the author's work assumed heliocentrism and could not be explained without the theory. In 1758 the Catholic Church dropped the general prohibition of books advocating heliocentrism from the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John L.Heilbron, ''Censorship of Astronomy in Italy after Galileo'' (in McMullin, Ernan ed., ''The Church and Galileo'', 
University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, 2005, p. 307, IN. {{ISBN|0-268-03483-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Observatory of the [[Roman College]] was established by [[Pope Clement XIV]] in 1774 (nationalized in 1878, but re-founded by   [[Pope Leo XIII]] as the [[Vatican Observatory]] in 1891). 
In spite of dropping its active resistance to heliocentrism, the Catholic Church did not lift the prohibition of uncensored versions of Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' or Galileo's ''Dialogue''. The affair was revived in 1820, when the Master of the Sacred Palace (the Church's chief censor), [[Filippo Anfossi]], refused to license a book by a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, because it openly treated heliocentrism as a physical fact.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2005, pp.279, 312"&gt;[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, pp.279, 312–313)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Settele appealed to pope [[Pius VII]].  After the matter had been reconsidered by the Congregation of the Index and the Holy Office, Anfossi's decision was overturned.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2005, pp.279, 312"/&gt; Pius VII approved a decree in 1822 by the [[Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition]] to allow the printing of heliocentric books in Rome. 
Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' and Galileo's ''Dialogue'' were then subsequently omitted from the next edition of the ''Index'' when it appeared in 1835.

===Reception in Judaism===
Already in the [[Talmud]], Greek philosophy and science under general name "Greek wisdom" were considered dangerous. They were put under ban then and later for some periods. &lt;!--For example, in 13-5{{huh}} a ''[[Beth din|beit din]]'' (rabbinical court) in Barcelona forbade men younger than 25 from studying secular [[philosophy]] or the [[natural sciences]] (although an exception was made for those who studied medicine).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Possibly due to this the system of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] did not cause furious resistance, although it was found to be contradicting verses of [[Tanakh]] (Jewish Bible).--&gt;

The first Jewish scholar to describe the Copernican system, albeit without mentioning Copernicus by name,  was [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]],  his book "Be'er ha-Golah" (1593). Maharal makes an argument of [[radical skepticism]], arguing that no scientific theory can be reliable, which he illustrates by the new-fangled theory of heliocentrism upsetting even the most fundamental views on the cosmos.&lt;ref name="efron"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3653968 Noah J. Efron. Jewish Thought and Scientific Discovery in Early Modern Europe.] Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 58, No. 4 (Oct., 1997), pp. 719–732&lt;/ref&gt;

Copernicus is mentioned in the books of [[David Gans]] (1541–1613), who worked with Tycho Brahe and [[Johannes Kepler]]. Gans wrote two books on astronomy in Hebrew: a short one "Magen David" (1612) and a full one "Nehmad veNaim" (published only in 1743). He described objectively three systems: [[Ptolemy]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and of Tycho Brahe without taking sides.
[[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]] (1591–1655) in his "Elim" (1629) says that the arguments of Copernicus are so strong, that only an imbecile will not accept them.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Elim, Amsterdam, 1629, стр. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Delmedigo studied at [[Padua]] and was acquainted with [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]].&lt;ref name="neher"&gt;[[#CITEREFNeher1977|Neher (1977)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An actual controversy on the Copernican model within Judaism arises only in the early 18th century. Most authors in this period accept Copernican heliocentrism, with opposition from   [[David Nieto]] and [[Tobias Cohn]].  Both of these authors argued against heliocentrism on grounds of contradictions to scripture. Nieto merely rejected the new system on those grounds without much passion, whereas Cohn went so far as to call Copernicus "a first-born of Satan", though he also acknowledged&lt;ref&gt;In a marginal note in his ''Massé Touvia'' (part 2, p.52b): "Remark of the author: I fear that the incredulous may draw an objection from a text of ''Midrash Bereshit Rabba'' (V,8) in which our Teachers, the Rabbis, of blessed memory, explain that if the Earth is called in Hebrew "''eretz''" it is because it hastens ("''ratseta''") before the Creator in order to accomplish His will. I acknowledge that the answer to this objection seems difficult for me to find", as translated by Neher ([[#CITEREFNeher1977|1977, p.220]]).&lt;/ref&gt; that he would have found it difficult to counter one particular objection based on a passage from the Talmud.

In the 19th century two students of the [[Moses Sofer|Hatam sofer]] wrote books that were given approbations by him even though one supported heliocentrism and the other geocentrism.

Since the 20th century most Jews have not questioned the science of heliocentrism.

M.M. Schneerson]] of [[Chabad]] who argued that the question of heliocentrism vs. geocentrism is obsolete because of the [[Relative velocity|relativity of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;"on the basis of the presently accepted scientific view (in accordance with the theory of Relativity) that where two bodies in space are in motion relative to one another, it is impossible scientifically to ascertain which revolves around which, or which is stationary and the other in motion. Therefore, to say that there is, or can be, 'scientific proof' that the earth revolves around the sun is quite an unscientific and uncritical statement."{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}{{year needed|date=April 2017}}

==The view of modern science==
[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] were used as arguments {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} in favor of the heliocentric hypothesis. Three apparent proofs of the heliocentric hypothesis were provided in 1727 by [[James Bradley]], in 1838 by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] and in 1851 by [[Leon Foucault|Foucault]]. Bradley discovered the stellar aberration, proving the relative motion of the earth. Bessel proved that the [[Stellar parallax|parallax]] of a star was greater than zero by measuring the parallax of 0.314 [[arcseconds]] of a star named [[61 Cygni]]. In the same year [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]] and [[Thomas James Henderson|Thomas Henderson]] measured the parallaxes of other stars, [[Vega]] and [[Alpha Centauri]].

The thinking that the heliocentric view was also not true in a strict sense was achieved in steps. That the Sun was not the center of the universe, but one of innumerable stars, was strongly advocated by the mystic [[Giordano Bruno]]. Over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, the status of the Sun as merely one star among many became increasingly obvious.  By the 20th century, even before the discovery that there are many galaxies, it was no longer an issue.

The concept of an absolute velocity, including being "at rest" as a particular case, is ruled out by the [[principle of relativity]], also eliminating any obvious "center" of the universe as a natural origin of coordinates. Some forms of [[Mach's principle]] consider the frame at rest with respect to the distant masses in the universe to have special properties.

Even if the discussion is limited to the [[solar system]], the Sun is not at the geometric center of any planet's orbit, but rather approximately at one [[focus (geometry)|focus]] of the [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbit. Furthermore, to the extent that a planet's mass cannot be neglected in comparison to the Sun's mass, the center of gravity of the solar system is displaced slightly away from the center of the Sun.&lt;ref name=newt-hc /&gt; (The masses of the planets, mostly [[Jupiter]], amount to 0.14% of that of the Sun.)  Therefore, a hypothetical astronomer on an [[extrasolar planet]] would observe a small "wobble" in the Sun's motion.

===Modern use of ''geocentric'' and ''heliocentric''===
In modern calculations, the terms "geocentric" and "heliocentric" are often used to refer to [[frame of reference|reference frames]].  In such systems the origin in the [[Center of mass#Barycenter in astrophysics and astronomy|center of mass]] of the Earth, of the Earth–Moon system, of the Sun, of the Sun plus the major planets, or of the entire solar system, can be selected.&lt;ref&gt;See [[center-of-mass frame]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right ascension]] and [[declination]] are examples of geocentric coordinates, used in Earth-based observations, while the heliocentric latitude and longitude are used for orbital calculations.  This leads to such terms as "heliocentric [[velocity]]" and "heliocentric [[angular momentum]]". In this heliocentric picture, any [[planet]] of the Solar System can be used as a source of [[mechanical energy]] because it moves relatively to the Sun. A smaller [[physical body|body]] (either [[spacecraft|artificial]] or [[astronomical object|natural]]) may gain heliocentric velocity due to [[gravity assist]]&amp;nbsp;– this effect can change the body's mechanical energy in heliocentric reference frame (although it will not changed in the planetary one). However, such selection of "geocentric" or "heliocentric" frames is merely a matter of computation. It does not have philosophical implications and does not constitute a distinct physical or scientific [[scientific model|model]]. From the point of view of [[general relativity]], [[inertial reference frame]]s do not exist at all, and any practical reference frame is only an approximation to the actual space-time, which can have higher or lower precision.

'''Hostility'''  is seen as form of emotionally charged [[aggressive]] behavior. In everyday speech it is more commonly used as a [[synonym]] for [[anger]] and [[aggression]].

It appears in several psychological theories. For instance it is a [[Facet (psychology)|facet]] of [[neuroticism]] in the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory|NEO PI]], and form part of [[personal construct psychology]], developed by [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]].

==Kelly's Model==
In psychological terms, [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] considered hostility as the attempt to extort validating evidence to confirm types of social prediction, [[Social constructionism|constructs]], that have failed.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Instead of reconstruing their constructs to meet disconfirmations with better predictions, the hostile person attempts to force or coerce the world to fit their view, even if this is a forlorn hope, and even if it entails emotional expenditure and/or harm to self or others. 

In this sense hostility is a form of psychological [[extortion]] - an attempt to force reality to produce the desired feedback, even by [[acting out]] in [[bullying]] by individuals and groups in various social contexts, in order that preconceptions become ever more widely validated. In this sense, hostility is an alternative response to [[cognitive dissonance]] .{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

While challenging reality can be a useful part of life, and [[Persistence (psychology)|persistence]] in the face of failure can be a valuable trait (for instance in invention or discovery {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}), in the case of hostility it is argued that evidence is not being accurately assessed when the decision is made to repeat the same approach .{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Instead it is claimed that hostility shows evidence of [[Thought suppression|suppression]] or [[denial]], and is "deleted" from awareness -  unfavorable evidence which might suggest that a prior belief is flawed is to various degrees ignored and willfully avoided {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17181">'''Ho{{okina}}oponopono''' (IPA [ho.ʔo.po.no.po.no]) is a [[Hawaii]]an practice of [[:wikt:reconciliation|reconciliation]] and [[forgiveness]]. The Hawaiian word translates into English simply as ''correction'', with the synonyms ''manage'' or ''supervise'', and the antonym ''careless''.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=google+translate&amp;oq=google+translate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0l4.4119j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.co.uk/#auto/en/Ho%CA%BBoponopono Translation for Hoʻoponopono given as 'Edit' or 'Correction'] ''translate.google.co.uk'', accessed 19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0824807030 Mary Kawena Pukui, Samuel H. Elbert - 1986: Hawaiian Dictionary: Hawaiian-English, English-Hawaiian] ''books.google.com'', accessed 19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar forgiveness practices are performed on islands throughout the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], including [[Hawaii]], [[Samoa]], [[Tahiti]] and [[New Zealand]]. Traditional ''Ho{{okina}}oponopono'' is practiced by [[Native Hawaiians|Indigenous Hawaiian]] healers, often within the extended family by a family member. There is also a [[New Age]] practice that goes by the same name.

==Polynesian antecedents==
[[File:Oceania (World-Factbook).jpg|thumb|Map of Oceania]]
In many [[Polynesian culture]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} it is believed that a person's errors (called ''hara'' or ''hala'') caused [[illness]]. Some believe error angers the gods, others that it attracts malevolent gods, and still others believe the guilt caused by error made one sick. "In most cases, however, specific 'untie-error' rites could be performed to atone for such errors and thereby diminish one's accumulation of them."&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the islands of [[Vanuatu]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], people believe that illness usually is caused by sexual misconduct or anger. "If you are angry for two or three days, sickness will come," said one local man.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy that counters this sickness is confession. The patient, or a family member, may confess. If no one confesses an error, the patient may die. The Vanuatu people believe that secrecy is what gives power to the illness. When the error is confessed, it no longer has power over the person.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other islanders, including Hawaiians, people of [[Tikopia]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], and on [[Rarotonga]] in the [[Cook Islands]], believe that the sins of the father will fall upon the children. If a child is sick, the parents are suspected of quarreling or misconduct. In addition to sickness, social disorder could cause sterility of land or other disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Harmony could be restored only by confession and apology.

In [[Pukapuka]], it was customary to hold sort of a confessional over patients to determine an appropriate course of action in order to heal them.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar traditions are found in [[Samoa]],&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tahiti]],&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; and among the [[Māori people|Maori]] of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buck, pp. 405–06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handy, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Hala lei.JPG|thumb|right|A lei made from the fruit of the hala or pandanus tree. A hala lei was given at the completion of ho{{okina}}oponopono in the tradition of kahuna Makaweliweli of Moloka{{okina}}i]]
[[File:Kokee.jpg|thumb|right|Overlooking Kalalau Valley from Koke'e State Park, where Nana Veary held retreats to teach ho{{okina}}oponopono]]

"Ho{{okina}}oponopono" is defined in the ''Hawaiian Dictionary'' as:

(a) "To put to rights; to put in order or shape, correct, revise, adjust, amend, regulate, arrange, rectify, tidy up make orderly or neat, administer, superintend, supervise, manage, edit, work carefully or neatly; to make ready, as canoemen preparing to catch a wave."

(b) "Mental cleansing: family conferences in which relationships were set right (''ho{{okina}}oponopono'') through prayer, discussion, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and [[forgiveness]]." &lt;ref name="HDict"&gt;Pukui, Elbert, pp. 340–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally, ''ho{{okina}}o'' is a particle used to make an actualizing verb from the following noun, as would "to" before a noun in English. Here, it creates a verb from the noun ''[[pono]]'', which is defined as: "...goodness, uprightness, morality, moral qualities, correct or proper procedure, excellence, well-being, prosperity, welfare, benefit, true condition or nature, duty; moral, fitting, proper, righteous, right, upright, just, virtuous, fair, beneficial, successful, in perfect order, accurate, correct, eased, relieved; should, ought, must, necessary."&lt;ref name="HDict" /&gt;

''Ponopono'' is defined as "to put to rights; to put in order or shape, correct, revise, adjust, amend, regulate, arrange, rectify, tidy up, make orderly or neat."

==Traditional practice==
Hawaiian scholar Nana Veary in her book, ''Change We Must: My Spiritual Journey''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3VsHAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=9781877982071&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN_PGD3c3WAhVR2WMKHQ4BAtoQ6AEIKDAA Nana Veary: Change We Must: My Spiritual Journey]  ''books.google.com'', accessed 19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that ho'oponopono was a practice in [[Ancient Hawaii]]&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Haertig, Lee, pp. 61–62, 67&lt;/ref&gt; and this is supported by oral histories from contemporary Hawaiian elders.&lt;ref&gt;Chai, pp. 47–50&lt;/ref&gt; Pukui first recorded her experiences and observations from her childhood (born 1895) in her 1958 book.&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Handy, pp. 184–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the word ''ho{{okina}}oponopono'' was not used, early Hawaiian historians documented a belief that illness was caused by breaking [[kapu]], or spiritual laws, and that the illness could not be cured until the sufferer atoned for this transgression, often with the assistance of a praying priest (''[[kahuna]] pule'') or healing priest (''kahuna lapa{{okina}}au''). Forgiveness was sought from the gods&lt;ref&gt;Kamakau, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malo, p. 75 (English)&lt;/ref&gt; or from the person with whom there was a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Titcomb&lt;/ref&gt;

Pukui described it as a practice of extended family members meeting to "make right" broken family relations. Some families met daily or weekly, to prevent problems from erupting.&lt;ref&gt;Chai, pp. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; Others met when a person became ill, believing that illness was caused by the stress of anger, guilt, recriminations and lack of forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Haertig, Lee, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Kupuna Nana Veary wrote that when any of the children in her family fell ill, her grandmother would ask the parents, "What have you done?" They believed that healing could come only with complete forgiveness of the whole family.&lt;ref&gt;Veary, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual==
Ho{{okina}}oponopono corrects, restores and maintains good relationships among family members and with their gods or God by getting to the causes and sources of trouble. Usually the most senior member of the family conducts it. He or she gathers the family together. If the family is unable to work through a problem, they turn to a respected outsider.

The process begins with prayer. A statement of the problem is made, and the transgression discussed. Family members are expected to work problems through and cooperate, not "hold fast to the fault". One or more periods of silence may be taken for reflection on the entanglement of emotions and injuries. Everyone's feelings are acknowledged. Then confession, repentance and forgiveness take place. Everyone releases (''kala'') each other, letting go. They cut off the past (''{{okina}}oki''), and together they close the event with a ceremonial feast, called ''pani'', which often included eating ''limu kala'' or [[kala seaweed]], symbolic of the release.&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Haertig, Lee pp. 60–80&lt;/ref&gt;

In a form used by the family of ''kahuna'' Makaweliweli of the island of Moloka{{okina}}i, the completion of ho{{okina}}oponopono is represented by giving the person forgiven a [[lei (Hawaii)|lei]] made from the fruit of the [[Hala (tree)|hala tree]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern uses==
"Aunty" Malia Craver, who worked with the Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani Children's Centers (QLCC) for more than 30 years, taught courses in traditional ho{{okina}}oponopono.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keepers of culture named  |work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/01/13/news/story09.html |date=January 13, 2007 |accessdate=19 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, 2000, she spoke about it to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.starbulletin.com/2000/08/09/news/story9.html "Aunty" Malia Craver to address United Nations] 8 September 2000, ''archives.starbulletin.com'', accessed  19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional applications===
In the late 20th century, courts in Hawai{{okina}}i began to order juvenile and adult offenders to work with an elder who would conduct ho{{okina}}oponopono for their families, as a form of [[alternative dispute resolution]]. The ho{{okina}}oponopono is conducted in the traditional way, without court interference, with a practitioner picked by the family from a list of court-approved providers.&lt;ref&gt;Steuterman, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Some native practitioners provide ho{{okina}}oponopono to clients who otherwise might seek family counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Shook&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom from karma===
[[File:Lapakahi3.jpg|thumb|right|The site of the partially restored remains of the village of Koai{{Okina}}e in the ''Lapakahi State Historical Park'' of the island of ''Hawaii'', North Kohala district. Beginning in the early 20th century, this village has been a center for lapa{{okina}}au]]
In 1976 [[Morrnah Simeona]], regarded as a healing priest or ''[[kahuna]] lapa{{okina}}au'', adapted the traditional ho{{okina}}oponopono of family mutual forgiveness to the social realities of the modern day. For this she extended it both to a general problem solving process outside the family and to a psycho-spiritual self-help rather than group process.

Simeona's version is influenced by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China and [[Edgar Cayce]]. Like Hawaiian tradition she emphasizes prayer, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and forgiveness. Unlike Hawaiian tradition, she describes problems only as the effects of negative [[karma]], saying that "you have to experience by yourself what you have done to others." But that you are the creator of your life circumstances was common knowledge for the people of old as "things we had brought with us from other lifetimes."&lt;ref&gt;Pali Jae Lee, Koko Willis, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Any wrongdoing is memorized within oneself and mirrored in every entity and object which was present when the cause happened. As the Law of Cause and Effect predominates in all of life and lifetimes, the purpose of her version is mainly "to release unhappy, negative experiences in past [[reincarnation]]s, and to resolve and remove traumas from the 'memory banks'."&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Karmic bondages hinder the evolution of mind, so that "(karmic) cleansing is a requisite for the expansion of awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Using her 14-step-process would dissolve those bondages.&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, pp. 45–61&lt;/ref&gt; She did not use [[mantra]]s or conditioning exercises.

Her teachings include: there is a Divine Creator who takes care of altruistic pleas of Men; "when the phrase 'And it is done' is used after a prayer, it means Man's work ends and God's begins."&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; "Self-Identity" signifies, e.g. during the ho{{okina}}oponopono, that the three selves or aspects of consciousness are balanced and connected with the Divine Creator.&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Different from egoistic prayers, "altruistic prayers like ho{{okina}}oponopono, where you also pray for the release of other entities and objects, reach the Divine plane or Cosmos because of their high vibrations. From that plane the Divine energy or "mana" would come,"&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; which would transform the painful part of the memory of the wrong actions in all participants to "Pure Light", on whatever plane they are existing; "all are set free".&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Through this transmutation in the mind the problems will lose their energy for physical effects, and healing or balancing is begun. In this sense, Simeona's mana is not the same as the traditional Polynesian understanding of [[mana]].

Pacifica Seminars, founded by [[Morrnah Simeona]], started the first Ho'oponopono seminars in [[Germany]]. Seminars are still held on a regular basis in Germany, Poland, France, and Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, Morrnah, ''Selbst-Identität durch Ho{{okina}}oponopono'', ''Self-identity through Ho´oponopono'' p. 128, Pacifica Seminars (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Simeona, Morrnah |url=http://www.hooponopono.eu/artykul_anny_kligert.htm |title=''Parę słów o moim spotkaniu z Ho´oponopono'' lit.

===State of Zero===
After Simeona's death in 1992, her former student and administrator, Ihaleakala Hew Len, co-authored a book with Joe Vitale called ''Zero Limits''&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Simeona's Ho{{okina}}oponopono teachings. Len makes no claim to be a ''kahuna''. In contrast to Simeona's teachings, the book brings the new idea that the main objective of Ho{{okina}}oponopono is getting to "the state of Zero, where we would have zero limits. No memories. No identity."&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; To reach this state, which Len called 'Self-I-Dentity thru Ho'oponopono', includes using the [[mantra]], "I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me.  Thank you."&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on Len's idea of 100% responsibility,&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; taking responsibility for everyone's actions, not only for one's own. If one would take complete responsibility for one's life, then everything one sees, hears, tastes, touches, or in any way experiences would be one's responsibility because it is in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The problem would not be with our external reality, it would be with ourselves. Total Responsibility, according to Hew Len, advocates that everything exists as a projection from inside the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Economic anthropology|Basic}}
{{Anthropology}}

'''Inalienable possessions''' (or '''immovable property''') are things such as land or objects that are symbolically identified with the groups that own them and so cannot be permanently severed from them. [[Landed estate]]s in the [[Middle Ages]], for example, had to remain intact and even if sold, they could be reclaimed by blood kin. As a legal classification, inalienable possessions date back to Roman times. According to Barbara Mills, "Inalienable possessions are objects made to be kept (not exchanged), have symbolic and economic power that cannot be transferred, and are often used to authenticate the ritual authority of corporate groups".&lt;ref name="Mills 2004 238"/&gt; 

[[Marcel Mauss]] first described inalienable possessions in ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]'', discussing [[potlatch]]es, a kind of gift-giving feast held in communities of many [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is even incorrect to speak in these cases of transfer. They are [[loans]] rather than sales or true abandonment of possessions. Among the [[Kwakiutl]] a certain number of objects, although they appear at the [[potlatch]], cannot be disposed of. In reality these pieces of "property" are [[wikt:sacrum#Latin|sacra]] that a family divests itself of only with great reluctance and sometimes never.&lt;ref name="Mauss2000"&gt;Mauss 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Annette Weiner]] broadened the application of the category of property outside the European context with her book ''Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving'', focussing on a range of Oceanic societies from [[Polynesia]] to [[Papua New Guinea]] and testing existing theories of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and marriage exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=131–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also applies the concept to explain examples such as the [[Kula ring]] in the [[Trobriand Islands]], which was made famous by [[Bronisław Malinowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=32–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explores how such possessions enable hierarchy by establishing a source of lasting social difference. She also describes practices of loaning inalienable possessions as a way of either "temporarily making kin of non-kin" or garnering status.

== ''Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving'' ==
''Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving'' is a book by anthropologist [[Annette Weiner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner was a Professor of Anthropology and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts at [[New York University]], and served as president of the [[American Anthropological Association]]. She died in 1997.

The book focuses on a range of Oceanic societies from Polynesia to Papua New Guinea to test existing theories of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] (gift-giving) and marriage exchange. The book is also important for introducing a consideration of gender in the [[Gift economy|gift-giving debate]] by placing women at the heart of the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=Barbara|title=The establishment and defeat of hierarchy: Inalienable possessions and the history of collective prestige structures in the Pueblo Southwest|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2004|volume=106|issue=2|pages=239–41|doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.2.238}}&lt;/ref&gt; She finds inalienable possessions at the root of many Polynesian kingdoms, such as [[Hawaii]] and [[Samoa]]. She also credits the original idea of "inalienable possessions" to Mauss, who classified two categories of goods in Samoa, ''Oloa'' and ''le'Tonga''─immovable and movable goods exchanged through marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmological authentication==
[[File:Maori cloak.jpg|left|thumb |Young Maori woman wearing a high status feather cloak indicating nobility]]
Weiner states that certain objects become inalienable only when they have acquired "cosmological authentication"; that is,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What makes a possession inalienable is its exclusive and cumulative identity with a particular series of owners through time.  Its history is authenticated by fictive or true genealogies, origin myths, sacred ancestors, and gods.  In this way, inalienable possessions are transcendent treasures to be guarded against all the exigencies that might force their loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She gives the example of a [[Māori people|Māori]] Sacred Cloak and says that when a woman wears it "she is more than herself – that she is her ancestors." Cloaks act as conduits for a person's hau or life giving spirit.  The hau can bring strength or even knowledge potentially but a person may also have the risk of losing their hau. "An inalienable possession acts as a stabilizing force against change because its presence authenticates cosmological origins, kinship, and political histories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the Cloak actually stands for the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=49–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These possessions then are the most potent force in the effort to subvert change, while at the same time they stand as the corpus of change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Sillitoe queries the supposed identification of these objects with persons. He states that these objects are "durable wealth [that] is collective property that is continually in circulation among persons who have temporary possession of it. In this view, transactable objects belong to society as a whole and are not inalienable possessions associated with certain persons. An analogy in Western culture is sporting trophies, such as championship boxing belts owned by all the clubs comprising the association that controls the competition in which constituent club members compete, and which pass for agreed periods of time into the possession of particular champions, changing hands as new champions emerge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sillitoe|first=Paul|title=Why Spheres of Exchange|journal=Ethnology|year=2006|volume=45|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.2307/4617561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theuws argues that "Over time, objects acquire new meanings and what was once a humble pot may become a sacred vessel." This transformation in the object is the result of [[ritualization]] or a change in cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Topographies of Power in the Early Middle Ages Maastricht as a center of power in the early Middle Ages|year=2001|publisher=Brill|location=Amsterdam|pages=201–2|author=Theuws, Frans|authorlink=Maastricht as a centre of power|editors=Theuws, Frans, Van Rhijn, Carine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, "[[Ritual Knowledge]] is often a source of political power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spielmann|first=K.A.|title=Feasting, Craft Specialization, and the Ritual Mode of Production in Small-Scale Societies|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2002|volume=104|issue=1|pages=195–207|doi=10.1525/aa.2002.104.1.195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these possessions may also become destabilizing, as elites reconstruct those sacred histories to identify themselves with the past; for example, [[Gandhi]] invoked the traditional hand spinning traditional cloth, khadi, to contest British rule, which [[Nehru]] referred to as Gandhi's "livery of freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keeping-while-giving==

Inalienable possessions are nonetheless frequently drawn into exchange networks. The subtitle of Weiner's book is "The paradox of keeping-while-giving"; they are given as gifts (not sold) yet still retain a tie to their owners. These gifts are not like those given in regular [[gift giving]] in the West on birthdays for example.  Rather, these gifts can't be re-sold for money by the receiver because the value and the significance of the gift cannot be alienated or disengaged from its relationship to those whose inalienable possession it is.

=== Property value, obligations and rights ===

These inalienable possessions are a form of property that is inalienable, yet they can be exchanged. Property can be thought of as a [[bundle of rights]] – the right to use something, the right to collect rent from someone, the right to extract something (as in oil drilling), the right to hunt within a particular territory.  That ownership may be a bundle of rights held in common by groups of individuals or lineages. The property thus becomes impossible to separate from the group owning it.   "To give in this instant means to transfer without alienating, or to use the language of the West, to give means to cede the right of use without ceding actual ownership".  In other words, Weiner is contending that an economy built around the moral code of gift giving provides the giver rights over what he/she has given and in turn "subsequently benefits from a series of advantages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when one accepts a gift one also accepts that the giver now has rights over the receiver.

=== Reconfiguring exchange theory ===
Weiner begins by re-examining Mauss' explanation for the return gift, the "spirit of the gift." The "spirit of the gift" was a translation of a Maori word, ''hau''. Weiner demonstrates that not ''all'' gifts must be returned. Only gifts that are "immoveable property" can become inalienable gifts. She further argues that inalienable possessions gain the "mana" (spirit) of their possessors, and so become associated with them. These goods are frequently produced by women, like the feather cloak above. The more prominent the woman, the more mana the object is thought to inherit. The longer the kin group can maintain the object in their possession, the more valuable it becomes; but it must also be periodically displayed to assert the group's status, and thus becomes an object of desire for outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=44–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The sibling incest taboo ===
Weiner argues that the role of women in the exchange of inalienable possessions has been seriously underestimated. [[Kinship]] theory as developed by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], used the "[[incest taboo|sibling incest taboo]]" to argue that women themselves are [[Alliance theory|objects of exchange]] between lineage groups. Men had to find women outside their kin groups to marry hence they "lost" their sisters in order to gain wives. Weiner shows that the focus on women as wives ignores the importance of women as sisters (who are not "lost" as a result of becoming wives). Women produce inalienable possessions which they may take with them when they marry out; the inalienable possession, however, must be reclaimed by her brother after her death in order to maintain the status of the kin group. In comparing Hawaii, Samoa and the Trobriands, she argues that the more stratified a society is by ranked differences, the more important inalienable possessions produced by sisters become. The more stratified a society becomes (as in Hawaii), the closer the sibling bond ("sibling intimacy"). In these cases, women are critical to the "cosmological authentication" of inalienable possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=66–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The defeat of hierarchy ===
A critical part of Weiner's argument is that the ability to keep inalienable possessions outside of exchange is a source of difference, and hence brings high status. The development of Polynesian kingdoms is an example. She points to the inalienable possessions of the Australian aborigines, however, to demonstrate how the creation of hierarchy can be defeated. Australian inalienable possessions are given  cosmological authentication through their religious beliefs in the [[Dreamtime|Dreaming]].

{{quote|As an [[ideology]], The Dreaming is [[Subjective idealism|immaterial]] but in another sense, The Dreaming flourishes because it consists of material and verbal possessions—myths, names, songs, ceremonies, and sacred objects inherited from one generation to the next. In this way, The Dreaming itself encompasses vast inalienable possessions that are authenticated by the very cosmology under which they are produced. These possessions created in and authenticated by The Dreaming circulate from one person or group to another in a limited way. The possibilities of transmission in the face of the canon for guardianship establish for ritual leaders a domain of authority that in certain situations leads to a formalized position of rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Weiner points out that the same gender relations of "sibling intimacy" affect the exchange of these inalienable objects. Women as sisters and women as wives provide the conduit for the gifting and return gifting of these goods, allowing the givers to build prestige. However, insofar as these inalienable possessions lose their cosmological authentication, these social hierarchies lose intergenerational longevity. Because the Dreaming itself is an inalienable possession kept secret by clan elders, it can be lost and hierarchy defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=98–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The paradox of keeping-while-giving ===
[[File:Kula bracelet.jpg|thumbnail|A Kula bracelet from the Trobriand Islands.]]
Weiner has used the term to categorize the many [[Kula ring|Kula]] valuables of the [[Trobriand]] islanders who view those objects as culturally imbued with a spiritual sense of the gift giver.  Thus, when they are transferred from one individual or group to another the objects reserve meaningful bonds associated with that of the giver and their lineage. The shell bracelets and necklaces given in exchange each have their own histories, and are thus ranked on the basis of who they have been exchanged to. There were, as well, less well known shells called ''kitomu'' which were individually owned (rather than being part of lineage history), which would be given to temporarily please a disappointed trade partner expecting a more valuable shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kula trade was organized differently in the more hierarchical parts of the Trobriand islands. There, only chiefs were allowed to engage in Kula exchange. In hierarchical areas, individuals can earn their own kitomu shells, whereas in less hierarchical areas, they are always subject to the claims of matrilineal kin. And lastly, in the hierarchical areas, Kula necklaces and bracelets are saved for external exchange only; stone axe blades are used internally. In less hierarchical areas, exchange partners may lose their valuables to internal claims. As a result, most seek to exchange their kula valuables with chiefs, who thus become the most successful players. The chiefs have saved their Kula valuables for external trade, and external traders seek to trade with them before they lose their valuables to internal claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kula exchange is the only way for an individual to achieve local prestige without local political action. But this prestige is fleeting and does not transform into permanent differences in rank because women's participation is minor and Kula shells lack cosmological authentication. It is not Kula shells but women's cloth wealth that is connected with matrilineal ancestors. It is for this reason that women retain high prestige and authority despite the fame of male Kula exchange players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Godelier on ''keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping''==
[[Maurice Godelier]] has further elaborated on Annette Weiner's ideas on inalienable possessions in ''The Enigma of the Gift''. He derived two theses from Weiner, to which he adds a third.

'''First Thesis:''' As discussed above, even in a society that is dominated by a gift-giving economic and moral code, the interplay of gift and counter-gift doesn't completely dominate the social sphere, as there must be some objects which are kept and not given. These things, such as valuables, [[talismans]], knowledge, and rites, confirm  identities and their continuity over time.  Moreover, they acknowledge differences of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of individuals or groups linked by various kinds of exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Second Thesis:'''  Women or the feminine element also exercise power by providing legitimation and redistributing  of political and religious power among groups in a society.  Godelier contends that Weiner refocuses attention on the role of women in constructing and legitimizing power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=33–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While women, as wives, are frequently lowered in status, as sisters, they frequently retain equal status to their brothers.  For example, in [[Polynesia]], the woman as a sister appears to control those goods associated with the [[sacred]], the ancestors, and the gods.

To this, Godelier adds a third thesis.

'''Third thesis:''' The social is not just the sum of alienable and inalienable goods, but is brought into existence by the difference and inter-dependence of these two spheres of exchange. Maintaining society thus requires not ''keeping-while-giving'', but "''keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping''."&lt;ref name="Godelier 1999 36"&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related anthropologists on exchange theory ==
*[[Emile Durkheim]] "describes how exchange involves an intensive bonding more formidable than mere economic relations.  [[Social cohesiveness]] occurs because one person is always dependent on another to achieve a feeling of completeness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This comes into being via the domain of the sacred [[ritual]] that involves communal participation even as it encompasses the moment in a higher order of sacredness.
*[[Bronisław Malinowski]] wrote ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]''.  Malinowski was a pioneer of ethnographic fieldwork in  the Trobriand Islandes and researched [[Kula ring|Kula]] exchange.  His work was later re-analyzed by Mauss and subsequently by other anthropologists.
*[[Marcel Mauss]] wrote ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]''.  He was a pioneer in the study of gift exchange. Mauss was concerned only with the relations formed by the circulation of things that men produce, and not with the relations that men form while they produce things. He is concerned, in particular, with why people give gifts, and why they feel the obligation to make a return.  In fact, he contended that [[inalienable right|inalienability]] is based on or legitimized by the [[belief]] that there is present in the object a power, a spirit, a spiritual reality that binds it to the giver, and which accompanies the object wherever it goes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This spirit then wishes to return to its source the original giver.
*[[Marshall Sahlins]] wrote ''Stone Age Economics''.  Sahlins disagreed with Mauss on several points and contended that "the freedom to gain at others' expense is not envisioned by the relations and forms of exchange."  Moreover, "The material flow underwrites or initiates social relations…. Persons and groups confront each other not merely as distinct interests but with the possible inclination and certain right to physically prosecute these interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahlins|first=Marshall|title=Stone Age Economics|year=1972|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|pages=149–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] applauded Marcel Mauss for his efforts even as he criticized him of not perceiving that "the primary fundamental phenomena (of social life) is exchange itself."  He believed that "society is better understood in terms of [[language]] than from the standpoint of any other [[paradigm]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, he thought that [[anthropologists]] and [[ethnographers]], particularly Mauss, were becoming confused by the languages of those they ethnographically studied, resulting in obscure theories that didn't really make sense.  He advocated [[Structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] analysis in an attempt to clear up certain confusions caused by Mauss' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Maurice Godelier]] wrote ''The Enigma of the Gift.''  Godelier expanded on Weiner's work  by maintaining that society requires not ''keeping-while-giving'', but "''keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping''."&lt;ref name="Godelier 1999 36"/&gt;

== Importance ==

[[Economist]]s have often shunned the idea of pondering exactly why people want goods.&lt;ref name="Douglas1979"&gt;Douglas 1979&lt;/ref&gt; [[Good (economics)|Goods]] serve many purposes beyond what classical economists might theorize. Goods can serve as systems of [[social communication]] according to [[Mary Douglas]], a prominent anthropologist.&lt;ref name="Douglas1979"/&gt; In fact, [[anthropology]] in general is important to [[economics]] because it talks about the socio-cultural relationships in [[economy]] and economy itself as a [[cultural system]] that is not just market-based.&lt;ref name="Erem2007"&gt;Erem 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, entire industries are often based on gift giving such as the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, gift-giving plays an important role in the [[cultural development]] of how social and [[business]] relations evolve in major economies such as in the case of the Chinese.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2467">'''Interpersonal complementarity hypothesis''' asserts that individuals often behave in ways that evoke complementary or reciprocal behavior from others.&lt;ref name=forsyth&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2010). ''Group Dynamics'', 5th Edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth. {{ISBN|0-534-36822-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, this hypothesis predicts that positive behaviors evoke positive behaviors, negative behaviors evoke negative behaviors, [[dominance and submission|dominant behaviors]] evoke [[dominance and submission|submissive behaviors]], and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Sadler&gt;Sadler, P., &amp; Woody, E.

Essentially, each action carried out by a member of a group has the ability to elicit predictable actions from other group members. For example, individuals who display evidence of positive behavior (e.g., smiling, behaving cooperatively) tend to trigger positively valenced behaviors from others.&lt;ref name=Carson&gt;Carson, R. C. (1969). ''Interaction concepts of personality.'' Chicago: Aldine.&lt;/ref&gt; In much the same way, group members who behave in a docile or submissive fashion tend to elicit complementary, dominant behaviors from other members of the group. This behavioral [[Carl Rogers#Incongruence|congruency]], as it applies to [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] and [[authority]], has been illustrated in several studies assessing [[Hierarchy|power]] [[Dominance hierarchy|hierarchies]] present in groups.&lt;ref name=tiedens&gt;Tiedens, L.

''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54'', 798–810.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies highlight the increased comfort experienced by individuals when the power or status behavior of others complement that of their own (e.g., a "leader" preferring a "follower").

'''Jeong Yol''' ({{lang|ko|정욜}}; born October 19, 1978) is a [[South Korea]]n [[LGBT]] rights activist. Since the foundation of [[Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea]] in 1997, he has been an early member of SLRK. From 1998 to 2012, he had been a representative of SLRK. His real name is '''Jeong Min-suk''' (정민석).

During the college time, he acknowledged that himself was [[gay]]. Later, while serving his [[conscription in South Korea|mandatory military service]], he came out as a homosexual. Then, his commanding officer took him to a mental hospital.&lt;ref name="phito"&gt;[http://www.ohmynews.com/nws_web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000238084 동성애자 인권운동가 정욜씨의 삶] 오마이뉴스 2005.02.18 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his discharge, he worked as a pastry chef for six years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnews.co.kr/news/quickViewArticleView.html?idxno=8503 무지개 깃발 휘날리며, 성소수자로 연대하다] {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, he joined SLRK. In 2000, he spent more time primarily for SLRK, From 2002 to 2012, he has been a representative of SLRK. In February 2003, the word "homosexual" was pointed as harmful word for youth by [[South Korea]]n government. So he struggled against the government with [[Kwak Yi-kyong]], [[Chang Pyong-kwon]] and others. In April 2004, banning of word "homosexual" for youth was eliminated in South Korea.

In 2003, he led a movement for the Elimination of Discrimination against LGBT. In 2004, he joined anti-war and peace movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=047&amp;aid=0000026043 어리석은 자들의 진보적 인권운동 10년] {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, he has fought for [[people living with HIV]]'s rights.&lt;ref name="bisope"&gt;[http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/View/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000167087 &lt;한겨레&gt; '에이즈 기사' 규탄 기자회견 열려] 오마이뉴스 2004.02.04 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3616">'''Jump-and-Walk''' is an [[algorithm]] for [[point location]] in [[triangulation]]s (though most of the theoretical analysis were performed in 2D and 3D random Delaunay triangulations). Surprisingly, the algorithm does not need any preprocessing or complex data structures except some simple representation of the triangulation itself. The predecessor of Jump-and-Walk was due to Lawson (1977) and Green and Sibson (1978), which picks a random starting point S and then walks from S toward the query point Q one triangle at a time. But no theoretical analysis was known for these predecessors until after mid-1990s.

Jump-and-Walk picks a small group of sample points and starts the walk from the sample point which is the closest to Q until the simplex containing Q is found. The algorithm was a folklore in practice for some time, and the formal presentation of the algorithm and the analysis of its performance on 2D random Delaunay triangulation was done by Devroye, Mucke and Zhu in mid-1990s (the paper appeared in Algorithmica, 1998). The analysis on 3D random Delaunay triangulation was done by Mucke, Saias and Zhu (ACM Symposium of Computational Geometry, 1996). In both cases, a boundary condition was assumed, namely, Q must be slightly away from the boundary of the convex domain where the vertices of the random Delaunay triangulation are drawn. In 2004, Devroye, Lemaire and Moreau showed that in 2D the boundary condition can be withdrawn (the paper appeared in Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications, 2004).

Jump-and-Walk has been used in many famous software packages, e.g., QHULL, Triangle and CGAL.

'''Substitutability''' is a principle in [[object-oriented programming]] stating that, in a [[computer program]], if S is a [[subtype]] of T, then objects of [[datatype|type]] T may be ''replaced'' with objects of type S (i.e. an object of type T may be ''substituted'' with any object of a subtype S) without altering any of the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.).  More formally, the '''Liskov substitution principle''' ('''LSP''') is a particular definition of a [[subtyping]] relation, called '''(strong) behavioral subtyping''', that was initially introduced by [[Barbara Liskov]] in a 1987 conference [[keynote]] address titled ''Data abstraction and hierarchy''. It is a [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantic]] rather than merely syntactic relation, because it intends to guarantee semantic interoperability of [[data type|types]] in a hierarchy, [[Object (computer science)|object type]]s in particular. Barbara Liskov and [[Jeannette Wing]] described the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows:
&lt;!-- inline math as LaTeX has poor baseline alignment (better with MathJaX HTML/CSS rendering of LaTeX)     
:''Let &lt;math&gt;q(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a property provable about objects &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;q(y)&lt;/math&gt; should be provable for objects &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a subtype of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.''
--&gt;&lt;!-- inline math as HTML --&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Subtype Requirement'': Let {{tmath|\phi(x)}} be a property provable about objects {{tmath|x}} of type {{math| T}}.  Then {{tmath| \phi(y) }} should be true for objects {{tmath|y}} of type {{math| S }} where {{math| S }} is a subtype of {{math| T}}. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- inline math as HTML bold
:''Let {{math| '''q(x)''' }} be a property provable about objects {{math| '''x''' }} of type {{math| '''T'''. }} Then {{math| '''q(y)''' }} should be provable for objects {{math| '''y''' }} of type {{math| '''S''', }} where {{math| '''S''' }} is a subtype of {{math| '''T'''. }}''
 --&gt;
In the same paper, Liskov and Wing detailed their notion of behavioral subtyping in an extension of [[Hoare logic]], which bears a certain resemblance to [[Bertrand Meyer]]'s [[design by contract]] in that it considers the interaction of subtyping with [[precondition]]s, [[postcondition]]s and [[Invariant (computer science)|invariants]].

== Principle ==
Liskov's notion of a behavioural subtype defines a notion of substitutability for objects; that is, if ''S'' is a subtype of ''T'', then objects of type ''T'' in a program may be replaced with objects of type ''S'' without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (e.g. [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]).

Behavioural subtyping is a stronger notion than typical [[subtyping of functions]] defined in [[type theory]], which relies only on the [[covariance and contravariance (computer science)|contravariance]] of argument types and [[covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariance]] of the return type. Behavioural subtyping is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] in general: if ''q'' is the property "method for ''x'' [[halting problem|always terminates]]", then it is impossible for a program (e.g. a compiler) to verify that it holds true for some subtype ''S'' of ''T'', even if ''q'' does hold for ''T''. Nonetheless, the principle is useful in reasoning about the design of class hierarchies.

Liskov's principle imposes some standard requirements on [[Type signature|signatures]] that have been adopted in newer object-oriented programming languages (usually at the level of classes rather than types; see [[Subtype#Subtyping schemes|nominal vs. structural subtyping]] for the distinction):

* [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|Contravariance]] of method arguments in the subtype.
* [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|Covariance]] of return types in the subtype.
* No new exceptions should be thrown by methods of the subtype, except where those exceptions are themselves subtypes of exceptions thrown by the methods of the supertype.

In addition to the signature requirements, the subtype must meet a number of behavioural conditions. These are detailed in a terminology resembling that of [[design by contract]] methodology, leading to some restrictions on how contracts can interact with [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]]:

*[[Precondition]]s cannot be strengthened in a subtype.
*[[Postcondition]]s cannot be weakened in a subtype.
*[[Invariant (computer science)|Invariant]]s of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.
* History constraint (the "history rule"). Objects are regarded as being modifiable only through their methods ([[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulation]]). Because subtypes may introduce methods that are not present in the supertype, the introduction of these methods may allow state changes in the subtype that are not permissible in the supertype. The history constraint prohibits this. It was the novel element introduced by Liskov and Wing. A violation of this constraint can be exemplified by defining a ''mutable point'' as a subtype of an ''immutable point''. This is a violation of the history constraint, because in the history of the ''immutable point'', the state is always the same after creation, so it cannot include the history of a ''mutable point'' in general. Fields added to the subtype may however be safely modified because they are not observable through the supertype methods. Thus, one can derive ''a circle with fixed center but mutable radius'' from ''immutable point'' without violating LSP.

== Origins ==
The rules on pre- and postconditions are identical to those introduced by Bertrand Meyer in his 1988 book ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]''. Both Meyer, and later Pierre America, who was the first to use the term ''behavioral subtyping'', gave [[proof-theoretic]] definitions of some behavioral subtyping notions, but their definitions did not take into account [[Aliasing (computing)|aliasing]] that may occur in programming languages that support references or pointers. Taking aliasing into account was the major improvement made by Liskov and Wing (1994), and a key ingredient is the history constraint. Under the definitions of Meyer and America, a MutablePoint would be a behavioral subtype of ImmutablePoint, whereas LSP forbids this.

'''Loubna Mrie''' (born 1991) is a [[Syria]]n civil rights activist.

Mrie comes from an [[Alawites|Alawite]] family from a village near [[Latakia]]. Her father is a high official in the [[Syrian Arab Air Force|Syrian Air Force]] Intelligence. Despite her family ties, she is one of a few Alawites to join the fight against the [[Assad regime]] and has been branded a traitor by her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Syria conflict: 'My father wants me dead'|date=2013-05-02|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22389484|language=en-GB|accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6576">[[Short-term memory]] for learned associations has been studied using the '''match-to-sample task''' (and the related '''delayed match-to-sample task''', and '''non-match to sample task'''). The basic procedure begins by presenting a subject with a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] (often a light of a particular color, or a visual pattern) that they will be required to remember, known as the 'sample'. They are then required to identify from a subsequent set of stimuli one that 'matches' the sample, known as the comparison stimuli. While the correct comparison stimulus option often matches the sample identically, the task can require a symbolic match or a matching of similar features (e.g. similar in color or shape).&lt;ref name="Mazur, J. E. 2013 pp. 226"&gt;Mazur, J. E. (2013). Learning and behavior. (7th ed., pp. 226). New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chudasama, Y. (2010). Delayed (Non)Match-to-Sample Task.

[[File:Matchtosample.png|thumb|Screen shot of the [[PEBL (software)|PEBL]] computerized match-to-sample task. The participant originally saw one of the two patterns, and after a delay was asked to choose which of the two was originally shown.]]

==Historical background==
Match-to-sample tasks were developed during the era of [[behaviorism]], and were described by, among others, [[B.F. Skinner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B. F. | year = 1950 | title = Are theories of learning necessary? | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 193–216 | doi=10.1037/h0054367 | pmid=15440996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blough D S.. Delayed matching in the pigeon. J Exp Anal Behav. 1959 Apr;2:151–160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ferster"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferster | first1 = C. B. | date = July 1960 | title = Intermittent reinforcment of matching to sample in the pigeon | journal = J Exp Anal Behav | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 259–272 | pmc=1404017 | pmid=13822532 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1960.3-259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early form&lt;ref name="ferster" /&gt; A pigeon would be presented with a colored light stimulus sample. It would then proceed to peck the sample and then be presented with two comparison stimuli. One comparison stimulus matches the sample (either because it is an identical color, or because the animal has learned an association such as green means left) and the other does not match. If it chooses (pecks) the matching comparison, then it is rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;("Models of Learning and Performance." Dr. Robert Cook's Homepage | Department of Psychology, Tufts University. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/avc/wright/.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more complex version of the task has formed the basis for human-centered cognitive test batteries since the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Englund, C. E., Reeves, D. L., Shingledecker, C. A., Thorne, D. R., &amp; Wilson, K. P. (1987). Unified Tri-Service Cognitive Performance Assessment Battery (UTC-PAB). 1. Design and Specification of the Battery. Retrieved from http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA182480&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perez, W. A., Masline, P. J., Ramsey, E. G., &amp; Urban, K. E. (1987). Unified Tri-Services Cognitive Performance Assessment Battery: Review and Methodology. Retrieved from http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA181697&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the task involves a 4X4 matrix pattern that is filled with yellow and red squares. Participants are allotted a specific amount of time to study the first pattern that appears on the screen. After the first pattern disappears, it is then replaced by a pair of matrices. One of these is the same as the previously viewed stimulus and one differs by one or more cells of the matrix. The participant then indicates which of the two was the presented stimulus. One trial of this tasks takes approximately 5–10 seconds.

==Strengths and weaknesses==
The strengths of this procedure are that participants have a limited time to think, so if they are more aware/alert, they should make more correct responses. It has also been hypothesized to be impacted by alertness, but resilient to practice effects.

==Sleep deprivation==
The match-to-sample task has been shown to be an effective tool to understand the impact of sleep deprivation on short-term memory. One research study&lt;ref&gt;Elsmore, T. F. (1995). A comparison of the effects of sleep deprivation on synthetic work performance and a conventional performance assessment battery. San Diego, Calif.: Naval Health Research Center.&lt;/ref&gt; compared performance on a traditional sequential test battery with that on a synthetic work task requiring subjects to work concurrently on several tasks, testing subjects every three hours during 64 hrs of [[sleep deprivation]]. Similarly, another study&lt;ref&gt;Habeck C, Rakitin BC, Moeller J, Scarmeas N, Zarahn E, Brown T, Stern Y. (2005). Brain research. Cognitive brain research&lt;/ref&gt; used an event-related [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] of the [[biological neural network|neural network]]s underlying the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval phase in the task. This test was used to discover the reduction in pattern expressions with sleep deprivation for each subject and how it related to the change in performance on the delayed-match-to-sample task. It also expanded the prefrontal areas regarding [[working memory]] and revealed substantial individual differences in performance. The test also reproduced findings of other working memory studies which demonstrated interactions between PFC and other parts of the brain.

==Delayed match-to-sample tasks and working memory==
The Delayed match-to-sample procedure is a slightly more complex variation of the task. In this case there is a time delay between the presentation of the sample and the comparison stimuli. By varying the length of the delay we can gain insight into how long the subject can retain information in their [[working memory]]. We can also use the delay to identify the extent to which modifying or adding new stimuli affects the performance of working memory in the subject. This is known as 'interference' and can come in two forms ; retroactive (following the presentation of the sample) or proactive (prior to the presentation of the sample).&lt;ref name="Mazur, J. E. 2013 pp. 226"/&gt;

{{main|Observational learning}}
'''Modeling''' is:
# a method used in certain techniques of [[psychotherapy]] whereby the client learns by imitation alone, without any specific verbal direction by the therapist (See [[Cognitive behavior therapy]]) and
# a general process in which persons serve as models for others, exhibiting the behavior to be imitated by the others&lt;ref&gt;VandenBoss, Gary (2006) ''APA Dictionary of Psychology''. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Westen 2006"&gt;Westen, D.; Burton, L. &amp; Kowalski, R. (2006) Psychology: Australian and New Zealand Edition. Milton, QLD. John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; This process is most commonly discussed with respect to children in [[developmental psychology]].

Confusingly, the word refers both to the behavior of the learner and the teacher.

Modeling is an important component of [[neurolinguistic programming]] (NLP), which field has further developed specialized techniques involving modeling. (See [[Neurolinguistic programming|NLP modeling]].)

As the name implies, in the modeling the client learns new skills by imitating another person, such as a parent or therapist, who performs the behavior to be acquired. A younger client may be exposed to behaviors or roles in peers who act as assistants to therapist &amp; then be encouraged to imitate &amp; practice the desired new responses. For example, modeling may be used to promote the learning of simple skills such as self-feeding for a profoundly intellectually disabled child, or more complex skills such as being more effective in social situations for a shy withdrawn adolescent.

==Albert Bandura==

The concept of behavioral modeling was most memorably introduced by [[Albert Bandura]] in his famous 1961 [[Bobo doll experiment|Bobo Doll Experiment]]. In this study, 72 children from ages three to five were divided into groups to watch an adult confederate interact with an assortment of toys in the experiment room, including an inflated Bobo doll. For children assigned the non-aggressive condition, the confederate ignored the doll. For children assigned the aggressive condition, the confederate spent the majority of the time physically aggressing the doll and shouting at it.

After the confederate left the room, the children were given the opportunity to individually interact with similar toys. Children who observed the non-aggressive confederate's behavior played quietly with the toys and rarely initiated violence toward the Bobo doll. Children who watched the aggressive confederate were more likely to imitate the confederate's behavior by hitting, kicking, and shouting at the Bobo doll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=1961|title=Transmission of Aggression Through Imitation of Aggressive Models|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3706/7acd33ad2ba2ed384baada06e7d74b800399.pdf|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=63|pages=575–582|via=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors influencing behavioral modeling ==

=== Psychological factors ===
Bandura proposed that four components contribute to behavioral modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brewer|first=Keri R.|date=1998|title=Observational Learning Effectiveness as a Function of Model Characteristics: Investigating the Importance of Social Power|url=|journal=Journal of Social Behavior and Personality|volume=26|pages=1–10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grusec|first=Joan E.|date=1992|title=Social Learning Theory and Developmental Psychology: The Legacies of Robert Sears and Albert Bandura|url=|journal=Journal of Developmental Psychology|volume=28|pages=776–786|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Attention.''' The observer must watch and pay attention the behavior being modeled.
# '''Retention.''' The observer must remember the behavior well enough to recreate it.
# '''Reproduction.''' The observer must physically recreate the actions they observed in step 1.
# '''Reinforcement.''' The observer's modeled behavior must be rewarded

=== Neurological factors ===
The [[mirror neuron system]], located in the frontal lobe of the brain, is a network of neurons that become active when an animal either performs a behavior or observes that behavior being performed by another. For example, the same mirror neurons will become active when a monkey grasps an object as when it watches another monkey do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Hyeonjin|last=Jeon|date=28 February 2018|title=From Neurons to Social Beings: Short Review of the Mirror Neuron System Research and Its Socio-Psychological and Psychiatric Implications|pmc=5810456|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neuroscience|volume=16|pages=18–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the significance of mirror neurons is still up for debate in the scientific community, there are many who believe them to be the primary biological component in imitative learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iacobono|first=Marco|date=2009|title=Imitation, Empathy, and Mirror Neurons|url=https://www-annualreviews-org.erl.lib.byu.edu/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163604|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=60|pages=653–670|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molnar-Szakacs|first=Istvan|date=22 February 2005|title=Grasping the Intentions of Others with One's Own Mirror Neuron System|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030079|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''No-analog''' (variants may omit the [[hyphen]] and/or use the [[British English]] ''analogue''), or alternately ''novel'', [[climate|climatic conditions]] ("no-analog climates") or [[community (ecology)|biological communities]] ("no-analog communities") in [[paleoecology]] and [[ecological forecasting]] are those without current equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;http://communicate.aag.org/eseries/aag_org/program/AbstractDetail.cfm?AbstractID=32500&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ecoworldly.com/2009/12/29/fossil-dung-fungus-helps-disprove-rapid-extinction-of-mammoths/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geography.wisc.edu/archiveNews/no_analogue_climates.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/070037&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common in both [[politics]] and [[public relations]].

Saying "I'm sorry you feel that way" to someone who has been offended by a statement is a non-apology apology. It does not admit there was anything wrong with the remarks made, and may imply the person took offense for hypersensitive or irrational reasons. Another form of non-apology does not apologize directly to the injured or insulted party, but generically "to anyone who might have been offended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elisadoucette/2014/11/30/the-art-of-apologies-and-why-elizabeth-lauten-failed-miserably-at-hers/|title=The Art Of Online Apologies And Why Elizabeth Lauten Failed Miserably At Hers|last=Doucette|first=Elisa|date=November 30, 2014|work=Forbes|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements that use the word "sorry" but do not express responsibility for wrongdoing may be meaningful expressions of regret, but such statements can also be used to elicit forgiveness without acknowledging fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazare|first=Aaron|title=On Apology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P9iADDrEI_AC|accessdate=3 October 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518911-7|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal significance==

===United States===
Non-apology apologizers may be trying to avoid [[litigation]] that might result from an admission of [[culpability|guilt]] or [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]].&lt;ref name="use google"&gt;[http://www.wm.edu/law/institutesprograms/lawtcp/documents/megan_e_bisk.doc+plaintiff+from+using+an+apology+as+evidence+of+liability&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=17&amp;gl=us&amp;client=opera Apology Statutes: A 22 State Survey] {{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states, including [[Massachusetts]] and [[California]], have laws to prevent a [[plaintiff]] from using an apology as evidence of liability.&lt;ref name="Frieswick"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ww2.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2001/05/say-youre-sorry/ | title=Say You’re Sorry | work=CFO | date=1 May 2001 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=Frieswick, Kris}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a medical doctor may apologize to a patient for a bad outcome without fearing the apology can be used against them at trial as evidence of [[negligence]].&lt;ref name="Bartolomei"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hahslaw.com/article-04.shtml | title=Apologies in the World of Litigation | publisher=Hill, Adams, Hall &amp; Scheiffelin, P.A. | accessdate=26 February 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621112606/http://hahslaw.com/article-04.shtml | archivedate=21 June 2006 | last1=Bartolomei | first1=Matt | last2=Black | first2=Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In November 2008, the Alberta legislature passed an amendment to the existing Alberta Evidence Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. A-18, geared at protecting apologizing parties from risks of legal liability and loss of insurance coverage. Section 26.1 of the Act provides that an apology does not constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability.&lt;ref name="Curial2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.millerthomson.com/assets/files/article_attachments/Please%20Don't%20Sue%20Me.pdf | publisher=Miller Thomson | date=3 June 2010 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | first1=Brian | last1=Curial | title=I'm Sorry (Please Don't Sue Me) | last2=Chau | first2=Maria | last3=Thomson | first3=Miller | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== "Mistakes were made" ===
The expression "[[mistakes were made]]" is commonly used as a [[rhetorical device]], whereby a speaker acknowledges a situation was handled poorly or inappropriately but seeks to evade any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by using the [[passive voice]]. The acknowledgement of "mistakes" is framed in an abstract sense with no direct reference to ''who'' made the mistakes. An [[active voice]] construction would be along the lines of "I made mistakes" or "John Doe made mistakes." The speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word "mistakes" also does not imply [[intent (law)|intent]].

''[[The New York Times]]'' has called the phrase a "classic [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] [[Linguistics|linguistic]] construct". Political consultant [[Bill Schneider (journalist)|William Schneider]] suggested this usage be referred to as the "past exonerative" tense,&lt;ref name="broder"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14mistakes.html | title=Familiar Fallback for Officials: 'Mistakes Were Made' | work=The New York Times | date=13 March 2007 | accessdate=2007-03-20 | author=Broder, John M. | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commentator [[William Safire]] has defined the phrase as "[a] passive-evasive way of acknowledging error while distancing the speaker from responsibility for it".&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite book | title=Safire's Political Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Safire, William | authorlink=William Safire | year=2008 | isbn=9780195343342 | page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commentator at [[NPR]] declared this expression to be "the king of non-apologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/14/183924858/its-true-mistakes-were-made-is-the-king-of-non-apologies|title=It's True: 'Mistakes Were Made' Is The King Of Non-Apologies|last=Memmot|first=Mark|date=May 14, 2013|work=NPR|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While perhaps most famous in politics, the phrase has also been used in business, sports, and entertainment.

===Ifpology===
Attorney and business ethics expert Lauren Bloom, author of ''The Art of the Apology'', mentions the "if apology" as a favorite of politicians, with lines such as "I apologize if I offended anyone".  Comedian [[Harry Shearer]] has coined the term '''Ifpology''' for its frequent appearances on "The Apologies of the Week" segment of ''[[Le Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://techmagazine-821469-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/129608125739/2015-will-be-a-year-of-apologies-maybe-yours | title=2015 Will Be a Year of Apologies.

One of the first references was in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' by Richard Mooney in his 1992 editorial notebook "If This Sounds Slippery ... How to Apologize And Admit Nothing". This was mainly in regard to Senator [[Bob Packwood]]: "Only in the event that someone should choose to take offense, why then he's sorry". Mooney goes on to cite [[Bill Clinton]], who said of [[Mario Cuomo]]: "If the remarks on the tape left anyone with the impression that I was disrespectful to either Governor Cuomo or Italian-Americans, then I deeply regret it." A famous example involved racially insensitive remarks made by golfer [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] about [[Tiger Woods]]; Zoeller's comments and his half-hearted ifpology were news for days and resulted in his being dropped from a commercial tie-in with [[K-Mart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Battistella|first=Edwin L.|title=Sorry about That: The Language of Public Apology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYY3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22if+I+offended%22+apology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZSTDU8CoJseAoQSC84DoBg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22if%20I%20offended%22%20apology&amp;f=false|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-930091-4|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Kador in ''Effective Apology'', "Adding the word ''if'' or any other conditional modifier to an apology makes it a non-apology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kador|first=John|title=Effective Apology: Mending Fences, Building Bridges, and Restoring Trust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ4gQAyfzTUC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22if+I+offended%22+apology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZSTDU8CoJseAoQSC84DoBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22if%20I%20offended%22%20apology&amp;f=false|year=2009|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57675-901-1|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 ifpology was made by ''CNN''{{'}}s [[Don Lemon]], who said, "If my question to her struck anyone as offensive, I am sorry, as that certainly was not my intention." This was in reference to his interview with [[Joan Tarshis]] where he suggested biting a penis as a way to avoid being orally sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Catherine|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/don-lemon-joan-tarshis-bill-cosby-rape|title=CNN Host To Accuser: Why Didn't You Bite Cosby's Penis To End Rape?|publisher=Talking Points Memo|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2015, [[Matt Damon]] made what ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' termed a "non-apology" apology when he said, "I am sorry that they [his comments] offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Paula Young|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/09/17/matt_damon_is_sorry_if_youre_offended_how_the_righteous_non_apology_of_socrates_became_the_tool_of_weasely_pr/|title=Matt Damon is sorry if you're offended: How the righteous non-apology of Socrates became the tool of weasely PR|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=September 17, 2015|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in reference to the backlash against Damon after he made comments about diversity to African American film producer [[Effie Brown]] on the September 13, 2015 debut of the HBO show ''[[Project Greenlight]]'' that were criticized as condescending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosen|first1=Christopher|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/16/matt-damon-project-greenlight-apology|title=Matt Damon apologizes for Project Greenlight diversity comments|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other versions===
On July 24, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans had offered the prime minister of Malaysia "what might best be described as a non-apology apology" for what the Malaysian government regarded as an insulting portrayal of Malaysia in an Australian television series, [[Embassy (TV series)|''Embassy'']].&lt;ref name="Shenon"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/24/world/cliffhanger-down-under-a-soap-opera-huff.html | title=Cliffhanger Down Under: A Soap Opera Huff | work=The New York Times | date=24 July 1991 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=Shenon, Philip | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to journalists, Mr Evans said he had "wanted to acknowledge fault where such acknowledgment is appropriate".

=== Sarcastic examples ===
Humorist Bruce McCall, in a 2001 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' piece entitled "The Perfect Non-apology Apology", defined the term as referring to "sufficiently artful [[doublespeak|double talk]]" designed to enable one to "get what you want by seeming to express regret while actually accepting no blame," and suggested some [[tongue-in-cheek]] apologies, such as:

{{quote|Nobody is sorrier than me that the police officer had to spend his valuable time writing out a parking ticket on my car. Though from my personal standpoint I know for a certainty that the meter had not yet expired, please accept my expression of deep regret at this unfortunate incident.&lt;ref name="McCall"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/22/weekinreview/the-perfect-non-apology-apology.html | title=The Perfect Non-Apology Apology | work=The New York Times | date=22 April 2002 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=McCall, Bruce | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==As a tactic==

Typologies of apology note they cover a range of situations and degrees of regret, remorse, and contrition, and that success is to be gauged by the result of the apology rather than the degree of contrition involved. Deborah Levi offers the following possibilities:&lt;ref name="Grigsby"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.aamc.org/download/164762/data/grigsby_fine_art_of_apology.pdf | title=The Fine Art of Apology: When, Why, and How to Say ‘I’m Sorry’ | author=Grigsby, R. Kevin | journal=International Journal of Healthcare &amp; Humanities |date=June 2007  | pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tactical apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology that is rhetorical and strategic—and not necessarily heartfelt
* Explanation apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology that is merely a gesture that is meant to counter an accusation of wrongdoing. In fact, it may be used to defend the actions of the accused 
* Formalistic apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology after being admonished to do so by an authority figure—who may also be the individual who suffered the wrongdoing
* Happy ending apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing fully acknowledges responsibility for the wrongdoing and is genuinely remorseful

While the non-apology apology is clearly unsuited to situations where an expression of remorse, contrition, and future change are obviously desirable (e.g. the "happy ending" apology), it may prove extremely useful in situations where little can be done to assuage the apparent offence or prevent its repetition, as when an airline apologises for a delay, in the full knowledge that a future repetition is inevitable. Such tactical apologies may have beneficial effects simply through the validation of the emotions of the offended party: they answer the basic human need for disagreeable emotions to be recognised and acknowledged as important, while protecting the apparently offending party from an expression of remorse.&lt;ref name="Winch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201106/the-antidote-anger-and-frustration | title=The Antidote to Anger and Frustration | work=Psychology Today | date=18 June 2011 | accessdate=2012-07-18 | author=Winch, Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiators often use this tactic to calm tense situations: "an apology can defuse emotions effectively, even when you do not acknowledge personal responsibility for the action or admit an intention to harm. An apology may be one of the least costly and most rewarding investments you can make."&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Ury"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Roger | last1=Fisher | title=[[Getting to YES|Getting to YES: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In]] | publisher=Penguin Book | last2=Ury | first2=William L. | location=New York | isbn=9780140157352 | oclc=24318769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''orienting response''' ('''OR'''), also called ''orienting reflex'', is an organism's immediate response to a change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to elicit the [[startle response |startle reflex]]. The phenomenon was first described by Russian physiologist [[Ivan Sechenov]] in his 1863 book ''Reflexes of the Brain'', and the term ('ориентировочный рефлекс' in Russian) was coined by [[Ivan Pavlov]], who also referred to it as the ''Shto takoye?'' (Что такое? or ''What is it?'') reflex. The orienting response is a reaction to novel or significant stimuli. In the 1950s the orienting response was studied systematically by the Russian scientist [[Eugene N. Sokolov|Evgeny Sokolov]], who documented the phenomenon called "[[habituation]]", referring to a gradual "familiarity effect" and reduction of the orienting response with repeated stimulus presentations.&lt;ref name="Sokolov, E.N 1960, pp. 187"&gt;Sokolov, E.N, Neuronal models and the orienting reflex, in ''The Central Nervous System and Behavior'', Mary A.B. Brazier, ed. NY: JosiahMacy, Jr. Foundation, 1960, pp. 187–276&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have found a number of [[physiological]] mechanisms associated with OR, including changes in phasic and tonic [[skin conductance response]] (SCR), [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), and heart rate following a novel or significant stimulus.  These observations all occur within seconds of stimulus introduction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2008.00702.x | last1 = Bradley | first1 = M.M. | year = 2008 | title = Natural selective attention: Orienting and emotion | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 1–11 | pmid = 18778317 | pmc = 3645482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, EEG studies of OR have corresponded particularly with the [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]] wave and [[P3a]] component of the OR-related [[event-related potential]] (ERP).&lt;ref name="fMRI"&gt;Polich, J. (2003). Overview of P3a and P3b. In J. Polich (Ed.), Detection of Change:Event-Related Potential and fMRI Findings (pp. 83-98). Kluwer Academic Press: Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural correlates==

Current understanding of the localization of OR in the brain is still unclear.  In one study using [[fMRI]] and SCR, researchers found novel visual stimuli associated with SCR responses typical of an OR also corresponded to activation in the [[hippocampus]], [[anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate gyrus]], and [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]].  These regions are also believed to be largely responsible for emotion, decision making, and memory.  Increases in cerebellar and extrastriate cortex were also recorded, which are significantly implicated in visual perception and processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200009110-00037| last1 = Williams | first1 = L | last2 = Brammer | first2 = M | last3 = Skerrett | first3 = D | last4 = Lagapolous | first4 = J | last5 = Rennie | first5 = C | last6 = Kozek | first6 = K | last7 = Oliveri | first7 = G | last8 = Peduto | first8 = T | last9 = Gordon | first9 = E | year = 2000 | title = The neural correlates of orienting: An integration of fMRI and skin conductance orienting | url = http://tamu.edu/faculty/bortfeld/689/689_Spring'07/readings/Williams_etal_NR2000.pdf| journal = Brain Imaging | volume = 11 | issue = 13| pages = 3011–3015 | pmid =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
When an individual encounters a novel environmental stimulus, such as a bright flash of light or a sudden loud noise, he or she will pay attention to it even before identifying it. This orienting reflex seems to be present early in development, as babies will turn their head toward an environmental change{Cowan, 1995}.  From an evolutionary perspective, this mechanism is useful in reacting quickly to events that call for immediate action.

===Habituation===
Sokolov's investigation of OR was primarily motivated in understanding habituation.  Provided the first introduction of a novel stimulus, defined in Sokolovian terms as any change from the "currently active neuronal model" (what the individual is currently focused on), results in OR.  However, with repeated introduction of the same stimulus, the orienting response will decrease in intensity and eventually cease.&lt;ref name="Sokolov, E.N 1960, pp. 187"/&gt;  When novel stimuli have an associated contextual significance, repeated stimulus will still result in a sequentially decreasing OR, though at a modified rate of decay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Orienting in decision-making===
The orienting response is believed to play an integral role in preference formation.   When faced with deciding between two options, subjects in studies by Simion &amp; Shimojo were shown to choose the items they preferentially orient their gaze toward.  This gaze can occur while the stimulus is present or after it has been removed, the latter causing gaze to be fixated at the point in which the stimulus had been present.  Gaze bias ceases following a decision, suggesting that gaze bias is the cause of preference and not its effect. Noting this postulated causal link with the irrelevance of a stimulus presence, it is argued that gaze orientation supports decision-making mechanisms in inducing a preferential bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/bf03193916| last1 = Simion | first1 = C | last2 = Shimojo | first2 = S | year = 2007 | title = Interrupting the cascade: Orienting contributes to decision making even in the absence of visual stimulation | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 69 | issue = 4| pages = 591–595 | pmid = 17727112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role between emotion and attention===
Both novelty and significance of a stimulation are implicated in the generation of an orienting response.  Specifically, the emotional significance of a stimulus, defined by its level of pleasantness, can affect the intensity of the orienting response toward focusing attention on a subject.  Studies showed that during exposure to neutral and emotionally significant novel images, both pleasant and unpleasant images produced higher skin conductance readings than neutral images.   With repeated stimulation, all skin conductance readings diminished relative to novel introduction, though with emotionally significant content diminishing more slowly.  Conversely, studies observing cardiac deceleration during novel stimuli introduction showed significantly more deceleration for unpleasant stimuli compared to pleasant and neutral stimuli.  These findings suggest that OR represents a combination of responses that act in tandem to a common stimulus.  More importantly, the differences between emotionally charged and neutral stimuli demonstrates the influence of emotion in orienting attention, despite novelty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In his 2007 book ''[[The Assault on Reason]]'', [[Al Gore]] posited that watching television affects the orienting response, an effect similar to [[vicarious traumatization]].

'''Parabolic coordinates''' are a two-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] in which the [[Coordinate system#Coordinate line|coordinate lines]] are [[confocal]] [[parabola]]s. [[Parabolic cylindrical coordinates|A three-dimensional version]] of parabolic coordinates is obtained by rotating the two-dimensional [[coordinate system|system]] about the symmetry axis of the parabolas.  

Parabolic coordinates have found many applications, e.g., the treatment of the [[Stark effect]] and the [[potential theory]] of the edges.

== Two-dimensional parabolic coordinates ==

Two-dimensional parabolic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; are defined by the equations, in terms of cartesian coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;
x = \sigma \tau
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = \frac{1}{2} \left( \tau^{2} - \sigma^{2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; form confocal parabolae

:&lt;math&gt;
2y = \frac{x^{2}}{\sigma^{2}} - \sigma^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

that open upwards (i.e., towards &lt;math&gt;+y&lt;/math&gt;), whereas the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; form confocal parabolae

:&lt;math&gt;
2y = -\frac{x^{2}}{\tau^{2}} + \tau^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

that open downwards (i.e., towards &lt;math&gt;-y&lt;/math&gt;).  The foci of all these parabolae are located at the origin.

==Two-dimensional scale factors==

The scale factors for the parabolic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\sigma} = h_{\tau} = \sqrt{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the infinitesimal element of area is

:&lt;math&gt;
dA = \left( \sigma^{2} + \tau^{2} \right) d\sigma d\tau
&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Laplacian]] equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}} 
\left(  \frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \sigma^{2}} + 
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \tau^{2}} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Three-dimensional parabolic coordinates==

[[Image:Parabolic coordinates 3D.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|Coordinate surfaces]] of the three-dimensional parabolic coordinates.  The red paraboloid corresponds to τ=2, the blue paraboloid corresponds to σ=1, and the yellow half-plane corresponds to φ=-60°.  The three surfaces intersect at the point '''P''' (shown as a black sphere) with [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] roughly (1.0, -1.732, 1.5).]]

The two-dimensional parabolic coordinates form the basis for two sets of three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates]]. The [[parabolic cylindrical coordinates]] are produced by projecting in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-direction.
Rotation about the symmetry axis of the parabolae produces a set of 
confocal paraboloids, the coordinate system of tridimensional parabolic coordinates. Expressed in terms of cartesian coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;
x = \sigma \tau \cos \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = \sigma \tau \sin \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = \frac{1}{2} \left(\tau^{2} - \sigma^{2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the parabolae are now aligned with the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis,
about which the rotation was carried out.  Hence, the azimuthal angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is defined

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan \varphi = \frac{y}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;

The surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; form confocal paraboloids

:&lt;math&gt;
2z = \frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{\sigma^{2}} - \sigma^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

that open upwards (i.e., towards &lt;math&gt;+z&lt;/math&gt;) whereas the surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; form confocal paraboloids 

:&lt;math&gt;
2z = -\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{\tau^{2}} + \tau^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

that open downwards (i.e., towards &lt;math&gt;-z&lt;/math&gt;).  The foci of all these paraboloids are located at the origin.

The [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[metric tensor]] associated with this coordinate system is

:&lt;math&gt; g_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2+\tau^2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; \sigma^2+\tau^2 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 0  &amp; \sigma^2\tau^2 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

==Three-dimensional scale factors==

The three dimensional scale factors are:

:&lt;math&gt;h_{\sigma} = \sqrt{\sigma^2+\tau^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h_{\tau}   = \sqrt{\sigma^2+\tau^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h_{\varphi} = \sigma\tau&lt;/math&gt;

It is seen that the scale factors &lt;math&gt;h_{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; are the same as in the two-dimensional case. The infinitesimal volume element is then

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = h_\sigma h_\tau h_\varphi\, d\sigma\,d\tau\,d\varphi = \sigma\tau \left( \sigma^{2} + \tau^{2} \right)\,d\sigma\,d\tau\,d\varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 \Phi = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}} 
\left[
\frac{1}{\sigma} \frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} 
\left( \sigma \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma} \right) +
\frac{1}{\tau} \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} 
\left( \tau \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau} \right)\right] +
\frac{1}{\sigma^2\tau^2}\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \varphi^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

'''Pariṇāma-vāda''' ({{lang-sa|परिणामवाद}}), or theTransformation theory is that which pre-supposes the cause to be continually transforming itself into its effects, and it has three variations – the Satkarya-vada of the [[Samkhya]]s, the Prakrti Parinama-vada of the [[Saiva Siddhanta]] and the Brahma-Parinama-vada of the [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] School of Thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy|author=John A.Grimes|publisher=SUNY Press|page=228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In Indian philosophy, there are basically three major cosmological theories of origination – 1) Arambha-vada (the theory of atomic agglomeration, based on the theory of Asatkarya-vada that the effect, which is something newly produced, does not exist in the cause), 2) Parinama-vada (the theory of real transformation, based on satkarya-vada that the effect, though phenomenally different, is substantially identical with the cause, and pre-exists latently in it), and 3) [[Vivartavada]] (the theory of apparent transformation or of false appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Thousand Teachings: Upadesasahasari of Sankara|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=SUNY Press|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fkLggRFFBwC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qpvPUsnUO8Sq7QaCnYDADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the fourth, [[Pratityasamutpada|Pratityasamutpada-vada]], the theory of dependent origination of [[Buddhism]].

According to the Sat-Karya-vada of the Samkhya School of [[Vedanta]], also accepted by the [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaitavada Vedanta]], causation is the manifestation of what is in the latent condition in the cause. The Prakrti Parnama-vada is based on the premise that the world is a transformation of the primordial Nature or [[Prakrti]]. According to the Brahman Parinama-vada, the world is a transformation of [[Brahman]].
Parināma-vāda is the term that refers to the [[Monotheism|Monotheistic Schools]]’ theory of ‘actual transformation’ different from [[Vivartavada]], the [[Monism|Monistic Schools]]’ theory of apparent transformation. It is the theory that the effect is a real transformation of the cause. According to the Brahman-parinama, this universe is a real transformation of Brahman.

==Arambha-vada==

The Arambha-vada theory of causation is advocated by the [[Nyaya|Nyaya School]], which is the creationistic view of causation and implies new creation as the effect that puts an end to its antecedent nonexistence and marks a new beginning. According to this school the effect, being the counter-entity of its prior nonexistence, must be held to be nonexistent before its appearance as an effect although it arose out of a previously existent cause. This theory is the reverse of Parinama-vada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traditions of Mysticism in Bengal|author=Sadhu Santideva|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt. Ltd|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGeitIm_--cC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4aTPUvnHMYqBhAfXsoG4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Arambhavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brahman as the cause==

The general Vedanta view is that Brahman is both, the Material and the Efficient, cause of the entire universe. There is nothing outside the Omnipresent Brahman. Brahman is the only being which contains the elements of cit and a-cit which are transformed into the forms of individual souls and material objects. There is no external world of souls and matter produced out of external material causes, and the very concept of [[Pradhana]] or Primal Matter, outside Brahman, involves contradiction.

==Sat-Karya-vada==

According to this philosophy, which follows from [[Satkaryavada|Sat-Karya-vada]], the cause first, potentially contains the effect in it as its [[Shakti]] (power), in an un-manifest way; then through the instrumentality of the efficient cause, that potential, latent, un-manifest effect is made actual, patent and manifest. Creation is not a new beginning but the manifestation of the already present un-manifest. The world, as the effect arisen from the pure cause, cannot be impure and imperfect because Brahman, the pure essence, merely transforms itself and does not change, and therefore, remains the same always, whereas the effects are mere names, due to words, for knowing and identifying the effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srikanth’s Philosophy of the Monotheistic Vedanta|author=Ruma Chaudhury|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|pages=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvwyXwxelxIC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prakrti]] is orderly. The [[Ṛta]] (order) that makes Prakrti appear to be composed of sub-systems arranged hierarchically with each sub-system being progressively inclusive, co-ordinating and interdependent is traditionally held to be the main basis of the doctrine of pre-existent effect or Sat-Karya-vada or the doctrine of real transformation or Parinama-vada, which R.A.Sinari states is “the earliest and epistemologically the most valuable attempt made in [[Indian Philosophy]] to set up a theory of causal order”. All phenomena, belonging to the surface and/or the deeper structure of Prakrti, are parinama i.e. transformation, of one and the same substratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Classical Yoga|author=Georg Feuerstein|publisher=Inner Traditions|pages=30–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWI9M9WC6MC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] says: मायां तु प्रकृतिं – “Know Maya to be Prakrti”. But, both the Samkhya School and the [[Brahma Sutra]]s base their understandings of the process of transformation for origination of things on the will of the creator. Badarayana by stating – नासतोऽदृष्टत्वात् | (Brahma Sutra 2.2.26), declares that Existence does not come out of non-existence. The entire creation is the result of Brahman’s will – अभिध्योपदेशाच्च | (Brahma Sutra 1.4.24), and that all transmigratory existence has no beginning - उपपद्यते चाप्युलभ्यते च | (Brahma Sutra 2.1.36).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|author=Gambhirananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=414, 294, 364|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/brahma-sutra-bhasya-of-shankaracharya-IDJ504/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantra view==

[[Tantra]] has influenced the [[Hindu]], the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and the [[Jainism|Jain]] traditions. According to the Srividya and the Saivite texts, the thirty-six tattvas covering the entire range of the un-manifest and manifest world, from the gross to the most subtle known as siva, pure illumination. Parinama-vada called Sakti parinama-vada, along with the doctrine of [[Abhasavada]] or [[Pratibimbavada]], explains the relationship between samvit or Tripura and the world; Tripura refers to the totality of the three-folds – sthula (gross), suksma (subtle) and para (transcendent), it represents. According to Abhasa-vada, samvit is like a mirror and the universe is a reflection appearing on it. But the universe cannot be outside the mirror i.e. citi or samvit. According to Parinama-vada, citi (consciousness) manifests in the form of the universe without losing its pristine nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sakti – The Power in Tantra|author=Rajmani Tigunait|publisher=Himalayan Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XnnFl6ZFHwC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWHPUoC7IMyThQe6woGgCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vivartavada==

[[Gaudapada]] treats creation as an imaginary event even though it seems to follow a sequential order. [[Badarayana]] also states that creation for Brahman is a mere pastime out of his spontaneity without any extraneous motive. But, Gaudapada, who was aware of the concepts of the real and apparent transformations, develops the doctrine of creation as an illusory transformation of Brahman without recourse to ‘vivarta’ terminology. The followers of Advaita School promoted by [[Adi Sankara]], to whom owing to [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] the world appears as if it is real i.e. distortion or false apprehension of the all encompassing unity of Brahman, use this term ‘vivarta’ to support the principle of the immutability of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of Gaudapadiya|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3ekXTZMZ_sC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4aTPUvnHMYqBhAfXsoG4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vidyaranya]] reminds us – एकमेवाद्वितीयं सन्नामरूपविवर्जितम् | - that before the creation there existed the Reality, one only, without a second, and without name and form ([[Panchadasi]] 5.5), this after explaining (in verse 2.59) that with Brahman as its basis, Maya creates the various objects of the world, just as a variety of pictures are drawn on a wall by the use of different colours, in other words, “Maya makes it possible for the imagination to attribute different changes to the unchangeable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swami|author=Swami Swahananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=59,124|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pancadasi-Swami-Vidyaranya/dp/8171205070}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is, therefore, said that “Maya resembles [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]], the source of common illusions, and described as the principle of cosmic illusion, thus differing from Prakrti of the Samkhyas which is real in the full sense of the term”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt. Ltd.|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uKXPUqz3DJSqhQedzYHYAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Both, Parnama-vada and Vivartavada, have their own critics. [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhava]] rejects [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]] on the ground that it is not possible for Brahman to transform at the loss of original nature, and there cannot exist unbridgeable gulf between Cit (Spirit) and Jada (Matter).239 A perfect being of pure intelligence and bliss cannot evolve out of itself an effect that is inert and wholly lacking in intelligence. [[Ramanuja]] accepts the material causality of Brahman which is absolutely without personal modification and which has the transforming Prakrti as its body. Vivarta concept is rejected because Brahman is not the constituent cause of Maya, therefore Brahman cannot be the constituent cause of the world through Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treasury of Mahayana Sutras|author=Garma C.C.Chanpage=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aktdBheKI-IC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6bPUtvnJ46ihgfY1oCYDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''poison pen letter''' is a [[Letter (message)|letter]] or note containing unpleasant, [[abuse|abusive]], or [[:wikt:malicious|malicious]] statements or accusations about the recipient or a third party. It is usually sent [[anonymity|anonymously]]. In the term "poison pen", the word [[poison]] is used [[Poison#Figurative use|figuratively]], rather than literally. Poison pen letters are usually composed and sent to upset the recipient. They differ from [[blackmail]], which is intended to obtain something from the recipient. In contrast, poison pen letters are purely malicious.

In the [[United Kingdom]], Section 1 of the [[Malicious Communications Act 1988]] covers most cases of poison pen letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/communications_offences/#an13|title=Communications Offences: Legal Guidance|date=7 November 2013|publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]]|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4416">In [[programming language]]s and [[type theory]], a '''product''' of ''types'' is another, compounded, type in a structure.  The "operands" of the product are [[data type|type]]s, and the structure of a product type is determined by the fixed order of the operands in the product.  An instance of a product type retains the fixed order, but otherwise may contain all possible instances of its [[primitive data type]]s.  The expression of an instance of a product type will be a [[tuple]], and is called a "tuple type" of expression. A product of types is a [[direct product]] of two or more types.

If there are only two component types, it can be called a "pair type". For example, if two component types '''A''' and '''B''' are the set of all possible values that type, the product type written '''A''' &amp;times; '''B''' contains elements that are pairs (a,b), where "a" and "b" are instances of '''A''' and '''B''' respectively. The pair type is a special case of the [[Dependent type#Dependent pair type|dependent pair type]], where the type '''B''' may depend on the instance picked from '''A'''.

In many languages, product types take the form of a [[record (computer science)|record]] type, for which the components of a tuple can be accessed by [[identifier|label]]. In languages that have [[algebraic data type]]s, as in most [[functional programming]] languages, algebraic data types with one constructor are isomorphic to a product type.

In the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]], product types are associated with [[logical conjunction]] (AND) in logic.

The notion directly extends to the product of an arbitrary finite number of types (a n-ary product type), and in this case, it characterizes the expressions which behave as [[tuple]]s of expressions of the corresponding types. A degenerated form of product type is the [[unit type]]: it is the [[empty product|product of no type]]s.

In [[Evaluation strategy#Call by value|call-by-value]] programming languages, a product type can be interpreted as a set of pairs whose first component is a [[value (computer science)|value]] in the first type and whose second component is a value in the second type. In short, it is a [[cartesian product]] and it corresponds to a [[product (category theory)|product]] in the category of types.

Most [[functional programming]] languages have a [[primitive notion]] of product type. For instance, the product of ''type&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''type&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is written ''type&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;code&gt; * &lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt; * &lt;/code&gt;''type&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in [[ML programming language|ML]] and &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;''type&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;''type&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]. In both these languages, tuples are written &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;''v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and the components of a tuple are extracted by [[pattern-matching]].  Additionally, many functional programming languages provide more general [[algebraic data type]]s, which extend both product and [[sum type]]s. Product types are the [[dual (mathematics)|dual]] of sum types.

==Example==
An example of a product type is the type of a vector in a [[vector space]] or an [[algebra over a field]]: the type is a product of a number type, and a direction type.  Thus, for example, the brochure for the [http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure International System of Units] starts out in section 1.1 saying "The value of a quantity is generally expressed as the product of a number and a unit", and also presents the unit product of a Newton and a meter with the product notation of mathematics: Newton meter (N m or N · m). This is properly indicative of the [[vector space]] nature of SI units over the [[abelian group]] of [[dimensional analysis#SI units|dimensions]] under multiplication, and the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s -- the SI units form an [[algebra over a field]].

Psychological symptoms can include but are not limited to: depression, chronic anxiety, anger, frustration, shock, disturbed sleep, disappointment, resentment, emotional or social withdrawal, intrusive thoughts or images, avoidance, helplessness, and fear&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://attheu.utah.edu/facultystaff/microaggression-and-racial-battle-fatigue/|title=Microaggression and racial battle fatigue|last=Adams|first=Brooke|date=5 December 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Researchers asserted that the distress and academic attrition that may be present with Black males at historically White universities should not be attributed to their lack of academic preparedness, rather the aftermath of subtle and cumulative racial discrimination that occurs in those places&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20017387|title=Black students : psychosocial issues and academic achievement|date=1989|publisher=Sage Publications|others=Berry, Gordon L., Asamen, Joy Keiko, 1953-|isbn=0803936648|location=Newbury Park, Calif.|oclc=20017387}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One of Smith's earliest studies on racial battle fatigue gathered 36 African American college students enrolled in historically white university campuses into focus groups with guided discussions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. During the time of the study, the students had been enrolled at: Harvard University; University of California, Berkeley; University of Michigan, University of Michigan Law School; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and Michigan State University. The students reported psychological responses aligned with racial battle fatigue and all perceived the college environment to be more hostile towards African American males than other groups&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Consistent patterns described by the students involved experiences of hypersurvellience and control from white people and anti-Black stereotyping&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Another published article on the findings from the study expressed stereotyping and scrutinizing from campus police officers&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. One student recounted an incident while at UC Berkeley: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[At] Underhill [residence hall], all last semester, almost every night, there’s Whites, there’s Asians in Underhill playing Frisbee, or playing football, or what have you at one o’clock in the morning. [They are] out there yelling, having a good time, and never [having] any problems. So, me and my friends [all Black males] are out there about to play some football, and it’s like 11 o’clock. All of a sudden, UCBP [UC-Berkeley Police] sweeps up. First, it’s one car, and they get out the car and it’s like, ‘We got some complaints. You guys need to leave.’ Mind you, there’s about maybe 10 of us and we’re out there still just tossing the football around. Then, after [the UCBP officer] is there for maybe about two minutes, all of a sudden from this entrance over here, we have two other [UCBP squad] cars swooping in on Underhill lot&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Despite stating to the police rationally that they were using campus property, the student and his friends were asked to leave or be arrested. The messages perceived by the students is that they as [Black males] were unwanted, unvalued, and not as respected compared to his other non-Black college peers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This experience may also reflects  community policing tactics employed by the police against Black males as a larger systemic issue&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Research on Latino/a/x students ==
A 2014 research study assessed if Latino/a/x students experience similar psychological and physiological stress responses on college campuses following racialized incidents that Smith described for African American males. They found that the common experiences of racial microaggressions were interpersonal, non-verbal, institutional, racial jokes and remarks, low teacher expectations, and false assumptions based on stereotypes&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Jeremy D.|last2=Smith|first2=William A.|last3=Hung|first3=Man|date=2014-07-03|title=Racial Battle Fatigue for Latina/o Students|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1538192714540530|journal=Journal of Hispanic Higher Education|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=303–322|doi=10.1177/1538192714540530|issn=1538-1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solorzano|first=Daniel G.|date=January 1998|title=Critical race theory, race and gender microaggressions, and the experience of Chicana and Chicano scholars|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F095183998236926|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=121–136|doi=10.1080/095183998236926|issn=0951-8398|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, they upheld that Latino/a/x experience more psychological stress because of racial microaggressions&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. As such, the stress responses highlighted by racial battle fatigue is quantitively linked to Latina/o/x students&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.    

== Limitations ==
The African American male experiences described in the earlier studies conducted cannot be generalized to other people of color, females, or African American females. The study assessing Latina/o students with racial battle fatigue had a small sample size and did not differentiate between gender&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6591">A '''self-validating reduction''' is kind of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] of which the result is a dramatic reduction in a person, group, or natural being. This term was coined by [[Anthony Weston]] and used in his book ''Back to Earth'' in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, Anthony (1994). ''Back to Earth: Tomorrow's Environmentalism''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Weston's work, Bob Jickling, et al. in ''Environmental Education, Ethics, and Action'' (United Nations Education Program ([[UNEP]]), 2006) wrote: 
:A self-validating reduction is a self-fulfilling prophecy in which one of the main effects of the "prophecy" is to reduce someone or something in the world. It acts to make that person or thing less than they, or it, are or could be; or it diminishes some part of the world’s richness, depth and promise. And, this reduction in turn feeds back, not only to justify the original "prophecy" but also to perpetuate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jickling, B., Lotz-Sisitka, H., O’Donoghue, R., Ogbuigwe. A. (2006)|title=''Environmental Education, Ethics, and Action''|url= http://cjee.lakeheadu.ca/public/journals/22/Ethics_book_english.pdf |publisher=United Nations Education Program (UNEP)|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and examples ==

According to [[Thomas Schelling]]’s classic (1978) treatment, the term “self-fulfilling prophecy” originally referred to a process in which a negative but quite possibly baseless expectation or prediction generates a [[feedback loop]] that ends by producing exactly the expected negative result: the diminution or defeat of something originally stable and seemingly solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schelling|first=Thomas|title=Micromotives and Macrobehavior|year=1978|publisher=W W Norton and Company|location=New York|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard example is a run on an initially solvent bank that can accelerate into a panic and drive the bank into bankruptcy simply because very few banks, however well-managed, can cash out large numbers of depositors upon unexpected demand. The term has since broadened greatly, however, to include any self-augmenting expectation, prediction, or disposition, many of which can also have positive effects. High self-esteem, however ill-founded, may produce more confident and capable acts, hence "fulfilling" itself. Other interpersonal expectations such as predictions of student success, initially quite baseless, can produce student success through subtly altering the expectations of their teachers.

A 1996 article by philosopher [[Anthony Weston]] refocused on part of what Schelling described as the original denotation of “self-fulfilling prophecy” using the more specific term “self-validating reduction”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weston|first=Anthony|title=Self-validating reduction: A theory of environmental devaluation|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1996|volume=18|pages=115–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "reduction" is an actual change – some kind of deprivation, loss, or diminution – not merely a "prophecy" in the sense of an attitude change in another person or society at large; and a change that comes to justify or "validate"  a changed judgment of the person changed or reduced, specifically by ignoring the actual cause of the reduction and attributing it instead to the essential character of the reduced person(s) instead. 

For example, the abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]] pointed out that

: Ignorance and depravity, and the inability to arise from degradation to civilization and respectability, are the most usual allegations against the oppressed. The evils most fostered by slavery and oppression are precisely those which slaveholders and oppressors would transfer from their system to the inherent character of their victims. Thus the very crimes of slavery become slavery’s best defense. By making the enslaved a character fit only for slavery, they excuse themselves for failing to make the slave a freeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douglass|first=Frederick|title=The Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered|journal=The Frederick Douglass Papers|year=1982|volume=2|series=Series One|pages=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many other possible examples are the Nazi concentration camps, designed to destroy the inmates' very humanity and thus to validate the Nazis’ prejudices and make systematic murder possible; and the ways in which prejudiced persons, convinced of (say) a co-worker's incapacity or inequality, are likely to reduce their co-workers to uncooperative antagonists: missing their own contribution to the process, they will then naturally conclude that their co-workers – not themselves – are incapable of good work.

== Other animals and nature ==

Self-validating reduction applies beyond the human sphere as well.  For example, wild animals who were not originally hostile or wary become that way upon being hunted. Scientific research on other animals that tends to avoid calling on their social instincts, in the name of objectivity, may in fact drive them away and actually induce an avoidance of humans that then is taken to be an objective and independent fact about them. Highly confined and managed animals under "[[factory farming]]" can be reduced to a state of social and physical dysfunction that seems to be their "inherent character", as Douglass puts it, thus making their treatment less morally troubling, and thereby making them more available for further reduction in turn.

The ecological critic [[Paul Shepard]] noted that land can be reduced in self-validating ways as well, as when Isaiah commands Israel to “tear down the [pagan] altars, break their images, cut down their groves” -– so that it ''becomes'' true, as it may not have been initially, that only the other world, beyond nature, is truly sacred.  Shepard called this kind of self-validating reduction “the evangelical desacralizing of place”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepard|first=Paul|title=Nature and Madness|year=1982|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5916">The '''self-model''' is the central concept in the theory of [[consciousness]] called the '''self-model theory of subjectivity''' ('''SMT'''). This concept comprises experiences of ownership, of first person perspective, and of a long-term unity of beliefs and attitudes. These features are instantiated in the [[prefrontal cortex]]. This theory is an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and explaining the phenomenology of [[consciousness]] and the self. This theory has two core contents, the phenomenal self-model (PSM) and the phenomenal model of the intentionality relation (PMIR).&lt;ref name="pmid18166398"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzinger T. |title=Empirical perspectives from the self-model theory of subjectivity: a brief summary with examples |journal=Prog. Brain Res. |volume=168 |pages=215–45 |year=2008 |pmid=18166398 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(07)68018-2 |series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=978-0-444-53050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Metzinger]] advanced the theory in his 1993 book ''Subjekt und Selbstmodell'' (Subject and self-model).&lt;ref&gt;Metzinger, T. (1993). ''Subjekt und Selbstmodell''. Paderborn: Schoningh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the PSM==
The PSM is an entity that “actually exists, not only as a distinct theoretical entity but something that will be empirically discovered in the future- for instance, as a specific stage of the global neural dynamics in the human brain”. Involved in the PSM are three phenomenal properties that must occur in order to explain the concept of the self. The first is mineness, “a higher order property of particular forms of phenomenal content,” or the idea of ownership.&lt;ref name="Being No One"&gt;Being No One&lt;/ref&gt; The second is perspectivalness, which is “a global, structural property of phenomenal space as a whole”.&lt;ref&gt;Being No one&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, it is what is commonly referred to as the ecological self, the immovable center of perception. The third phenomenal property is selfhood, which is “the phenomenal target property” or the idea of the self over time. It is the property of phenomenal selfhood that plays the most important role in creating the fictional self and the first person perspective. Metzinger defines the first person perspective as the “existence of single coherent and temporally stable model of reality which is representationally centered around or on a single coherent and temporally stable phenomenal subject”.&lt;ref name="Being No One"/&gt; The first-person perspective can be non-conceptual and is autonomously active due to the constant reception of perceptual information by the brain. The brain, specifically the brainstem and hypothalamus, processes this information into representational content, namely linguistic reflections. The PSM then uses this representational content to attribute phenomenal states to our perceived objects and ourselves. We are thus what Metzinger calls naïve realists, who believe we are perceiving reality directly when in actuality we are only perceiving representations of reality. The data structures and transport mechanisms of the data are “transparent” so that we can introspect on our representations of perceptions, but cannot introspect on the data or mechanisms themselves.  These systemic representational experiences are then connected by subjective experience to generate the phenomenal property of selfhood. Subjective experience is the result of the Phenomenal Model of Intentionality Relationship (PMIR). The PMIR is a “conscious mental model, and its content is an ongoing, episodic subject-object relation”.&lt;ref name="Being No One"/&gt; The model is a result of the combination of our unique set of sensory receptors that acquire input, our unique set of experiences that shape connections within the brain, and our unique positions in space that give our perception perspectivalness.

==Role of the prefrontal cortex==
The prefrontal cortex is implicated in all the functions of the human self model. The following functions all require communication with the prefrontal cortex; agency and association areas of the cortex; spatial perspectivity and the [[parietal lobe]]s, unity and the [[temporal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10487788"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vogeley K. |author2=Kurthen M. |author3=Falkai P. |author4=Maier W. |title=Essential functions of the human self model are implemented in the prefrontal cortex |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=343–63 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10487788 |doi=10.1006/ccog.1999.0394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to psychopathology==
Disorders of the self model are implicated in several disorders including [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and [[depersonalization]]. According to this theory, long-term unity is impaired in autism, similar to [[theory of mind]] deficits and [[weak central coherence theory]]. Individuals with autism are thought to be impaired in assigning mental states to other people, an ability that probably codevelops with long-term unity of self. Weak central coherence, that is, the inability to assemble information into a cohesive whole, reflects the same problems with creating a unified sense of self and benific sense extreme in [[narcissism]].&lt;ref name="pmid10993669"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ben Shalom D |title=Developmental depersonalization: the prefrontal cortex and self-functions in autism |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=457–60 |date=September 2000 |pmid =10993669 |doi=10.1006/ccog.2000.0453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''strip search phone call scam''' is a series of incidents, mostly occurring in rural areas of the United States, that extended over a period of about twelve years, starting in 1992. The incidents involved a man calling a restaurant or grocery store, claiming to be a police officer and then convincing managers to conduct [[strip search]]es of female employees, and to perform other bizarre acts on behalf of "the police". The calls were most often placed to [[fast-food restaurant]]s in small towns.

Over 70 such occurrences were reported in 30 U.S. states,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} until an incident in 2004 in [[Mount Washington, Kentucky]] which led to the arrest of David Richard Stewart. Stewart was acquitted of all charges in the Mount Washington case. He was suspected of, but never charged with, having made other, similar scam calls.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009&gt;{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Wolfson | work= [[The Courier-Journal]] | url = https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2005/10/09/a-hoax-most-cruel-caller-coaxed-mcdonalds-managers-/28936597/ | archive-url =  | dead-url = no | archive-date =  | title = A hoax most cruel | date = 9 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfson"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Wolfson |title=Trial to start for $200 million lawsuit over strip-search hoax |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-09-mcdonaldslawsuit_N.htm |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=9 September 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police reported that the scam calls ended after Stewart's arrest.

==Before the Mount Washington scam==
There were numerous prior incidents in many states which followed the pattern of the fraudulent call to a McDonald's restaurant in Mount Washington, Kentucky. Most of the calls were made to fast-food restaurants, but a few were made to grocery stores.

A caller who identified himself as a police officer or other authority figure would contact a manager or supervisor and would solicit their help in detaining a female employee or customer who was suspected of a crime. He would provide a description of the suspect, which the manager would recognize, and he would then ask the manager to search the suspected woman.

Some notable incidents were:
* Two calls were reported in 1992: one in [[Devils Lake, North Dakota]] and another in [[Fallon, Nevada]].&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt;
* On November 30, 2000, a female McDonald's manager in [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]], undressed herself  in the presence of a customer. The caller had convinced her that the customer was a "suspected sex offender" and that the manager, serving as bait, would enable undercover police officers to arrest him.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt;
* On January 26, 2003, an [[Applebee's]] assistant manager subjected a waitress to a 90-minute strip search after receiving a [[collect call]] from someone who purported to be a regional manager for Applebee's.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt;
* In February 2003, a call was made to a McDonald's in [[Hinesville, Georgia]]. The female manager (who believed she was speaking to a police officer who was with the director of operations for the restaurant's upper management) took a female employee into the women's bathroom and strip-searched her. She also brought in a male employee, who conducted a [[body cavity search]] of the woman to "uncover hidden drugs." McDonald's and GWD Management Corporation (owner and operator of the involved McDonald's restaurant) were taken to court over the incident. In 2005, U.S. District Judge [[John F. Nangle]] granted a summary judgment to McDonald's and denied, in part, a summary judgment to GWD Management.&lt;ref&gt;30 March 2005, [http://www.onpointnews.com/docs/hoax.pdf case 4:03‑cv‑00167‑JFN], [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia]], Savannah Division &lt;!-- the case name mentions the subject, so it has been excluded --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgments.&lt;ref&gt;28 September 2006, [http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/unpub/ops/200516425.pdf D.

* In July 2003, a [[Winn-Dixie]] grocery store manager in [[Panama City, Florida]], received a call instructing him to bring a female cashier (who matched a description provided by the caller) into an office where she was to be strip-searched. The cashier was forced to undress and pose in various positions as part of the search. The incident ended when another manager entered the office to retrieve a set of keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/07/15/State/Supermarket_superviso.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608064530/http://www.sptimes.com/2003/07/15/State/Supermarket_superviso.shtml |archivedate=2009-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2004, a female customer at a [[Taco Bell]] in [[Fountain Hills, Arizona]], was strip-searched by a manager who had received a call from a man claiming to be a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =  Anderson | last = Cooper | authorlink = Anderson Cooper | title = Transcript | work = [[Anderson Cooper 360°|AC-360]] | publisher = CNN | date = 30 March 2004 | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0403/30/acd.00.html | accessdate = 4 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mount Washington scam==&lt;!--linked from Compliance (film)--&gt;
On April 9, 2004, a call was made to a [[McDonald's]] restaurant in [[Mount Washington, Kentucky]]. According to assistant manager Donna Summers, the caller identified himself as a policeman, "Officer Scott." The caller gave Summers a vague description of a slightly built young white woman with blonde hair, who was suspected of theft. Summers believed the description provided was that of Louise Ogborn, a woman who was currently on duty at the restaurant.

The "police officer" demanded that Ogborn be searched at the restaurant because no officers were available at the moment to handle such a minor matter. Ogborn was brought into an office and ordered to remove her clothes, which Summers then placed in a bag and took to her car, as instructed. Ogborn then put on an apron to partially cover herself. Kim Dockery, another assistant manager,&lt;ref name="Wolfson"/&gt; was present at that time; Dockery believed she was there as a witness to the search.

Dockery left after an hour, and Summers told the caller that she needed to be working at the restaurant's counter. The caller then told Summers to bring in someone whom she trusted to assist with the investigation.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt; Summers first asked Jason Bradley, one of the restaurant's cooks, to watch Ogborn. When the caller ordered Bradley to remove Ogborn's apron and describe her, Bradley refused but did not attempt to call the police. Summers then called her fiancé Walter Nix Jr., who went to the restaurant and took over from Summers. After being told that a police officer was on the phone, Nix can be seen obeying the caller's instructions for the next two hours.

Nix removed the apron that Ogborn was wearing and ordered her to dance and perform [[Jumping Jack|jumping jacks]] while she was naked. Nix then ordered her to insert her fingers into her vagina and expose it to him as part of the "search." He also ordered her to sit on his lap and kiss him, and when she refused to do so, he spanked her until she promised to do it. The caller also spoke to Ogborn and demanded that she do as she was told or face worse punishment. Recalling the incident later, Ogborn said that, "I was scared for my life."

After Ogborn had been in the office for two and a half hours, she was ordered to perform [[oral sex]] on Nix. Summers returned to the office periodically, and during these times, Ogborn was instructed by the caller to cover herself with the apron. Nix became uneasy about what was happening. The caller then permitted him to leave on condition that Summers had to find someone to replace him. After Nix left, he called a friend and told him, "I have done something terribly bad."&lt;ref name="cj-20051009" /&gt;

With Nix having left, and short on staff due to the dinnertime rush, Summers needed someone to take Nix's place in the office. She spotted Thomas Simms, the restaurant's maintenance man, who had stopped in at the restaurant for dessert. She told Simms to go into the office and watch Ogborn. Simms, however, refused to go along with the caller's demands. At this point, Summers became suspicious and decided to call a higher-level manager (whom the caller earlier had claimed to have been speaking to on another phone line).

Speaking with her boss, Summers discovered that he had been sleeping and had not spoken to any police officer. She realized that the call had been fraudulent. The caller then abruptly ended the call. An employee dialed [[Last-call return|*69]] before another call could ring in, thus obtaining the number of the caller's telephone. Summers was now hysterical and began apologizing. Ogborn (shivering and wrapped in a blanket) was released from the office after three and a half hours. The police were called to the restaurant; they arrested Nix on a charge of [[sexual assault]] and began an investigation to find the perpetrator of the scam call.

The entire incident was recorded by a surveillance camera in the office. Summers watched the tape later that night and, according to her attorney, broke off her engagement with Nix.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt;

===Investigation, arrest, and trial===
Mount Washington police, after doing a simple word search on the Internet, quickly realized that this was only the latest in a long series of similar incidents that extended over a period of about 10 years. None of those incidents had continued as long, or with as many people involved, as the one in the Mount Washington McDonald's.

Although their initial suspicion was that the call had originated from a pay phone near the McDonald's restaurant (from which the perpetrator could see both the police station and the restaurant), police later determined that the call originated from a supermarket pay phone in [[Panama City, Florida]]. Having learned that the call was made with an [[AT&amp;T]] [[phone card]] and that the largest retailer of such cards was [[Walmart]], they contacted the police in Panama City.

The Panama City police informed the Mount Washington police that Detective Flaherty in Massachusetts was already conducting an investigation. Several similar scam calls had been placed to Boston-area restaurants, and Flaherty had already pulled [[surveillance camera]] footage from a Walmart in Panama City. Following Flaherty's lead, the Mount Washington police used the [[serial number]] of the phone card to find out that it had been purchased from a different Walmart than the Walmart that sold the card used for calls to Massachusetts restaurants.

Using the records of the Panama City Walmart, which showed the cash register and the time of purchase of the phone card, Mount Washington police were able to find surveillance camera footage of the purchaser of the card. The Massachusetts investigation had gone cold when their surveillance video failed to show the purchaser—the cameras had been trained on the store's parking lot and not on the cash registers.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

The purchaser in the Panama City video was wearing a [[Prison officer|correctional officer]]'s uniform of the kind used by [[Corrections Corporation of America]], a private security firm. Videos and still photographs from the two Walmarts were compared, and the same man was seen entering and exiting the Massachusetts Walmart at the time when a phone card was purchased there. Police used these images to produce front-and-back composite images of the suspect. Subsequent queries directed to the private security firm's human resources department led to the identification of the phone card buyer as David R. Stewart – a married man with five children – who was then arrested.

During his questioning by police, Stewart insisted he never had bought a phone card, but detectives found one in his home that had been used to call nine restaurants in the past year—including a call to a [[Burger King]] in [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]] on the same day when that restaurant's manager was reportedly duped by a scam call. Police also found in Stewart's home dozens of applications for police department jobs, hundreds of police magazines, as well as [[Police uniforms of the United States|police-style uniforms]], guns, and holsters. This was thought to indicate that the suspect had fantasized about being a police officer.&lt;ref name="cj-20051009" /&gt; 

Stewart was [[Extradition|extradited]] to Kentucky to be tried on charges of [[Police impersonation|impersonating a police officer]] and [[solicitation]] of [[sodomy]]. If convicted, Stewart faced up to 15 years in prison.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; On October 31, 2006, he was acquitted of all charges. Both the defense and the prosecution attorneys stated that a lack of direct evidence may have affected the jury's decision, which found him not guilty.&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Acquittal in hoax call that led to sex assault | work = | pages = | publisher = MSNBC | date = 31 October 2006 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15504125/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090325234639/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15504125/ | archive-date = 25 March 2009 | accessdate = 16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a suspect in similar cases throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt; Police stated later that since Stewart's arrest the scam calls had stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Associated Press | first = | author-link = Associated Press | title = U.S. jury awards $6.1 million to woman in McDonald's strip-search hoax | newspaper = [[International Herald Tribune]] | date = 5 October 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/05/america/NA-GEN-US-Strip-Search-Hoax.php | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Louise Ogborn, the victim, underwent therapy and medication to address [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] depression. She abandoned her plans to attend the [[University of Louisville]], where she had anticipated becoming a [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] student. In an interview with ABC News, she said that after her abuse she "felt dirty" and had difficulty making and maintaining friendships because she wouldn't "allow anyone to get too close to her".

Donna Summers ended her engagement with Nix soon after the incident.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; She was fired from McDonald's for violating corporate policies prohibiting strip-searches and prohibiting anyone not employed by McDonald's from entering the restaurant's office.&lt;ref name="Wolfson"/&gt; She entered an [[Alford plea]] to a charge of [[False imprisonment|unlawful imprisonment]] (a [[misdemeanor]]) and received one year of [[probation]]. She was not charged with any sex-related crime.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

Kim Dockery was transferred to another location. Walter Nix pleaded guilty to [[sexual abuse]], sexual misconduct and unlawful imprisonment in his trial. The judge agreed to a plea deal for Nix in exchange for his testimony against David Stewart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=1728839&amp;page=1l |title = Man Gets 5 Years for Role in Fast-Food Strip Search Ploy |publisher = ABC NEWS |date = 15 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Because he was the principal perpetrator of the beating and had engaged in the sex act, he received a five-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt;

====Lawsuits====
Three years after the incident, still undergoing therapy, Louise Ogborn sued McDonald's for $200 million for failing to protect her during her ordeal. Her grounds for the suit were:

* that McDonald's corporate headquarters were aware of the danger of a possible hoax because they had defended themselves against lawsuits over similar incidents at its restaurants in four other states
* that McDonald's had been subjected to similar hoaxes at least two years before the Mount Washington incident and they had not taken appropriate action as directed by their own chief of security and as outlined in his memo to McDonald's upper management&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news | url = http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Story?id=2684890 | title = Strip-Search Case Closed? | publisher = ABC News | date = 30 November 2007 |access-date = 30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donna Summers also sued McDonald's, asking for $50 million, for failing to warn her about the previous hoaxes.&lt;ref name="Wolfson"/&gt;

McDonald's based its defense on four points:
#Summers deviated from the company's management manual, which prohibits strip-searches, and therefore McDonald's should not be held responsible for any action of Summers outside the scope of her employment;
#[[workers' compensation]] law prohibited employees from suing their employer;
#Nix, who actually performed the acts, was not a McDonald's employee; and
#the victim did not remove herself from the situation, contrary to common sense.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt;

The civil trial began September 10, 2007, and ended October 5, 2007, when a jury awarded Ogborn $5 million in [[punitive damages]] and $1.1 million in compensatory damages and expenses. Summers was awarded $1 million in punitive damages and $100,000 in compensatory damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Associated Press]] |title=Ex-McDonald's worker wins lawsuit over strip search |work= |publisher=CTV |date=6 October 2007 |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071006/mc_lawsuit_071006 |accessdate=23 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304062757/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071006/mc_lawsuit_071006 |archivedate=4 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury decided that McDonald's and the unnamed caller were each 50% at fault for the abuse to which the victim was subjected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Schreiner | first = Bruce | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/1091834/mcdonalds_worker_wins_stripsearch_suit/ | title = McDonald's Worker Wins Strip-Search Suit | publisher = The Associated Press | date = 6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's and its attorneys were [[Sanctions (law)|sanctioned]] for withholding evidence pertinent to the outcome of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://indianalawblog.com/archives/2007/09/07/&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, McDonald's also was ordered to pay $2.4 million in legal fees to plaintiffs' lawyers.&lt;ref name="wolfsonC-J"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wolfson |first=Andrew |title=Judge: Company must pay legal fees |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=15 November 2008 |url=http://search.courier-journal.com/sp?eId=213&amp;gcId=64792167&amp;rNum=4&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnl.newsbank.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Fngate%2FLCJB%3Fext_docid%3Dlou62457799%26ext_hed%3DJudge%3A+Company+must+pay+legal+fees%26s_site%3Dcourier-journal%26ext_theme%3Dgannett%26pubcode%3DLCJB%26usefield%3Dsqn&amp;siteIdType=2 |postscript= }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2009, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the jury's verdict but reduced the punitive damages award to Summers to $400,000.&lt;ref name="Appeals court upholds $6 million award in McDonald's strip search case."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wave3.com/Global/story.asp?S=11545266|title=Appeals court upholds $6 million award in McDonald's strip search case|date=20 November 2009|work=www.wave3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's then appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court. While its petition was pending in 2010, Ogborn settled with McDonald's for $1.1 million and abandoned her claim for punitive damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McDonald's and strip-search victim settle lawsuit|author=|date=26 March 2010|newspaper=The Courier-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the court decisions, McDonald's revised its manager-training program to emphasize awareness of scam phone calls and protection of employees' rights.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt;

===Media depiction===
The Mount Washington McDonald's scam has been the basis of four media depictions:

* A short film ''Plainview'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1082864 ''Plainview'']&lt;/ref&gt; which played the [[Film festival|festival circuit]] in 2007–2008.
* [[Authority (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|Episode 17 of season 9]] of the television show ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (April 29, 2008) featured [[Robin Williams]] as the caller. The character played by Williams identified himself as Detective Milgram, a reference to the famous [[Milgram experiment]], which studied unreasonable obedience to authority.
* The 2012 feature film ''[[Compliance (film)|Compliance]]'', directed by [[Craig Zobel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lim|first1=Dennis|title=‘Compliance’ Raises Questions About Human Behavior|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/movies/compliance-raises-questions-about-human-behavior.html|accessdate=3 July 2017|work=The New York Times|date=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Compliance"&gt;{{cite news |title=COMPLIANCE, writer-director, Craig Zobel |url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/news/2012/01/compliance-writer-director-craig-zobel/ |work=[[Filmmaker Magazine]] |date=21 January 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2016 play ''Mai Dang Lao'', written by David Jacobi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagocritic.com/mai-dang-lao/ ''Mai Dang Lao'' review at Chicago Critic web site]&lt;/ref&gt; which opened at the Victory Gardens Theatre in Chicago.

The division of [[human rights]] into '''three generations''' was initially proposed in 1979 by the [[Czech people|Czech]] jurist [[Karel Vasak]] at the [[International Institute of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]]. He used the term at least as early as November 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Vasak, "Human Rights: A Thirty-Year Struggle: the Sustained Efforts to give Force of law to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights", ''UNESCO Courier'' 30:11, Paris: [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]], November 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasak's theories have primarily taken root in European law.

His divisions follow the three watchwords of the [[French Revolution]]: ''[[Liberté, egalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]''. The three generations are reflected in some of the rubrics of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] includes rights that are thought of as second generation as well as first generation ones, but it does not make the distinction in itself (the rights listed are not in specific order).

== First-generation human rights ==
First-generation human rights, sometimes called "blue" rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally [[civil and political rights|civil and political]] in nature: They serve [[negative and positive rights|negatively to protect]] the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, the [[right to life]], [[equality before the law]], [[freedom of speech]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], and [[voting rights]]. They were pioneered by the [[United States]] [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and in [[France]] by the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in the 18th century, although some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Rights of Englishmen]], which were expressed in the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689.

They were enshrined at the global level and given status in [[international law]] first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and later in the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In Europe, they were enshrined in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1953.

== Second-generation human rights ==
Second-generation human rights are related to equality and began to be recognized by governments after [[World War II]]. They are fundamentally [[economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social, and cultural]] in nature. They guarantee different members of the citizenry equal conditions and treatment. Secondary rights would include a [[right to work|right to be employed]] in [[decent work|just and favorable condition]], rights to [[right to food|food]], [[public housing|housing]] and [[universal health care|health care]], as well as [[social security]] and [[unemployment benefit]]s. Like first-generation rights, they were also covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and further embodied in Articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration, and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]].

In the United States of America, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed a [[Second Bill of Rights]], covering much the same grounds, during his State of the Union Address on January 11, 1944. Today, many nations, states, or groups of nations have developed legally binding declarations guaranteeing comprehensive sets of human rights, e.g. the [[European Social Charter]].

Some states have enacted some of these economic rights, e.g. the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] has enshrined the [[Campaign for Fiscal Equity#Campaign for Fiscal Equity.2C Inc. v. State|right to a free education]],&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Const. ART. XI, § 1, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=**CNSA11S1+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=14425895+&amp;TARGET=VIEW New York State Assembly website].

Retrieved February 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; in its [[constitutional law]].

These rights are sometimes referred to as "[[Red#Use by political movements|red]]" rights. They impose upon the government the duty to respect and promote and fulfill them, but this depends on the availability of resources. The duty is imposed on the state because it controls its own resources. No one has the direct [[right to housing]] and [[right to education]]. (In [[South Africa]], for instance, the right is not, ''per se'', to housing, but rather "to have access to adequate housing",&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa]], [[1996 in South Africa|1996]], s 26(1).&lt;/ref&gt; realised on a progressive basis.&lt;ref&gt;s s 26(2).&lt;/ref&gt;)

The duty of government is in the realization of these positive rights.

== Third-generation human rights ==
Third-generation human rights are those rights that go beyond the mere civil and social, as expressed in many progressive documents of [[international law]], including the 1972 [[Stockholm Declaration]] of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], the 1992 [[Rio Declaration]] on Environment and Development, and other pieces of generally aspirational "[[soft law]]". Because of the present-day tilting toward national [[sovereignty]] and the preponderance of would-be offender nations, these rights have been hard to enact in legally binding documents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The term "third-generation human rights" remains largely unofficial, just as the also-used moniker of "[[Green politics|green]]" rights, and thus houses an extremely broad spectrum of rights, including:

* [[Group rights|Group]] and [[collective rights]]
* Right to [[self-determination]]
* [[right to development|Right to economic and social development]]
* Right to a [[healthy environment]]
* Right to [[natural resources]]
* Right to [[communication|communicate]] and [[Communication Rights|communication rights]]
* Right to participation in [[cultural heritage]]
* Rights to [[intergenerational equity]] and [[sustainability]]

The [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] ensures many of those: right to self-determination, right to development, right to natural resources and right to satisfactory environment.&lt;ref&gt;[[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], Article 20, 21, 22 and 24&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries also have constitutional mechanisms for safeguarding third-generation rights. For example, the Hungarian [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pieandcoffee.org/2010/02/26/sandor-fulop/ Notes: Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eduskunta|Parliament of Finland]]'s [[Committee for the Future]], and the erstwhile [[Commission for Future Generations]] in the Knesset in Israel.

Some international organizations have offices for safeguarding such rights. An example is the [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. The [[Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission)|Directorate-General for the Environment]] of the European Commission has as its mission "protecting, preserving and improving the environment for present and future generations, and promoting sustainable development".

A few jurisdictions have enacted provisions for [[environmental protection]], e.g. New York's "forever wild" constitutional article,&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Const. ART XIV, § 1.  Found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=**CNSA14S1+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=08222978+&amp;TARGET=VIEW New York State Assembly website].  Retrieved February 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which is enforceable by action of the [[New York State Attorney General]] or by any citizen ''[[ex rel.]]'' with the consent of the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]].&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Const. ART XIV, § 5.  Found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=**CNSA14S5+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=08222978+&amp;TARGET=VIEW New York State Assembly website].

== Commentary ==
[[Maurice Cranston]] argued that [[scarcity]] means that supposed second-generation and third-generation rights are not really rights at all.&lt;ref&gt;Cranston, Maurice. "Human Rights: Real and Supposed," in ''Political Theory and the Rights of Man'', edited by D. D. Raphael (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1967), pp. 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt; If one person has a right, others have a duty to respect that right, but governments lack the resources necessary to fulfill the duties implied by citizens' supposed second- and third-generation rights.

Charles Kesler, a professor of government at [[Claremont McKenna College]] and senior fellow of the [[Claremont Institute]], has argued that second- and third-generation human rights serve as an attempt to cloak political goals, which the majority may well agree are good things in and of themselves, in the language of rights, and thus grant those political goals inappropriate connotations. In his opinion, calling socio-economic goods "rights" inherently creates a related concept of "[[duties]]", so that other citizens have to be coerced by the government to give things to other people in order to fulfill these new rights. He also has stated that, in the US, the new rights create a "nationalization" of political decision-making at the federal level in violation of federalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/47825927.html |title=Charles Kesler on the Grand Liberal Project |date=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |publisher=''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715094108/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/47825927.html |archivedate=July 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Soft Despotism, Democracy's Drift'', Paul Rahe, the Charles O. Lee and Louise K. Lee Chair in Western Heritage at [[Hillsdale College]], wrote that focusing on equality-based rights leads to a subordination to the initial civil rights to an ever-expanding government, which would be too incompetent to provide for its citizens correctly and would merely seek to subordinate more rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/72025472.html |title=Soft Despotism with Paul Rahe |date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |publisher=''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104072827/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/72025472.html |archivedate=January 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th century philosopher [[Frederic Bastiat]] summarized the conflict between these [[negative and positive rights]] by saying:

{{quote|M. de Lamartine wrote me one day: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first half." And, in fact, it is quite impossible for me to separate the word "fraternity" from the word "voluntary". It is quite impossible for me to conceive of fraternity as legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice being legally trampled underfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Economist [[F. A. Hayek]] has argued that the second generation concept of "[[social justice]]" cannot have any practical political meaning:

{{quote|No state of affairs as such is just or unjust: it is only when we assume that somebody is responsible for having brought it about ... In the same sense, a [[free market|spontaneously working market]], where prices act as guides to action, cannot take account of what people in any sense need or deserve, because it creates a distribution which nobody has designed, and something which has not been designed, a mere state of affairs as such, cannot be just or unjust. And the idea that things ought to be designed in a "just" manner means, in effect, that we must abandon the market and turn to a [[planned economy]] in which somebody decides how much each ought to have, and that means, of course, that we can only have it at the price of the complete abolition of personal liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/1992/07/01/the-road-from-serfdom/4|publisher=''[[Reason Magazine|Reason]]''|accessdate=January 4, 2010|title=The Road from Serfdom: Forseeing the Fall|first=Thomas W.|last=Hazlett|date=July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[New York University School of Law]] professor of law [[Jeremy Waldron]] has written in response to critics of the second-generation rights:

{{quote|In any case, the argument from first-generation to second-generation rights was never supposed to be a matter of conceptual analysis. It was rather this: if one is really concerned to secure civil or political liberty for a person, that commitment should be accompanied by a further concern about the conditions of the person's life that make it possible for him to enjoy and exercise that liberty. Why on earth would it be worth fighting for this person's liberty (say, his liberty to choose between A and B) if he were left in a situation in which the choice between A and B meant nothing to him, or in which his choosing one rather than the other would have no impact on his life?"&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, 1993. Liberal Rights: Collected Papers, page 7, 1981–91. {{ISBN|0-521-43617-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[socialist]] and [[political economist]] [[Karl Polanyi]] made the antithetical argument to Hayek in the book ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]''. Polanyi wrote that an uncontrolled free market would lead to repressive economic concentration and then to a co-opting of democratic governance that degrades civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Karl Polanyi]]|title=[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|year=2001|ISBN=978-0-8070-5643-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Conference on Human Rights]] opposed the distinction between [[civil and political rights]] (negative rights) and [[economic, social and cultural rights]] (positive rights) that resulted in the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] proclaiming that "all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated".&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], Part I para 5&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tzompantli''' {{IPA-nah|t͡somˈpant͡ɬi|}} or '''skull rack''' is a type of wooden rack or palisade documented in several [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations, which was used for the public display of [[human skull]]s, typically those of [[Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica|war captives]] or other [[human sacrifice|sacrificial victims]]. It is a scaffold-like construction of poles on which heads and skulls were placed after holes had been made in them.&lt;ref&gt;Palka (2000) pg 152&lt;/ref&gt; Many have been documented throughout Mesoamerica, and range from the Epiclassic (ca. 600–900 CE) through early Post-Classic (ca. 900–1250 CE).&lt;ref name=Mendo397&gt;Mendoza (2007) pg 397&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 archeologists announced the discovery of the Huey Tzompantli, with more than 650 skulls, in the archeological zone of the Templo Mayor in Mexico city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-archaeology-skulls-idUSKBN19M3Q6|title=Tower of human skulls in Mexico casts new light on Aztecs|date=2017-07-03|access-date=2017-07-05|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name comes from the [[Classical Nahuatl]] language of the [[Aztec]]s but is also commonly applied to similar structures depicted in other civilizations. Its precise [[etymology]] is uncertain although its general interpretation is "skull rack," "wall of skulls," or "skull banner."&lt;ref name=Mendo397 /&gt; It's most likely a compound of the Nahuatl words ''tzontecomatl'' ("skull"; from ''tzontli'' or ''tzom-'' "hair", "scalp" and ''tecomatl'' ("[[gourd]]" or "container"), and ''pamitl'' ("banner"). That derivation has been ascribed to explain the depictions in several codices that associate these with banners; however, Nahuatl linguist [[Frances Karttunen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Frances Karttunen | title=Linguist list server | work=etymology of Tzompantli | url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0501a&amp;L=nahuat-l&amp;D=1&amp;P=197 | accessdate=September 25, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025200407/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0501a&amp;L=nahuat-l&amp;D=1&amp;P=197 | archivedate=October 25, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed that ''pantli'' means merely "row" or "wall."

==Historical distribution==

===General information===
It was most commonly erected as a linearly-arranged series of vertical posts connected by a series of horizontal crossbeams. The skulls were pierced or threaded laterally along these horizontal stakes. An alternate arrangement, more common in the Maya regions, was for the skulls to be impaled on top of one another along the vertical posts.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson et al. (1992) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tzompantli'' are known chiefly from their depiction in Late Postclassic (13th to 16th centuries) and post-Conquest (mid-16th to 17th centuries) [[Maya codices|codices]], contemporary accounts of the [[conquistador]]es, and several other inscriptions. However, a ''tzompantli''-like structure, thought to be the first instance of such structures, has been excavated from the Proto-Classic [[Zapotec civilization]] at the [[La Coyotera]], [[Oaxaca]] site, dated from c. 2nd century BCE to 3rd century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1982), pp.236-239&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapotecs called this structure a "''yàgabetoo''," and it displayed 61 skulls.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tzompantli'' are also noted in other Mesoamerican [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] cultures, such as the [[Toltec]] and [[Mixtec]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe (2011) 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza (2007) 396&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toltec===
At the Toltec capital of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] exists the first indications in Central Mexico of a real fascination with skulls and skeletons. Tula flourished from the ninth until the thirteenth century. The site includes the decimated remains of a tzompantli. The tzompantli at Tula displayed multiple rows of stone carved skulls adorning the sides of a broad platform upon which the actual skulls of sacrificial victims were exhibited. The tzompantli appeared during the final phases of civilization at Tula, which was destroyed around 1200.&lt;ref&gt;Brandes (2009) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maya===
Other examples are indicated from [[Maya civilization]] sites such as [[Uxmal]] and other [[Puuc]] region sites of the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]], dating from around the late 9th-century decline of the [[Maya Classical Era]]. A particularly fine and intact inscription example survives at the extensive [[Chichen Itza]] site.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993), p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Großes Bild|2014-01-03 Tzompantli in Chichén Itzá anagoria.jpg|1500px|[[Chichén Itzá]] Tzompantli}}

Human sacrifice on a large scale was introduced to the Maya by the Toltecs from the appearances of the tzompantli by the Chichen Itza ball courts. Six ball court reliefs at Chichen Itza depict the decapitation of a ball player; it seems that the losers would be beheaded and would have their skulls placed on the Tzompantli.&lt;ref name=Coe1956&gt;Coe (2011) pg. 195-196 (or 210 in the 2015 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|A ''tzompantli'' is illustrated to the right of a depiction of an Aztec temple dedicated to the deity [[Huitzilopochtli]]; from Juan de Tovar's 1587 manuscript, also known as the [[Ramírez Codex]].]]

===Aztec era===
The word ''tzompantli'' is [[Nahuatl]] and was used by the [[Aztec|Aztecs]] to refer to the skull-racks found in many Aztec cities; The first and most prominent example is the Huey Tzompantli (Great Skull-rack) located the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]] and described by the early conquistadors. There were at least five more skull racks in Tenochtitlan but by all accounts they were much smaller. 

According to [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]'s eye-witness account, the ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España]]'', written several decades after the event, after Cortes' expedition was forced to make their initial retreat from Tenochtitlan, the Aztecs erected a makeshift tzompantli to display the severed heads of men and horses they had captured from the invaders. This ''tzompantli'' is depicted in the twelfth book of the Florentine Codex. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/10096/view/1/1/|title=General History of the Things of New Spain by Fray Bernardino de Sahagún: The Florentine Codex — Viewer — World Digital Library|website=www.wdl.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.famsi.org/research/pohl/pohl_meeting.html|title=FAMSI - John Pohl's Mesoamerica - Historical Records of the Conquest|last=famsi|first=|date=|website=www.famsi.org|language=EN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This taunting is also depicted in an Aztec codex which relates the story, and the subsequent battles which led to the eventual capture of the city by the Spanish forces and their allies.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz del Castillo (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the stay of Cortes' expedition in the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] (initially as guest-captives of the Emperor [[Moctezuma II]], before the battle which would lead to the conquest), they reported a wooden ''tzompantli'' altar adorned with the skulls from recent sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2009) pg 65&lt;/ref&gt; Within the complex of the [[Templo Mayor]] itself, a relief in [[stucco]] depicted these sacrifices; the remains of this relief have survived and may now be seen in the ruins in the [[Zócalo]] of present-day [[Mexico City]]. 

==== Preparation of ''tzompantli'' ====
Excavations at [[Templo Mayor]] in the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] have revealed many skulls belonging to women and children, in addition to those of men, a demonstration of the diversity of the [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|human sacrifices in Aztec culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40473547|title=Aztec tower of human skulls uncovered in Mexico City|last1=BBC Staff|date=2 July 2017|work=British Broadcasting Company|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After displaying severed heads, many scholars have determined that limbs of Aztec victims would be [[Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America|cannibalized]] &lt;ref&gt;Michael Harner (1977) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  Fray Diego Durán confirms this, stating that skulls were delivered to temples after "the flesh had been eaten".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Durán, Diego. ''Book of the gods and rites and the ancient calendar''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1971. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

Durán notes that the ''tzompantli'' were periodically renovated. Regarding this, Durán states&lt;blockquote&gt;"When [the skulls] become old and deteriorated, they fell in pieces. When the palisade become old, however, it was renovated, and on its removal many [skulls] broke. Others were removed to make room for more, so that there would be a place for those were to be killed later"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Archeologist Eduardo Contreras believes that the tissue attached to skulls was removed prior to a ''tzompantli'' pole being inserted through the side of the skulls. He bases these assumptions off of excavations of the Plaza de las Tres Culturas at Tlatelolco, Mexico City between 1960 and 1965. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Huey Tzompantli ====
The Huey Tzompantli was the central ''tzompantli'' found in Tenochtitlan. The skull rack here served as a reminder of the Aztec's ongoing [[Flower war|Flowery Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Koontz (2008) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect of [[Aztec warfare]] was the capture of enemy warriors to serve as sacrificial victims, which is evident from the number of warriors found sacrificed around Aztec structures.&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Koontz (2008) pg 110&lt;/ref&gt; One conquistador, [[Andrés de Tapia]], was given the task of counting the skulls on the "tzompantli" at Tenochtitlan and estimated that there were 136,000 skulls on it.&lt;ref&gt;Harner (1977) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; However, based on numbers given by Taipa and Fray [[Diego Durán]], Bernard Ortiz de Montellano&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz de Montellano 1983&lt;/ref&gt; has calculated that there were at most 60,000 skulls on the ''"Hueyi Tzompantli"'' (Great Skullrack) of Tenochtitlan. The "Hueyi Tzompantli" consisted of a massive masonry platform composed of “thirty long steps” measuring fully 60 meters in length by 30 meters wide at its summit. Atop of the aforementioned platform was erected an equally formidable wooden palisade and scaffolding consisting of between 60 and 70 massive uprights or timbers woven together with an impressive constellation of horizontal cross beams upon which were suspended the tens of thousands of decapitated human heads once impaled thereon.&lt;ref&gt;Ruben Mendoza (2007) p. 407-408.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding, this Bernal Díaz de Castillo states &lt;blockquote&gt;"I remember that they had in a plaza, where there were some shrines, so many places of dead skulls, which could be counted, according to the concert as they were set, that when they appeared they would be more than one hundred thousand; and I say again about one hundred thousand. And in another part of the square were as many rowers of bones without meat, bones of dead, that could not be counted; and they had in many beams many heads hanging from one part to another. And  keeping those bones and skulls were three priests, who, as we understood, wherein charge of them.  Of which we had to look more after we entered the land well: in all the villages they were that way, and also in Tascala."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.rae.es/sites/default/files/Aparato_de_variantes_Historia_verdadera_de_la_conquista_de_la_Nueva_Espana.pdf|title=Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de la Nueva España|last=Díaz del Castillo|first=Bernal|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Various scholarly interpretations of the cosmological importance of Huey Tzompantli's placement have emerged.  Matos Monteczum claims that a central ''tzompantli'' was placed north of the Templo Mayor. Monteczuma notes that no corresponding shrine was found south. Monteczuma also notes that Mexica views of the universe, which divide the universe into a horizontal and vertical plane, claim that the northern sector of the horizontal plane corresponds to Mictlampa, or the land of the dead.  &lt;ref&gt;Vol. 53, No. 4, 75th Anniversary Meeting of the American Academy of Religion (Dec., 1985), pp. 797-813&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, Rubén G. Mendoza contends that the Huey Tzompantli was placed on an east-west axis between the Templo Mayor and a principal ball court.  The Huey Tzompantli would have been aligned with the  marker within the Templo Mayor dividing one half for Tlaloc and the other half for Huitzilopochtli. Mendoza argues that as the sun traveled through the sky, it would have ascended into the "vault of the heavens," represented by the Huey Tzompantli. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MENDOZA|first=RUBÉN G.|date=2007|title=The Divine Gourd Tree|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-48303-0_16.pdf|journal=SpringerLink|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-48303-0_16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Modern archeological evidence has found that this large palisade was flanked by two circular towers made out of skulls and mortar. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/06/feeding-gods-hundreds-skulls-reveal-massive-scale-human-sacrifice-aztec-capital|title=Feeding the gods: Hundreds of skulls reveal massive scale of human sacrifice in Aztec capital|date=2018-06-20|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Historical depictions ====
[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 2r.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza]]
There are numerous depictions of ''tzompantli'' in [[Aztec codices]], dating from around the time or shortly after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], such as the [[Diego Durán#Literary works and influence|''Durán Codex'']], ''[[Ramírez Codex]]'', and ''[[Codex Borgia]]''. The [[Codex Mendoza]] contains multiple depictions of ''tzompantli.'' The Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza depicts a ''tzompantli'' holding single skull next to an eagle perched on a cactus. A similar depiction of a ''tzompantli is'' used to represent the town of Tzompanco in the Codex Mendoza. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/codex-mendoza-1542/|title=Codex Mendoza (1542) – The Public Domain Review|website=publicdomainreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folio 45v of the Codex Borgia depicts a platform adorned with skulls. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.famsi.org/research/loubat/Borgia/thumbs0.html|title=FAMSI - Universitätsbibliothek Rostock - Codex Borgia (Loubat 1898)|website=www.famsi.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Recent excavations ====
Archaeologists affilitated with the National Institute of Anthropology and History have partaken in a series of excavations since 2015 that have resulted in the finding of ''tzompantli.'' These excavations took place near the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and resulted in the finding of one ''tzompantli'' tower. These excavations have revealed that women and children were sacrificed, despite men making up 75% of sacrificial victims. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Association and meaning==
Apart from their use to display the skulls of ritualistically-executed war captives, ''tzompantli'' often occur in the contexts of [[Mesoamerican ballgame|Mesoamerican ball courts]], which were widespread throughout the region's civilizations and sites. The game was 'played for keeps' ending with the losing team being sacrificed. The captain of the winning team was tasked with taking the head of the losing team's captain to be displayed on a tzompantli.&lt;ref name=Coe1956 /&gt; In these contexts it appears that the tzompantli was used to display the losers' heads of this often highly ritualised game. Not all games resulted in this outcome, however, and for those that did it is surmised that these participants were often notable captives. An alternative theory is that it was the captain of the winning team who lost his head, but there is little evidence that this was the case.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell (1988) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Still, it is acknowledged that in Mesoamerican culture to be sacrificed was to be honored with feeding the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Koontz (2008) 204-205&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], the former [[Toltec]] capital, has a well-preserved ''tzompantli'' inscription on its ball court.

The association with ball courts is also reflected in the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the famous religious, mythological and cultural account of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]]. When [[Hun Hunahpu]], father of the [[Maya Hero Twins]], was killed by the lords of the Underworld ([[Xibalba]]), his head was hung in a [[gourd]] tree next to a ball court.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (2011) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The gourd tree is a clear representation of a "tzompantli", and the image of skulls in trees as if they were fruits is also a common indicator of a tzompantli and the associations with some of the game's metaphorical interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza (2007)pg 418&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary uses ==
''Tzompantli'' have been the subject of multiple artworks made by during the twentieth century. [[José Chávez Morado|Jose Chavez Morado]] depicted ''tzompantli'' in a 1961 painting. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marco.org.mx/programas/HojaSala_UnSiglo.pdf|title=La Colección de Arte Moderno|last=|first=|date=|work=Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; George O. Jackson, as part of his Essence of Mexico project, photographed various representations of skulls, which he refers to as ''calaveras.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3032">In [[logic]] and [[model theory]], a '''valuation''' can be:
*In [[propositional logic]], an assignment of [[truth value]]s to [[propositional variable]]s, with a corresponding assignment of truth values to all [[propositional formula]]s with those variables.
*In [[first-order logic]] and higher-order logics, a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]], (the [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]) and the corresponding assignment of a truth value to each sentence in the language for that structure (the valuation proper). The interpretation must be a [[homomorphism]], while valuation is simply a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

==Mathematical logic==

In mathematical logic (especially model theory), a valuation is an assignment of truth values to formal sentences that follows a [[T-schema|truth schema]]. Valuations are also called truth assignments.

In propositional logic, there are no quantifiers, and formulas are built from propositional variables using logical connectives. In this context, a valuation begins with an assignment of a truth value to each propositional variable. This assignment can be uniquely extended to an assignment of truth values to all propositional formulas.

In first-order logic, a language consists of a collection of constant symbols, a collection of function symbols, and a collection of relation symbols. Formulas are built out of [[atomic formula]]s using logical connectives and quantifiers.  A [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] consists of a set ([[domain of discourse]]) that determines the range of the quantifiers, along with interpretations of the constant, function, and relation symbols in the language. Corresponding to each structure is a unique truth assignment for all [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] (formulas with no [[free variables]]) in the language.

== Notation ==
If &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a valuation, that is, a mapping from the atoms to the set &lt;math&gt;\{ t, f \}&lt;/math&gt;, then the double-bracket notation is commonly used to denote a valuation; that is, &lt;math&gt;v(\phi)=[[\phi]]_v&lt;/math&gt; for a proposition &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk van Dalen, (2004) ''Logic and Structure'', Springer Universitext, (''see section 1.2'') {{isbn|978-3-540-20879-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of law]], '''virtue jurisprudence''' is the set of theories of law related to [[virtue ethics]]. By making the [[aretaic turn]] in legal theory, virtue jurisprudence focuses on the importance of character and human excellence or virtue to questions about the nature of law, the content of the law, and judging.

==The topics encompassed by virtue jurisprudence==

Among the topics encompassed by virtue jurisprudence are:
# Virtue ethics has implications for an account of the proper ends of legislation. If the aim of law is to make citizens virtuous (as opposed to maximizing utility or realizing a set of moral rights), what are the implications for the content of the laws? 
# Virtue ethics has implications for legal ethics. Current approaches to legal ethics emphasize deontological moral theory, i.e. duties to clients and respect for client autonomy, and these deontological approaches are reflected in the various codes of professional conduct that have been devised for lawyers, judges, and legislators. 
# Accounts of the virtue of justice (in particular, Aristotle and Aquinas's theories of natural justice) have implications for debates between natural lawyers and legal positivists over the nature of law. 
# A virtue-centered theory of judging, which describes the particular excellences required by judges.

==Aretaic theories of judging==
===The judicial virtues===

The most developed aspect of virtue jurisprudence is its distinctive theory of judging. A virtue-centered theory of judging offers an account of the characteristics or excellences that make for a good judge. These include: judicial temperance, judicial courage, judicial temperament, judicial intelligence, judicial wisdom, and justice. Although every theory of judging can incorporate some account of judicial virtue, a virtue-centered theory of judging makes the distinctive claim that the judicial virtues are central, ''i.e.'' that they have basic explanatory and normative significance.

===Criticism of a virtue-centered theory of judging===

Many of the criticisms of virtue jurisprudence are parallel to those offered in the context of debates over virtue ethics. Some of these include:
* The charge that virtue jurisprudence does not provide sufficient guidance for the making of legal decisions. "Do as a virtuous judge would do!" This formula provides little instruction to an ordinary decision maker.
* The argument that virtue jurisprudence requires inordinate trust in the capacities of judges. In a democratic society, the rightness or wrongness of legal decisions should be decided by criteria that are public and accessible to all citizens.

==Virtue as the proper end of law==

Aristotle argued that the inculcation of promotion of virtue was the proper end of law. Aquinas argued that true laws (which are rational) can teach virtue by being internalized by those who already possess sufficient virtue to grasp the purpose of the law. Even those who have not yet achieved this level of virtue can be coerced into obedience to the law, and this may enable them to become more virtuous.

A contemporary restatement of this view is found in the writings of Robert George. In his book, ''Making Men Moral'', George argues for the promotion of virtue as the end of law and against the contrary view that the purpose of law is the protection of rights.

==Law and virtue outside the Western tradition==

The phrase "virtue jurisprudence" is usually applied in the context of contemporary Western philosophical thinking about law. There are, however, important ideas about the relationship between law and virtue in other intellectual traditions. One example is provided by [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideas about virtue. In the [[Analects]], [[Confucius]] argues that a society in which people are virtuous would have no need of judges, rules, or jurisprudence because people would be able to resolve social conflicts by themselves. Thus, it is argued that the idea of virtue is opposed to the idea of law.

It can be argued that even virtuous citizens might disagree about the application of the law, especially where their own interests or ideological commitments are at stake. However, this argument is rather foreign to both traditional and modern Chinese political thought. Chinese political theory tends to assume that the truly virtuous are selfless to the point of martyrdom and would not consider their own personal interests and that the virtuous are able to transcend ideology. At the same time, traditional Chinese political thought regards those with absolute virtue to be historically extremely rare, and that most people, including the Emperor and his officials, are prone to both corruption and error. Consequently, there is a belief that law and indeed government is an unfortunate necessity in dealing with an imperfect world and with imperfect people.

The view that the inculcation of virtue is the proper end of legislation contrasts markedly with traditional Chinese thinking on the subject, which argues that laws exist because men are lacking in virtue. Confucianism places very little faith on the ability of law or external pressure to make men moral but rather believes that virtue must come from introspection and education. Throughout Chinese political and intellectual history, the Confucian view on law was frequently contrasted in discourse and practice with Chinese [[Han Feizi|Legalist]] philosophy.

The '''water–cement ratio''' is the ratio of the weight of water to the weight of [[cement]] used in a [[concrete]] mix. A lower ratio leads to higher strength and durability, but may make the mix difficult to work with and form. Workability can be resolved with the use of [[plasticizer]]s or [[superplasticizer|super-plasticizers]].

Often, the ratio refers to the ratio of water to cement plus [[pozzolan]] ratio, w/(c+p). The pozzolan is typically a [[fly ash]], or [[blast furnace]] [[slag]]. It can include a number of other materials, such as silica fume, rice husk ash or natural pozzolans. Pozzolans can be added to strengthen concrete.

The notion of water–cement ratio was first developed by [[Duff Abrams|Duff A. Abrams]] and published in 1918. Refer to [[concrete slump test]].
The 1997 [[Uniform Building Code]] specifies a maximum of 0.5 ratio when concrete is exposed to freezing and thawing in a moist condition or to de-icing chemicals, and a maximum of 0.45 ratio for concrete in a severe or very severe sulfate condition.

Concrete hardens as a result of the chemical reaction between cement and water (known as [[hydration reaction|hydration]], this produces heat and is called the heat of hydration). For every pound (or kilogram or any unit of weight) of cement, about 0.35 pounds (or 0.35&amp;nbsp;kg or corresponding unit) of water is needed to fully complete hydration reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civil Engineering Materials|last=Somayaji|first=Shan|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2001|isbn=0-13-083906-X|location=Upper Saddle River|pages=129|quote=The water-to-cement ratio is the ratio between the weights of water and cement in a concrete mix. For proper hydration, this ratio (commonly called the w/c ratio) should be about 0.30, assuming no contribution to hydration from external water sources.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a mix with a ratio of 0.35 may not mix thoroughly, and may not flow well enough to be placed. More water is therefore used than is technically necessary to react with cement. Water–cement ratios of 0.45 to 0.60 are more typically used. For higher-strength concrete, lower ratios are used, along with a plasticizer to increase flowability.

Too much water will result in [[Segregation in concrete|segregation of the sand and aggregate components from the cement paste]]. Also, water that is not consumed by the hydration reaction may leave concrete as it hardens, resulting in microscopic pores (bleeding) that will reduce final strength of concrete. A mix with too much water will experience more shrinkage as excess water leaves, resulting in internal cracks and visible fractures (particularly around inside corners), which again will reduce the final strength.
