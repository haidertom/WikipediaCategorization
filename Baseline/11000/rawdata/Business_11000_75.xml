Count '''Alfred Wojciech Potocki''' hr. [[Pilawa coat of arms|Pilawa]] (1785–1862) was a [[Poland|Polish]] nobleman ([[szlachcic]]), landowner, political and economic activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://genealogia.grocholski.pl/gd/osoba.php?id=003246 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421012542/http://genealogia.grocholski.pl/gd/osoba.php?id=003246 |archive-date=2016-04-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sejm-wielki.pl/b/3.662.587&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred was the 1st [[Ordynat]] of [[Łańcut]] estates. From 1809 until 1815 he served in the [[Polish Army]]. In 1812 he became [[aide-de-camp]] of Prince [[Józef Antoni Poniatowski]] and participated in [[Napoleon]]'s campaign against Russia.

In 1838 he created the Łańcut [[Ordynacja]]. Since 1861 Alfred was member of the National [[Sejm]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], and member of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)#House of Lords|Herrenhaus]]. He served as Austrian councillor and was Great Galician [[Ochmistrz]].

Alfred helped to modernize the agriculture in Galicia. He founded textile (1839–1844) and sugar (1836 industries and 1841) factories. He was co-founder of the "Estate Credit Society" in [[Lwów]]. Since 1823 he ran the [[Lubomirski]] family distillery in [[Łańcut]], which exists today under the name [[Polmos Łańcut]].

His father was the writer [[Jan Potocki]], best known for his famous novel ''"[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]"''. His brother was Count [[Artur Potocki]] (1787–1832), who married Countess [[Zofia Branicka]].

==Marriage and issue==
Alfred Wojciech married Princess [[Józefina Maria Czartoryska]] on 21 June 1814 and had four children:

* Count [[Alfred Józef Potocki]] (1817 or 1822–1889), married Princess [[Maria Klementyna Sanguszko]]
* Countess [[Ewa Józefina Julia Potocka]] (1818–1895), married [[Prince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein]] 
* Countess Zofia Ewa Potocka (1820–1882), married Count [[Dietrichstein|Moritz von Dietrichstein]] (1801–1852)

An '''assignment'''&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''cessio''&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal term used in the context of the law of [[contract]] and of [[property (law)|property]]. In both instances, assignment is the process whereby a person, the ''assignor'', transfers rights or benefits to another, the ''assignee''.&lt;ref&gt;For the assignment of claim see [http://www.trans-lex.org/917000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; An assignment may not transfer a duty, burden or detriment without the express agreement of the assignee. The right or benefit being assigned may be a gift (such as a [[waiver]]) or it may be paid for with a contractual [[consideration]] such as money. 

The rights may be vested or contingent,&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation|HCA|21|1963|parallelcite=(1963) 109 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 9 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and may include an [[equitable interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Law Dictionary|publisher=oxford university press|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mortgages and loans are relatively straightforward and amenable to assignment. An assignor may assign rights, such as a [[mortgage note]] issued by a third party borrower, and this would require the latter to make repayments to the assignee.

A related concept of assignment is [[novation]] wherein, by agreement with all parties, one contracting party is replaced by a new party. While novation requires the consent of all parties, assignment needs no consent from other non-assigning parties. However, in the case of assignment, the consent of the non-assigning party may be required by a contractual provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdnf.tlcollect.com/f1/cl/610/8172/TMT%20Newsletter%20August%202010%20v1d.pdf#page=3 |title=Tips and traps in contracting: novation versus assignment |last1=Kallenbach |first1=Paul |last2=Reid |first2=Nicole |publisher=[[MinterEllison]] |date=August 2010 |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The assignment does not necessarily have to be in writing; however, the assignment agreement must show an intent to transfer rights. The effect of a valid assignment is to extinguish [[privity]] (in other words, contractual relationship, including right to sue) between the assignor and the third-party [[obligor]] and create privity between the obligor and the assignee.

==Liabilities and duties==
Unless the contractual agreement states otherwise, the assignee typically does not receive more rights than the assignor, and the assignor may remain liable to the original counterparty for the performance of the contract. The assignor often delegates duties in addition to rights to the assignee, but the assignor may remain ultimately responsible.

However, in the United States, there are various laws that limit the liability of the assignee, often to facilitate credit, as assignees are typically lenders.&lt;ref name=AssigneeLiability&gt;[http://arnstein.com/attorneypublications/Ropiquet/Assignee.Liability.-.Through.the.Minefield.pdf Assignee Liability: Through the Minefield]. Arnstein &amp; Lehr LLP.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples include a provision in the [[Truth in Lending Act]]&lt;ref&gt;See 15 U.S.C. 1641(a).&lt;/ref&gt; and provisions in the [[Consumer Leasing Act]] and the [[Home Ownership Equity Protection Act]].&lt;ref name=AssigneeLiability/&gt;

In other cases, the contract may be a [[negotiable instrument]] in which the person receiving the instrument may become a [[holder in due course]], which is similar to an assignee except that issues, such as lack of performance, by the assignor may not be a valid defense for the obligor.&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC&gt;[http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm Commercial Paper: Holder in Due Course &amp; Defenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128024402/http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm |date=2012-11-28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] promulgated Rule 433, formally known as the "Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses", which "effectively abolished the [holder in due course] doctrine in consumer credit transactions".&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC/&gt; In 2012, the commission reaffirmed the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftc.gov/opa/2012/05/holderrule.shtm FTC Opinion Letter Affirms Consumers' Rights under the Holder Rule]. FTC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assignment of contract rights==
{{Contract law}}

After the assignment of contractual rights, the assignee will receive all benefits that had accrued to the assignor. For example, if A contracts to sell his car for $100 to B, A may assign the benefits (the right to be paid $100) to C.&lt;ref&gt;In this scenario, Party A is the '''obligee/assignor''', Party B is an '''obligor''', and Party C is the '''assignee'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Party C is ''not'' a ''[[third party beneficiary]]'', because the contract was not made for C's benefit. Assignment takes place after the contract was formed; they may not precede them.{{cn|date=April 2018}}
===When assignment will be permitted===
The [[common law]] favors the freedom of assignment, so an assignment will generally be permitted unless there is an express prohibition against assignment in the contract. Where assignment is thus permitted, the assignor need not consult the other party to the contract. An assignment cannot have any effect on the duties of the other party to the contract, nor can it reduce the possibility of the other party receiving full performance of the same quality. Certain kinds of performance, therefore, ''cannot'' be assigned, because they create a unique relationship between the parties to the contract. For example, the assignment of a legal malpractice claim is void since an assignee would be a stranger to the attorney-client relationship, who was owed no duty by the attorney and would imperil the sanctity of the highly confidential and fiduciary relationship existing between attorney and client.

Torts are not assignable as [[public policy]], and various statutes may prohibit assignment in certain instances.&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt; In addition, the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] lists prohibitions in §317(2)(a) based upon the effect to the nonassigning party (obligor),&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt; with similar prohibitions in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] §2-210.&lt;ref name=LexisNexisStudy&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/contracts/contracts18.htm Chapter 18: Assignment and Delegation]. LexisNexis study outline.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, UCC §2-210 states the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-210 Uniform Commercial Code § 2-210. Delegation of Performance; Assignment of Rights].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreementotherwise [sic].}}

===Requirements for an effective assignment===
For assignment to be effective, it must occur in the present. No specific language is required to make such an assignment, but the assignor must make some clear statement of intent to assign clearly identified contractual rights to the assignee. A promise to assign in the future has no legal effect. Although this prevents a party from assigning the benefits of a contract that has not yet been made, a [[court of equity]] may enforce such an assignment where an established economic relationship between the assignor and the assignee raised an expectation that the assignee would indeed form the appropriate contract in the future.

A contract may contain a [[non-assignment clause]], which prohibits the assignment of specific rights and some various rights, or of the entire contract, to another. However, such a clause does not necessarily destroy the power of either party to make an assignment. Instead, it merely gives the other party the ability to sue for breach of contract if such an assignment is made. However, an assignment of a contract containing such a clause will be ineffective if the assignee ''knows'' of the non-assignment clause, or if the non-assignment clause specifies that "all assignments are void".

Two other techniques to prevent the assignment of contracts are ''[[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] clauses'' or clauses creating a ''[[condition subsequent]]''. The former would give the other party to the contract the power to rescind the contract if an assignment is made; the latter would rescind the contract automatically in such circumstances.

====Requirement of a writing====
There are certain situations in which the assignment must be in writing.
#Assignment of [[wages]]; additionally, statutes may prohibit this assignment&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt;
#Assignment of any interest in [[real property]]
#Assignment of [[Chose (English law)|choses in action]] worth over $5,000

===Delegation===
A parallel concept to assignment is ''[[delegation (law)|delegation]]'', which occurs when one party transfers his ''duties or liabilities'' under a contract to another. A delegation and an assignment can be accomplished at the same time, although a non-assignment clause may also bar delegation.

== Remedies ==
[[Legal remedy|Legal remedies]] may be available if the nonassigning party's rights are affected by the assignment.

===Revocability===
Assignments made for consideration are irrevocable, meaning that the assignor permanently gives up the legal right to take back the assignment once it has been made. Donative assignments, on the other hand, are generally revocable, either by the assignor giving notice to the assignee, taking performance directly from the obligor, or making a subsequent assignment of the same right to another. There are some exceptions to the revocability of a donative assignment:
#The assignment can not be revoked if the obligor has already performed
#The assignment can not be revoked if the assignee has received a ''token chose'' (''chose'' being derived from the [[French language|French]] word for "thing", as in a chose of action) - a physical object that signifies a right to collect, such as a stock certificate or the passbook to a savings account.
#The assignment can not be revoked if the assignor has set forth in writing the assignment of a ''simple chose'' - a contract right embodied in any form of token.
#[[Estoppel]] can prevent the revocation of a donative assignment if the assignee changed their position in reliance on the assignment.

===Breach and defenses===
A cause of action for [[breach of contract|breach]] on the part of the obligor lies with the assignee, who will hold the exclusive right to commence a cause of action for any failure to perform or defective performance. At this stage, because the assignee "stands in the shoes" of the assignor, the obligor can raise any defense to the contract that the obligor could have raised against the assignor. Furthermore, the obligor can raise against the assignee counterclaims and setoffs that the obligor had against the assignor. For example, suppose that A makes a contract to paint B's house in exchange for $500. A then assigns the right to receive the $500 to C, to pay off a debt owed to C. However, A does such a careless job painting the house that B has to pay another painter $400 to correct A's work. If C sues B to collect the debt, B can raise his counterclaim for the expenses caused by the poor paint job, and can reduce the amount owed to C by that $400, leaving only $100 to be collected.

When the assignor makes the assignment, he makes with it an [[implied warranty]] that the right to assign was not subject to defenses. If the contract had a provision that made the assignment ineffective, the assignee could sue the assignor for breach of this implied warranty. Similarly, the assignee could also sue under this theory if the assignor wrongfully revoked the assignment.

===Successive assignments===
Occasionally, an unscrupulous assignor will asof the assignment, and on the timing of the assignments relative to certain other actions.

In a quirk left over from the common law, if the assignment was donative, the ''last assignee'' is the true owner of the rights. However, if the assignment was for consideration, the ''first assignee'' to actually ''collect against the assigned contract'' is the true owner of the rights. Under the modern ''American rule'', now followed in most U.S. jurisdictions, the first assignor with equity (i.e. the first to have paid for the assignment) will have the strongest claim, while remaining assignees may have other remedies.  In some countries, the rights of the respective assignees are determined by the old common law [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']].

# Earlier donative assignees for whom the assignment was revocable (because it had not been made irrevocable by any of the means listed above) have no cause of action whatsoever.
# Earlier donative assignees for whom the assignment was made irrevocable can bring an action for the [[tort]] of [[conversion (law)|conversion]], because the assignment was technically their property when it was given to a later assignee.
# Later assignees for consideration have a cause of action for breaches of the implied warranty discussed above.

See [[interpleader]].

==Special rules for assignment of certain rights==

===Property rights===
{{Property law}}
{{See also|Rule in Dumpor's Case|Privity of estate}}
[[Real property]] rights can be assigned just as any other contractual right. However, special duties and liabilities attach to transfers of the right to possess property. With an assignment, the assignor transfers the complete remainder of the interest to the assignee. The assignor must not retain any sort of reversionary interest in the right to possess. The assignee's interest must abut the interest of the next person to have the right to possession. If any time or interest is reserved by a tenant assignor then the act is not an assignment, but is instead a sublease.

The liability of the assignee depends upon the contract formed when the assignment takes place. However, in general, the assignee has privity of estate with a lessor. With privity of estate comes the duty on the part of the assignee to perform certain obligations under covenant, e.g. pay rent. Similarly, the lessor retains the obligations to perform on covenants to maintain or repair the land.

If the assignor agrees to continue paying rent to the lessor and subsequently defaults, the lessor can sue both the assignor under the original contract signed with the lessor as well as the assignee because by taking possession of the property interest, the assignee has obliged himself to perform duties under covenant such as the payment of rent.

Unlike a Novation where consent of both the lessor and lesse is required for the third party to assume all obligations and liabilities of the original lessee, an assignment does not always need the consent of all parties. If the contract terms state specifically that the lessor's consent is not needed to assign the contract, then the lesee can assign the contract to whomever the lesee wants to.

Absent language to the contrary, a tenant may assign their rights to an assignee without the landlord's consent. In the majority of jurisdictions, when there is a clause that the landlord may withhold consent to an assignment, the general rule is that the landlord may not withhold consent unreasonably unless there is a provision that states specifically that the Landlord may withhold consent at Landlord's sole discretion.

===Partnership rights===
A person can also assign their rights to receive the benefits owed to a partner in a [[partnership]]. However, the assignee can ''not'' thereby gain any of the assignor's rights with respect to the operation of the partnership. The assignee may not vote on partnership matters, inspect the partnership books, or take possession of partnership property; rather, the assignee can only be given the right is to collect distributions of income, unless the remaining partners consent to the assignment of a new general partner with operational, management, and financial interests. If the partnership is dissolved, the assignee can also claim the assignor's share of any distribution accompanying the dissolution.

===Intellectual property rights===
{{See also|transfer (patent)}}

Ownership of intellectual property, including [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, and [[trademark]]s, may be assigned, but special conditions attach to the assignment of patents and trademarks. In the [[United States]], assignment of a patent is governed by [[statute]], {{USCode|35|261}}.  Patent rights are assignable by an "instrument in writing."  Title in a patent can also be transferred as a result of other financial transactions, such as a [[merger]] or a [[takeover]], or as a result of operation of law, such as in an [[inheritance]] process, or in a [[bankruptcy]].  An assignment of a patent can be recorded with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].  Although such recording is not required, if an assignment is not recorded at the USPTO within three (3) months or prior to a subsequent assignment, the assignment will be void against a subsequent assignee without notice of the earlier, unrecorded assignment.

With respect to a trademark, the owner of the mark may not transfer ownership of the mark without transferring the [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] associated with the mark.

Companies sometimes request from employees that they assign all intellectual property they create while under the employment of the company.  This is typically done within an Employment Agreement, but is sometimes done through a specific agreement called Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement (PIIA).

===Personal injury torts===

The standard rule is that [[personal injury]] [[tort]] causes of action are nonassignable as a matter of [[Public policy (law)|public policy]].&lt;ref name=Stark2003&gt;Stark T. (2003). ''Negotiating and Drafting Contract Boilerplate'', [http://www.starklegaled.com/downloads/sample-nadcp-3.2.pdf Ch. 3: Assignment and Delegation]. ALM Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pony v. County of Los Angeles'', 433 F.3d 1138 (9th Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  These should be distinguished from final settlements or judgments resulting from lawsuits brought on such causes of action, which may be assignable.

===Legal malpractice===

In the majority of jurisdictions, assignments involving fraud or [[legal malpractice]] causes of action are void as against public policy.&lt;ref&gt;''Cowan Liebowitz &amp; Latman, PC v. Kaplan'', 902 So. 2d 755, 759-760 (Fla. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equitable assignment==
An '''equitable assignment''' is an assignment, or transfer of rights, in [[Equity (law)|equity]].

===General principles===

There are numerous requirements that exist for an equitable assignment of property, outside the 'standard' ''clear and unconditional intention to assign''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|39|2007|litigants=Westbourne Grammar School v Sanget Pty |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements are fundamental characteristics of a statutory assignment: Absolute assignment (an unconditional transfer: conditions precedent or part of a debt are not absolute) and the assignment must be made in writing and signed by the assignor, and in particular, this applies to real property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca1919141|Conveyancing Act 1919|23C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assigning future property in equity cannot be gratuitous. The assignor must receive consideration for the agreement, otherwise the assignment will be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"/&gt; However, an absolute assignment does not require consideration to be given. Secondly, between the period of agreement between assignor and assignee and acquisition by the assignor, the assignees rights are not [[contractual]], but rather a [[property|proprietary right]] to the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|39|1978|litigants=Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Everett |parallelcite=(1978) 21 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 625 at p. 643 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] (Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the assignee has an interest in this future property, in the same manner any owner has over property.

In equity, these principles operate to protect both the assignor and the assignee. In ''Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation'',&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"/&gt;  a taxpayer attempted to assign by [[deed]], to his wife certain moneys which he was eventually going to receive. This included dividends and [[interest]] due on [[loan]]s. The court held the interest and the [[dividend]]s were expectancies or possibilities which could not be assigned without consideration. The court's worry was that assignments without consideration might be used as instruments of fraud, to avoid creditors and tax collection.

===Mere expectancies===

Courts will not enforce a contract to assign an expectancy unless there is a valuable consideration. For example, under a settlement of property the respondent "the son" would have been entitled to an equal portion of properties along with his other siblings which was gained in a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] by his mother. This portion was only his when allocated to him at his mothers discretion. Prior to this allocation being made, the respondent allotted his benefit to [[trustee]]s for a voluntary settlement. He was assigning or purporting to assign something which he might become entitled to in the future, not a [[contingent interest]]. The judgment held it ineffective and elaborated on previous points to state the respondent cannot be compelled to allow the trustees to retain the appointed sum.&lt;ref&gt;Northumberland (Duke) v Inland Revenue Comrs&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2019">'''Atomic layer etching''' is an emerging technique in [[Semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductor manufacture]], in which a sequence alternating between self-limiting chemical modification steps which affect only the top atomic layers of the wafer, and etching steps which remove only the chemically-modified areas, allows the removal of individual atomic layers.  The standard example is etching of silicon by alternating reaction with [[chlorine]] and etching with [[argon]] ions.

This is a better-controlled process than [[reactive ion etching]], though the issue with commercial use of it has been throughput; sophisticated gas handling is required, and removal rates of one atomic layer per second are around the state of the art.&lt;ref name=lam-ale&gt;{{cite web | url=http://semimd.com/blog/2014/08/04/atomic-layer-etch-now-in-fab-evaluations/ | title=Atomic Layer Etch now in Fab Evaluations |date=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent process for depositing material is [[atomic layer deposition]] (ALD). ALD is substantially more mature, having been used by [[Intel]] for [[high-κ dielectric]] layers since 2007 and in Finland in the fabrication of thin film electroluminescent devices since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puurunen|first=Riikka L.|date=2014-12-01|title=A Short History of Atomic Layer Deposition: Tuomo Suntola's Atomic Layer Epitaxy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cvde.201402012/abstract|journal=Chemical Vapor Deposition|language=en|volume=20|issue=10-11-12|pages=332–344|doi=10.1002/cvde.201402012|issn=1521-3862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Broadband Lifecycle''' is a [[Economic model|model]] for looking at the planning, implementation, and adoption of [[broadband networks]], providing a framework for understanding the natural progression and sound business planning to drive local economic development through broadband (high-speed Internet networks). It has been utilized by multiple North-American States since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sngroup.com/broadband-lifecycle-in-action-virginia-2 Broadband Lifecycle in Action: Virginia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sngroup.com/illinois-and-sng-announce-partnership Illinois announces to take up the Broadband Lifecycle]&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed by Strategic Networks Group &lt;ref name=SNG&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadband Lifecycle|url=http://www.sngroup.com/broadband-lifecycle/|publisher=Strategic Networks Group|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 2000s as an alternative means to view broadband deployments, the Broadband Lifecycle is a departure from the dominant economic model of broadband network operators’ that relies on the “supply side” assumption that if a network is built adoption will follow.

Thus, the Broadband Lifecycle considers broadband from a “[[Demand (economics)|demand side]],” recognizing that adoption and utilization only comes through understanding benefits, supporting the [[Demand (economics)|Demand side]] and the benefits for communities, demonstrating to individual businesses, organizations and households the value of broadband and its transformative effects through Internet enabled applications, which include global market reach, ability to [[Telecommuting|telework]], use of [[telemedicine]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Strategic_Networks_Group%27s_Broadband_Lifecycle.jpg Broadband Lifecycle Approach]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Business Development Bank of Canada''' ('''BDC'''; {{lang-fr|Banque de Développement du Canada}}) is a federal [[Crown corporation]] wholly owned by the [[Government of Canada]]. Its mandate is to help create and develop Canadian businesses through financing, growth and transition capital, [[venture capital]] and advisory services, with a focus on [[small and medium-sized enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;Canada's Department Of Justice. http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-9.9/FullText.html. Retrieved 2012-05-04&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank was founded in 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/who-we-are/pages/history.aspx|title=History of the Business Development Bank of Canada|website=BDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its corporate headquarters is located in [[Montreal]]. BDC has more than 118 business centres across [[Canada]] and more than 49,000 clients.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bdc.ca/EN/Documents/annualreport/bdc-annual-report-2017.pdf. Retrieved 2018-01-23&lt;/ref&gt;

BDC's [[debt]] obligations, secured by the Government of Canada, are issued to [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector]] institutions.

==History==

The bank was established by an [[Act of Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pas-srp/remarks-observations_e.asp?id=34355. Retrieved 2012-05-04&lt;/ref&gt; as the '''Industrial Development Bank (IDB)''' in September 1944. IDB was initially an arm of the [[Bank of Canada]], and the Governor of the Bank was also Chief Executive Officer of the IDB. During its first years, the bank's main role was to help small "industrial enterprises" convert from military production to peace-time operations after the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Official website. http://www.bdc.ca/EN/about/overview/history/Pages/pioneer_years.aspx. Retrieved 2012-05-04&lt;/ref&gt;

IDB was one of the first and largest development banks in the world.&lt;ref name="pioneer"&gt;Official website. http://www.bdc.ca/EN/about/overview/history/Pages/pioneer_years.aspx Retrieved 2012-05-04&lt;/ref&gt;

The Industrial Development Bank Act was first amended in 1952 to allow the bank to offer financing to companies in the commercial airlines industry. By the mid-1950s, one out of every 10 planes in Canada was financed by IDB.&lt;ref name="pioneer"/&gt; Later, IDB's Act was amended two more times to allow the bank to lend to companies in almost all industries.

By 1964, twenty years after its foundation, IDB had 22 branches across Canada, covering main cities such as [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]],  [[Calgary]] and [[Vancouver]] and also had operations in relatively rural areas.  In the mid-1970s, the bank added consulting and training to its financial offerings to help entrepreneurs better manage their businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Official website. http://www.bdc.ca/EN/about/overview/history/Pages/diversification_years.aspx. Retrieved 2012-05-04&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the name of the bank changed to '''Federal Business Development Bank (FBDB)''' and its [[venture capital]] operations were started. At the time, the bank was known as "a [[lender of last resort]]"—supporting businesses in difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bdc.ca/en/documents/about/history/LF_ENG_BD1604_eBook_histoireBDC_INTERACTIF.PDF.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4965">[[File:Saint-Pierre and Miquelon EEZ map-en.svg|thumb|The boundaries of the 1992 [[Exclusive Economic Zone|EEZ]] resolution between Canada and France]]
The '''''Canada–France Maritime Boundary Case''''' was a 1992 dispute between [[Canada]] and [[France]] that was decided by an [[Arbitration#Arbitration with sovereign governments|arbitral tribunal]] created by the parties to resolve the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;The case decision and the two dissents were printed in 31 ''International Legal Materials'' (ILM) 1149 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The case established the extent of the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of the French territory of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). ''International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas,'' p. 288; Charney, Jonathan I. ''et al.'' (2005). ''International Maritime Boundaries,''  pp. 2141–2158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1972, Canada and France signed a [[treaty]] that [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] the territorial [[maritime boundary]] between Canada and the French territory of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]. However, the maritime boundaries beyond the territorial sea (including extent of the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]s (EEZ) of both countries) continued to be disputed. The extent of each country's EEZ was significant because it would determine where the countries had an exclusive right to fish. Years of failed negotiations led Canada and France to agree in March 1989 to establish an ad hoc arbitral tribunal that would resolve the dispute.

==Arbitral tribunal==
The [[arbitral tribunal]] was composed of five arbitrators—three neutral parties and one representative from each country. The neutral arbitrators were [[Eduardo Jiménez de Aréchaga]] of [[Uruguay]] (president), Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz of [[Italy]], and [[Oscar Schachter]] of the [[United States]]. Canada's representative was [[Allan Gotlieb]] and France's was [[Prosper Weil]].

==Decision==
The arbitral tribunal issued its decision and award on 10 June 1992. It was a 3–2 decision, with the representatives of both Canada and France dissenting from the decision. The zone that was awarded to France was unusual and in two parts: first, the boundary was set at an equidistant line between the French islands and the Canadian island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Added to this was a 24 nautical mile bulge on the west of the islands. Lastly, a long north–south {{convert|188|nmi|km|adj=on}} corridor south of the islands was awarded to France, presumably to allow France access to its EEZ from international waters without having to pass through the Canadian EEZ. The corridor is narrow, being approximately 10½ nautical miles wide. The shape of the award has been likened to a keyhole, a mushroom, and a baguette.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=Oh, (No) Canada! |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/oh-no-canada/ |work=Opinionator: Borderlines|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=July 15, 2012|author=Frank Jacobs|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was approximately 18% of the territory that France had initially been claiming.

==Criticism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Since the 1992 award, the decision has been criticised by both Canadian and French commentators as well as neutral observers. Some have noted that a straightforward application of the [[Convention on the Law of the Sea]] would extend Canada's EEZ beyond the limits of the French corridor, meaning that the French EEZ may be entirely enveloped within Canada's EEZ, a circumstance that was not intended by the arbitral tribunal.

Baker has two brothers and three sisters.

After completing his elementary education in Haiti, he traveled to the United States. In 1972 he graduated from [[Redondo Union High School]] in [[Redondo Beach, California]]. He later attended [[Saint Leo University]] in Florida, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration in 1976. In 1975, he married Marie Florence Apaid, sister of [[André Apaid]]. He has four children and seven grandchildren.&lt;ref name="charleshenribaker.com"&gt;http://charleshenribaker.com/about/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

Baker began his business career as a manager at the age 21 in his family-owned and operated supermarket chain. When his father became ill, he took over the family-owned 90-acre farm Habitation Dujour, which grew sugarcane, banana, and tobacco. Eventually, the land expanded another 120 acres which made it the largest flue-cured tobacco farm in Haiti, with more than 200 acres. Simultaneously, from 1982 to 1985 he worked with the tobacco growers of Haiti through the [[Comme il faut]] Company, where he held the position of Assistant to the Leaf Growing Manager.&lt;ref name="charleshenribaker.com"/&gt;

Beginning in the late 1980s, Baker purchased a garment factory, Pantalon Boucanier S.A.. This factory, which is monitored by Betterworks an affiliate of OIT, adheres to strict international standards. It employs hundreds of Haitians who are paid the minimum salary required by Haitian law. It has set up an incentive program which permits workers to make 50% more than the minimum salary while getting the 25% benefits required by Haitian law. Baker sells the garments produced in these factories to major corporations such as [[Walmart]] and [[K-Mart]].

In 2000, he joined the Association des Industries d’Haïti as a member and a year later became its vice president.&lt;ref name="charleshenribaker.com"/&gt;

Baker was a prominent member of the [[Group of 184]] (G 184), a coalition of Haitian organizations opposing Haitian President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. The group's actions contributed to the [[US]] orchestrated coup d'état against Aristide in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/03/01/haitian-election-aftermath/ The Puzzling Alliance of Chavannes Jean-Baptiste and Charles Henri Baker, CounterPunch, March 1, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church and Wellesley''' is an [[gay village|LGBT-oriented enclave]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.  It is roughly bounded by [[Gerrard Street (Toronto)|Gerrard Street]] to the south, [[Yonge Street]] to the west, Charles Street to the north, and [[Jarvis Street]] to the east, with the core commercial strip located along Church Street from Wellesley south to Alexander.  Though some gay and lesbian oriented establishments can be found outside this area, the general boundaries of this village have been defined by the Gay Toronto Tourism Guild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaytorontotourism.com/mapofvill.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118185403/http://www.gaytorontotourism.com/mapofvill.htm |archivedate=2016-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
While the neighbourhood is home to the community centre, parks, bars, restaurants, and stores catering to the LGBT community (particularly along Church Street), it is also a historic community with Victorian houses and apartments dating back to the late 19th and early 20th century. Many LGBT people also live in the nearby residential neighbourhoods of [[The Annex]], [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]], [[St. James Town]], [[St. Lawrence, Toronto|St. Lawrence]], [[Riverdale, Toronto|Riverdale]] and the [[Garden District, Toronto|Garden District]], and in smaller numbers throughout the city and its suburbs.
[[File:Pride Toronto 2012 (7).jpg|thumb|left|Church and Wellesley is home to the annual [[Gay Pride Week|Pride Week]] celebrations, as well as the [[Pride Toronto|Pride parade]].]]
Church and Wellesley is home to the annual [[Gay Pride Week|Pride Week]] celebrations, the largest event of its kind in Canada with over 90 floats and an enthusiastic crowd that numbers in the hundreds of thousands. [[Pride Toronto]] is always on the last weekend in June. It runs southward along [[Yonge Street]]. The [[Dyke March]] is a women-only parade that runs on that Saturday afternoon and has a smaller parade route. There is also a weekend-long community fair that closes off Wellesley between Yonge and Church and also goes into Church Street. The community fair includes tables from a wide variety of groups involved in or associated with [[queer]] culture.

The [[519 Church Street Community Centre]] is the meeting place for numerous social and political groups and became well known as a [[LGBT]]-friendly space. "The 519", as it is most often called, is a city-run recreation centre that has been adopted locally as the queer community centre, though its programming is not exclusive to LGBT groups and organizations. In 2007, a new wing was opened, and upgrades to the existing spaces were completed in 2009.

Church and Wellesley is also home to the AIDS Memorial, located in Barbara Hall Park, where the names of members of the community who have been lost to [[AIDS]] are etched into bronze plaques. A memorial candlelight vigil is held each year at the AIDS Memorial, during Pride Week.

===Alternate names===
[[File:Church Wellesley - street sign.jpg|thumb|The neighbourhood goes by a number of names, though most refer to it as Church Street or the Village.]]
A number of alternative names for Church and Wellesley exist in local vernacular, including the Gay Ghetto, the Village, the Gaybourhood&lt;ref&gt;[[Bert Archer]]. [http://www.yongestreetmedia.ca/features/churchstreet0623.aspx "The evolution of Toronto's Church Street Gaybourhood"]. ''Yonge Street'', June 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or the Gay Village — however, many of these "nicknames" are generic to [[gay villages]] across the English speaking world, and are therefore not descriptive of Church and Wellesley specifically, but of gay villages in general. Most people refer to it simply as Church Street or the Village, since most of the gay-related establishments in the area are located on that street.

===Bar scene===
Bars in the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood include [[Woody's (Toronto)|Woody's]], Pegasus On Church, Crews &amp; Tangos, the Churchmouse and Firkin, O'Grady's, Statler's, Black Eagle, Boutique, Flash, [[Glad Day Bookshop|Glad Day]] and Fly.

===Business association===
The Church Wellesley Village Business Improvement Area was established October 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchwellesleyvillage.ca|title=the-village|website=the-village}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2004, the business association launched a pilot project. Every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. throughout the summer, two blocks of Church Street, from Wellesley south to Alexander, were closed to traffic to encourage more pedestrian activity. However, this proved controversial when some business owners accused other businesses of "stealing" customers by providing street entertainment, and ended three weeks earlier than planned due to a lack of money.

The business association also sponsored the Church Street Fetish Fair in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727161944/http://www.churchstreetfetishfair.com/|title=Church Street Fetish Fair|date=27 July 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[San Francisco]]'s [[Folsom Street Fair]] had licensed a consortium of Toronto community groups to use the name ''Folsom Fair North'' for a similar fetish fair. That fair was held in a large parking lot near the corner of Wellesley and Yonge in 2003 and 2004, and in [[Allan Gardens]] in 2005, and the "Church Street Fetish Fair" was widely perceived as retaliation for the Folsom fair not being held on Church Street itself. Folsom Fair North, which changed its name to FFN in 2006, was last held in 2007.

==History==
The portion of the neighbourhood bounded by Yonge, Jarvis, Maitland and Carlton Streets was once the estate of [[Alexander Wood (merchant)|Alexander Wood]], a merchant and magistrate in [[Upper Canada]] who was at the centre of a strange, supposedly sexually related scandal in 1810. His lands were derisively known as "Molly Wood's Bush" in the early nineteenth century — "molly" being a contemporaneous slang term for "homosexual". In the spring of 2005, a statue of Wood was erected at the corner of Church and Alexander Streets (the latter named for Wood), honouring him as a forefather of Toronto's modern gay community.
[[File:Statue of Alexander Wood, Alexander Street, Toronto, Canada IMG 5696.jpg|thumb|upright|Statute of [[Alexander Wood (merchant)|Alexander Wood]] in the neighbourhood. A lieutenant in the [[Canadian militia]] that was later involved in a [[homophobic]] scandal, he is now lauded as a forefather of Toronto's gay community.]] 
Church Street and the area around it has been familiar to the Toronto gay community for many decades. Prior to the 1970s there had been an underground (mostly male) gay scene centred on various [[gay bathhouse|bathhouse]]s and [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s around the city that were not exclusively gay establishments but were known to be frequented by homosexuals. [[Allan Gardens]], just east of Church Street on Carlton, was a well-known [[cruising for sex|cruising]] area for gay men.

From the late 1960s through the early 1980s the focus of Toronto's gay subculture was the Yonge and Wellesley area. The most notable bars for the gay subculture were the Parkside Tavern and the St. Charles Tavern on Yonge Street (one block west of Church) just south of Wellesley.&lt;ref name=before&gt;{{cite news|title=Before Pride, there was a kiss: Toronto gay activists look back on 1976 protest|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/06/27/before-pride-there-was-a-kiss-toronto-gay-activists-look-back-on-1976-protest.html|accessdate=June 27, 2015|work=Toronto Star|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, the St. Charles in particular was the focus of many attacks by homophobes, especially on Halloween when the tavern held an annual drag contest that had been proceeded by an outdoor promenade until attacks by homophobes hurling eggs and rotten fruit made that impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St Charles Tavern remembered|url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/St_Charles_Tavern_remembered-6379.aspx|accessdate=January 4, 2012|newspaper=Xtra|date=March 2, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810132452/http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/St_Charles_Tavern_remembered-6379.aspx|archivedate=August 10, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=track&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN4_8eurids Track Two](1982) directed by Harry Sutherland&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Glad Day Bookshop]], for many years the city's only gay oriented bookstore, opened on Yonge Street near Wellesley in the mid-1970s. There were also a number of gay-oriented businesses and clubs on the side streets running west off of Yonge street around Wellesley, in particular St. Nicholas Street, a laneway running behind the west side of Yonge, and St. Joseph Street, one block north of Wellesley running west off Yonge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cockerline|first=Danny|title=Street life versus sterility: the battle for St Joseph St.|url=http://www.walnet.org/csis/news/toronto_84/tbp-8401-08.html|accessdate=January 4, 2012|newspaper=The Body Politic|date=January–February 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cbc.ca/society/celebrations/clips/17184/ Drag queens on Halloween], CBC Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Denise|title=Then &amp; Now: Voodoo|url=http://www.thegridto.com/culture/music/then-now-voodoo/|accessdate=January 4, 2012|newspaper=The Grid|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The streets and alleys between Yonge and Bay also became a cruising area frequented by male prostitutes and their clients referred to by the police as "Track two".&lt;ref name=track/&gt;

Church Street, one block east of Yonge, had been a depressed area with low rents and started to become a predominantly gay area as gay owned bars and other businesses started opening up as an alternative to the straight owned Parkside and St. Charles Taverns whose owners were accused of being hostile of their gay clientele.&lt;ref name=before/&gt;

The centre of the gay life in Toronto shifted to Church Street following the [[1981 Toronto bathhouse raids]], an event that galvanized the gay and lesbian community in the city. [[George Hislop]], a gay businessman and co-owner of one of the raided bathhouses, ran for [[Toronto City Council]] with his campaign headquarters located at Church and Wellesley.
[[File:519 Church Street Community Centre.jpg|thumb|left|[[519 Church Street Community Centre]] became a meeting place for numerous social and political groups in the area beginning in the 1980s.]]
In the 1980s, the [[519 Church Street Community Centre]] became the meeting place for numerous social and political groups and became well known as an LGBT friendly space. A strip of gay bars opened along the street and many LGBT people rented apartments, joined residential co-ops or bought condos close to Church. The area became known as a friendly environment where people could be open about their sexual orientation.

===Uncertain future===
As times have changed and Toronto public has become more open to homosexuality, the role of Church and Wellesley as a "sanctuary" for LGBT people has been debated in recent years.&lt;ref name=renaissance&gt;Paul Gallant, "Ready for a Renaissance". ''In Toronto'', June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Many bars and clubs throughout Toronto are now gay-friendly; establishments such as Wayla, the [[Drake Hotel (Toronto)|Drake Hotel]], the [[Gladstone Hotel (Toronto)|Gladstone Hotel]] and the Beaver, although outside Toronto's traditional gay village and not technically gay bars ''per se'', are popular destinations for young gay and lesbian club-goers.

Rental rates for both commercial and residential property have also risen significantly.&lt;ref name=changingtimes&gt;"Changing times on Church Street". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', May 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, many privately owned businesses, including [[This Ain't the Rosedale Library]], have been forced to close down or move to other areas due to these rent increases, and much larger corporations, such as [[Starbucks]],  [[The Body Shop]], [[David's Tea]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] and the [[Bank of Montreal]], have settled on the street in their place.&lt;ref name=renaissance /&gt; The [[Priape]] chain of gay porn and clothing stores closed its Church Street and other locations in October 2013 when it filed for bankruptcy;&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Houston and Brandon Matheson, [http://dailyxtra.com/world/news/priape-closes-four-canadian-stores?market=210 "Priape closes all four Canadian stores"]. ''[[Xtra!]]'', October 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; as of September 2017, its former location is still vacant. Many smaller gay-owned businesses have moved to cheaper areas such as [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]], located east of Church and Wellesley.&lt;ref name=changingtimes /&gt; 
[[File:Gay Toronto View Down Church Street.jpg|thumb|The first decade of the 21st century saw a number of privately-owned businesses close in Church and Wellesley, with larger corporations taking their place.]]
The residents of the area are now largely middle-aged men with established careers, as the high rents and increasing density of [[condominium]] development mean that the majority of gay youth cannot afford to live in the neighbourhood. Some choose to settle in nearby neighbourhoods such as [[St. James Town]] and [[Cabbagetown (Toronto)|Cabbagetown]], while others no longer feel it necessary to live near the village as they can be open about their sexuality without as much fear of backlash.&lt;ref name=changingtimes /&gt; Many in the gay community have expressed concern about the decline of the neighbourhood's appeal with youth and its loss of small businesses.&lt;ref name=exodus&gt;"Exodus sees Church St losing its gay village identity". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', October 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other downtown neighbourhoods much farther afield from Church and Wellesley, including [[Parkdale, Toronto|Parkdale]], [[Trinity-Bellwoods]], [[Riverdale, Toronto|Riverdale]] and [[Leslieville]], are also now popular areas for LGBT residents;&lt;ref name=changingtimes /&gt; Parkdale in particular has even earned the nickname of "Queer West Village" in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/CommunityGroups/Queer_West_Fest_Sunday_June_14_Pride_Ride_2009-14/news.aspx Community News for Queer West]. ''[[Xtra!]]'', April 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a partnership of community organizations, including [[The 519 Church Street Community Centre|The 519]] and the Church-Wellesley Business Improvement Association, launched a community survey to solicit ideas for community revitalization.&lt;ref name=renaissance /&gt; Questions posed by the study included "What is the role of a 'LGBTQ village' in a modern, progressive city?" and "What must be done to support the Church-Wellesley Village to solidify its role as a major cultural community hub in the Toronto context now and into the future?"

==Politics==
===Federal===
The neighbourhood is part of the federal [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] of [[Toronto Centre]], currently represented in the House of Commons by [[Bill Morneau]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. Previous representatives have included [[Bob Rae]], [[Chrystia Freeland]], and [[Bill Graham (Canadian politician)|Bill Graham]].

In the 2012 electoral redistribution proposals at the federal level, the neighbourhood was proposed for division, with Wellesley Street serving as the new boundary between Toronto Centre to the south and a new district of Mount Pleasant to the north.&lt;ref name=redistribution&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Proposed_riding_redistribution_splits_Village_in_half-12475.aspx "Proposed riding redistribution splits Village in half"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017140046/http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Proposed_riding_redistribution_splits_Village_in_half-12475.aspx |date=2012-10-17 }}. ''[[Xtra!]]'', August 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to community opposition, in the final report the northern boundary of Toronto Centre was shifted north to Charles Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Village_preserved_in_final_ridingredistribution_proposal-13209.aspx "Village preserved in final riding-redistribution proposal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318033037/http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Village_preserved_in_final_ridingredistribution_proposal-13209.aspx |date=2013-03-18 }}. ''[[Xtra!]]'', February 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provincial===
As early as 1977, politicians and journalists were already identifying the riding of [[St. George (Ontario provincial electoral district)|St. George]], the electoral district which included the Church and Wellesley village at that time, as perhaps the only electoral district in North America outside [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] where the support of gay voters could almost singlehandedly determine the winner.&lt;ref name=critical&gt;"St. George gay vote critical". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', June 6, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; That district's MPP's in the 1970s and 1980s, [[Margaret Campbell (politician)|Margaret Campbell]] (1973-1981) and [[Susan Fish]] (1981-1987), were both among the province's most vocal supporters of LGBT rights initiatives in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] during their terms in office. Despite this, the parties remained reluctant to actually nominate an openly gay candidate, for fear of backlash against the parties in other parts of the province — in 1981, the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] rejected the candidacy of [[Peter Maloney]] and the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] rejected the candidacy of John Argue, with Maloney claiming that party insiders had dismissed him as a "single-issue candidate".&lt;ref name=thwarting&gt;"Homosexual fears party is thwarting nomination". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', February 10, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

When St. George was redistributed into [[St. George—St. David]] for the 1987 election, [[Ian Scott (Ontario politician)|Ian Scott]] defeated Fish for the seat. Scott was not openly gay during his time in the legislature, although his sexuality was something of an open secret, and he came out after his retirement from politics. When [[Tim Murphy (Canadian politician)|Tim Murphy]] won the seat in a 1993 by-election after Scott's resignation from the legislature, one of his first significant legislative initiatives as an MPP was the presentation of a [[private member's bill]] which would have expanded the rights of same-sex couples, although it was later superseded by the Rae government's failed [[Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act]].&lt;ref name=rayside&gt;David Rayside, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUYOhAohQgMC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22Chris+Hodgson%22+by-election&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gy1AS7u6ON&amp;sig=1mTTwnAXf_H2LsFb9kOZyLIOA9I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LNSwSa2JCILMM57cycYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result ''On the Fringe: Gays &amp; Lesbians in Politics'']. [[Cornell University Press]], 1998. {{ISBN|0-8014-8374-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1999 election, St. George—St. David was redistributed into the current district of [[Toronto Centre (provincial electoral district)|Toronto Centre]]. [[George Smitherman]], the first openly gay MPP elected to the provincial legislature in Ontario, represented the district from 1999 to 2010. After his resignation from the legislature to run for [[Mayor of Toronto]] in the [[Toronto mayoral election, 2010|2010 mayoral election]], he was succeeded by the openly gay [[Glen Murray (politician)|Glen Murray]].  Murray resigned his seat effective 1 September 2017 to accept a position with the Pembina Institute, and the seat remained vacant until the [[Ontario general election, 2018|2018 provincial election]]. [[Suze Morrison]] was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario to represent Toronto Centre in the 2018 provincial election.

===Municipal===
In 1991, [[Kyle Rae]] was elected to Toronto City Council to represent the ward that includes Church and Wellesley, becoming the city's first openly gay councillor. He represented the area until 2010, when he retired and was succeeded by [[Kristyn Wong-Tam]], the city's first openly lesbian councillor.

==Demographics==
In 2006, the non-immigrant population accounted for 58% of the census tract population. The immigrant population was 35% and the non-permanent residents 7%.  In 2011, the non-immigrant population still accounted for 58% but the non-permanent residents population rose from 7 to 10%, leaving the immigrant population at 32%.

==Transportation==
[[File:Wellesley TTC 22836813562.jpg|thumb|The [[Toronto subway]] can be accessed at Church and Wellesley from [[Wellesley (TTC)|Wellesley]] station, a stop on [[Line 1 Yonge–University]].]]
The [[Wellesley (TTC)|Wellesley]] subway station on [[Line 1 Yonge–University]] provides the community with access to Toronto's extensive [[Toronto subway|subway]] system. Other stations that are within walking distance to the community include:

'''''Yonge–University–Spadina line''''':
* [[Bloor-Yonge (TTC)|Bloor-Yonge]] 
* [[College (TTC)|College]]

'''''[[Bloor–Danforth line]]''''':

==In popular culture==
The television series ''[[Queer as Folk (U.S.)|Queer as Folk]]'', a Canadian-American coproduction, was filmed in the Church and Wellesley area. Although considerable outdoor filming took place and the neighbourhood was quite recognizable within the show, the series was set in [[Pittsburgh]] rather than Toronto.

The Toronto-based comedy troupe ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' performed a recurring sketch, ''The Steps'', on their television series in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Although the sketch was filmed on a studio set, it was inspired by a real cultural touchstone in the Church and Wellesley area, a series of steps along the length of a building on the southwest corner of Church and Wellesley where residents of and visitors to the neighbourhood regularly congregated to hang out and drink coffee from the [[Second Cup]] franchise in the building.

==Notable people==
* [[Enza Anderson]], transgender media personality and political candidate
* [[Mark Elliot (radio host)|Mark Elliot]], the first openly gay talk show host on [[CFRB (AM)|CFRB]]
* [[Malcolm Ingram]], director ''[[Small Town Gay Bar]]''
* [[Kyle Rae]], former [[Toronto City Council|Toronto city councillor]]

He won the [[Hong Kong Young Industrialist Award]] in 1992 and maintained working relationships with governments in [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Authosis Ventures"&gt;[http://www.authosisvc.com/team.htm/ Authosis Ventures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429014428/http://www.authosisvc.com/team.htm |date=2007-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also had a network of venture capital connections on both sides of the [[Pacific]].&lt;ref name="Authosis Ventures"/&gt;

'''Downtown Las Vegas''' (commonly abbreviated as '''DTLV''') is the [[central business district]] and historic center of [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. It is the original townsite and was the gambling district of Las Vegas prior to [[the Strip]], and the area still incorporates [[Downtown gaming Las Vegas|downtown gaming]]. As the urban core of the [[Las Vegas Valley]], it features a variety of hotel and business [[highrise]]s, cultural centers, historical buildings and government institutions, as well as residential and retail developments.  Downtown is located in the center of the Las Vegas Valley and just north of the [[Las Vegas Strip]], centered on [[Fremont Street]], the [[Fremont Street Experience]] and [[Fremont East]].  The city defines the area as bounded by [[Interstate 15|I-15]] on the west, Washington Avenue on the north, Maryland Parkway on the east and Sahara Avenue on the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schoenmann |first=Joe |date=March 19, 2014 |title=Joe Downtown: The boundaries of downtown Las Vegas are as fluid as its reputation |url=http://lasvegasweekly.com/column/joe-downtown/2014/mar/19/boundaries-downtown-las-vegas-are-fluid-reputation/?_ga=1.239706432.27414779.1396127750 |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Weekly]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=March 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vic-yellowshirt.JPG|thumb|Downtown Las Vegas casinos on Fremont Street (1973)]]
Perhaps the earliest visitors to the Las Vegas area were nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]], who traveled here 10,000 years ago, leaving behind [[petroglyph]]s. [[Anasazi]] and [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] tribes came here at least 2,000 years ago.

The area was named Las Vegas, which is Spanish for ''the meadows'', in the 1800s because it featured abundant wild grasses, as well as desert spring waters for westward travelers.

The year 1844 marked the arrival of [[John C. Frémont]], whose writings helped lure pioneers to the area. Downtown Las Vegas’ Fremont Street is named after him.

Eleven years later, members of the [[LDS Church]] chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Los Angeles]], where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this fort can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue at the [[Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park]].

Las Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when 110 acres of land adjacent to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city.

The year 1931 was a pivotal one for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks.  This year also witnessed the beginning of construction on nearby [[Hoover Dam]]. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the [[Great Depression]]. It was completed in 1935.

Following [[World War II]], lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas.

The 1950s saw the opening of the [[Moulin Rouge Hotel]], the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas.

In 1951, the first [[atomic bomb]] detonation at the [[Nevada Test Site]], 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, occurred.  City residents and visitors were able to witness the [[mushroom cloud]]s until 1963, when the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] required that nuclear tests be moved underground.

During the 1960s, corporations and business powerhouses such as [[Howard Hughes]] were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as "gaming," which transitioned into legitimate business.

In 1989, entrepreneur [[Steve Wynn]] changed the face of the Las Vegas gaming industry by opening up [[The Mirage]], the Las Vegas Strip’s first mega-casino resort. This strengthened the pull of visitors away from the downtown area.

In 1995, the [[Fremont Street Experience]] in Las Vegas’ downtown area was opened. This canopied, five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held on the top of each hour.

Due to years of revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed “The Year of Downtown.” Hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of projects made their debut at this time. They included The Smith Center for the Performing Arts and Discovery Children’s Museum, the Mob Museum, the Neon Museum, a new City Hall complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/factsstatistics/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050727081949/http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/FactsStatistics/history.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-07-27|title=History (Official City of Las Vegas Web Site)|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/travel/cityguide/article/0,31489,1838100_1838099_1838098,00.html|title=Las Vegas: 10 Things to Do — 10.

In 2018, plans for a new downtown expo center were announced, replacing and expanding on space previously provided by the Cashman Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/las-vegas/downtown-las-vegas-to-get-new-76m-expo-center/|title=Downtown Las Vegas to get new $76M expo center|date=29 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neighborhoods and attractions==

===Fremont Street Casino District===
{{Main|Downtown (Nevada gaming area)}}
[[Fremont Street]] is home to most of downtown's hotels and casinos. These are the original casinos of Las Vegas, which existed before the more famous [[Las Vegas Strip]].

[[File:Beauty Bar Las Vegas, Las Vegas, United States (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|An artist performing at Beauty Bar on Fremont East]]
Property and business owners have been working to redevelop Fremont Street just east of the Fremont Street Experience. In 2002, the city of [[Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency]] joined with Fremont East property and business owners to create a [[business improvement district]], as well as pay for a $5.5 million streetscape improvement. This area is called the Fremont East Entertainment District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fremont East Entertainment District|url=http://lasvegasnevada.gov/Government/7589.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features an eclectic mix of bars, clubs and restaurants.

===The Arts District===
{{Main|Downtown Arts District}}
Officially called 18b, The Las Vegas Arts District – named after the 18 blocks the district originally encompassed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18b, The Las Vegas Arts District website|url=http://www.18b.org/las-vegas-arts-district}}&lt;/ref&gt; – this area is home to the city's arts scene with its mix of art galleries, studios and stores.

===Symphony Park===
{{Main|Symphony Park}}
[[Symphony Park]] is a mixed-use urban district being built on the land to the west of Fremont and Main streets. It will eventually feature a mix of retail, medical, hotel and residential developments. The city of Las Vegas is undertaking the development on {{convert|61|acre}} of land purchased from the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in 1995. This is a major project for the [[Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency]] and the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Park Overview|url=http://www.unionparkvegas.com/unionparkoverview.aspx |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208202131/http://www.unionparkvegas.com/unionparkoverview.aspx |archivedate=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects that have been completed and are currently operating at Symphony Park are the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cleveland Clinic website|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/neurological_institute/lou-ruvo-brain-health/default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith Center for the Performing Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smith Center website|url=http://www.thesmithcenter.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Discovery Children's Museum.&lt;ref name="DISCOVERY"&gt;{{cite web|title=DISCOVERY Children's Museum|url=http://www.discoverykidslv.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Las Vegas website|url=http://lasvegasnevada.gov/Government/7598.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Las Vegas Medical District===
Business and government leaders have begun working on a plan to expand downtown’s Las Vegas Medical District (LVMD) from its current 200 acres to at least 680 acres. While currently offering the largest concentration of health-care services in the Las Vegas valley, an expanded district would allow for additional health-care services and opportunities. Areas for planned expansion include the Charleston Boulevard corridor to Valley View Boulevard, along Martin L. King Boulevard and in Symphony Park. The centerpiece of this expanded district will be the 260,000-square-foot UNLV School of Medicine, which will include an educational building and library. The school was granted preliminary accreditation in late 2016 and can begin accepting students for its 2017 charter class.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

===Financial District===
Centered on Bonneville Avenue and Casino Center Boulevard, most of this area is filled with office and government buildings.  With several court buildings located here, there are many judicial-related businesses such as law firms in the immediate area.  The financial district is home to the [[Las Vegas City Hall]] building, the Lloyd D. George U.S. Courthouse and several bank buildings such as [[Bank of America]]. The Clark County Marriage Bureau is also located here at the Regional Justice Center.&lt;ref name="lasvegasnevada.gov"/&gt;

===Art and culture===
[[File:LasVegasSymphonyPark1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Symphony Park]]]]
Downtown is a hub for arts and culture in the metro area.  The main venue for performing arts is the [[Art Deco]]-inspired [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]]. In addition to The Smith Center and 18b, The Las Vegas Arts District, there are a number of educational facilities in the Cultural Corridor, located just north of the immediate downtown area. They include the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, the Neon Museum and Boneyard and the Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Corridor website|url=http://culturalcorridorvegas.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in this area are a number of neon signs from former Las Vegas casinos and landmarks, which have been restored and installed on several streets around downtown, as well as throughout the Fremont Street Experience. A famous neon icon of downtown Las Vegas is the [[Vegas Vic]] sign, also located at the Fremont Street Experience.

==Cityscape==
[[Image:Lou Ruvo Center - South West Corner - 2010-12-10.JPG|thumb|right|Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health]]

===Architecture===
Several buildings of architectural significance exist downtown, although being founded in 1905, Las Vegas lacks the number of historical buildings of older cities. Exceptions include the Historic Fifth Street School, built in 1936 in the Spanish-mission style and listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Also listed is the [[Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse]], which currently serves as home to The Mob Museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mob Museum website|url=http://www.themobmuseum.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the few historical neoclassical buildings in the city.  Built in 1930, the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies and Performing Arts is the city's best example of Art Deco architecture.  The Morelli House, built in 1959, is a notable mid-century modern design.  The building that formerly housed the Las Vegas City Hall, and now is home to the corporate headquarters for the online retailer Zappos.com, is a notable example of 1970s modern architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aialasvegas.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=34|title=About the Historic 5th Street School - American Institute of Architects Las Vegas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aialasvegas.org/associations/9424/files/Visitors%20Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As Las Vegas boomed, more recent buildings tended to take inspiration from a variety of styles.  The Clark County Government Center has a red sandstone exterior invoking a desert motif.  The [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]], opened in 2012, is a more modern example of Art Deco design. Architect [[Frank Gehry]] designed the building for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health building in deconstructionist style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/lasvegas/downtown01b.html|title=Architecture Studies Library - University Libraries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was completed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasvegasnevada.gov/Government/7598.htm|title=Symphony Park (Official City of Las Vegas Web Site)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks===
* Donald W. Reynolds Symphony Park
* Lewis Avenue Pedestrian Corridor
* Heritage Park
* Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park

* Cashman Field Center

==Government==
Downtown serves as a main center for government services in the [[Las Vegas Valley]].  Government offices for the city of Las Vegas and Clark County are located here, as well as the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] and several courts.

Some former government buildings have been turned into attractions, such as the old [[Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse]] becoming the [[Mob Museum]].

==Transportation==
[[File:RTC Bus Picture - Photo by June Johns.jpg|thumb|Regional Transportation Commission provides public transportation]]

Two major freeways—Interstate 15 and Interstate 515/U.S. Route 95—cross in downtown Las Vegas. [[RTC Transit]] is a public transportation system providing bus service throughout Las Vegas, including the downtown area.

A [[bus rapid transit]] link in Las Vegas called the Strip &amp; Downtown Express (previously ACE Gold Line) with limited stops and frequent service was launched in March 2010. It connects downtown Las Vegas, the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center. It stops at the Bonneville Transit Center.  Completed in 2012, the transit terminal serves as a central transfer point for downtown and features 16 vehicle bays for buses and 100 bike racks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit/btc/tour.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526141505/http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit/btc/tour.cfm |archivedate=2011-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Downtown Loop is a free shuttle servicing many attractions in downtown Las Vegas.  The Loop runs continuously during operating hours and arrives at each stop every 20 minutes. The hours of operation are Monday through Thursday: 11:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; Friday through Saturday: 3 p.m. to 12 a.m.; Sunday: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.

The AAA Free Self-Driving Shuttle is a pilot program that provides rides in the Fremont East Entertainment District Nov 2017 – Nov 2018. The pilot program is a partnership with [http://www.keolisnorthamerica.com/ Keolis], the [[city of Las Vegas]], and the [[Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada]]. The shuttle runs Tuesday – Sunday 4:30pm – 8:30pm, with the main station stop at the Downtown Container Park. Shuttle service is suspended during the month of August.

==Economy==
The economy of downtown Las Vegas has been primarily based on gambling and entertainment, as is the case in the greater [[Las Vegas Valley]]. However, the smaller downtown casinos earn revenues that pale in comparison to the mega resorts on the Las Vegas Strip further south. As of 2014, there have been major renovations of several downtown resorts such as [[Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino|The Plaza]], Golden Gate Hotel, [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]], El Cortez Hotel &amp; Casino, the D and the Downtown Grand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/mar/20/downtown-casino-renovations-maintain-old-vegas-vib/|title=Downtown casino renovations maintain Old Vegas vibe|author=Ron Sylvester|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/apr/10/strip-gaming-revenue-rose-33-percent-february/|title=Strip gaming revenue rose 3.3 percent in February|author=Cy Ryan|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown Las Vegas also houses some corporate offices, as well as the World Market Center Las Vegas, a frequent host of trade shows and conventions.  Recently, the opening of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and the arrival of the new Zappos headquarters downtown has started to attract new medical and technology-oriented businesses to the area.

===Revitalization===
The downtown area in recent decades has played second fiddle to the larger and more famous [[Las Vegas Strip]], which is located a few miles to the south. The city has been working on revitalization efforts to entice more visitors and residents to the downtown area.
[[Image:WMCLV GrandPlaza.jpg|thumb|right|The World Market Center Las Vegas complex]]
[[File:The Smith Center for the Performing Arts &amp; DISCOVERY Children's Museum.jpg|thumb|right|The Smith Center for the Performing Arts]]
World Market Center Las Vegas consists of three giant buildings, with a total of 5.1 million square feet, in a facility designed by [[Jon Jerde]]. It is home to semiannual trade shows for the furniture and furnishing industries. This is one of several entities that are helping to diversity downtown Las Vegas' economy and job base.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Market Center Las Vegas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The square footage of World Market Center Las Vegas is greater than both the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]] and the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]].

The city is also working to attract events to the downtown area. Recently held events include ''Helldorado''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elkshelldorado.com|title=Elks Helldorado Days Official Website - Join us May 14-17, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Life is Beautiful'' festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeisbeautifulfestival.com/|title=Life is Beautiful Life is Beautiful|work=Life is Beautiful}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 several new downtown projects were completed. The [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]], the new [[Mob Museum]] and a new City Hall building opened. The Discovery Children's Museum opened next door to The Smith Center in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2013/mar/07/new-discovery-childrens-museum-opens-weekend/|title=New Discovery: Children's museum opens this weekend|author=Ken Miller|date=7 March 2013|work=LasVegasWeekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Las Vegas City Hall now operates out of a new building, which, along with the Bonneville Transit center, can serve as an anchor tenant for new development along Main Street.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Fiscal Year In Review, city of Las Vegas Economic and Urban Development Projects, "A New Downtown Emerges."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Main and Commerce streets in downtown Las Vegas are undergoing major beautification efforts, which started in mid-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/apr/17/joe-downtown-construction-begin-downtown-beautific/|title=Joe Downtown: Construction to begin on downtown beautification project|author=Joe Schoenmann|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online retailer [[Zappos]] made major renovations to the old Las Vegas City Hall, and moved into the building in late 2013, which now houses its corporate headquarters. Zappos CEO [[Tony Hsieh]] has taken a personal, as well as a professional, interest in the urban area and is contributing $350 million of his personal wealth toward a multifaceted revitalization effort called the Downtown Project, with businesses like [[The Writer's Block]] included among its investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/magazine/what-happens-in-brooklyn-moves-to-vegas.html|title=What Happens in Brooklyn Moves to Vegas|date=21 October 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4846">An '''equality impact assessment''' ('''EqIA''') is a process designed to ensure that a policy, project or scheme does not discriminate against any disadvantaged or vulnerable people.&lt;ref name=EHRC&gt;{{cite book|title=Equality impact assessment quick-start guide: A step-by-step guide to integrating equality impact assessment into policymaking and review|date=March 2010|publisher=[[Equality and Human Rights Commission]]|isbn=978 1 84206 269 2|page=3|url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/documents/PSD/equality_impact_assessment_guidance_quick-start_guide.pdf|accessdate=26 February 2016|format=PDF document|chapter=Ready: What is an equality impact assessment?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The EqIA process aims to prevent discrimination against people who are categorised as being disadvantaged or vulnerable within society.&lt;ref name=EHRC /&gt; These categories are called equality target groups (ETGs) and are currently designated by the [[Greater London Authority]] as: 
*women; 
*black, Asian and ethnic-minority people; 
*young people and children;
*older people; 
*disabled people; 
*Lesbian people, gay people, bisexual people and transsexual people; and 
*people from different faith groups.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Previous EqIAs have included other categories of people such as people on low incomes{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} and [[gypsies]] and [[Irish Travellers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Planning policy for traveller sites: Equality impact assessment|publisher=Communities and Local Government|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11422/2116900.pdf|accessdate=26 February 2016|format=PDF document}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the UK, EqIAs are still popular as a means of ensuring that the public-sector equality duty is met.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} However, on 19 November 2012, prime minister [[David Cameron]] announced that EqIAs would no longer be undertaken for government decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20389297 BBC News].

'''George Gould''' (6 April 1865 – 26 May 1941) was a New Zealand farmer, businessman, stock breeder, racehorse owner and breeder, and racing administrator.

The latter proposal would have required the demolition of the Colosseum. Gould suggested this diagonal street be called Little High Street, in reference to the diagonal High Street further south in the central city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Town Planning |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP19291125.2.73 |accessdate=27 February 2016 |work=[[The Press]] |volume=LXV |issue=19785 |date=25 November 1929 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two weeks after Gould's proposal, a group of businessman led by Arthur Francis Stacey put a proposal for a new street with a Spanish theme to Christchurch City Council's town planning committee. The group had secured options on the Colosseum and on those two properties that separated the Colosseum from access onto Armagh Street.&lt;ref name="Spanish Street"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spanish Street |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP19291213.2.73 |accessdate=27 February 2016 | work=[[The Press]] |volume=LXV |issue=19801 |date=13 December 1929 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Regent Street]] is what came from Stacey's proposal.

The '''Global Ecolabelling Network''' (GEN) is a non-profit network composed of some 27 [[ecolabel]] organisations throughout the world representing nearly 60 countries and territories, with 2 associate members and a growing number of affiliate members, one of which is Google. GEN members have certified over 252,000 products and services for environmental leadership. GEN was established in 1994.

The stated goal of the Network is to further the exchange of information between national ecolabel organisations that operate "Type 1" ecolabels, the strongest category, as defined by ISO 14024. "Blauer Engel" (Blue Angel), the German ecolabel, established in 1978, was the first of this kind. Ecolabels are "licensed" for use only after a product or service is proven to meet transparent, published standards for environmental preferability, verified by a qualified, independent, third party, and assessed over multiple environmental parameters (not just one single issue). The ecolabels are an assurance to consumers and procurement professionals that a product or service is proven "green" and has high environmental values and integrity. 

The Global Ecolabelling Network, its members and their clients will celebrate the first annual [https://www.globalecolabelling.net/world-ecolabelling-day/ World Ecolabel Day] on October 25, 2018.

==Early political career==
At the time the [[Urban Council]] elections, the only direct elections in the colony at the time, were dominated by [[Brook Bernacchi]]'s [[Reform Club of Hong Kong]], Cheong-Leen founded the [[Hong Kong Civic Association]] in 1954 with [[Roger Lobo]] and [[A. de O. Sales]], as well as Rev. [[Brigant Cassian]] and Dr. [[Woo Pak-foo]].&lt;ref name="Faure"/&gt; Cheong-Leen was the founding secretary-general of the association and was in the first meeting at a bar on the mezzanine floor of Jimmy's Kitchen in [[Theatre Lane]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]].&lt;ref name="HCL"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hilton Cheong-leen|date=28 July 2003|first=Hilton|last=Cheong-leen|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/423095/hilton-cheong-leen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He remained in the Urban Council for 34 years until he retired in 1991.&lt;ref name="HCL"/&gt; He took over as the Civic Association chairman in 1968 and had held the position for many years until 2004.

After 34 years of service, Cheong-Leen stepped down as the second longest-serving elected officeholder in Hong Kong history, behind [[Brook Bernacchi]]'s 41 years, after he decided not to seek for re-election of the Urban Council in 1991.&lt;ref name="retire"&gt;{{cite news|title=本港有史以來任期最長民選議員張有興放棄參選市局話別卅四載議員生涯|newspaper=Wah Kiu Yat Po|page=5|date=20 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was first appointed as an [[unofficial member]] of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] on 1 May 1973 by [[Governor of Hong Kong|Governor]] Sir [[Murray MacLehose]] with [[Guy Sayer]] to fill the vacancies left by retired [[Herbert John Charles Browne|H. J. C. Browne]] and deceased [[Mary Wong Wing-cheung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=張有興沙雅二人出任立法局議員|newspaper=Wah Kiu Yat Po|page=13|date=26 April 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first term in the council, he made a major speech advocating nine years of free compulsory education and followed up all the way to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], which made it eventually realised.&lt;ref name="HCL"/&gt; He retired from the Legislative Council on 31 August 1979 along with [[James Wu Man-hon]] after six years of service and were succeeded by [[Hu Fa-kuang]] and [[Wong Po-yan]].

'''Ignaz Glaser''' (May 5, 1853 &amp;ndash; August 11, 1916) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] businessman from [[Prague]] and the founder of one of the biggest sheet glass factories in the [[k.u.k.]] monarchy.

==Biography==
In 1881 in [[Bürmoos]] near [[Salzburg]] he used the legal estate of a former [[glassworks]] company that went bankrupt four years earlier and he bought a giant [[moorland|moor]] area. He expanded the factory with four glass ovens, which worked with turf.
He also founded a brickyard, which was very successful and which existed throughout the 1970s. Bit by bit he then bought further moor areas in the neighboring [[Weidmoos]] and at [[Ibmer]] moor, where he also started to cultivate [[hops]]. In the middle of the Ibmer area, in [[Hackenbuch]], [[Upper Austria]], he established another glass factory. The turf factory was very unstable because it depended on the weather a lot and the turf supplies drew to a close. Thus Glaser bought a closed sugar factory in [[North Bohemia]]n [[Bruex]] and established a new glass factory. In that factory ovens were heated with coal from an open pit, which made the company independent from weather conditions. After Glaser’s death in 1916, his son Dr. '''Hermann Glaser,''' born on August 18, 1889, took over the glass factory, which experienced a short economic boom after [[World War I]]. But then the company missed the update to mechanical flat glass fabrication and the Glaser empire broke down in 1926. In Bürmoos, flat glass was produced by a company named Stiassny until the end of 1929, which then bought the holdings. At this point glass fabrication was shut down totally. Eighty percent of the population there was unemployed.

Glaser’s grave is in the Jewish cemetery in Salzburg–Aigen. His son survived the [[Holocaust]] in [[Shanghai]] and died on January 10, 1956 in [[Vienna]].

In 2006 the first [[Ignaz-Glaser-Symposium]] organized by [[Andreas Maislinger]] with a focus on [[Racial integration|integration]] took place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10405">'''Involuntary unemployment''' occurs when a person is willing to work at the prevailing wage yet is [[unemployed]]. Involuntary unemployment is distinguished from voluntary unemployment, where workers choose not to work because their [[reservation wage]] is higher than the prevailing wage. In an economy with involuntary unemployment there is a surplus of labor at the current real wage. Involuntary unemployment cannot be represented with a basic [[supply and demand]] model at a competitive equilibrium: All workers on the labor supply curve above the market wage would voluntarily choose not to work, and all those below the market wage would be employed. Given the basic supply and demand model, involuntarily unemployed workers lie somewhere off of the labor supply curve.{{sfn|Taylor|2008}} Economists have several theories explaining the possibility of involuntary unemployment including [[implicit contract theory]], [[Disequilibrium macroeconomics|disequilibrium theory]], staggered wage setting, and [[efficiency wages]].{{sfn|Taylor|2008}}

[[File:Efficiency wage Shapiro Stiglitz.svg|right|thumb|alt=Chart showing the relationship of the non-shirking condition and full employment.|In the Shapiro-Stiglitz model workers are paid at a level where they do not shirk. This prevents wages from dropping to market clearing levels. Full employment cannot be achieved because workers would slack off if they were not threatened with the possibility of unemployment. The curve for the no-shirking condition (labeled NSC) goes to infinity at full employment.]]
Models based on implicit contract theory, like that of Azariadis (1975), are based on the hypothesis that labor contracts make it difficult for employers to cut wages. Employers often resort to layoffs rather than implement wage reductions. Azariadis showed that given risk-averse workers and risk-neutral employers, contracts with the possibility of layoff would be the optimal outcome.{{sfn|De Vroey|2002|p=384}}

Efficiency wage models suggest that employers pay their workers above market clearing wages in order to enhance their productivity.{{sfn|Taylor|2008}} In efficiency wage models based on shirking, employers are worried that workers may shirk knowing that they can simply move to another job if they are caught. Employers make shirking costly by paying workers more than the wages they would receive elsewhere. This gives workers an incentive not to shirk.{{sfn|Taylor|2008}} When all firms behave this way, an equilibrium is reached where there are unemployed workers willing to work at prevailing wages.{{sfn|Shapiro|Stiglitz|1984}}

[[File:Malinvaud unemployment typology.svg|thumb|right|Chart representing Malinvaud's typology includes a region with Keynesian unemployment, where there is an excess supply of goods and labor, and a region of classical unemployment, where there is an excess supply of labor and excess demand for goods.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|2010|p=294}}]]
Following earlier disequilibrium research including that of [[Robert Barro]] and [[Herschel Grossman]], work by [[Edmond Malinvaud]] clarified the distinction between classical unemployment, where real wages are too high for markets to clear, and Keynesian unemployment, involuntary unemployment due to inadequate aggregate demand.{{sfn|Taylor|2008}}  In Malinvaud's model, classical unemployment is remedied by cutting the real wage while Keynesian unemployment requires an exogenous stimulus in demand.{{sfn|De Vroey|2002|p=383}} Unlike implicit contrary theory and efficiency wages, this line of research does not rely on a higher than market-clearing wage level.  This type of involuntary unemployment is consistent with Keynes's definition while efficiency wages and implicit contract theory do not fit well with Keynes's focus on demand deficiency.{{sfn|De Vroey|2002|p=383-385}}

==Perspectives==
{{See also|Shapiro–Stiglitz theory}}
For many economists, involuntary unemployment is a real-world phenomenon of central importance to economics. Many economic theories have been motivated by the desire to understand and control involuntary unemployment.{{sfn|McCombie|1987|p=203}} However, acceptance of the concept of involuntary unemployment isn't universal among economists.{{who|date=June 2018}} Some do not accept it as a real or coherent aspect of economic theory. {{who|date=June 2018}}

Shapiro and Stiglitz, developers of an influential shirking model, stated "To us, involuntary unemployment is a real and important phenomenon with grave social consequences that needs to be explained and understood."{{sfn|Shapiro|Stiglitz|1985|p=1217}}

[[Mancur Olson]] argued that real world events like the [[Great Depression]] could not be understood without the concept of involuntary unemployment. He argued against economists who denied involuntary unemployment and put their theories ahead of "common sense and the observations and experiences of literally hundreds of millions of people... that there is also involuntary unemployment and that it is by no means an isolated or rare phenomenon".{{sfn|Olson|1982|p=195}}

Other economists do not believe that true involuntary unemployment exists{{sfn|Mayer|1997|p=94}} or question its relevance to economic theory. [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]] claims "...there is an involuntary element in all unemployment in the sense that no one chooses bad luck over good; there is also a voluntary element in all unemployment, in the sense that, however miserable one's current work options, one can always choose to accept them"{{sfn|Lucas|1978|p=354}} and "the unemployed worker at any time can always find some job at once".{{sfn|Lucas|1978|p=354}} Lucas dismissed the need for theorists to explain involuntary unemployment since it is "not a fact or a phenomenon which it is the task of theorists to explain. It is, on the contrary, a theoretical construct which Keynes introduced in the hope it would be helpful in discovering a correct explanation for a genuine phenomenon: large-scale ﬂuctuations in measured, total unemployment."{{sfn|Lucas|1978|p=354-355}} Along those lines [[real business cycle]] and other models from Lucas's [[new classical school]] explain fluctuations in employment by shifts in labor supply driven by changes in workers' productivity and preferences for leisure.{{sfn|Taylor|2008}}

Involuntary unemployment is also conceptually problematic with [[Matching theory (economics)|search and matching theories]] of unemployment. In these models, unemployment is voluntary in the sense that a worker might choose to endure unemployment during a long search for a higher paying job than those immediately available; however, there is an involuntary element in the sense that a worker does not have control of the economic circumstances that force them to look for new work in the first place.{{sfn|Andolfatto|2008}}

'''James Blair''' ({{circa}} 1788 – 9 September 1841&lt;ref name="lbs-blair" /&gt;) was a [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] owner of plantations in the [[West Indies]]. He entered Parliament as a [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] in 1818 to protect the interests of slave-owners.&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v1" /&gt;
Blair sat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] from 1818 to 1830, and later from 1837 to 1841.&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hollett" /&gt;

When slave-owners were compensated for the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolition of slavery in British colonies]] in 1833, Blair received the biggest single compensation payment.

==Early life==
Blair was the son of John Blair of [[County Armagh]] in Ireland. However, his family came from [[Wigtownshire]] in Scotland, and their business interests were there.&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v2" /&gt;

==Career as a planter==
In 1815, his father's brother [[Lambert Blair]] left his South American estates jointly to James Blair and his cousin John MacEamon&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v1" /&gt; (or MacCamon).&lt;ref name="s-h-lambert-blair" /&gt; These included sugar and cotton plantations in [[Berbice]], [[Demerara]] and [[Surinam]].&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v1" /&gt;

==Career in Parliament==
At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1818|1818 general election]], Blair bought a seat in Parliament, in the [[rotten borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]] in Devon.&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v1" /&gt; That seat was bought for one Parliament only from [[Michael George Prendergast]], who had purchased a life interest from the borough's owner [[James Buller (1772–1830)|James Buller]].&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v1" /&gt;

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1820|1820 general election]], Blair was returned for another rotten borough, this time [[Aldeburgh (UK Parliament constituency)|Aldeburgh]] in Suffolk.&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v2" /&gt; It was owned by the Yorkshire ironmaster [[Samuel Walker (1779–1851)|Samuel Walker]], who had bought it in 1818 for £39,000&lt;ref name="histparl-samuel-walker-d1851" /&gt; (equivalent to £{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|39,000|1818}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).

Blair had entered Parliament to defend the slave plantations, and while he voted on conventional Tory lines, he did not speak in the Commons until March 1824, in the debates which followed the [[Demerara rebellion of 1823]]. He opposed measures to improve the living and working conditions of slaves.&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v2" /&gt; He told the house that the slaves were "as mildly and as humanely managed in Demerara, as in the Islands, or as is compatible with a state of slavery and pressure" and that "there can be no doubt that the revolt in Demerara is to be attributed to the debates which took place in this House last year, and to the notice preceding them".&lt;ref name="hansard-1824" /&gt; His only other contribution to Parliamentary debates was in 1825,&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v2" /&gt; when he supported retaining the preferential tariff on sugar imported from the West Indies.&lt;ref name="hansard-1825" /&gt; He had been an active member of the [[London Society of West India Planters and Merchants]], attending 33 meetings between 1824 -1829.&lt;ref name="Ryden EHS"&gt;Ryden D. (2015) The Society of West India Planters and Merchants in the Age of Emancipation, c.1816-35, [http://www.ehs.org.uk/events/annual-conference-programme-2015.html Economic History Society Annual Conference, University of Wolverhampton], accessed 5 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker's interest in Aldeburgh had been sold in 1822, and at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1826|1826 election]] Blair was returned for [[Minehead (UK Parliament constituency)|Minehead]] in the Fownes Luttrell interest. He continued to take a Tory line, voting against repeal of the [[Test Acts]], against Jewish emancipation, and against Catholic emancipation.&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v2" /&gt;

He stood down at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1830|1830 general election]], with hopes of a seat in [[Wigtownshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Wigtownshire]].&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v2" /&gt; However, he did not return to the Commons for seven years.

In 1833, Parliament passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]], which abolished slavery throughout the [[British Empire]]. The Act reconciled two central principles of 19th-century [[classical liberalism]] – [[Civil liberties|human liberty]] and [[private property]] – by paying compensation to slave-owners for the loss of their property.&lt;ref name="kidner" /&gt; The sum allocated in the Act was £20 million, which amounted to 40% of the United Kingdom's annual budget.&lt;ref name="trebilcock" /&gt; Owners submitted separate claims for their slave-holdings on separate plantations, and the largest single claim came from Blair.&lt;ref name="lbs-blair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ios-feb-2013" /&gt; (Others such as [[Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet|John Gladstone]] made multiple claims which reached a higher total.&lt;ref name="lbs-gladstone" /&gt;) For the 1,598 slaves he owned on the Blairmont plantation he had inherited in British Guyana, Blair was awarded £83,530 8shilling and 11pennies&lt;ref name="lbs-blair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ios-feb-2013" /&gt;
(equivalent to £{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|83,530|1833}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).

Blair did not contest the Wigtownshire seat until [[United Kingdom general election, 1835|1835]], when he was defeated by the incumbent [[Sir Andrew Agnew, 7th Baronet|Sir Andrew Agnew, Bt]].&lt;ref name="craig1832-1885" /&gt; Agnew retired at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1837|1837 election]], when Blair won the seat by 362 votes to 314 of the Whig [[Alexander Murray (1789–1845)|Alexander Murray]].&lt;ref name="craig1832-1885" /&gt; At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1841|general election in August]], Blair lost his seat to the Whig [[John Dalrymple, 10th Earl of Stair|John Hamilton Dalrymple]].&lt;ref name="craig1832-1885" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1815, he married Elizabeth Catherine Stopford, youngest daughter of Lieutenant-General Hon [[Edward Stopford (British Army officer)|Edward Stopford]]. In 1825, he bought the [[Penninghame]] estate in Wigtownshire from a merchant whose business had failed. The estate included the lands of Penninghame, [[Castle Stewart of Penninghame|Castle Stewart]] and Fintalloch.&lt;ref name="mkerlie" /&gt;

==Death==
Blair died less than a month after his defeat in the 1841 election at about age fifty-three.&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v2" /&gt;
His will ran to 46 pages and made many bequests,&lt;ref name="histparl-james-blair-d1841-v2" /&gt; to a total value of £300,000&lt;ref name="lbs-blair" /&gt; (equivalent to £{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|300,000|1818}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).

The bulk of his wealth, including the Penninghame estate, was bequeathed to his brother-in-law [[William Henry Stopford]], a Colonel in the [[Royal Artillery]].&lt;ref name="mkerlie" /&gt; In 1842, Colonel Stopford changed his name to Stopford-Blair, and incorporated the Blair [[coat of arms]] in his own.&lt;ref name="mkerlie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gazette-stopford-namechnage" /&gt;

'''Jacobus Petrus "Koos" Bekker''' (born 14 December 1952) is chairman of leading emerging markets media group [[Naspers]].&lt;ref name=Naspers&gt;{{cite web|title=About Naspers, Non-Executive Directors|url=http://www.naspers.com/about#Non-Executive|website=Naspers|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-08-19/south-african-bekker-becomes-billionaire-with-china-media&lt;/ref&gt;
The company operates in 130 countries and is listed on the London and Johannesburg Stock Exchanges, and has the largest market capitalization of any media company outside the US and China.

==Early life==
Koos Bekker was born in [[Potchefstroom]], South Africa on 14 December 1952.  Bekker received his school education from Hoër Volkskool Heidelberg and completed degrees from [[Stellenbosch University]] in Law and Literature and [[Wits University]] in Law. During his studies in Stellenbosch he was a hostel boarder of Eendrag Manskoshuis.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

==Career==
After a few years in advertising he read an MBA degree at [[Columbia Business School]], graduating in 1984.  As a result of a project paper, he, and a few young colleagues founded one of the first two pay television services outside the US.  [[M-Net]] and its sister companies like Multichoice eventually expanded to 48 countries across Africa. In the 1990s, he was a founding director of mobile communication company [[MTN Group|MTN]].&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=82609080&amp;privcapId=35248158|title=Koos Bekker: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997 Bekker became CEO of Naspers, one of the initial investors in the M-Net/Multichoice group.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}   Naspers bought out the other shareholders.  During his tenure, the market capitalization of Naspers grew from about $1.2 billion to $45 billion.  His compensation package was unusual in that for fifteen years as CEO he earned no salary, bonus or perks.  He was compensated solely via stock option grants that vested over time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Foreign investments==
Under Bekker, Naspers invested in pay television, mobile telephony and various internet services.  Geographically the group spans Europe, Africa, Latin America, China, India, Russia and various smaller countries.

'''Lehmann Bernheimer''' (27 December 1841 - 29 May 1918) was a German antique dealer, who built the [[Bernheimer-Haus]] in Munich.

He was born on 27 December 1841 in Buttenhausen in Münsingen, Württemberg, the third child of Meier Bernheimer (1801-1870) and his wife Sarah, née Kahn (1803-1881).

In 1887, Bernheimer bought a small coffee house and beer garden, owned and run by an Englishman, and called the ''English Café''. In its place was built the [[Bernheimer-Haus]], which was opened in December 1889 by [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Prince Regent Luitpold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bauer | first1=Richard |last2=Brenner | first2=Michael Brenner |date=2006 | title=Jüdisches München |language=German | location= |publisher=C.H. Beck | page=129 | isbn=978-3-406-54979-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the focus was on high-quality textiles, with the manufacture of luxury goods being slowly added. After a fire in 1897, the building was extended and antiques, tapestries and carpets were added. On his death in 1918, his son, [[Otto Bernheimer]] took over.

[[File:C-130 airdrop.jpg|thumb|right|An [[M551 Sheridan]] being dropped from a [[C-130 Hercules]].]]

The '''low-altitude parachute-extraction system''' ('''LAPES''') is a tactical military [[airlift]] delivery method where a [[fixed wing]] [[cargo aircraft]] can deposit supplies in situations in which [[landing]] is not an option, in an area that is too small to accurately [[parachute]] supplies from a high altitude.

This method was developed by the [[US Military]] with the assistance of the 109th Quartermaster Company (Air Drop) in 1964. In May 1965, a detachment of the 109th was formed as the 383rd Quartermaster (Aerial Supply) Detachment and sent to Vietnam. In 1966 the 109th was sent to Vietnam and took operational control of the 383rd. Both units provided Air Drop and LAPES support during the [[Siege of Khe Sanh]] in the [[Vietnam War]]. LAPES was used to provide a method of supplying heavy loads into Khe Sanh which could not effectively be supplied by air drop.&lt;ref name=KheSanh/&gt; This practice was perfected at [[Mactan Air Base]] in [[Cebu]], [[Philippines]].

Preparation for a LAPES delivery includes loading cargo on a [[pallet]] rigged with two types of parachutes (chutes).  The drogue chute is used to pull a cluster of larger extraction chutes out.  The deployed extraction chutes will then pull the load out of the plane.  Floor locks hold the pallet in place until extraction time.

The LAPES delivery procedure begins by slowing to approach speed, lowering the ramp, and opening the cargo door.  To preclude damage to the aircraft from an inadvertent contact with the ground, the landing gear is lowered.  The aircraft approaches the extraction zone in a manner similar to landing.  On command of the pilot, the drogue chute is released and allowed to trail behind the aircraft on a tether.  As the pilot flares and achieves a wheel height of 1-2 meters above ground, the drogue chute is allowed to pull the extraction chutes out into the airstream.  The force of these chutes overcomes the floor locks, pulling the pallet across the ramp, out of the aircraft, and onto the extraction zone.  The pilot adjusts the flight controls to remain level during the extreme change in the aircraft center of gravity caused by the pallet movement.  While the pallet slides to a stop using the extraction chutes as a brake, the pilot climbs away from the extraction zone and raises the landing gear.  On climb out, the rear cargo door is closed and the ramp is raised, completing the sequence. 

LAPES enables planes to quickly deploy large cargo in a timely fashion instead of having to land and take off, which exposes the plane to enemy fire. The technique also allows delivery of loads that are too heavy for a direct parachute descent (high altitude drop). However, the drop sequence's low altitude allows for no margin of [[pilot error]] and the risk of [[plane crash]] is heightened.&lt;ref name="KheSanh"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Siege of Khe Sanh|url=https://www.pbs.org/battlefieldvietnam/khe/g_02.html|author=Geiger, Bruce M|work=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 1, 1987, during a [[capabilities exercise]] (CAPEX), a USAF C-130E (68-10945 c/n 4325) crashed while performing a LAPES demo at the Sicily Drop Zone, on Fort Bragg. The pilot of the C-130 had performed a LAPES drop with the same extreme rate of descent two days earlier during a practice run. The crash killed three on board and one soldier on the ground, and injured two crew.&lt;ref name="Ft Bragg"&gt;{{cite news |title=Plane Crashes in Military Exercise, Narrowly Missing Spectators|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/plane-crashes-in-military-exercise-narrowly-missing-spectators.html|date=2 July 1987|work=New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106044910/https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/plane-crashes-in-military-exercise-narrowly-missing-spectators.html|archive-date=6 November 2017|access-date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PT Matahari Putra Prima Tbk''' doing business as '''Matahari Hypermart''' is an Indonesian retail chain that sells items for daily needs.&lt;ref name="MPP1"&gt;Matahari Putra Prima Tbk 2014, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Matahari Hypermart was established on March 11, 1986. It was based on notarial deed No. 30, dated March 11, 1986 of ''Budiarti Karnadi, S.H.'' and was approved by the Minister of Justice in Decision Letter No. C2-5238.HT.01-01.Th.86, dated July 26, 1986. It was published in Supplement No. 73 of State Gazette No. 2954 dated September 20, 1991.&lt;ref name="MPP1" /&gt; The first Hypermart was opened in 2004 at Wahana Tata Cemerlang Mall in Lippo Karawaci, Tangerang. On December 19, 2014, Hypermart unveiled the new logo at the opening of the new Hypermart store with the new G7 concept at Cyberpark, North Lippo Karawaci, Tangerang. This logo was rolled out on their new and renovated existing Hypermart stores with the G7 concept throughout 2015 and still going on until present.

== Initial Public Offering ==
In December 1992, Matahari Hypermart listed its shares on the [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]] and the [[Surabaya Stock Exchange]].  These later merged and were renamed as [[Indonesia Stock Exchange|the Indonesia Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="MPP2"&gt;Matahari Putra Prima Tbk 2014, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Competition law}}
'''Merger control''' refers to the procedure of reviewing [[mergers , acquisitions]] under [[antitrust]] / competition law. Over 130 nations worldwide have adopted a regime providing for merger control. National or supernational competition agencies such as the [[European Union|EU]] [[European Commission]] or the [[US]] [[Federal Trade Commission]] are normally entrusted with the role of reviewing mergers.

Merger control regimes are adopted to prevent anti-competitive consequences of concentrations (as mergers and acquisitions are also known). Accordingly, most merger control regimes normally provide for one of the following substantive tests:

* Does the concentration significantly impede [[effective competition]]? ([[European Union|EU]], [[Germany]])
* Does the concentration substantially lessen competition? ([[United States|US]], [[United Kingdom|UK]])
* Does the concentration lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position? ([[Switzerland]], [[Russia]])

In practice most merger control regimes are based on very similar underlying principles. In simple terms, the creation of a dominant position would usually result in a substantial lessening of or significant impediment to [[effective competition]].

The large majority of modern merger control regimes are of an ''ex-ante'' nature, i.e. the reviewing authorities carry out their assessment before the transaction is implemented.

While it is indisputable that a concentration may lead to a reduction in output and result in higher prices and thus in a welfare loss to consumers, the antitrust authority faces the challenge of applying various [[Economics|economic]] theories and rules in a legally binding procedure.

==Horizontal mergers==

The vast majority of significant competition issues associated with mergers arises in horizontal mergers.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 1.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A horizontal merger is one between parties that are competitors at the same level of production and/or distribution of a good or service, i.e., in the same [[relevant market]].&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.4 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of anticompetitive effects associated with horizontal mergers: unilateral effects and coordinated effects.

'''Unilateral effects''', also known as non-coordinated effects, arise where, as a result of the merger, competition between the products of the merging firms is eliminated, allowing the merged entity to unilaterally exercise market power, for instance by profitably raising the price of one or both merging parties’ products, thus harming consumers.&lt;ref&gt;International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 2.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Homogeneous products|homogeneous markets]], unilateral effects can be pronounced when two significant competitors merge to create a large, dominant player with only a few or no other competitors. In these markets, an important role in the assessment is played by market shares and by the capacity available in the market.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice  and the  Federal Trade Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 6.3 http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/hmg-2010.html#6c&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Differentiated Bertrand competition|differentiated markets]], unilateral effects tend to arise particularly when the two merging companies have highly [[Substitute good|substitutable goods]]. Such a price increase does not depend on the merged firm being the dominant player in the market. The likelihood and magnitude of such an increase will instead depend on the [[substitutability]] of the products supplied by the two firms – the closer the substitute, the greater the unilateral effects.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission - Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 28 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52004XC0205(02):EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coordinated effects''' arise where, under certain market conditions (e.g., market transparency, product homogeneity etc.), the merger increases the probability that, post merger, merging parties and their competitors will successfully be able to [[Coordination game|coordinate]] their behaviour in an anti-competitive way, for example, by raising prices.&lt;ref&gt;International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As in the case of unilateral effects, the most common form of coordinated effects is in the case of horizontal mergers, i.e. mergers between firms active on the same market.

The main question in analysing coordinated effects should be whether the merger materially increases the likelihood that firms in the market will successfully coordinate their behaviour or strengthen existing [[Coordination game|coordination]]. The task is to identify what factors are likely to lead to coordination taking place between firms post-merger.  This was a controversial area with which competition authorities and courts have struggled to come to terms over the years, but experience has led to the emergence of some agreement on what conditions are most likely to give rise to coordinated effects.&lt;ref&gt;International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. D.3 and D.4 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[European Union]] merger control regime, in order for coordinated effects to arise the so-called "[[Airtours]] criteria" have to be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;From the judgment of the General Court of the European Union which introduced these criteria. See Case T-342/99, Airtours v Commission, [2002] ECR II-2585.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "[[Airtours]] criteria", coordination is more likely to emerge in markets where it is relatively simple to reach a common understanding on the terms of coordination. In addition, three conditions are necessary for coordination to be sustainable. First, the coordinating firms must be able to monitor to a sufficient degree whether the terms of [[Coordination game|coordination]] are being adhered to. Second, discipline requires that there is some form of credible deterrent mechanism that can be activated if deviation is detected. Third, the reactions of outsiders, such as current and future competitors not participating in the coordination, as well as customers, should not be able to jeopardise the results expected from the [[Coordination game|coordination]].&lt;ref&gt;European Commission - Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 41 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52004XC0205(02):EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-horizontal mergers==

There are two basic forms of non-horizontal mergers: vertical mergers and conglomerate mergers.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.7 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vertical mergers''' are mergers between firms that operate at different but complementary levels in the chain of production (e.g., manufacturing and an upstream market for an input) and/or distribution (e.g., manufacturing and a downstream market for re-sale to retailers) of the same final product.  In purely vertical mergers there is no direct loss in competition as in horizontal mergers because the parties' products did not compete in the same [[relevant market]].  As such, there is no change in the level of concentration in either [[relevant market]]. Vertical mergers have significant potential to create efficiencies largely because the upstream and downstream products or services complement each other.  Even so, vertical integration may sometimes give rise to competition concerns.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. 3.7 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertical effects can produce competitive harm in the form of foreclosure. A merger is said to result in foreclosure where actual or potential rivals' access to supplies or markets is hampered or eliminated as a result of the merger, thereby reducing these companies' ability and/or incentive to compete.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 29 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:265:0006:01:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

Two forms of foreclosure can be distinguished. The first is where the merger is likely to raise the costs of downstream rivals by restricting their access to an important input (input foreclosure). The second is where the merger is likely to foreclose upstream rivals by restricting their access to a sufficient customer base (customer foreclosure).&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 30 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:265:0006:01:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it should be noted that in general vertical merger concerns are likely to arise only if market power already exists in one or more markets along the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. 3.10 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conglomerate mergers''' involve firms that operate in different [[Relevant market|product markets]], without a vertical relationship.  They may be product extension mergers, i.e., mergers between firms that produce different but related products or pure conglomerate mergers, i.e., mergers between firms operating in entirely different markets.  In practice, the focus is on mergers between companies that are active in related or neighbouring markets, e.g., mergers involving suppliers of complementary products or of products belonging to a range of products that is generally sold to the same set of customers in a manner that lessens competition.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.12 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Merger review in this area is controversial, as commentators and enforcement agencies disagree on the extent to which one can predict competitive harm resulting from such mergers.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.13 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Such a disagreement is for instance illustrated by the different outcomes of the merger control reviews by the authorities of the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] of the [[Honeywell#GE-Honeywell merger attempt|GE/Honeywell merger attempt]].

Proponents of conglomerate theories of harm argue that in a small number of cases, where the parties to the merger have strong market positions in their respective markets, potential harm may arise when the merging group is likely to foreclose other rivals from the market in a way similar to vertical mergers, particularly by means of tying and bundling their products.  When as a result of foreclosure rival companies become less effective competitors, consumer harm may result.

However, it should be stressed that in these cases there is a real risk of foregoing efficiency gains that benefits consumer welfare and thus the theory of competitive harm needs to be supported by substantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.14-3.15 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandatory and voluntary regimes==

A merger control regime is described as "mandatory" when filing of a transaction is compulsory. Mandatory regimes normally also contain a so-called "suspensory clause", which implies that the parties to a transaction are indefinitely prevented from closing the deal until they have received merger clearance. The majority of merger jurisdictions worldwide have mandatory merger control systems. An examples of a mandatory system with suspensory clause is provided by the [[European Union]] merger control.&lt;ref&gt;See Regulation of the Council (EC) No. 139/2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EU Merger Regulation) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0139:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction can also be made between "local" and "global" bars on closing/implementation; some mandatory regimes provide that the transaction cannot be implemented within the particular jurisdiction (local bar on closing) and some provide that the transaction cannot be closed/implemented anywhere in the world prior to merger clearance (global bar on closing). A number of jurisdictions worldwide have a merger control regime which imposes a global bar on closing. This creates obstacles for the parties to a concentration to close a transaction until a number of the regulatory clearances required are obtained.

A merger control regime is described as "voluntary" when the parties are not prevented from closing the deal and implementing the transaction in advance of having applied for and received merger clearance.  In these circumstances the merging parties are effectively taking the risk that the competition authority will not require them to undo the deal if in due course it is found that the transaction is likely to have an anti-competitive effect.  Voluntary regimes are fairly exceptional. The United Kingdom, for instance, has a voluntary merger control regime. However, the [[Office of Fair Trading]] can request the parties to a merger that has already completed to hold the two businesses separate pending an investigation (so called "[[initial undertakings]]").

Mandatory regimes can be considered effective in preventing anticompetitive concentrations since it is almost impossible to unravel a merger once it has been implemented (for example because key staff have been made redundant, assets have been sold and information has been exchanged). On the other hand, voluntary regimes are seen as constituting less of a burden for merging firms.

'''Metallizing''' is the general name for the technique of coating [[metal]] on the surface of objects. Metallic coatings may be decorative, protective or functional.

Techniques for metallization started as early as [[mirror]] making. In 1835, [[Justus von Liebig]] discovered the process of [[silvering|coating a glass surface with metallic silver]], making the glass mirror one of the earliest items being metallized. Plating other non-metallic objects grew rapidly with introduction of [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic. Because a non-metallic object tends to be a poor electrical [[Conductor (material)|conductor]], the object's surface must be made conductive before plating can be performed. The plastic part is first etched chemically by a suitable process, such as dipping in a hot [[chromic acid]]-[[sulfuric acid]] mixture. The etched surface is sensitised and activated by first dipping in [[tin(II) chloride]] solution, then [[palladium chloride]] solution. The processed surface is then coated with [[plating#electroless plating|electroless]] copper or nickel before further plating. This process gives useful (about 1 to 6&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram-force|kgf]]/cm or 10 to 60&amp;nbsp;[[newton (unit)|N]]/cm or 5 to 35&amp;nbsp;[[pound-force|lbf]]/in) adhesion force, but is much weaker than actual metal-to-metal adhesion strength.

'''[[Vacuum metallizing]]''' involves heating the coating metal to its boiling point in a vacuum chamber, then letting condensation deposit the metal on the substrate's surface. [[Heating element|Resistance heating]], [[electron beam]], or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] heating is used to vaporize the coating metal. Vacuum metallizing was used to deposit aluminum on the large glass mirrors of reflecting telescopes, such as with the [[Hale telescope]].

[[Thermal spray]] processes are often referred to as metallizing. Metals applied in such a manner provide corrosion protection to steel for decades longer than paint alone. Zinc and aluminum are the most commonly used materials for metallizing steel structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Protective Coatings and Linings |url=http://www.metalize.net/content/metalizing-steel-bridges-field |title=Metalizing Steel Bridges in the Field |last=Lohrey |first=Eric C. |volume=12 |issue=5 |page=39 |publisher=Steel Structures Painting Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cold sprayable metal technology is a metallizing process that seamlessly applies cold sprayable or puttyable metal to almost any surface. The composite metal consists of two (waterbased binder) or three different ingredients: metal powder, binder and hardener.

The mixture of the ingredients is cast or sprayed on the substrate at room temperature. The desired effect and the necessary final treatment define the thickness of the layer, which normally varies between 80 and 150&amp;nbsp;[[µm]].
After the spraying process the work piece should rest for approximately 60 minutes. Then the work piece is dried for 6-12 hours at a temperature of 20-60&amp;nbsp;°C. Afterwards the surface is ready for the next treatment steps.

'''Minileaks''' is a [[non-profit organization]] whose aim is to promote [[freedom of speech]] and [[civil justice]] in [[Spain]]. Inspired by the ideals of the [[2011–12 Spanish protests|2011 Spanish protests 15-M movement]], the project was founded in 2010 by journalists Eduardo Laporte and Iñigo Antolín and garnered significant attention from the Spanish and Latin American media&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.abc.es/20110704/medios-redes/abci-mini-leaks-201107040842.html Nace «MiniLeaks», una web española para destapar abusos «por pequeños que sean» - ABC.es&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.diariosur.es/rc/20110801/tecnologia/wikileaks-version-espanola-201108011602.html Wikileaks en versión española.

The collective's chief modus operandi is to publicize cases of corporate or government wrongdoing against individuals, using documentary evidence obtained by the victim to verify the reports.  Cases are submitted anonymously via email or post.

The project has been on an indeterminate hiatus since Spring 2013, although it maintains an active [[social media]] presence.

'''Noël Le Graët''' (born December 25, 1941 in [[Bourbriac]], [[Côtes-d'Armor]]) is a [[France|French]] [[businessman]], [[politician]] and football official. Since 18 June 2011 he has been the President of the [[French Football Federation]] (FFF).&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110618/sp_soccer_afp/fblfrafederationvote Yahoo News: Le Graet elected as French football chief] June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/feedarticle/9701525 The Guardian: Le Graet elected French federation president] June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[vice-president]] of the French federation from 2005 to 2011.

== FFF career  ==
He is very influential within the FFF. Between 1991 and 2000 he was President of [[Ligue 1]], the French professional league and was vice-president of FFF. In this position, he has brought - through acquisition of new sponsors, including of a new supplier contract with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] - a substantial improvement of the financial situation of the FFF. Following the resignation of its president, [[Jean-Pierre Escalettes]] because of the fiasco of the [[France national football team|French national football team]] at the [[2010 World Cup]], Noël Le Graët became as a likely candidate for interim Fernand Duchaussoy to succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxifoot.fr/football/article-10810.htm FFF: Le Graët, a new head to stop war of clans?] 22. October 2010 (French)&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, 2011 during elections of the association's federal assembly in [[Paris]], he surprisingly collected 54.39 percent of the votes to succeed Fernand Duchaussoy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=fra/news/newsid=1644552.html UEFA: Le Graët elected French FA president] June 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business &amp; Life ==
Born in a neighboring city, the [[Breton people|Breton]] has built-up in the city of [[Guingamp]] a diversified family in the food industry during the last years, the [[Le Graët Group]]. It operates on various locations in the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] region. With ''Pêcherie d'Armorique'' in [[Erquy]] it has its own [[fishing fleet]]. Among the best known [[brand]] names in France belongs [[Celtigel]] (frozen meat, fish and vegetable dishes), ''Les Delices de la Mer'' (soups, sauces, bread spreads) and ''Agil Chien/Agil Chat'' (pet food). The group's turnover in 2010 amounted to approximately 163 million [[Euro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groupelegraet.fr/1/16.aspx Le Graët Group, Numbers] retrieved June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1971 and 1992 and again between 2002 and 2011 he was president of the French Football Club [[En Avant de Guingamp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaguingamp.com/v2_finale.php?rub=organigramme EAGuingamp.com: Club organization chart] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927165757/http://www.eaguingamp.com/v2_finale.php?rub=organigramme |date=2011-09-27 }} retrieved 19.

'''Operational planning''' is the process of planning [[Strategic goal (military)|strategic goals]] and objectives to tactical goals and objectives. It describes milestones, conditions for success and explains how, or what portion of, a strategic plan will be put into operation during a given operational period, in the case of commercial application, a fiscal year or another given budgetary term. An operational plan is the basis for, and justification of an annual operating budget request. Therefore, a five-year strategic plan would typically require five operational plans funded by five operating budgets.

Operational plans should establish the activities and budgets for each part of the organization for the next 1 – 3 years. They link the strategic plan with the activities the organization will deliver and the resources required to deliver them. 

An operational plan draws directly from agency and program strategic plans to describe agency and program missions and goals, program objectives, and program activities. Like a strategic plan, an operational plan addresses four questions:
*Where are we now?
*Where do we want to be?
*How do we get there?
*How do we measure our progress?

The operations plan is both the first and the last step in preparing an operating budget request. As the first step, the operations plan provides a plan for resource allocation; as the last step, the OP may be modified to reflect policy decisions or financial changes made during the budget development process. 

Operational plans should be prepared by the people who will be involved in implementation. There is often a need for significant cross-departmental dialogue as plans created by one part of the organization inevitably have implications for other parts.

Operational plans should contain:
*clear objectives 
*activities to be delivered 
*quality standards 
*desired outcomes 
*staffing and resource requirements 
*implementation timetables 
*a process for monitoring progress

The Pallache have had connections with both Portuguese and Spanish Sephardic communities, as detailed below.

The Pallache established themselves in cities in Portugal (?), Morocco, the Netherlands, Turkey, Egypt, and other countries from the 1500s through the 1900s.  The family includes [[Chief Rabbi]]s, [[rabbi]]s, founders of [[synagogue]]s and [[beth midrash|batei midrash]], scientists, entrepreneurs, writers, and others.  Best known to date are:  Moroccan envoys and brothers [[Samuel Pallache]] (ca. 1550–1616) and [[Joseph Pallache]], at least three grand rabbis of Izmir – [[Gaon (Hebrew)|Gaon]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History==

===Inquisitions and expulsions===

[[File:Expulsion judios-en.svg|right|200px|Expulsions of Jews in Europe (1100–1600)]]

In 1480, Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] and King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] established a Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition ({{lang-es|Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisición|links=no}}), commonly known as the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (''Inquisición española'').  Its dual purpose was to maintain [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] orthodoxy in Spain while replacing the [[Medieval Inquisition]] under [[Papal]] control.  On March 31, 1492, Isabella  and Ferdinand issued the [[Alhambra Decree]] (or "Edict of Expulsion"), thereby ordering the expulsion of practicing Jews from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Kingdoms of Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], its territories, and it possessions by July 31 that year–in four months.&lt;ref name="Decree-translation"&gt;

On December 5, 1496, King [[Manuel I of Portugal|ManueI of Portugal]] decreed that all Jews must convert to Catholicism or leave the country.  Jews who converted to Christianity were known as [[New Christians]].  This initial edict of expulsion turned into an edict of forced conversion by 1497.  In 1506, the [[Lisbon Massacre]] erupted.  In 1535, Portugal launched its own [[Portuguese Inquisition|inquisition]].  Portuguese Jews fled to the Ottoman Empire (notably [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Constantinople]] and to [[Wattasid Dynasty|Morocco]]. Some went to [[Amsterdam]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Colony of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Curaçao]], and the [[Antilles]].  Some of the most famous descendants of Portuguese Jews who lived outside [[Portugal]] are the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] (from Portuguese Bento de Espinosa), and the classical economist [[David Ricardo]].  While Portugal was under control of the [[Philippine Dynasty]] of the [[House of Habsburg]] (1581–1640), the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] blended with the Spanish.

The combined Spanish-Portuguese inquisitions caused one of the largest [[Jewish diaspora|diasporas]] in [[Jewish history]].

===Iberia===

[[File:Main door of the Synagogue of Córdoba.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cordoba Synagogue]] entrance hall from prayer hall]]

(Research is currently underway to connect the Pallache more clearly back from Morocco to the Iberian Peninsula and probable ancestor, '''Samuel ben Meir Ha-Levi Abulafia''' / '''[[Samuel ha-Levi]]''' (ca. 1320–1360) of [[Cordoba, Andalusia]], which would make the Pallache family a branch of the '''[[Abulafia (surname)|Abulafia]]''' family.)

According to Professor Mercedes García-Arenal,&lt;ref&gt;

José Maria Abecassis cites historian [[Abraham ibn Daud]] of Toledo (ca. 1110–1180), who wrote:  &lt;blockquote&gt;''Segundo o historiador Abraham Ben Daud (''Sepher Ha-Qabbalah'', 69) a família Pallache já era célebre em Córdova no séc. 10. Após a expulsão de Espanha em 1492 foi para Marrocos, donde posteriormente se ramificou na Holanda, Turquia, Palestina e em Gibraltar.''&lt;br&gt;''Outras grafias: Palatio, Pallacío, Payachia. ''&lt;br&gt;''Membros desta familia prestaram serviços eminentes a Marrocos no séc. 17. Distinguiram-se como embaixadores ou enviados dos sultões na Europa, especialmente na Holanda. Estabeleceram relações diplomáticas e criaram importantes trocas comerciais com o seu país.''&lt;br&gt;''Os Palaçano viviam em Portugal antes da Expulsão.''&lt;br&gt; According to the historian Abraham Ben Daud (''Sepher Ha-Qabbalah'', 69) the Pallache family was already famous in Cordoba in the 10th century. After expulsion from Spain in 1492, they went to Morocco, where later they branched out to Holland, Turkey, Palestine, and Gibraltar.&lt;br&gt; Other spellings: Palatio, Pallacío, Payachia.&lt;br&gt; Members of this family provided eminent services to Morocco in the 17th century. They distinguished themselves as ambassadors or envoys of the Sultans in Europe, especially in Holland. They established diplomatic relations and created important trade with their country.&lt;br&gt;The Palaçano lived in Portugal before the Expulsion.&lt;ref name= Abecassis&gt;

===Portugal===

At present, it is unclear as to whether members of the Pallache family went first to Portugal after Spain.  However, new findings show that their intermarriage started earlier than supposed in ''A Man in Three Worlds'' (see "Netherlands," below).

===Morocco===

[[File:Jüdische Hochzeit in Marokko-1024.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jewish Wedding in Morocco by [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]]]     Jewish presence in Morocco goes back to [[Carthage]], fared moderately, and often prospered under Muslim rule (e.g., the [[Marinid dynasty]]).  From Morocco, they filtered into [[Al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain, 711–1492) but began to return during the [[Spanish Reconquista]], which mounted in the 10th Century.  The Spanish-Portuguese expulsions and inquisitions sent floods of Jews back to Morocco on a larger scale.  Resultant overcrowding in Moroccan cities led to tension, fires, and famines in Jewish quarters.

Moïse Al Palas (also Moses al-Palas&lt;ref name=Pallache-Moroccan /&gt;) (???–1535), born in Marrakesh, was a rabbi who moved to [[Tetuán]] and lived for a time in [[Salonica]], then in the Ottoman Empire.  Before dying in [[Venice]], he published ''Va-Yakhel Moshe'' (1597) and ''Ho'il Moshe'' (1597), and an autobiography.&lt;ref name=Pallache-Moroccan /&gt;&lt;ref name=JVL-Palache /&gt;&lt;ref name=Patronymes&gt;

Isaac Pallache was a rabbi in [[Fez, Morocco]], first mentioned in ''[[takkanot]]'' (Jewish community statutes) in 1588.  His sons were '''Samuel Pallache''' (ca. 1550–1616) and '''Joseph Pallache'''.  Isaac was married to a sister of Fez's grand rabbi, [[Judah Uziel]]; his nephew [[Isaac Uziel]] became a rabbi of the Neve Shalom community in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

===Netherlands===

[[File:Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael - The Jewish Cemetery - WGA20486.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[The Jewish Cemetery]]'' by [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], where [[Samuel Pallache]], his brother, and descendants lie buried]]  Jews began to settle in the Netherlands only at the end of the 16th Century.  Thanks to its own recent (1581) independence from Spanish control, the [[Dutch Republic]] attracted [[Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands]] as a refuge from a common enemy, Spain.

After an unsuccessful attempt to return to Spain in the mid-1600s, Samuel and Joseph Pallache settled a new branch of the Pallache family in the Netherlands by 1608.  There, they represented their benefactor, [[Zidan al-Nasir]] of Morocco, as well as the Dutch government, in complex negotiations with Morocco, the Netherlands, Spain, France, England, the Ottoman Empire, and other European states – often on behalf of more than one sponsoring state and (as stateless Jews) on their own behalf.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

The sons of both brothers continued in their fathers's footsteps, some remaining in the Netherlands (e.g., David Pallache), others returning to Morocco (e.g., Moses Pallache).

In the Netherlands, the surname solidified as "Palache" (a spelling variation which started in the 16th Century), and the family continues as Palache in the Netherlands to the present.  In recent times, prominent members have included grand rabbi '''[[Isaac Juda Palache]]''' (1858-1927) and his son, Professor '''[[Juda Lion Palache]]''' (1887-1944).

''A Man in Three Worlds'' did not find intermarriage between the Pallache brothers or sons and members of the Portuguese Sephardic community in the Netherlands.  In fact, it documents the contrary, e.g., that sons Isaac and Joshuae did not go make such marriages.  "It seems significant that no male member of the Pallache family ever married a woman from the Portuguese community...  it is surely significant that neither Samuel nor any of his heirs were ever to marry into the great trading families of 'the Portuguese nation'."&lt;ref name=three /&gt;  In September 2016, however, two 1643 marriage certificates were discovered for [[David Pallache]] (1598–1650&lt;ref name=David-Record&gt;

===Turkey===

[[File:Abraham palagi.jpg |thumb|right|200px|[[Abraham Palacci]]]]      [[Romaniotes|Jewis]] have lived in Asia Minor (Turkey) since the 5th Century BCE.  The [[Ottoman Empire]] welcomed Sephardic Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula.  (Today, the majority of [[Turkish Jews in Israel|Turkish Jews live in Israel]], while modern-day Turkey continues to host a modest Jewish population.)

The first reported Pallache in Turkey (then, the Ottoman Empire) dates to 1695, when Isaac Pallache of Leghorn ([[Livorno]], Italy) wrote a letter to the Dutch consul in Smyrna (1695)&lt;ref name=three /&gt;&lt;ref name=Patronymes /&gt;  Currently, it is unknown whether the Pallache settled first in Istanbul or Izmir.

The Pallache appear in Izmir (then, "Smyrna") no later than the time of rabbi Jacob Pallache, who married the daughter of a previous grand rabbi '''[[Joseph ben Hayyim Hazan|Joseph Raphael ben Hayyim]] [[Hazzan (surname)|Hazzan]]'''.&lt;ref name=HazanGen&gt;

According to the ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World'':  &lt;blockquote&gt;The Pallache... produced several leading rabbinical scholars in the Ottoman city of Izmir (Smyrna) during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Two of them, Hayyim ben Jacob and his sone Abraham, served as chief rabbi (''hakham bashi'') and became the focus of a fierce dispute that engulfed the town's Jewish community, while a third, Soloman ben Abraham, contributed to its decline.&lt;ref name=Pallache-Turkish /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Pallache continued in Turkey past the 1922 [[great fire of Smyrna]]; some left during Allied evacuation during World War II and died during the Holocaust (see below).&lt;ref name=Deported&gt;

===Egypt===

[[File:Demonstration in Egypt in 1919 (Crescent, the Cross and Star of David).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|Demonstration in Egypt in 1919]]]]   The [[Torah]] documents a long history of Jews in Egypt.  Jews lived quietly under the Romans until the advent of Christianity (e.g., Emperor [[Heraclius I]] and [[Patriarch Cyrus of Alexandria]]).  After the [[Arab conquest]], Jews survived reasonably well under the [[Tulunids]] (863–905), the [[Fatimids]] (969–1169), and the [[Ayyubids]] (1174–1250) during whose rule [[Maimonides]] lived.  Under the [[Bahri Mamluks]] (1250–1390), Jews began to feel less secure and less so under the [[Burji dynasty|Burji Mamluks]] (1390–1517).  The [[Ottomans]] (1517–1922) took more active interest in the Jewish community and made substantial changes in their governance.  [[Shabbatai Zvi]] visited Cairo, where his movement continued under [[Abraham Miguel Cardozo]], physician to the pasha Kara Mohammed.  Following the [[Damascus Affair]], [[Moses Montefiore]], [[Adolphe Crémieux]], and [[Salomon Munk]] visited Egypt in 1840 and helped found schools with Rabbi [[Moses Joseph Algazi]].

It was a period of rapid change in Egypt.  As of 1867, the government began changing from ''pasha'' to ''[[Khedivate of Egypt|khedive]]'', to ''[[Sultanate of Egypt|sultan]]'' and threw off Ottoman [[suzerainty]].  It also saw the building of the [[Suez Canal]].  Political unrest exploded after World War I, led by [[Saad Zaghlul]] and the [[Wafd Party]]) and culminating in the [[Egyptian revolution of 1919]] and the issue by the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916–1922)|UK government]] (colonial controllers in the 1800s) of a [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|unilateral declaration of Egyptian independence]] on February 22, 1922..  (See [[History of Egypt under the British]].)  The [[Kingdom of Egypt|new Egyptian government]] drafted and implemented a [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] in 1923 based on a [[parliamentary system]]. In 1924, Zaghlul became [[Prime Minister of Egypt]]. In 1936, Egypt concluded a new [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|treaty]] with the UK. In 1952, the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] of the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]] forced King [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] to abdicate in support of his son [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad]], secured a British promise of withdrawal by 1954–1956, and led to the accession of Egypt's first modern president [[Gamal Abdel-Nasser]].

No later than the close of the 19th Century, a branch of the Pallache family had settled in Egypt, with some remaining in Cairo into the 1950s.

Which members of the family had what foreign citizenship is as yet undetermined, e.g., Spanish under the Decree-Law of 29 December 1948 (''Decreto-Ley de 29 de Deciembre de 1948'') to extend Spanish protection for Sephardic Jews in Greece and Egypt:  &lt;blockquote&gt;'' '''DECRETO-LEY de 29 de diciembre de 1948 por el que se reconoce la condición de súbditos españoles en 1. extranjero a determinados sefardies protegidos de España:'''   Por Canje de Notas efectuado por España con Egipto el dieciséis y diecisiete de enero de mil novecientos treinta y cinco, y con Grecia el siete de abril de mil novecientos treinta y seis, se convino que España continuarla otorgando su patrocinio y documentando, en consecuencia, a una serie de familias sefardies que, desde tiempos del imperIo ottoman, gozaban en aquellos territorios de tal gracia; y a dicho efecto, y como anejo a las referidas Notas, se establecireron unas listas, cuidadosamente seleccionadas, de esos beneficiarios, cuya futura condición de súbditos españoles se preveía en aquellas Notas...''&lt;br&gt;

As community leaders, the Palacci supported Jewish causes inside and outside Egypt.  In 1907, Vita Palacci was serving as president of ''la société de bienfaisence a "Hachemia"'':  &lt;blockquote&gt;''En 1901, fut fondée au Caire une société de bienfaisance israélite dénommée "Hachemia."

Pendant le dernier exercice, Hachemia a donne des soins médicaux à 1.000 malades furent visites à raison d'une piastre (0 fr. 25) par visite, sans compter les malades seignés à son compete dans divers hôpitaux du Caire et d'Alexandrie...&lt;br&gt;  L'année dernière, le baron [[Edmond de Rothschild]], lors de son dernier séjour au Cairo, fit a cette société un don de 3.000 fr.

Vita Palacci, le distingué chef de l'importante maison du commerce Palacci fils, Haim et Cie, qui est bien connue en Egypte et au Soudain, en est le president actif et dévoué.  Parmi ses collaborateurs, citons de Dr. Beneroya, le directeur du journal "La Vara"; M.

This institution, which is a charitable organization for Turkish [Ottoman] Jews residing in Egypt, is making positive advances. Since the last fiscal year, Hachemia has provided medical care to a thousand visiting patients at the rate of one piaster (0.25 French francs) per visit, not including patients cared for and covered by Hachemia in several hospitals in Cairo and Alexandria...&lt;br&gt;Last year, Baron Edmond de Rothschild, during his last visit to Cairo, donated 3,000 francs. In 1901, Baroness de Rothschild made a gift in the same amount.&lt;br&gt;The committee leadership of Hachemia is composed of prominent people of Cairo. Mr. Vita Palacci, the distinguished head of the major commercial house Palacci Sons, Haim and Co., well known in Egypt and in Sudan, is the current and committed president of Hachemia. Among the other members of the leadership are: Dr. Beneroya, the editor of the newspaper "La Vara"; Mr. Talvi, an engineer at the Ministry of Public Works, etc.; Dr. Amster, doctor administering health services; and Dr. Isaac J. Levy of Alexandria, doctor at the Jewish Community Menascé Hospital, of Anti-Tuberculosis League, and the Alexandria Municipality.

After World War I, participation of the ''[[Force Publique]]'' in the East African campaign resulted in a [[League of Nations]] mandate over the previously German colony of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] to Belgium as Belgian Congo (read more at "[[Belgian Congo]]").

In the mid-1940s, Henri Palacci, son of Menahem, son of Aaron (Henri) Palacci, founded "La Coupole" store in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (then Leopoldville, [[Belgian Congo]]), as documented in

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Les commerçants juifs ont contribué à l'émancipation des "indigènes," en les initiant aux produits manufacturés.  Ainsi, les boutiques "Au Chic" du Groupe Hasson et "La Coupole" d’Henri Palacci, ouverts, à Léopoldville, vers 1946, vendent à tous et refusent toute forme de discrimination raciale. Leurs rapports quotidiens avec les colonisés distinguaient les Juifs des autres Blancs. Et lors des évènements tragiques de 1960, aucun Juif ne fut molesté par la foule en colère.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jewish merchants contributed to the empowerment of "indigenous" people by introducing them to manufactured goods.  The shops "Au Chic" (Hasson Group)  and "La Coupole" (Henry Palacci), opened in Leopoldville, around 1946, selling to all and refusing any form of racial discrimination.  Daily contact with colonized Jews differed from other Whites.  And during the tragic events of 1960, no Jew was molested by mobs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  (See "[[Congo Crisis]]" for more on the emergence of the DR Congo.&lt;ref&gt;

Continued expulsions and diaspora have dispersed the Pallache family to many countries in the Americas, Europe, and farther afield.

By the 20th Century, the Pallache had established and the United States.  The family of noted American mineralogist '''[[Charles Palache]]''' (1869–1954) came to California from Jamaica.&lt;ref name=NAS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;

===Turkey===
Around 1840, the Pallache home in Smyrna became today's Beth Hillel Synagogue (Turkish ''Bet-Ilel Sinagogu'') and seat of a yeshiva or beit madras.  The synagogue lies in the [[Kemeraltı]] marketplace district in Izmir and is named after Haim or Abraham Palacci.  Professor [[Stanford J. Shaw]] stated it was Haim who founded the ''Beth Hillel Palacci''.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;

According to Jewish Izmir Heritage, "In the 19th century, Rabbi Avraham Palache founded in his home a synagogue named Beit Hillel, after the philanthropist from Bucharest who supported the publication of Rabbi Palache's books.  However, the name 'Avraham Palache Synagogue' was also used by the community."&lt;ref&gt;

"The building had been used as a synagogue and a ''[[Beth midrash|Beit Midrash]]''. The synagogue has not been used since 1960's."    It concludes, "The synagogue was founded by the Palaggi family and is therefore very important."&lt;ref name=BeitHillel&gt;

Journey into Jewish Heritage states that Haim Palacci founded the ''Beit Hillel [[Yeshiva]]'' in Izmir in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=book-collection&gt;

===Israel===

A seminary was named in Haim Palachi's honor in [[Bnei Brak]], Israel.&lt;ref name=Pallache-Turkish /&gt;

==Writings==
* Haim Palachi – of 82 publications, 36 (as of September 2016) are listed under: [[Haim Palachi]]
* Many other rabbinical works by other Palache rabbis, including:  [[Abraham Palacci]], [[Rahamim Nissim Palacci]], and [[Joseph Palacci]]
* [[Colette Rossant|Colette (Palacci) Rossant]]:  ''Apricots on the Nile'' (1999, 2004)&lt;ref name=Apricots /&gt;
* [[Eddy Palacci]]:  ''Des étoiles par cœur'' (2012)&lt;ref name=Etoiles /&gt;

==Documented spellings of surname==

As the Pallache settled in new cities with new languages, spellings of the surname changed.  Oftentimes, changes occurred via officialdom.  In the 19th Century, for example, American officials at [[Ellis Island]] would shorten, simplify, or change altogether the spellings of foreigners upon arrival.  In the 20th Century, Turkish officials forced all nationals to adopt surnames under the 1934 [[Surname Law]].

Variations on the Pallache name appear on both Spanish and Portuguese lists of Sephardic names.  For instance, "Palacci" is listed as Spanish Sephardic,&lt;ref&gt;

==Family tree==

The approach that the outline below follows is:  1) use [[Moïse Rahmani]]'s essay "Les Patronymes: une histoire de nom ou histoire tout court" as a base, 2) add findings from the penultimate chapter of García-Arenal and Wiegers's ''A Man of Three Worlds: Samuel Pallache, a Moroccan Jew in Catholic and Protestant Europe'' (1999, 2007), and 3) add further information – all with citations.  The index developed for Abraham Galante's ''Jews of Turkey'' is another major source for the Izmir branch of the family.

      <comment>Removed external link to an archive of "Recent Proxy Statements" published by the SEC. This link takes the user to an archive of 2009 proxy statements and surfing the URL screenshots to more recent archives only go through 2012. These screenshot archives are therefore irrelevant and certainly not "recent." Perhaps a new web URL now houses recent proxy statements.</comment>

A '''proxy statement''' is a statement required of a firm when soliciting shareholder votes. This statement is filed in advance of the annual meeting. The firm needs to file a proxy statement, otherwise known as a Form DEF 14A (Definitive Proxy Statement), with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].  This statement is useful in assessing how management is paid and potential conflict-of-interest issues with auditors.  The statement includes:
* Voting procedure and information.
* Background information about the company's nominated directors including relevant history in the company or industry, positions on other corporate boards, and potential conflicts in interest.
* Board compensation.
* Executive compensation, including salary, bonus, non-equity compensation, stock awards, options, and [[deferred compensation]]. Also, information is included about perks such as personal use of company aircraft, travel, and tax gross-ups. Many companies will also include pre-determined payout packages for if an executive leaves the company.
* Who is on the audit committee, as well as a breakdown of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor.

SEC proxy rules: The term "proxy statement" means the statement required by Section 240.14a-3(a) whether or not contained in a single document.

In many cases, shareholder votes—particularly institutional shareholder votes—are determined by [[proxy firm]]s which advise the shareholders...

Traditionally, [[broker-dealer]]s have been permitted to vote for "routine" proposals on behalf of their shareholders if the shareholders do not return the proxy statement. This has been controversial, and in 2006 the NYSE Proxy Working Group recommended that the rules be modified so that uncontested director elections were not considered routine.&lt;ref&gt;NYSE Working Group. (June 5, 2006). [https://www.nyse.com/pdfs/REVISED_NYSE_Report_6_5_06.pdf REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PROXY WORKING GROUP TO THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE].&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC approved the rule on July 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyse/2009/34-60215.pdf Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, as modified by Amendment No. 4, to Amend NYSE Rule 452 and Corresponding Listed Company Manual Section 402.08 to Eliminate Broker Discretionary Voting for the Election of Directors, Except for Companies Registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and to Codify Two Previously Published Interpretations that Do Not Permit Broker Discretionary Voting for Material Amendments to Investment Advisory Contracts with an Investment Company]. Release No. 34-60215; File No. SR-NYSE-2006-92. Discussed by the NY Times Dealbook at: [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/sec-split-on-broker-voting-change/ Curbs on Broker Voting Are Approved].&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the SEC announced that it was seeking public comment on the efficiency of the proxy system.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-122.htm SEC Votes to Seek Public Comment on U.S. Proxy System].&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some controversy over "proxy access" which is a method to allow shareholders to nominate candidates which appear on the proxy statement. Currently, only the nominating board can place candidates on the proxy statement. The United States [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] specifically allowed the SEC to rule on this issue. In 2010, the SEC passed a rule which allowed certain shareholders to place candidates on the proxy statement;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-155.htm SEC Adopts New Measures to Facilitate Director Nominations by Shareholders].&lt;/ref&gt; however, the rule was struck down by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120403125211/http://corpgov.proxyexchange.org/2011/07/what-would-proxy-access-look-like-if-done-right/ What Would Proxy Access Look Like if Done Right?].

'''Purna Kaji Tamrakar''' ([[Devanagari]]: पूर्णकाजी ताम्रकार) (1920 - 2009) was a Nepalese merchant, author and journalist who worked to develop [[Nepal Bhasa]] during difficult times when writers were being persecuted by the government.&lt;ref name="Kayastha2009"&gt;{{cite news|last= Kayastha|first= Chhatra Bahadur|title= Bhasa Thuwa Purna Kaji Tamrakar Lumanka|url= |accessdate=|newspaper=Thaunkanhe|date=April 2009}} Pages 60-67.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

[[Tamrakar]] was born at [[Maru, Kathmandu]] to father Jagat Muni and mother Pun Laxmi Tamrakar. The neighborhood lies at the western edge of [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]]. Tamrakar's ancestral home stands near a large [[stupa]] and is known as Tagwah Chibha meaning "large stupa". He attended high school in [[Kolkata]], India and returned to Kathmandu and married Hira Devi.

==Career==

Tamrakar was a [[Lhasa Newar (trans-Himalayan traders)|Lhasa trader]]. In 1940, he went to [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]] and joined his maternal uncle's business house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/26487/2/Nepal_cat.pdf&amp;ei=n8eCT5LqMcXZrQeatOHRBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC0Q7gEwAjge&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dpurna%2Bkaji%2Btamrakar%26start%3D30%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN%26prmdo%3D1%26biw%3D1015%26bih%3D575%26prmd%3Dimvnso| title =Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School of Arts and Graduate School of Regional| work = | publisher =| date=31 March 2007| accessdate = 9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamrakar engaged in business, and also served as secretary of the [[Nepalese Chamber of Commerce, Lhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Tuladhar|first= Kamal Ratna|title= Pioneers on the Roof of the World|url= |accessdate=|newspaper=Matina|date=August 2009}} {{BLCAT|ZK.9.b.25686}}. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Lhasa, he came into contact with another Nepalese merchant [[Pushpa Ratna Sagar]], and was inspired to write and serve his mother tongue. His first article was published in ''[[Dharmodaya]]'' magazine in 1948. Tamrakar returned to Kathmandu in 1948. 

Restrictions on publication in Nepal Bhasa were removed after the [[Rana dynasty]] was overthrown and democracy established in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://npi10month.blogspot.com/2010/02/history-of-nepali-journalism.html| title =History of Nepali Journalism| work = | publisher =Nepal Press Institute| date=15 February 2010| accessdate = 9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Tamrakar, Sagar and another merchant Ratna Man Singh [[Tuladhar]] started a monthly magazine named ''[[Thaunkanhe]]'' (थौंकन्हे) with the money donated by Nepalese traders in Lhasa. The three partners were editor, deputy editor and publisher respectively. It was the first magazine in Nepal Bhasa to be published from Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Malla, Kamal Prakash (ed.) (1967). ''Nahli Swana.'' Kathmandu: Chwasa Pasa. Page 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamrakar was editor of ''Thaunkanhe'' from 1951 to 1957.

==Printing press==

In 1952, the three partners established their own printing press named Nepal Press in a bid to promote publishing in Nepal Bhasa. It was located at 11/122 Asan Tyouda Tol, Kathmandu. They also set up Thaunkanhe Publications Division which published a number of books.  

Meanwhile, Tamrakar acquired a BA degree (Sahitya Ratna) from Nepal Rastriya Vidyapeeth, [[Birgunj]] in 1953. He was among the first batch of four students.&lt;ref name="Kayastha2009" /&gt;

Besides writing, Tamrakar was involved in Buddhist activities, and was elected assistant secretary of Dharmodaya Sabha in 1956 when it held the landmark fourth international conference of the [[World Fellowship of Buddhists]] in Kathmandu. Dharmodaya Sabha is a Buddhist organization formed in 1944 in [[Sarnath]], India by Buddhist monks expelled from Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.dharmodaya.org/history.htm| title =History of Dharmodaya Sabha| work = | publisher =| date=2011| accessdate = 10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Tamrakar and Sagar sold their shares in Nepal Press to Tuladhar, and it was shifted to New Road. Tamrakar continued writing and published six books on culture, literature, historical sites and his experiences in Tibet. He also served as editor of ''Nepal Ritu Pau'', a literary quarterly. From 2000 to 2005, he was president of Nepal Bhasa Parisad (Nepal Bhasa Council).&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (2002). ''Mimmanahpau: letter from a Lhasa merchant to his wife.''

==Honors==

In 2004, the Nepal Bhasha Academy awarded Tamrakar the Danyahira Sirpa Award for literature for his outstanding service and contribution in the field of Nepal Bhasha and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.nepalbhashaacademy.org.np/awards.htm| title =Danyahira Sirpa Award| work = | publisher =Nepal Bhasha Academy| date=| accessdate = 9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal Bhasa Parisad declared him a Bhasa Thuwa ("patron of the language") in 2009.&lt;ref name="Kayastha2009" /&gt;

'''Salomon Isacovici''' (1924 in [[Sighetu Marmaţiei]], [[Romania]] – 1998) was a [[Jew]]ish [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] [[List of Holocaust survivors|survivor]] who became a writer and businessman in [[Ecuador]]. Born in [[Romania]], he moved to [[Ecuador]] following [[World War II]], and co-authored with [[Juan Manuel Rodriguez (writer)|Juan Manuel Rodriguez]] the book ''Man of Ashes''.

==Personal life==
Isacovici grew up in [[Sighetu Marmaţiei]] on his parents' farm.&lt;ref name=stavans/&gt;   In 1944 he was interned at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], is both the [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Auschwitz I|Auschwitz I]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Auschwitz II-Birkenau|Auschwitz II-Birkenau]] camps. He escaped during a massacre, was shot, recaptured and sent to the [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="MoA99"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtH4Dxdt_WkC&amp;pg=PP13| title=Man of Ashes|first1=Salomon|last1=Isacovici|first2= Juan Manuel|last2=Rodriguez|authorlink2=Juan Manuel Rodriguez (writer)|others=trans. by Dick Gerde |year=1999 |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |location=[[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] |isbn= 978-0-8032-2501-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|preface}} He remained there until [[United States Army|U.S. soldiers]] liberated the camp.

At the end of the war, he returned to his original home only to find another family in residence.&lt;ref name="MoA99" /&gt; He joined a [[Zionist]] group and considered emigrating to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. Instead, in 1948, he followed his sweetheart to [[Ecuador]],&lt;ref name=stavans/&gt; and beginning with menial jobs, rose to become a successful businessman.&lt;ref name=stavans/&gt; He was deeply concerned that the treatment of [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|Ecuadorian indigenous peoples]] by the Spanish was comparable to those in the concentration camps of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=stavans/&gt;

==''Man of Ashes''==
A book co-authored by Isacovici and [[Juan Manuel Rodriguez (writer)|Juan Manuel Rodriguez]] was published in [[Mexico]] in 1990 as ''A7393: Hombre de Cenizas''.&lt;ref name="MoA90"&gt;{{cite book|title=A7393: Hombre de Cenizas|first1= Salomon |last1= Isacovici |first2=Juan Manuel|last2=Rodríguez|year=1990|isbn= 978-968-13-2085-0|publisher=Editorial Diana|location=Mexico|language=Spanish|authorlink2=Juan Manuel Rodriguez (writer)|oclc=27333907|trans-title=A7393: Man of Ashes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book recounted Isacovici's youth in Romania, his years in [[Nazi Germany]], and his eventual emigration to Ecuador. It was described by its publisher as a "cruel and truthful testimony of the Nazi concentration camps".&lt;ref name=stavans/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ozick&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Wiesel|editor1-first=Elie|editor2-last=Katz|editor2-first=Steven T.|editor3-last=Rosen|editor3-first=Alan |title=Obliged By Memory: Literature, Religion, Ethics: A Collection Of Essays Honoring Elie Wiesel's Seventieth Birthday|last=Ozick|first=Cynthia|authorlink=Cynthia Ozick|chapter=Rights of History and Rights of Imagination |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|location=Syracuse |year=2006 |pages=8–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f721SBeYxbUC&amp;pg=PA8 |isbn=0-8156-3064-6 |accessdate= 27 December 2009|editor1-link=Elie Wiesel|editor2-link=Steven T. Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was awarded the Fernando Jeno literary prize by Mexico's Jewish community in 1991.&lt;ref name=stavans/&gt;

In 1995, the [[University of Nebraska Press]] planned to an English-language version, with a translation by Dick Gerdes, a professor at [[George Mason University]] in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=stavans/&gt;&lt;ref name="MoA99" /&gt; The university press described the book as important to Holocaust studies as a rare account of a Romanian and Latin American Jew.&lt;ref name="db"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2206">A '''semantic layer''' is a business representation of corporate [[data]] that helps [[end user]]s access data autonomously using common business terms. A semantic layer maps complex data into familiar business terms such as product, customer, or revenue to offer a unified, consolidated view of data across the organization.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = On May 29, 1992, [[Business Objects]] obtained U.S. Patent 5,555,403, which "provides a new data representation and a query technique which allows information system end users to access (query) relational databases without knowing the relational structure or the structure query language (SQL)".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/patents/US5555403&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, some competitors like [[Cognos]] paid licensing fees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getfilings.com/o0001194396-03-000047.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2003, [[Microstrategy]] successfully defended a brought suit by Business Objects alleging patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theengineer.co.uk/court-dismisses-patent-infringement-suit/&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
By using common business terms, rather than data language, to access, manipulate, and organize information, a semantic layer simplifies the complexity of business data. Business terms are stored as objects in a semantic layer, which are accessed through business views.

The semantic layer enables business users to have a common "[[look and feel]]" when accessing and analyzing data stored in relational databases and [[OLAP cube]]s. This is claimed to be core [[business intelligence technology|business intelligence]] (BI) technology that frees users from IT while ensuring correct results.

Business Views is a multi-tier system that is designed to enable companies to build comprehensive and specific [[business object]]s that help report designers and end users access the information they require. Business Views is intended to enable people to add the necessary business context to their [[data island]]s and link them into a single organized Business View for their organization.

Semantic layer maps tables to classes and rows to objects.

==Biography==
Born in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]] province, on [[Christmas Day]] 1949, Tanoto is the oldest of seven boys.&lt;ref name="teo"/&gt; His father was an immigrant from [[Putian]] city in [[China]]'s [[Fujian]] province. In 1966, Tanoto's education was abruptly interrupted after Chinese schools were shut down by then-President [[Suharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|new regime]]. He was prohibited from attending national schools due to his parents' Chinese citizenship.&lt;ref name="teo"/&gt;

When his father suffered a stroke, Tanoto was left to run the family business. He gradually moved beyond basic trading to winning contracts in building gas pipelines for multinationals. During the 1972 oil crisis that increased prices dramatically, Tanoto took advantage of clients rapidly expanding their operations. With this injection of capital, Tanoto turned his attention to another business in 1973, noticing that Indonesia exported raw logs for conversion into plywood in countries like Japan or Taiwan, before importing the finished plywood back to Indonesia at great cost.&lt;ref name="teo"/&gt;

Tanoto recognized an opportunity to develop his own plywood mill in Indonesia. However, he required a permit to do so. Under the Suharto regime, permits were sought from politicians who often served as [[Armed Forces of Indonesia|army]] generals. Tanoto was forced to work with a general who gave his blessing and was quickly convinced of the mill's potential after seeing the completed factory, with Tanoto citing the potential value-add to Indonesia's economy and the creation of new jobs. The plant began operations in 1975 after being inaugurated by Suharto.&lt;ref name="teo"/&gt; Slowly, from the plywood business, his company branched out into palm oil as well as pulp and paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/14/hard-work-the-key-for-the-family-behind-singapore-based-resources-giant-rge.html|title=CNBC Lasting Legacy: Hard work the key for the family behind Singapore-based resources giant RGE|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanoto is a self-educated entrepreneur but regretted his interrupted education. He learned English word-for-word using a Chinese-English dictionary and finally attended business school in Jakarta in the mid-1970s. He also undertook further studies at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France.&lt;ref name="teo"/&gt;

In 1997, Tanoto elected to settle in [[Singapore]] with his family, establishing his company's headquarters there.&lt;ref name="FortuneIndonesia"/&gt;

Three of his children are active within RGE and its businesses. His son, [[Anderson Tanoto|Anderson,]] is an RGE director.&lt;ref name="Scion"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-indonesian-scion-grapples-with-his-familys-past-1445903371|title=An Indonesian Scion Grapples with His Family's Past|journal=Wall Street Journal|date=2015-10-26|last1=Fong|first1=Dominique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Higher Interest Rates Lower Expectations in Emerging Economies"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/22/business/international/indonesia-economy-interest-rates.html?_r=0|title=Higher Interest Rates Lower Expectations in Emerging Economies|journal=The New York Times|date=2015-12-21|access-date=|last1=Gough|first1=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; His eldest daughter Imelda is a member of the RGE executive committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whartonmagazine.com/issues/fall-winter-2017/the-business-family-imelda-tanoto-belinda-tanoto-anderson-tanoto/#sthash.BSUZiiH7.dpbs|title=Wharton Magazine - The Business Family: Imelda Tanoto W04 &amp; Belinda Tanoto C06 W06 &amp; Anderson Tanoto W11|last=|first=|date=2017-10-12|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his younger daughter [[Belinda Tanoto|Belinda]] dedicates most of her time to the family's philanthropic arm, [[Tanoto Foundation]].

==Business activities==

Tanoto's business interests are represented by [[Royal Golden Eagle|the Royal Golden Eagle (RGE)]], a global resource-based group of companies with manufacturing operations in Indonesia, China, Brazil, Canada and Europe, and sales offices worldwide. Since Sukanto Tanoto started his entrepreneurial journey in 1967, the business has grown considerably, with a workforce of over 60,000 people and its assets exceeding US$18 billion.&lt;ref name="scmp.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/presented/news/hong-kong/education/topics/hkust-biz-school-magazine/article/2115113/outward-looking|title=South China Morning Post: The Outward-looking Family Philanthropy|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013025434/http://www.scmp.com/presented/news/hong-kong/education/topics/hkust-biz-school-magazine/article/2115113/outward-looking|archive-date=2017-10-13|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business has five key operational areas: pulp and paper ([[Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings]] or APRIL, Asia Symbol), agro-industry ([[Asian Agri]]), specialty cellulose ([[Bracell Limited]]) and viscose fibre ([[Sateri]]) and energy resources development [http://www.po-and-g.com/ (Pacific Oil &amp; Gas)]. APRIL has been involved in conservation controversies related to the use of native Sumatran growth forests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2011/s3283804.htm|title=Paper/Tiger|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=ABC Foreign Correspondent|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the company withdrawing from the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] in April 2010. In September 2011, [[Fuji Xerox]] ceased selling paper manufactured by APRIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=Fuji Xerox | title=Fuji Xerox ceases procurement from Asia Pacific Resources International Limited (APRIL)| url=http://www.fujixerox.com/eng/company/ecology/topics/2011/0901_april.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has denied the claims, stating it has a commitment to implement practices that mitigate climate change and promote sustainability.&lt;ref name="business2"&gt;{{cite web|date=November 2011|title=APRIL's commitment to being part  of the "sustainability solution"| url=http://www.aprilasia.com/images/pdfs/APRIL%27s%20commitment%20to%20being%20part%20of%20the%20sustainability%20solution%20-%20by%20AJ%20Devanesan,%20COO%20APRIL.pdf|publisher=|language=|last=Devanesan|first=A.J.|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in June 2015, APRIL pledged to eliminate deforestation from its entire supply chain.

== Philanthropic activities ==
Tanoto and his wife, Tinah Bingei Tanoto, began their philanthropic work in 1981 in Indonesia with the opening of a kindergarten in Besitang.&lt;ref name="scmp.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commitment To A Cause: The Continuing Evolution Of The Tanoto Foundation |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanotofoundation/2018/11/06/commitment-to-a-cause-the-continuing-evolution-of-the-tanoto-foundation/ |website=Forbes |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formally established the [[Tanoto Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tanotofoundation.org/sukanto-tanoto|title=Tanoto Foundation Founder: Sukanto Tanoto|last=|first=|date=2015-09-08|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001. Its numerous educational initiatives have included the funding of teacher training and the provision of over 700 scholarships a year. The Foundation also delivers basic amenities such as clean water and sanitation, as well as healthcare. Through the provision of access to productive assets, startup capital, technical skills and links to markets, it helps to empower families and deliver sustainable livelihood.&lt;ref name="scmp.com"/&gt;

Tanoto recognized the importance of establishing strong [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) programs in the [[Riau]] province.&lt;ref name="teo" /&gt; Through [[Riau Andalan Pulp &amp; Paper]] (RAPP), Tanoto built schools and established farming systems that teach villagers an alternative cultivation to [[slash-and-burn]] techniques, as well making regular sustainability reports to [[NGO]]s, such as the [[World Wildlife Fund]] after the organization expressed concerns over the conservation of forests in Riau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=The Jakarta Post| title=Pulp mills put heavy pressure on forests: Study | url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20020209.J04 |date=2002-02-09 |accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071117043333/http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20020209.J04 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reach of Tanoto Foundation's activities now extends to China, Hong Kong and Singapore and the US. It has provided more than 20,000 scholarships, built several schools and educational facilities that produced 27,000 graduates, developed 60,000 hectares of community livelihood plantations and created more than 1,800 jobs in local communities through Small-and-Medium-size Enterprise (SME) programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ust.hk/about-hkust/media-relations/press-releases/bizinsighthkust-forum-examines-future-chinese-family-businesses/#|title=BizInsight@HKUST Forum  Examines the Future of Chinese Family Businesses|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Thehundredyearlie cover.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Hundred Year Lie'', hardback edition]]
'''''The Hundred Year Lie: How Food And Medicine Are Destroying Your Health''''' (2006) is a book by [[investigative journalist]] [[Randall Fitzgerald]] that examines the rise of the local and global influence of the United States [[Food industry|food]] and [[Chemical industry|chemical]] industries, and argues that they have, over the last century, altered, affected and damaged the lives of millions of people in the United States by introducing synthetic chemicals into the mainstream food chain.

==Summary==

The book covers a wide range of topics related to the central issue. It starts by describing the myths that the public believes, that toxicity health issues are 'someone else's problem', and then goes on to talk about what is known to the scientific and chemical communities, and charts the history of the cover-up of chemicals in relation to human health, and the level of business made from this by the chemical companies.

The book then goes on in detail about the dangers of [[food additives]], the toxic threats of the processed food humans and animals currently eat, and how this chemical contamination has now affected the water that people drink, and how this has brought on increased biological changes, genetic mutations and newly discovered and increasing illnesses and diseases, in both human and animals.

The book ends with a discussion on Western and Eastern medical approaches and philosophies, a focus on alternative medicine and eating healthily, avoiding synthetic foods, and a practical guide on how to detoxify one's body.
