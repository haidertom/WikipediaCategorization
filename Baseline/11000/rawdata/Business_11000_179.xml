      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1924">'''Adolf Gottlieb (also: Gottlob) Fiedler''' (1771 &amp;ndash; 12 August 1850) was a [[Germany|German]] entrepreneur in [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Congress Poland|Poland]].

==Life==
Born in [[Dresden]] as the son of Christian Gottlob Fiedler, Adolf was one of the most important cloth producers of Saxony in the beginning of the 19th century. The operational seat of the company was in [[Oederan]] in Saxony. He also had factories in [[Kalisz]] and [[Opatówek]] (both in Poland), [[Wegefarth]], [[Wingendorf]], [[Falkenau]] and [[Berthelsdorf]] (all in Saxony). He followed other cloth producers to eastern regions at the time of the German [[industrial revolution]] because of lower salaries and large loans offered by the Polish government. The German investments in Poland were followed by experienced Saxon and [[Bohemia]]n specialists to run the factories. An additional reason was local water power.

From 1824-1826 Fiedler established one of the biggest cloth mills in Congress Poland. He employed around 600 workers in his Polish mill in Opatówek. The products of Fiedler were well known for their quality and won several international prizes.

Fiedler was also [[mayor]] of Oederan.
He had one son, Eduard Magnus and he died in Dresden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">'''Antônio Carbonari Netto''' ( ) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[educator]], [[mathematician]], and businessman.

He is founder, [[CEO]] and one of the main [[shareholder]]s of [[Anhanguera Educacional]], a [[holding company|holding]] of 18 institutions of higher education in the [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]], one of the largest private [[university|universities]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/che.nsf/Content/SelectedPR?OpenDocument&amp;UNID=C10736CE36999842852571B800530BA6 IFC to finance post-secondary education to lower-income students in Brazil] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908032512/http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/che.nsf/Content/SelectedPR?OpenDocument&amp;UNID=C10736CE36999842852571B800530BA6 |date=September 8, 2010 }}" (July 27, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his position and CEO of Anhangüera Educacional, he is [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the [[Centro Universitário Anhangüera of Leme]] (Anhangüera University Center), and director general of the following colleges: Faculdades de [[Valinhos]], Faculdade Comunitária de Campinas, Faculdade Politécnica de [[Jundiaí]] and Faculdade Politécnica de [[Matão]].

Carbonari Netto is a prominent academic and business leader in the private education world in Brazil. He has served in the executive board and councils of several important associations, such as the [[Associação Brasileira de Mantenedoras do Ensino Superior]] (Brazilian Association of Higher Education Organizations), [[Sindicato dos Estabelecimentos do Ensino Superior de São Paulo]] (Syndicate of the Higher Education Institutions of São Paulo), and others.

In late 2011, massive layoffs took place at all Anhangüera Educacional establishments. Over 1500 lecturers and professors with the highest salaries were dismissed, a move focused exclusively on increasing profits.  Classes hours were also decreased, worsening the educational value from the courses offered.

'''Atul Shah''' is a [[businessman]] and [[entrepreneur]] in [[Kenya]]. He is the [[Managing Director]] and [[Chief Executive Officer]] of the Nakumatt Holdings Limited, the parent company of [[Nakumatt|Nakumatt Supermarkets]], the largest, privately owned supermarket chain in the [[African Great Lakes]] area, with branches in [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Rwanda]]. {{asof|September 2014}}, the retail chain maintained 50 stores in four countries, employed over 7,000 people and had annual sales in excess of US$650 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/no-secret-to-doing-business-in-africa-says-nakumatt-md-atul-shah/43244/|

==Background and education==
He was born in [[Nandi Hills, Kenya|Nandi Hills]], Kenya in 1961. In 1965, when Atul was four years old, the family relocated to [[Nakuru]]. Atul's father, '''Mangalal Shah''', who had migrated to Kenya from India in 1947, opened a retail clothing store opposite the Nakuru open air market. Atul' s older brother, Vimal started working in the business in 1970. In 1975 Mangalal began exporting clothing to Uganda, often on credit. Towards the end of 1976, with debtors behind on their payments and creditors demanding for their money, Atul's father declared bankruptcy, with total debts of KSh1.2 million. The store was closed and Mangalal went to work for his brother '''Hasmukh Shah''', who then owned a shop called '''Nakuru Mattresses'''.

Following the closure of their father's business, Atul Shah and his brother, Vimal Shah opened a clothing store that they named '''Furmatts''', which among other things, sold bed sheets which the brothers stitched at home. In 1978, due to booming business, supported by the 1970s coffee boom in East Africa, the two sons and their father managed to pay off the KSh1.2 million debt. They bought Nakuru Mattress from their uncle, who relocated to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2 December 2014| url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000036154/the-non-quitter-who-founded-nakumatt-supermarkets?articleID=2000036154&amp;story_title=the-non-quitter-who-founded-nakumatt-supermarkets&amp;pageNo=1|date=31 May 2011|first=Kenneth|

newspaper=[[The Standard (Kenya)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nakumatt supermarkets==
Under new ownership, Nakuru Mattress and Furmatts began integrating their operations. From two stores Nakuru town in 1978, they diversified the list of items on offer. In addition to clothes and mattresses, they began selling saucepans, cooking pots, plastic basins and umbrellas, among other products. In 1984, they opened a store in [[Eldoret]], their first outside of Nakuru. In 1986 the retail chain expanded to [[Nairobi]], with a store on Ukwala Road.

Over the next 30 years, the supermarket chain has grown into the largest retailer in Kenya, with over 36 stores, employing over 4,500 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Herbling|date=23 September 2014|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Corporate-News/Nakumatt-s-4-500-employees-win-12pc-salary-raise-/-/539550/2463136/-/cqh71sz/-/index.html|title=Nakumatt’s 4,500 Employees Win 12 Percent Salary Raise|newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] (Nairobi)|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the retailer opened its first outlet outside of Kenya, in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]].

==Wealth==
In 2013, Atul Shah is reported to have valued shareholders' equity in the retail chain at US$400 million (KSh34 billion at that time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2 December 2014|last=Mwaniki| url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Nakumatt-valued-at-Sh34bn-says-MD--/-/539552/2055344/-/11a2x3v/-/index.html|first=Charles|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5921">The '''Business Council for International Understanding (BCIU)''' is a [[not-for-profit]], nonpartisan, membership organization that encourages dialogue between business and political leaders in different countries. It holds events, briefings and programs for [[Business networking|networking]] and education. Membership comprises more than 200 companies.

== History ==
BCIU was formed November 10, 1955, at the [[White House Industrial Cooperation Council Conference]], as an initiative directed by U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. It was established with the purpose of improving foreign understanding of business practices within the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Department of State Bulletin Volume 41| url= http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/united-states-dept-of-state-office-of-public-co/department-of-state-bulletin-volume-v-41-jul--sep1959-tin/page-20-department-of-state-bulletin-volume-v-41-jul--sep1959-tin.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby lifting a national image that had suffered greatly through the course of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=The Business Council for International Understanding - Report on the Plenary Meeting |date=September 26, 1956|origyear= JWT Archives |title=Sam Meek Papers: International Marketing Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was intended to operate as a part of a larger Eisenhower program, called People to People; however, in 1958, the umbrella initiative was shut down after failing to amass an adequate amount of independent funding. BCIU survived the initial decentralization of direction and support, and has continued to perform many of its original duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Allen to Christian Herter|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/people_to_people/BinderSS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

=== Corporate to government event building ===
BCIU organizes conferences and receptions for its member companies and relevant government officials to address issues of common concern. The initiative to organize a conference is taken by BCIU members, U.S. government officials, or foreign government officials. The specific format of these meetings is typically left to the discretion of the host.

=== Government contracts ===

'''Business and Enterprise Colleges''' (BECs) were introduced in 2002 as part of the [[Specialist school|Specialist Schools Programme]] in England. The system enables [[secondary school]]s to specialise in certain fields. Schools that successfully apply to the [[Specialist Schools Trust]] and become Business and Enterprise Colleges receive extra funding for applied business teaching from this joint private sector and government scheme. Business and Enterprise Colleges also act as a local point of reference for other schools and businesses in the area, with an emphasis on promoting enterprise and commercial awareness within the community.

==Schools' Enterprise Education Network==
In his budget speech of March 2006, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]] announced that the government would be funding a network of best practice to support the delivery of Enterprise Education within the UK.  This network (called the Schools' [[Business|Enterprise]] Education Network (SEEN) was based on the expertise within BECs&amp;mdash;56 hubs (one per county) were identified in May 2006. At a launch conference the hub co-ordinators were advised of the local BECs that would act as 'spokes' to support the dissemination to all state-maintained secondary schools.

'''Christopher Chandler''' (born 1960&lt;ref name="BirthDate" /&gt;) is a New Zealand-born, Maltese&lt;ref name="ftmaltagrants"/&gt; [[billionaire]] and founder of Dubai-based [[investment company]] [[Legatum]]. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', he has a net worth of $1.7 billion.&lt;ref name="GuardianSchool"&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Andrew|date= |title=School aims to seed the world with business sense|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/22/globaleconomy.internationalaidanddevelopment|location=Boston|access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Matangi, New Zealand|Matangi]], Chandler is the son of [[beekeeper|beekeepers]] Robert and Marija Chandler, who launched and operated Chandler House, a department store in [[Hamilton, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legatum.com/about-us/our-story/ |title=Our story |publisher=Legatum |access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Auckland]], earning a degree in law in 1982.&lt;ref name="IISecrets"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=16 March 2006 |title=Secrets of Sovereign |url=https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b150nr9k08bfxb/secrets-of-sovereign |publisher=Institutional Investor |access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Christopher and his brother, [[Richard Chandler (businessman)|Richard]], took over the business and expanded it to ten stores, adding fashion design, manufacturing and real estate, before starting to look for international investment opportunities.&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/christopher-chandler/ |title=Christopher Chandler |publisher=Forbes |access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout" /&gt;

==Sovereign Capital==
In 1986, the brothers formed investment firm Sovereign Global in Monaco to focus on transitioning industries in Russia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile"/&gt; The business operated by investing in assets which it felt were mispriced in times of crisis.&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout"/&gt;

One of the company's first major investments was in Hong Kong real estate, a market which investors had fled after the signing of the [[Sino-British_Joint_Declaration|Sino-British Accord]].&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout"/&gt; The company also invested in the Brazilian telecommunications industry, just after the country came out of hyperinflation, and in Russia, just after the fall of communism.

During the [[1997_Asian_financial_crisis|Asian banking crisis]], the brothers made significant investments in both Japan, including taking stakes in UHJ Holdings, Mizuho Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., and Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group.&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IISecrets" /&gt; The brothers of took a stake in South Korean refiner SK Corp., where they unsuccessfully tried to "oust" its CEO and Chairman.&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IISecrets" /&gt;

In 2002, the brothers were the fourth largest investor in [[Gazprom]], the Russian state-controlled gas company.&lt;ref name="TimesLegatum"&gt;{{cite news |last=Leroux |first=Marcus |date=14 October 2017 |title=Christopher Chandler: billionaire behind Legatum think tank has unrivalled access to Brexit MPs |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/unrivalled-access-of-secretive-billionaire-christopher-chandler-funds-legatum-institute-885pb9vjc |access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog of their representative on the Board, [[Boris Fyodorov]], was poisoned by cyanide, which allegedly may have been the result of their campaign to clean up the company's governance.&lt;ref name="TimesLegatum" /&gt;

==Legatum==
In 2006, Christopher founded Dubai-based [[Legatum|Legatum Capital]] after splitting off from his brother.&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile" /&gt; The company was co-founded with Mark Stoleson, Philip Vassiliou and Alan McCormick.&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout" /&gt;

Legatum is a private, multibillion-dollar investment firm that puts money into companies in developing countries as well as the world's capital markets.&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile" /&gt; In April 2012, Legatum acquired its own building in the [[Dubai_International_Financial_Centre|Dubai International Finance Centre]].&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Chandler is publicity shy and there exist few photographs of him nor much information about his personal life.&lt;ref name="GuardianSchool" /&gt; He enjoys windsurfing, water-skiing and riding motorcycles.&lt;ref name="IISecrets" /&gt;

The Chandler brothers bought [[La Fleur du Cap]] in [[Cap Ferrat]] for their parents.&lt;ref name="TimesLegatum" /&gt; It was previously owned by [[David Niven]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].

Chandler became a citizen of [[Malta]], a member-state of the [[European Union]], in 2016.&lt;ref name="ftmaltagrants"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Murchu|first1=Cynthia|title=Malta grants EU citizenship to Legatum backer|url=https://www.ft.com/content/110f57ee-02a3-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5?desktop=true|accessdate=January 29, 2018|work=Financial Times|date=January 29, 2017|quote=The New Zealand-born billionaire behind Legatum, the London based think-tank that emerged as one of the most vocal advocates for Britain’s departure from the single market and the customs union, has obtained EU citizenship via Malta.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberta Metsola]], a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) representing [[Malta]], said in January 2018, when the news of his Maltese citizenship became public, that it was "surreal" that a [[Brexit]] backer had applied for an EU passport.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180129/local/major-brexit-supporter-obtains-maltese-passport-ft.669224 Major Brexit supporter obtains Maltese passport - FT], ''[[Times of Malta]]'', January 29, 2018, accessed March 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently became clear that Chandler was not a Brexiter, and his application for Maltese citizenship was made before the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|UK referendum]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/apology-christopher-chandler], ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 28, 2018, accessed October 25, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the French language professor|Eric H. du Plessis}}
{{BLP sources|date=May 2008}}

'''Erik du Plessis''' is the Chairman of [[Millward Brown South Africa]] and author of "The Advertised Mind: Groundbreaking Insights into How Our Brains Respond to Advertising," 2005.  He specializes in brand and advertising research. Erik has also been a guest professor at the [[Copenhagen Business School]]. Du Plessis formerly ran his own research company, [[Impact Information]], in [[South Africa]].

== The Advertised Mind ==
Compiling research performed by du Plessis and Millward Brown, "The Advertised Mind" theorizes that the strongest factor in successful marketing is whether an advertisement creates an emotional response in its target audience. du Plessis bases his conclusions on recent discoveries in neuroscience—particularly the limbic system—which suggest that emotion establishes a firm memory of an advertisement and predisposes consumers to buy the brand that is being advertised. du Plessis also refers to Adtrack’s database of responses to over 30,000 TV commercials, and explores how this paradigm shift can maximize return on advertising spend.

== The Branded Mind ==
In 2011, du Plessis wrote a follow up book called "The Branded Mind: What Neuroscience Really Tells Us About the Puzzle of the Brain and Brand."

"The Branded Mind" examines the neuroscience of brand decisions, taking the position that brand decisions were largely dependent on homeostatic factors. In "The Branded Mind," du Plessis also discusses how both emotion and rationality factors come into play when a consumer is deciding which brand to pick. Du Plessis also offers some insight in his book on the ways in which emotions, moods, personality, and culture impact our brand decisions.&lt;ref&gt;http://threefiftyneuromarketing.com/branded-mind-what-neuroscience-really-tells-us-about-puzzle-brain-and-brand&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Awards''' or '''EY Entrepreneur of the Year Awards''' is an award sponsored by [[Ernst &amp; Young]] in recognition of [[entrepreneurship]]. Founded in 1986 in [[Milwaukee]] with just one award, as of 2016, twenty-five programs were run in all fifty states of the [[United States]] and also run in more than sixty countries.&lt;ref name=EYeoty&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ey.com/US/en/About-us/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year |title=EY Entrepreneur of the Year Awards |publisher=[[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]] |date= |accessdate=9 June 2016 |location=United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, the award can be given to multiple individuals per year; for example, in 2013 there were ten winners in the [[New York State|state of New York]], with winners awarded in the categories of retail and consumer products; technology; family business; emerging; energy, chemical and mining; food products and services; real estate, hospitality, and construction; financial services; digital media; and transformational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ey.com/US/en/About-us/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year/MET-NY_Article_award_recipients |title=Meet NY award recipients |work=Entrepreneur of the Year Awards |publisher=[[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]] |date=2013 |location=United States |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, there were eleven national winners in the United States; with one individual recognized as the Overall Award Winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ey.com/US/en/About-us/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year/US_EOY_2014-winners |title=US winners |work=Entrepreneur of the Year Awards |publisher=[[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]] |date=2014 |location=United States |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416053832/http://www.ey.com/US/en/About-us/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year/US_EOY_2014-winners |archivedate=2015-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''family business''' is a [[commercial organization]] in which decision-making is influenced by multiple generations of a family — related by blood or marriage or adoption — who has both the ability to influence the vision of the business and the willingness to use this ability to pursue distinctive goals.&lt;ref name="JSBM"&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Massis |first=Alfredo |author2=Josip Kotlar |author3=Jess H. Chua |author4=James J. Chrisman|date=2014 |title=Ability and Willingness as Sufficiency Conditions for Family-Oriented Particularistic Behavior: Implications for Theory and Empirical Studies |ssrn= |journal=Journal of Small Business Management |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=344–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Family Business Studies: An Annotated Bibliography|year=2012|publisher= Edward Elgar |location= Cheltenham Glos, UK |author=Alfredo De Massis|author2=Pramodita Sharma |author3=Jess H. Chua |author4=James J. Chrisman }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are closely identified with the firm through leadership or ownership. Owner-manager entrepreneurial firms are not considered to be family businesses because they lack the multi-generational dimension and family influence that create the unique dynamics and relationships of family businesses.

==Conceptual overview==
Family business is the oldest and most common model of economic organization. The vast majority of businesses throughout the world—from corner shops to multinational publicly listed organizations with hundreds of thousands of employees—can be considered family businesses.&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlock|first=Randel S |author2=Manfred Kets de Vries |author3=Elizabeth Florent-Treacy|title=Family Business|journal=International Encyclopedia of Organizational Studies|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on research of the [[Forbes 400]] richest Americans, 44% of the Forbes 400 member fortunes were derived by being a member of or in association with a family business.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic prevalence and importance of this kind of business are often underestimated. Throughout most of the 20th century, academics and economists were intrigued by a newer, “improved” model: large publicly traded companies run in an apparently rational, bureaucratic manner by well trained “organization men.” Entrepreneurial and family firms, with their specific management models and complicated psychological processes, often fell short by comparison.&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"/&gt;

Privately owned or family-controlled enterprises are not always easy to study. In many cases, they are not subject to financial reporting requirements, and little information is made public about financial performance. Ownership may be distributed through trusts or holding companies, and family members themselves may not be fully informed about the ownership structure of their enterprise. However, as the 21st-century global economic model replaces the old industrial model, government policy makers, economists, and academics turn to entrepreneurial and family enterprises as a prime source of wealth creation and employment.&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"/&gt;

In some countries, many of the largest publicly listed firms are family-owned. A firm is said to be family-owned if a person is the controlling shareholder; that is, a person (rather than a state, corporation, management trust, or mutual fund) can garner enough shares to assure at least 20% of the voting rights and the highest percentage of voting rights in comparison to other shareholders.&lt;ref name="JIM1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chakrabarty |first=S |date=2009 |title=The Influence of National Culture and Institutional Voids on Family Ownership of Large Firms: A Country Level Empirical Study |ssrn=1151025 |journal=Journal of International Management |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Some of the world's largest family-run businesses are [[Walmart]] (United States), [[Samsung Group]] (Korea) and [[Tata Group]] (India).

The "Global Family Business Index"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familybusinessindex.com|title=HSG / Global Family Business Index|website=www.familybusinessindex.com|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises the largest 500 family firms around the globe. In this index—published for a first time in 2015 by Center for Family Business [[University of St. Gallen]] and [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]]—for a privately held firm, a firm is classified as a family firm in case a family controls more than 50% of the voting rights. For a publicly listed firm, a firm is classified as a family firm in case the family holds at least 32% of the voting rights.

Family owned businesses account for over 30% of companies with sales over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Kachaner |first1=Nicolas |last2=Stalk Jr. |first2=George |last3=Bloch |first3=Alain |date=November 2012 |title=What You Can Learn from Family Business |url=http://hbr.org/2012/11/what-you-can-learn-from-family-business/ar/1 |magazine=Harvard Business Review |access-date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a family business, two or more members within the management team are drawn from the owning family. Family businesses can have owners who are not family members. Family businesses may also be managed by individuals who are not members of the family. However, family members are often involved in the operations of their family business in some capacity and, in smaller companies, usually one or more family members are the senior officers and managers. In India, many businesses that are now [[Public company|public companies]] were once family businesses.

Family participation as managers and/or owners of a business can strengthen the company because family members are often loyal and dedicated to the family enterprise. However, family participation as managers and/or owners of a business can present unique problems because the dynamics of the family system and the dynamics of the business systems are often not in balance.

==Problems==
The interests of a family member may not be aligned with the interest of the business. For example, if a family member wants to be president but is not as competent as a non-family member, the personal interest of the family member and the well being of the business may be in conflict.

The interests of the entire family may not be balanced with the interests of their business. For example, if a family needs its business to distribute funds for living expenses and retirement but the business requires those to stay competitive, the interests of the entire family and the business are not aligned.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, Jacoline (2008). Money Magnet: Attract Investors to Your Business: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-470-15575-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the interest of one family member may not be aligned with another family member. For example, a family member who is an owner may want to sell the business to maximize their return, but a family member who is an owner and also a manager may want to keep the company because it represents their career and they want their children to have the opportunity to work in the company.

==The three circles model==
The challenge for business families is that family, ownership and business roles involve different and sometimes conflicting values, goals, and actions. For example, family members put a high priority on emotional capital—the family success that unites them through consecutive generations. Executives in the business are concerned about strategy and social capital—the reputation of their firm in the marketplace. Owners are interested in financial capital—performance in terms of wealth creation.&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"/&gt;

A three-circles model is often used to show the three principal roles in a family-owned or -controlled organization: Family, Ownership and Management. This model shows how the roles may overlap.

Everyone in the family (in all generations) obviously belongs to the Family circle, but some family members will never own shares in the family business, or ever work there. A family member is concerned with social capital (reputation within the community), dividends, and family unity.

The Ownership circle may include family members, investors and/or employee-owners. An owner is concerned with financial capital (business performance and dividends).
The Management circle typically includes non-family members who are employed by the family business. Family members may also be employees. An employee is concerned with social capital (reputation), emotional capital (career opportunities, bonuses and fair performance measures).

A few people—for example, the founder or a senior family member—may hold all three roles: family member, owner and employee. These individuals are intensely connected to the family business, and concerned with any or all of the above sources of value creation.

==The genogram==
A genogram is an organization chart for the family. It is an enhanced family tree that shows not only family events like births and deaths, but also indicates the relationships (close, conflicted, cut-off, etc.) among individuals in the family. It is a useful tool for spotting relationship patterns across generations, and decrypting seemingly irrational behavior.

Family myths—sets of beliefs that are shared by the family members—can play important defensive and protective roles in families. Myths help people cope with stress and anxiety and, by prescribing ritualistic behavior patterns, will enable them to establish a common front against the outside world. They provide a rationale for the way people behave, but because much of what makes up a family myth takes place deep beneath the surface, they also conceal the true issues, problems, and conflicts. Although these family myths can turn into a blueprint for family action, they can also turn into straitjackets, reducing a family's flexibility and capacity to respond to new situations.

Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|author=McGoldrick, M |author2=Gerson, R. |author3=Shellenberger, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel planning processes==
All businesses require planning, but business families face the additional planning task of balancing family and business demands. There are five critical issues where the needs of the family and the demands of the business overlap—and require parallel planning action to ensure that business success does not create a family or business disaster.&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strategic Planning for the Family Business: Parallel Planning to Unify the Family and Business|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|author=Randel S Carlock|author2=John L Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=When Family Businesses are Best|date=October 2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|author=Carlock, Randel S.|author2=Ward, John L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#  '''Capital''' How are the firm’s financial resources allocated between different and family demands?
#  '''Control''' Who has decision-making power in the family and firm?
#  '''Careers''' How are individuals selected for senior leadership and governance positions in the firm or family?
#  '''Conflict''' How do we prevent this natural element of human relationships from becoming the default pattern of interaction?
#  '''Culture''' How are the family and business values sustained and transmitted to owners, employees and younger family members?

==Fair process==
Fairness is a fundamental issue in family business decision-making. Solutions that are perceived as fair by the family and business stakeholders are more likely to be accepted and supported. Fair process helps create organizational justice by engaging family members, whether as owners and employees, in a series of practical steps to address and resolve critical issues. Fair process lays a foundation for continued family participation over generations.

==Emotional dimension==
The challenge faced by family businesses and their stakeholders, is to recognise the issues that they face, understand how to develop strategies to address them and more importantly, to create narratives, or family stories that explain the emotional dimension of the issues to the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Family Business on the Couch: A Psychological Perspective|date=September 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=London|author=Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries |author2=Randel S. Carlock |author3=Elizabeth Florent-Treacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most intractable family business issues are not the business problems the organisation faces, but the emotional issues that compound them. Many years of achievement through generations can be destroyed by the next, if the family fails to address the psychological issues they face. Applying psychodynamic concepts will help to explain behaviour and will enable the family to prepare for life cycle transitions and other issues that may arise. Family-run organisations need a new understanding and a broader perspective on the human dynamics of family firms with two complementary frameworks, psychodynamic and family systematic.

==Structuring==
When the family business is basically owned and operated by one person, that person usually does the necessary balancing automatically. For example, the founder may decide the business needs to build a new plant and take less money out of the business for a period so the business can accumulate cash needed to expand. In making this decision, the founder is balancing his personal interests (taking cash out) with the needs of the business (expansion).

Most first generation owner/managers make the majority of the decisions. When the second generation (sibling partnership) is in control, the decision making becomes more consultative. When the larger third generation (cousin consortium) is in control, the decision making becomes more consensual, the family members often take a vote. In this manner, the decision making throughout generations becomes more rational.&lt;ref name="Alderson, K 2011"&gt;Alderson, K,. (2011). Understanding the Family Business. NY. Business Expert Press, {{ISBN|9781606491690}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The assets that are owned by the family, in most family businesses, are hard to separate from the assets
that belong to the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walczak |first1=D. |last2=Voss |first2=G. |date=2013 |title=New Possibilities of Supporting Polish SMEs within the Jeremie Initiative Managed by BGK |url=http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/mjss/article/view/1144/1173 |journal=Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences |volume=4 |issue=9 |page=759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenarios==
Balancing competing interests often become difficult in three situations. The first situation is when the founder wants to change the nature of their involvement in the business. Usually the founder begins this transition by involving others to manage the business. Involving someone else to manage the company requires the founder to be more conscious and formal in balancing personal interests with the interests of the business because they can no longer do this alignment automatically—someone else is involved.

The second situation is when more than one person owns the business and no single person has the power and support of the other owners to determine collective interests. For example, if a founder intends to transfer ownership in the family business to their four children, two of whom work in the business, how do they balance these unequal differences? The four siblings need a system to do this themselves when the founder is no longer involved.

The third situation is when there are multiple owners and some or all of the owners are not in management. Given the situation above, there is a higher chance that the interests of the two off-spring not employed in the family business may be different from the interests of the two who are employed in the business. Their potential for differences does not mean that the interests cannot be aligned, it just means that there is a greater need for the four owners to have a system in place that differences can be identified and balanced.

These three scenarios can be mitigated by following the guidelines of TMP, or "The Maria Principle"

==Succession==
There appear to be two main factors affecting the development of family business and succession process: the size of the family, in relative terms the volume of business, and suitability to lead the organization, in terms of managerial ability, technical and commitment (Arieu, 2010).{{Full citation needed|date=August 2017}}
Arieu proposed a model in order to classify family firms into four scenarios: political, openness, foreign management and  [[Succession planning|natural succession]].

Potential successors who had professional experience outside the family business may decide to leave the firm to found a new one, either with or without the support of the family. Instead, successors tend to be characterized by professional experience only within the family business. The education of potential successors is a critical issue in the succession process because it affects the endowement of managerial capabilities of the firm.&lt;ref name="FBR"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pittino |first1=D. |last2=Visintin |first2=F. |last3=Lauto |first3=G. |date=May 2018 |title=Fly Away From the Nest? |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0894486518773867 |journal=Family Business Journal |volume=in print |doi=10.1177/0894486518773867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest trends in family business is the number of women who are taking over their family firms. In the past, succession was reserved for the first-born son, then it moved on to any male heir. Now, women account for approx. 11-12% of all family firm leaders, an increase of close to 40% since 1996. Daughters are now considered to be one of the most underutilized resources in family businesses. To encourage the next generation of women to be valuable members of the business, potential female successors should be nurtured by assimilation into the family firm, mentoring, sharing of important tacit knowledge and having positive role models within the business.&lt;ref name="Alderson, K 2011"/&gt;

==Success==
Successfully balancing the differing interests of family members and/or the interests of one or more family members on the one hand and the interests of the business on the other hand require the people involved to have the competencies, character and commitment to do this work.

Family-owned companies present special challenges to those who run them. They can be quirky, developing unique cultures and procedures as they grow and mature. That is fine, as long as they continue to be managed by people who are steeped in the traditions, or at least able to adapt to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=2176257#ixzz0oesFCjGp |accessdate=May 22, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EMJ1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pittino |first1=D. |last2=Visintin |first2=F. |last3=Lauto |first3=G. |date=April 2017 |title=A configurational analysis of the antecedents of entrepreneurial orientation |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026323731630086X |journal=European Management Journal |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=224–237 |doi=10.1016/j.emj.2016.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often family members can benefit from involving more than one professional advisor, each having the particular skill set needed by the family. Some of the skill sets that might be needed include communication, [[conflict resolution]], family systems, finance, legal, accounting, insurance, investing, leadership development, management development, and [[strategic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Tutelman and Hause, The Balance Point: New Ways Business Owners Can Use Boards (2008 Famille Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership in a family business will also show maturity of the business. If all the shares rest with one individual, a family business is still in its infant stage, even if the revenue is strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=2176257# |accessdate=May 22, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{Main|Entrepreneurship}}
Entrepreneurship has traditionally been defined as the process of designing, launching and running a new [[business]], which typically begins as a [[small business]], such as a [[startup company]], offering a product, process or service for sale or hire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=AK Yetisen |author2=LR Volpatti |author3=AF Coskun |author4=S Cho |author5=E Kamrani |author6=H Butt |author7=A Khademhosseini |author8=SH Yun |title=Entrepreneurship |journal= Lab Chip |volume=15 |issue=18 |pages=3638–60 |doi= 10.1039/c5lc00577a |pmid=26245815 |url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/lc/c5lc00577a|year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined as the "...capacity and willingness to develop, organize, and manage a business venture along with any of its risks in order to make a [[profit (accounting)|profit]]."&lt;ref name="businessdictionary.com"&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/entrepreneurship.html#ixzz3xv9ci0nt&lt;/ref&gt; While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses, due to the high [[risk]]s involved in launching a start-up, a significant proportion of businesses have to close, due to a "...lack of funding, bad business decisions, an economic crisis -- or a combination of all of these"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224113&lt;/ref&gt; or due to lack of market demand. In the 2000s, the definition of "entrepreneurship" has been expanded to explain how and why some individuals (or teams) identify opportunities, evaluate them as viable, and then decide to exploit them, whereas others do not,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=S.|last2=Venkatraman|first2=S.|title=The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research|journal=Academy of Management Review|date=2000|volume=25|pages=217–226|doi=10.5465/amr.2000.2791611}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in turn, how entrepreneurs use these opportunities to develop new products or services, launch new firms or even new industries and create wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brush|first1=C.|title=Doctoral education in the field of entrepreneurship|journal=Journal of Management|volume=29|issue=3|pages=309–331|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/s0149-2063(03)00014-x|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, an '''entrepreneur''' has been defined as "a person who organizes and manages any enterprise, especially a business, usually with considerable initiative and [[risk]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/entrepreneurship&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than working as an [[employee]], an entrepreneur runs a [[small business]] and assumes all the risk and reward of a given business venture, idea, or good or service offered for sale. The entrepreneur is commonly seen as a business leader and [[Innovation|innovator]] of new ideas and business processes."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp#ixzz3yfNOKdsp&lt;/ref&gt;
Entrepreneurs tend to be good at perceiving new business opportunities and they often exhibit positive [[biases]] in their perception (i.e., a bias towards finding new possibilities and seeing unmet market needs) and a pro-risk-taking attitude that makes them more likely to exploit the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S.X. Zhang |author2=J. Cueto |title=The Study of Bias in Entrepreneurship |journal= Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice |pages=n/a |doi= 10.1111/etap.12212  |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/etap.12212/abstract|year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Ervin L.|last2=Burton|first2=F.

An entrepreneur is typically in control of a commercial undertaking, directing the [[factors of production]]–the [[human resources|human]], [[Financing|financial]] and material resources–that are required to exploit a business opportunity. They act as the manager and oversee the launch and growth of an enterprise. Entrepreneurship is the process by which an individual (or team) identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. The exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include actions such as developing a [[business plan]], hiring the [[human resources]], acquiring financial and material resources, providing [[leadership]], and being responsible for the venture's success or failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert D. |last=Hisrich |title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883–1950) stated that the role of the entrepreneur in the economy is "[[creative destruction]]"–launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches. For Schumpeter, the changes and "dynamic [[Economic equilibrium#Disequilibrium|disequilibrium]] brought on by the innovating entrepreneur ... [are] the ‘norm’ of a healthy [[economy]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/provincial/innovation/ambition.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurship typically operates within an [[entrepreneurship ecosystem]] which often includes government programs and services that promote entrepreneurship and support entrepreneurs and start-ups; non-governmental organizations such as small business associations and organizations that offer advice and mentoring to entrepreneurs (e.g., through entrepreneurship centers or websites); small business [[advocacy organization]]s that lobby the government for increased support for entrepreneurship programs and more small business-friendly laws and regulations; entrepreneurship resources and facilities (e.g., [[business incubator]]s and [[seed accelerator]]s); entrepreneurship education and training programs offered by schools, colleges and universities; and financing (e.g., bank loans, [[venture capital financing]], [[angel investing]], and government and private foundation grants). The strongest entrepreneurship ecosystems are those found in top entrepreneurship hubs such as [[Silicon Valley]], [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Singapore]] and other such locations where there are [[business cluster|clusters]] of leading high-tech firms, top [[research university|research universities]], and venture capitalists.&lt;ref name=VentureCapitalNY1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvca.org/research/venture-investment/|title=Venture Investment - Regional Aggregate Data|publisher=National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, entrepreneurship can be studied in college or university as part of the disciplines of [[management]] or [[business administration]].

== History ==

Before the 20th century, female operated [[small business]]es as a way of supplementing their income. In many cases, they were trying to avoid poverty or were replacing the income from the loss of a spouse. At that time, the ventures that these women undertook were not thought of as entrepreneurial. Many of them had to focus on their domestic responsibilities. For instance, with longstanding and significant barriers to educational and alternative employment opportunities, Black women were historically relegated to low-paying jobs and domestic work—particularly in the Jim Crow South. As a result, Black women of the early 20th century developed entrepreneurial niches in dressmaking, Black hair care, private home domestic work and midwifery. Lower levels of wealth, access to capital, racial discrimination and inadequate networks have been and continue to be barriers to entrepreneurship women of color face&lt;ref&gt;Walker’s Legacy. (2016). “Black Women Entrepreneurs: Past and Present Conditions of Black Women’s Business Ownership.” Walker’s Legacy.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The term [[entrepreneur]] is used to describe individuals who have ideas for products and/or services that they turn into a working business. In earlier times, this term was reserved for men.&lt;ref&gt;"From Ideas to Independence A Century of Entrepreneurial Women." Entrepreneurs.nwhm.org. N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women became more involved in the business world only when the idea of women in business became palatable to the general public; however, this does not mean that there were no female entrepreneurs until that time. In the 17th century, Dutch colonists who came to what is now known as New York City, operated under a [[matriarchal]] society. In this society, many women inherited money and lands, and through this inheritance, became business owners. One of the most successful women from this time was [[Margaret Hardenbrook Philipse]], who was a merchant, a ship owner, and was involved in the trading of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Bostwick, Heleigh. "History's Top Women Entrepreneurs." LegalZoom: Online Legal Document Services: LLC, Wills, Incorporation, Divorce &amp; More. N.p., March 2009. Web. 18 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid 18th century, it was popular for women to own certain businesses like brothels, alehouses, taverns, and retail shops. Most of these businesses were not perceived with good reputations; because, it was considered shameful for women to be in these positions. Society frowned upon women involved in such businesses; because, they detracted from the women's supposed gentle and frail nature. During the 18th and 19th centuries, more women came out from under the oppression of society's limits, and began to emerge into the public eye. Despite the disapproval of society, women such as [[Rebecca Lukens]] flourished. In 1825, Lukens took her family business of Iron works, and turned it into a profit-generating steel business.

In the 1900s, due to a more progressive way of thinking, and the rise of feminism, female entrepreneurs began to be a widely accepted term. Although these female entrepreneurs serviced mostly female consumers, they were making great strides. Women gained the right to vote in 1920, and two years later, Clara and Lillian Westropp started the institution of Women's Savings &amp; Loan as a way of teaching women how to be smart with their money. As society progressed, female entrepreneurs became more influential. With the boom of the textile industry and the development of the railroad and telegraph system, women such as [[Madam C. J. Walker|Madame C. J. Walker]] took advantage of the changing times. Walker was able to market her hair care products in a successful way, becoming the first African American female millionaire. Carrie Crawford Smith was the owner of an employment agency opened in 1918, and like Madame C. J. Walker, sought to provide help to many women by giving them opportunities to work.

During the Great Depression, some of the opportunities afforded to women took a backseat and society seemed to reverse its views, reverting to more traditional roles. This affected women working in business; however, it also served as a push to those involved in the entrepreneurial world. More women began to start their own businesses, looking to survive during this time of hardship. In 1938, Hattie Moseley Austin, who had begun to sell chicken and biscuits after her husband died, opened Hattie's Chicken Shack in Saratoga Springs, NY.

During WWII, many women entered the workforce, filling jobs that men had left behind to serve in the military. Some women, of their own accord, took these jobs as a patriotic duty while others started businesses of their own. One of these women was [[Pauline Trigère|Pauline Trigere]], who came to New York from Paris in 1937, started a tailoring business that later turned into a high-end fashion house. Another woman was [[Estée Lauder (businesswoman)|Estée Lauder]], who was working on the idea for her beauty products which officially launched in 1946, a year after the war ended. When the war ended, many women still had to maintain their place in the business world; because, many of the men who returned were injured.

The Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs were sources of encouragement to female entrepreneurs. They often would hold workshops with already established entrepreneurs, such as [[Elizabeth Arden]], who would give advice. During the 1950s, women found themselves surrounded by messages everywhere, stating what their role should be. Domesticity was the overall public concern and a theme that was highly stressed during this time, and women had to juggle combined home responsibilities and their career.

Home-based businesses helped to solve a good part of the problem for those women who worried about being mothers. [[Lillian Vernon (businesswoman)|Lillian Vernon]], while pregnant with her first child, started her own business dealing with catalogs by investing money from wedding gifts and started filling orders right at her kitchen table. Mary Crowley founded Home Decorating and Interiors as a way of helping women to work from home by throwing parties to sell the products right in the comfort of their own home. In an effort to avoid criticism and lost business from those who did not support women in business, [[Bette Nesmith Graham|Bette Nesmith]], who developed the product "Mistake Out," a liquid that painted over mistakes in typing, would sign her orders B. Smith so no one would know she was a female.

From the 1960s to the late 1970s, another change came about when divorce rates rose and many women were forced back into the role of being the sole provider. This pushed them back into the working world, where they were not well received. When the recession hit, many of these women were the first to be without work. Once again, the entrepreneurial endeavors of women came to the rescue as an effort of asserting themselves, and aiding other women in being a part of the workforce. [[Mary Kay Ash]] and [[Ruth Fertel]] of Ruth's Chris Steak House were part of that movement.

The 1980s and 1990s were a time of reaping the benefits from the hard work of women who worked tirelessly for their rightful place in the workforce as employees and entrepreneurs. [[Martha Stewart]] and Vera Bradley were among the twenty-first percent women who owned businesses. The public was also becoming more receptive and encouraging to these female entrepreneurs, acknowledging the valuable contribution they were making to the economy. The [[National Association of Women Business Owners]] helped to push Congress to pass the ''Women's Business Ownership Act'' in 1988'','' which would end discrimination in lending and also strike down laws that required married women to acquire their husband's signature for all loans. In addition, the Act also gave women-owned businesses a chance to compete for government contracts.

Another monumental moment for women in business was the appointment of [[Susan Engeleiter]] as head of the US government's [[Small Business Administration]] in 1989. In the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, there was more of a focus on networking opportunities in the world of female entrepreneurs. There were many opportunities that came about to help those who were interested in starting up their own businesses. Support groups, organizations for educating the female entrepreneur, and other opportunities like seminars and help with financing came from many different sources, such as the Women's Business Development Center and Count Me In. Despite all these advances, the female entrepreneurs still fell behind when compared to their male counterparts.

As the 1990s came in, the availability of computers and the increasing popularity of the internet gave a much needed boost to women in business. This technology allowed them to be more prevalent in the business world and showcase their skills to their competitors. Even with the increased popularity of women in business, the availability of technology and the support from different organizations, female entrepreneurs today are still struggling. The economic downturn of 2008 did not serve to help them in their quest. However, with the continual attention given to female entrepreneurs and the educational programs afforded to women who seek to start out with their own business ventures, there is much information and help available. Since 2000, there has been an increase in small and big ventures by women, including one of their biggest obstacles—financing.

== Demographics ==
Studies have shown that successful female entrepreneurs start their businesses as a second or third profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pandey|first=Tarkeshwer|year=2016|title=Women Entrepreneurship In Business Trends; Challenging Issue For Growth|url=http://www.ijrdo.org/International-Journal-of-Research-&amp;-Development-Organisation-pdf/Applied%20Management%20Science/2015/14.pdf|journal=IJRDO-Journal of Applied Management Science|volume=1|pages=18–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Because of their previous careers, female entrepreneurs enter the business world later on in life, around 40–60 years old.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report, “women are nearly one-third more likely to start businesses out of necessity than men.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gemconsortium.org/report/49480|title=GEM Global Entrepreneurship Monitor|website=GEM Global Entrepreneurship Monitor|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because women are overtaking their male peers in the level of education obtained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schumpeter|title=The daughter also rises women are storming emerging-world boardrooms|journal=The Economist|date=27 August 2011|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21526872}}&lt;/ref&gt; having higher education degrees is one of the significant characteristics that many successful female entrepreneurs have in common. The average self-employment rate for women under 25 years old in OECD countries is 7.2%.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. (2015), ''Entrepreneurship at a Glance 2015,'' OECD Publishing, Paris. {{doi|10.1787/entrepreneur_aag-2015-en}}: 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of self-employed women has steadily increased over the past three decades, putting them at an approximate thirty-three percent increase. Many female-owned businesses continue to be home-based operations. These types of businesses usually have limited revenue with about eighty percent of them making less than $50,000 in 2002. This group made up for about six percent of total women-owned businesses. Children of these female entrepreneurs are expected to boost that number as they contribute to the growing amount of female entrepreneurs. Most women-owned businesses are in wholesale, retail trade, and manufacturing. Female entrepreneurs have also made a name for themselves in professional, scientific, and technical services, as well as in healthcare and social assistance. In the majority of OECD countries, female entrepreneurs are more likely to work in the services industry than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. (2015), ''Entrepreneurship at a Glance 2015,'' OECD Publishing, Paris. {{doi|10.1787/entrepreneur_aag-2015-en}}: 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, women-owned businesses accounted for 4.6 percent of all U.S. businesses—that was about 1.5 million self-employed women. That number increased to 2.1 million in 1979 and 3.5 million in 1984. In 1997, there were about 5.4 million women-owned businesses and in 2007, that number increased to 7.8 million. The participation of females in entrepreneurial activities does of course vary in different levels around the world. For example, in Pakistan, female entrepreneurs account for only 1% of this gender's population, while in Zambia 40% of women are engaged in this activity. The highest number of females involved in entrepreneurial activities can be seen in Sub-Saharan Africa, with 27% of the female population. Latin America/Caribbean economies show comparatively high percentages as well (15%). The lower numbers are seen in the MENA/Mid-Asia region with entrepreneurial activities registering at 4%. Developed Europe and Asia, as well as Israel, also show low rates of 5%.

== International implications ==
A recent international study found that women from low to middle income countries (such as [[Russia]] and the [[Philippines]]) are more likely to enter early stage [[entrepreneurship]] when compared to those of higher income countries (such as [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]], and [[Australia]]). A significant factor that may play a role in this disparity can be attributed to the fact that women from low income countries often seek an additional means of income to support themselves and their families. Overall, 40 to 50 percent of all small businesses are owned by women in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmon, G. (2012). Women entrepreneurs, example not exception [Video]. Available from http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/gayle_tzemach_lemmon_women_entrepreneurs_example_not_exception.html&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, this may also be due to the fact that, in western business practices, it is not seen as beneficial to exhibit perceived feminine traits. While eastern businesses tend to follow methods based around mutual respect and understanding, western business' expectations are for business leaders to be more ruthless, headstrong, and less sensitive or respectful.

"In the grab for power, women use whatever means available to them, whereas a man would take a club to his opponents head, a woman is more likely use other less forceful and more subversive measures. Let's just own it, we have different weapons in our arsenal." &lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, S (2012). Can we please change the Conversation. http://www.shebusiness.com/2012/09/can-we-please-change-the-conversation/&lt;/ref&gt; Female entrepreneurs make up for approximately 1/3 of all entrepreneurs globally. According to one study, in 2012 there was an approximate 126 million women that were either starting or already running new businesses in various economies all over the world. As far as those who were already established, there was an approximate 98 million. Not only are these women running or starting their own businesses but they are also employing others, so that they are participating in the growth of their respective economies.

A study in India entitled "Barriers of Women Entrepreneurs: A Study in Bangalore Urban District", has concluded that despite all these constraints, successful female entrepreneurs do exist. Female entrepreneurs have evidently more to ‘acquire’ than their male counterparts. But, the socio-cultural environment in which women are born and raised hinders them. Social customs, caste restrictions, culture restraints, and norms leave women lagging behind men.&lt;ref&gt;Gayathridevi, C.L., 'Barriers of Women Entrepreneurs: A Study in Bangalore Urban District', International Journal of Trends in Economics Management &amp; Technology (IJTEMT), {{ISSN|2321-5518}}, Vol. 3 Issue 2, April 2014, pp:24-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present challenges ==
Even though female entrepreneurship and the formation of female-owned business networks is steadily rising, there are a number of challenges and obstacles that female entrepreneurs face. One major challenge that many female entrepreneurs face is the effect that the traditional gender-roles society may still have on women. Entrepreneurship is still considered as a male-dominated field, and it may be difficult to surpass these conventional views. Other than dealing with the dominant stereotype, female entrepreneurs are facing several obstacles related to their businesses.

=== Obstacles specific to starting new firms ===

==== External finance and sex discrimination. ====
In general, women have lower personal financial assets than men. This means that for a given opportunity and equally capable individual, women must secure additional resources compared to men in order to exploit the opportunity; because, they control less capital.  The question of whether women have a harder time getting finance than men for the same business opportunity has developed into its own sub-field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brush | first1 = C. G. | year = 1992 | title = Research on women business owners: Past trends, a new perspective and future directions | url = | journal = Entrepreneurship Theory &amp; Practice | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 5–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, S., Anderson, S., &amp; Shaw, E. 2001.

London, UK: Small Business Service.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carter | first1 = S. | last2 = Rosa | first2 = P. | year = 1998 | title = The financing of male- and female-owned businesses | url = | journal = Entrepreneurship and Regional Development | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 225–241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible issue in raising outside capital is that 96% of senior venture capitalists are men and may not be as understanding of female-centric businesses.&lt;ref name="kauffman.org"&gt;Robb, Alicia M. and Susan Coleman. Sources of Financing for New Technology Firms: A Comparison by Gender. Kauffman. (July 2009): http://www.kauffman.org/what-we-do/research/kauffman-firm-survey-series/sources-of-financing-for-new-technology-firms-a-comparison-by-gender&lt;/ref&gt; However, the situation seems to be improving. A study by Babson College showed that in 1999, fewer than 5% of venture capital investments went to companies with a woman on the executive team. In 2011, it was 9% and in 2013 it had jumped to 18%.&lt;ref name="Weisul, Kimberly 2015"&gt;Weisul, Kimberly. "Will the Next Steve Jobs Be a Woman?" Inc. (October 2015): 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific solution for solving women's difficulties for obtaining financing has been micro-financing. [[Microfinance]] is a financial institution that has become exceptionally popular, especially in developing economies. Female entrepreneurs have also been especially successful in getting funded through crowdfunding platforms like [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref name="Weisul, Kimberly 2015"/&gt;

Due to lack of funding for women in new businesses many women founders have had to hire or create fake male profiles to act as co-founders, executives, or the face of their businesses to make progress. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40456604/these-women-entrepreneurs-created-a-fake-male-cofounder-to-dodge-startup-sexism|title=These Women Entrepreneurs Created A Fake Male Cofounder To Dodge Startup Sexism|date=2017-08-29|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Obstacles to managing a small firm ===

Studies on female entrepreneurs show that women have to cope with stereotypical attitudes towards them on a daily basis. Business relations—from customers to suppliers and banks—constantly remind the entrepreneur that she is different, sometimes in a positive way such as by praising her for being a successful entrepreneur even though she is a woman. Employees tend to mix the perceptions of the manager with their images of female role models, leading to mixed expectations on a female manager to be a manager as well as a "mother". The workload associated with being a small business manager is also not easily combined with taking care of children and a family. However, even if the revenues are somewhat smaller, female entrepreneurs feel more in control and happier with their situation than if they worked as an employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loscocco | first1 = K. A. | last2 = Leicht | first2 = K. T. | year = 1993 | title = Gender, work-family linkages, and economic success among small- business owners | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 875–887 | doi=10.2307/352769}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Female entrepreneurship has been recognized as an important source of economic growth. Female entrepreneurs create new jobs for themselves and others and also provide society with different solutions to management, organisation, and business problems. However, they still represent a minority of all entrepreneurs. Female entrepreneurs often face gender-based barriers to starting and growing their businesses, like discriminatory property; matrimonial and inheritance laws, and/or cultural practices; lack of access to formal finance mechanisms; limited mobility and access to information and networks, etc.

A woman's entrepreneurship can make a particularly strong contribution to the economic well-being of the family and communities, poverty reduction and women's empowerment, thus contributing to the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). Thus, governments across the world, as well as various developmental organizations, are actively undertaking the promotion of female entrepreneurs through various schemes, incentives and promotional measures. Female entrepreneurs in the four southern states and Maharashtra account for over 50% of all women-led small-scale industrial units in India{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

=== Obstacles to growing firms ===
A specific problem of female entrepreneurs seems to be their inability to achieve growth, especially sales growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Du Rietz | first1 = A. | last2 = Henrekson | first2 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Testing the female underperformance hypothesis | url = | journal = Small Business Economics | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another issue is finance and, as stated previously, the entrepreneurial process is somewhat dependent on initial conditions. In other words, as women often have a difficult time assembling external resources, they start as less ambitious firms that can be financed to a greater degree by their own available resources. This also has consequences for the future growth of the firm. Basically, firms with more resources at start-up have a higher probability to grow than firms with fewer resources. Resources include the following: societal position, human resources, and financial resources. This initial endowment in the firm is of great importance for firm survival and especially for firm growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brüderl | first1 = J. | last2 = Schussler | first2 = R. | year = 1990 | title = Organizational Mortality: The liabilities of newness and adolescence | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 35 | issue = 3| pages = 530–548 | doi=10.2307/2393316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = A.

A study by the Kauffman Foundation of 570 high-tech firms started in 2004 showed that women-owned firms were more likely to be organized as sole proprietorships, both during their startup year and in the years to follow. Female entrepreneurs were also much more likely to start their firms out of their homes and were less likely to have employees. This fact may serve as an indication that women either anticipated having smaller firms or were operating under resource constraints that did not allow them to launch firms requiring more assets, employees, or financial resources. This study also found that women only raised 70% of the amount that men raised to start their firms, which ultimately impacted their ability to introduce new products and services or expand their business in terms of employees or geographic locations.&lt;ref name="kauffman.org"/&gt;

Despite the fact that many female entrepreneurs face growth barriers, they are still able to achieve substantial firm growth. There are examples of these both in a number of developing economies (Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zambia) surveyed by the [[ILO]], as well as in more developed economies such as the United States.

== Encouragement ==

In 1993, "Take Our Daughters To Work Day" was popularized to support career exploration for girls, and later expanded to [[Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day]]. [[Hillary Clinton]] stated that "Investing in women is not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do."&lt;ref&gt;unfoundation.org&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that there are many support groups for women in business, for female entrepreneurs, and for women looking for business advice. Women in different areas are willing to show the support that in some cases, they never had. They offer encouragement, advice, and support to moms who seek to provide for their families through their own visions for business. [http://www.hercorner.org HerCorner], is a group located in Washington, D.C.  This groups seeks to bring women business owners together to collaborate with each other for the betterment of their businesses. There are government backed programs available to female entrepreneurs and information can be found on their website at [http://www.sba.gov/about-offices-content/1/2895 SBA Online] and their Facebook group [https://www.facebook.com/SBAgov?ref=br_tf SBAgov]. Female-only taxi companies in India, the UAE, and Brazil support working women.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter. (2011, 08 27). The daughter also rises women are storming emerging-world boardrooms. Retrieved from http://www.economist.com/node/21526872&lt;/ref&gt; One example of successful female entrepreneurship in rural villages of [[Bangladesh]] is the Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme (ISEP). Norway celebrates Female Entrepreneur of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.tu.no/artikler/nuria-espallargas-er-arets-kvinnelige-teknologigrunder/377716 |title=Nuria Espallargas er årets kvinnelige teknologigründer|publisher= [[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for launching firms==

Many studies show that women start their own businesses for a variety of reasons. These reasons include the following: having an idea for a business plan, having passion for solving a specifically related career problem, wanting to be more in control of their careers, maintaining a more balanced life, having a flexible work  schedule, and taking a personal vision and turning it into a lucrative business. 
Along with the intense desire to see their vision carried out, these women also have a great ability to multi-task and never feared the risks involved in being self-employed. Women are still facing many issues in the workforce, and being their own boss certainly is more appealing to some of the everyday issues they face outside of entrepreneurship. 
Gender roles are still very much a part of their lives, but for some female entrepreneurs, they feel more in control when working for themselves.

==Feminism==
A [[feminist]] entrepreneur is an individual who applies feminist values and approaches through entrepreneurship, with the goal of improving the quality of life and wellbeing of girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=22349|title=Feminine Capital: Unlocking the Power of Women Entrepreneurs|last=Orser|first=Barbara|last2=Elliott|first2=Catherine|date=2015-03-25|publisher=Stanford Business Books|year=|isbn=9780804783798|location=|pages=214|language=English|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are doing so by creating ‘for women, by women’ enterprises.’ Feminist entrepreneurs are motivated to enter commercial markets by desire to create wealth and social change, based on the ethics of cooperation, equality, and mutual respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbara J.

The '''Financial District''' (Financial Core) is a neighborhood in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] south of the [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California|Bunker Hill]] district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discoverlosangeles.com 2012-2013 Official Visitors Map], Los Angeles Tourism &amp; Convention Board, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The two neighborhoods are divided roughly at 5th Street.  Like Bunker Hill, the Financial District is home to corporate office skyscrapers, hotels and related services as well as banks, law firms, and real estate companies.

==History==
The Financial District was created by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency to provide an alternative to the old [[Spring Street Financial District]], which fell into decline in the second half of the 20th Century.

Demand for apartments in downtown Los Angeles surged in 2010 and the years following. In 2015, thousands of apartments were under construction or proposed for the area around 8th Street.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, Roger (February 19, 2015) [http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-0219-property-report-grand-20150219-story.html "Whole Foods to anchor posh apartment complex in downtown L.A."] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
The [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] ([[Metro Rail (Los Angeles County)|Metro Rail]] &amp; [[Metro Liner (Los Angeles County)|Metro Liner]]), and [[Los Angeles Department of Transportation|LADOT]] (DASH &amp; Commuter Express) provide heavy rail (subway), light rail, and local bus services throughout the Financial Core and to the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]].

[[7th St/Metro Center (LACMTA Station)|7th St/Metro Center]] station provides primary access to Metro [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Red Line]], [[Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Purple Line]], [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Blue Line]], and [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Expo Line]].

==Landmarks==
The Financial District contains some of the city's more significant destinations and buildings, including:
* [[611 Place]]
* [[777 Tower]]
* [[Aon Center (Los Angeles)]]
* [[Brockman Building]]
* [[Citigroup Center (Los Angeles)]]
* [[City National Bank Plaza]]

'''Financial Reporting Standards Board''' (FRSB) is a board of [[New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants]]. Its objective is to develop, revise and maintain definite accounting standards and providing guidance through research bulletins or technical practice aids in all aspects of financial reporting. FRSB forwards new accounting standards to the [[Accounting Standards Review Board]] (ASRB) for approval. It also works with the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB).

'''Francisco de Pando y Armand''' (1900-1977) was a sugar estate owner in [[Cuba]] known for his influential leadership in the Cuban sugar industry. He was owner of four sugar producing estates, with land holdings in excess of 24,000 acres. de Pando engaged in corporate and political activities and held interests in various railways and banks.

== Biography ==
de Pando was a Cuban and the only son of [[Luis Manuel de Pando y Sánchez|Lieutenant-General Luis Manuel de Pando y Sánchez]] and Cecilia Armand-Roche.

== Professional career ==
As president and principal owner of the sugar estates Central Romelié S.A., and Santa Cecilia S.A. each consisting of approximately 12,000 acres with a daily production capacity of 150,000 bags and 2,600 employees, de Pando was the 97th-ranked landowner in Cuba.&lt;ref name="Proporietarios"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Los Proprietarios de Cuba 1958 | author = Guillermo Jiminez Soler | volume = Editorial de Ciencias Sociales, La Habana, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
de Pando served as director and one of the majority shareholders of the Cuban corporation "Compañia Cubana", owner of 2 sugar estates, which represented the 15th and 7th most important with respect to capitalization.&lt;ref name="Proporietarios"/&gt;

In 1958, he was Vice-President of the General Board of Members of ICEA (Institute of Economic Sciences and Autonomous-Management), and Vice-President I of the ANHC (National Association of Cuban Sugar Mill Owners), where he presided on 2 occasions during the 1940s, and in 1951-1956. Consulting Counselor, 1952-1955.

de Pando was declared by the Castro government as the most influential leader in the Cuban sugar industry.&lt;ref name="Gaceta"&gt;{{cite news | title = Resolution # 729 | newspaper = Gaceta Official de la Republica de Cuba | date = October 19, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1917, the maternal side of his family, the Armand-Roches, became co-owners of the Romelié sugar estate, along with the Brooks family heirs. The Brooks family was English, and owners of several sugar estates in the Guantánamo region, along with the McKinleys. They were partners from 1905 until the mid-1920s when the de Pando family became the sole owners of Romelie.&lt;ref name="Proporietarios"/&gt;

In the 1940s, de Pando entered into an agreement with [[Julio Lobo|Julio Lobo Olavarría]] and with Dr. Delio Nuñez Mesa, for the purchase of more sugar interests. 

Later, in March 1944, de Pando and Julio Lobo participated in the purchase of the “Tinguaro” sugar estate for $1,650,000,(approx $14.6 M in today's dollars) along with Rafael Águila Sarduy and others. De Pando was an advisor and minority shareholder of the "Banco Atlántico" from its founding in 1951 until its sale in April 1954 to “The Trust Company of Cuba.” In 1953, de Pando was a member of the board of directors of “The Cuba Company.”&lt;ref name="Proporietarios"/&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
In 1956, he established with a generous donation, the General Pando Legacy. This foundation in honor of his father, General Luis Manuel de Pando, was intended to honor Spanish military survivors and the museum of engineers. It was to be managed by the association of engineers.&lt;ref name="Asinto"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Revista de la asociacion de ingenieros de construccion y electricidad y del arma de ingenieros | volume = Asinto, January–March 1992 Num. 152, page 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
De Pando married Emma Ramsden y de la Torre, daughter of Frederick Wollaston Ramsden, former British Consul General and Susana de la Torre. Their only son, Luis Manuel de Pando y Ramsden later married María Victoria Quiroga and had four children. Luis Manuel was a Vice-President of the sugar estates.&lt;ref name="Proporietarios"/&gt;

On September 21, 1961, de Pando and his family were forced into exile when the Castro government announced the expropriation of all the family property and holdings. They settled in Key Biscayne, Florida. De Pando divided his time between there and Madrid until his death in Madrid in 1977.

{{refimprove|date=May 2014}}
{{Capitalism|Concepts}}
A '''free price system''' or '''free price mechanism''' (informally called ''the price system'' or ''the price mechanism'') is a mechanism of resource allocation that relies upon [[Money|monetary prices]] set by the interchange of [[supply and demand]]. The resulting prices serve as ''[[price signal|signal]]s'' communicated between producers and consumers which serve to guide the production and distribution of resources. Through the free price system, supplies are rationed, income is distributed, and resources are allocated. 

A free price system contrasts with a [[Administered price|fixed price system]] where prices are administered by [[government]] in a [[controlled market]]. The price system, whether ''free'' or controlled, contrasts with physical and non-monetary [[economic planning]].

==Mechanics of a free price system==
[[Image:PriceFreedom.svg|thumb|left|300px|A diagram presenting the argument for free prices]]
Rather than prices being set by the state, as in a [[command economy]] with a ''fixed price system'', prices are determined in a decentralized fashion by trades that occur as a result of sellers' ''asking prices'' matching buyers' ''bid prices'' as a result of [[subjective theory of value|subjective value judgement]] in a [[market economy]]. Since resources of consumers are limited at any given time, consumers are relegated to satisfying wants in a descending hierarchy and bidding prices relative to the urgency of a variety of wants. This information on relative values is communicated, through ''[[price signal]]s'', to producers whose resources are also limited. In turn, relative prices for the productive services are established. The interchange of these two sets of prices establish market value, and serve to guide the rationing of resources, distributing income, and allocating resources.

Those goods which command the highest prices (when summed among all individuals) provide an incentive for businesses to provide these goods in a corresponding descending hierarchy of priority. However, the ordering of this hierarchy of wants is not constant. Consumer preferences change. When consumer preferences for a good increase, then bidding pressure raises the price for a particular good as it moves to a higher position in the hierarchy. As a result of higher prices for this good, more productive forces are applied to satisfying the demand driven by the opportunity for higher profits in satisfying this new consumer preference. In other words, the high price sends a ''price signal'' to producers. This causes producers to increase supply, either by the same firms increasing production or new businesses coming into the market, which eventually lowers the price and the profit incentive to increase supplies. Hence, the now lower price provides a price signal to producers to decrease production and, as a result, a surplus is prevented. Since resources are scarce (including labor and capital), supplies of other goods will be diminished as the productive resources are taken from other areas of production to be applied toward increasing output of the good that has risen in the hierarchy of consumer preferences. Also, as resources become more scarce the price increases, which signals to consumers to reduce consumption thereby ensuring that the quantity demanded does not exceed the quantity supplied. It is in this way that the free price system persuades consumers to ration dwindling resources. Hence, supply and demand affect price, while at the same time price affects supply and demand. If prices remain high because increases in supply cannot keep pace with demand, then this also signals other business to provide substitute goods in order to take advantage of profit opportunities.

Individual employments and incomes are also guided by the price system. Employment will move toward those goods and services that consumers value and away from those with declining importance to consumers as a result of changes in prices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13899">In [[computing]], '''geolocation software''' is software that is capable of deducing the [[geolocation]] of a device connected to the Internet. The identification of a device's [[IP address]] can be used to determine the country, city, or post/[[ZIP code]], determining an object's geographical location.&lt;ref name=oreilly&gt;{{cite book|title=HTML5 Geolocation|last=Holdener|first=Anthony T.|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|year=2011|isbn=9781449304720|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods include examination of a [[MAC address]], [[International Press Telecommunications Council|image metadata]], or [[credit card]] information.

==Data sources==
An [[IP address]] is assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a [[computer network]] that uses the [[Internet Protocol]] for communication.&lt;ref name=rfc760&gt;{{IETF RFC|760}}, ''DOD Standard Internet Protocol'' (January 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol specifies that  each IP packet must have a [[Header (computing)|header]] which contains, among other things, the IP address of the sender of the packet.

There are a number of free and paid subscription geolocation [[database]]s, ranging from country level to state or city—including ZIP/[[post code]] level—each with varying claims of accuracy (generally higher at the country level). These databases typically contain IP address data which may be used in firewalls, ad servers, routing, mail systems, web sites, and other automated systems where geolocation may be useful. An alternative to hosting and querying a database is to obtain the country code for a given IP address through a [[DNSBL]]-style lookup from a remote server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netop.org/services/ip-geolocation|title=IP geolocation (The NetOp Organization)|accessdate=2009-02-04|date=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commercial databases have augmented geolocation software with demographic data to enable demographic-type targeting using IP address data.&lt;ref name=oreilly/&gt;

The primary source for IP address data is the [[regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] which allocate and distribute IP addresses amongst organizations located in their respective service regions:

* [[AfriNIC|African Network Information Centre]] (AfriNIC)
* [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN)
* [[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre]] (APNIC)
* [[LACNIC|Latin American and Caribbean Internet Address Registry]] (LACNIC)
* [[RIPE NCC|RIPE Network Coordination Centre]] (RIPE NCC)

Secondary sources include:

* [[Data mining]] or user-submitted geographic location data. For example, a weather web site might ask visitors for a city name to find their local forecast. Another example would be to pair a user's IP address with the address information in his/her account profile.
* Data contributed by [[internet service provider]]s.
* Merging databases from different suppliers.
* [[Guesstimate]]s from adjacent [[Classful network|Class C range]]&lt;ref&gt;An example is the guessed city provided by hostip.info.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or gleaned from network [[hop (telecommunications)|hops]].
* Network routing information collected to the end point of IP address.

Accuracy is improved by:
* [[Data scrubbing]] to filter out or identify [[software anomaly|anomalies]].
* [[Statistics|Statistical analysis]] of user submitted data.
* Utilizing third-party tests conducted by reputable organizations.

A farmstead northeast of [[Potwin, Kansas]] became the default site of 600 million [[IP address]]es (due to their lack of fine granularity) when the Massachusetts-based digital mapping company [[MaxMind]] changed the putative [[geographic center of the contiguous United States]] from 39.8333333,-98.585522 to 38.0000,-97.0000.&lt;ref name="Potwin, Kansas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fusion.net/story/287592/internet-mapping-glitch-kansas-farm/ | title=How an internet mapping glitch turned a random Kansas farm into a digital hell | publisher=Fusion | date=2016-04-10 | accessdate=2016-04-10 | author=Hill, Kashmir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privacy==
A distinction can be made between ''co-operative'' and ''oppositional'' geolocation. In some cases, it is in the interest of users to be accurately located, for example, so that they can be offered information relevant to their location. In other cases, users prefer to not disclose their location for privacy or other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sethf.com/nitke/ashcroft.php|title=Nitke vs. Ashcroft - Expert report of Seth Finkelstein|date=2003-11-10|accessdate=2004-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical measures for ensuring [[anonymity]], such as [[proxy server]]s, can be used to circumvent restrictions imposed by geolocation software. Some sites detect the use of proxies and anonymizers, and may either block service or provide non-localized content in response.&lt;ref&gt;RealNetworks detects proxies and anonymizers; Google serves non-localized content if location is in doubt. {{cite web |url=http://wired-vig.wired.com/news_drop/news_lycatalog/story/0,2149,64178,00.html |title=Geolocation: Don't Fence Web In |date=2004-07-12 |publisher=Wired |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514234503/http://wired-vig.wired.com/news_drop/news_lycatalog/story/0,2149,64178,00.html |archivedate=2006-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the application of the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] means that geolocation will only yield the physical address of the ISP.

==Applications==
Geolocation technology has been under development only since 1999, and the first patents were granted in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Digital-Envoy-wins-geotargeting-patent/2110-1032_3-5251844.html |title=Digital Envoy wins Geotargeting Patent |accessdate=2010-04-19 |date=2004-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617060350/http://news.cnet.com/Digital-Envoy-wins-geotargeting-patent/2110-1032_3-5251844.html |archivedate=June 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is already widely used in multiple industries,&lt;ref name=industries&gt;[http://clientsidenews.com/downloads/CSNV10I6.pdf   ClientSideNews, Nov/Dec 2010 issue, Page 6 “You Can Really Do That? – The Power of Geolocation Technology” ]&lt;/ref&gt; including e-retail, banking, media, telecommunications, education, travel,&lt;ref name=travel&gt;[http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/1054072/Thetrainline-brings-Digital-Element-board-localised-ad-task/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH Marketing Magazine, February 10, 2011 “Thetrainline brings Digital Element on board for localised ad task”]&lt;/ref&gt; hospitality, entertainment, health care, online gaming and law enforcement, for preventing [[online fraud]], complying with regulations, managing digital rights&lt;ref name=rights&gt;[http://www.digitalelement.com/success_stories/we7.html Music Streaming site we7 Cranks up the Volume for Digital Rights Management and Ad Targeting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206040230/http://www.digitalelement.com/success_stories/we7.html |date=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and serving targeted [[marketing]] content and [[pricing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1433634|title=Geolocation and Federalism on the Internet: Cutting Internet Gambling's Gordian Knot|accessdate=2010-01-02|date=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has proposed that geolocation software might be leveraged to support [[9-1-1]] location determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2011/db0712/DOC-308377A1.pdf| title= FCC Strengthens Enhanced 911 Location Accuracy Requirements for Wireless Services |access-date= April 27, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811023438/http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2011/db0712/DOC-308377A1.pdf |archivedate=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An IP address or the [[one-to-one correspondence|related unique]] [[URL]] may also investigated with basic functions, typing from the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] two instructions: [[ping (networking utility)|ping]] and [[traceroute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/traceroute-geolocation.html|title= File traceroute-geolocation|language= en|access-date= March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Unix-like]] systems, they are available as a command line tool. In the same way, [[Microsoft Windows]] has the prompt of [[DOS]] working with those instructions.

===Criminal investigations===

Banks, software vendors and other online enterprises in the USA and elsewhere became subject to strict "[[Know your customer]]" laws imposed by the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], the [[Bank Secrecy Act]], the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]]'s [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] and other regulatory entities in the US and Europe from the early twenty-first century. These laws are intended to prevent money laundering, trafficking with terrorist organizations, and trading with banned nations. When it is possible to identify the true location of online visitors, geolocation can protect banks from participating in the transfer of funds for illicit purposes.  More and more prosecuting bodies are bringing cases involving cyber-crimes such as cyber-stalking and identity theft. Prosecutors often have the capability of determining the [[IP address]] data necessary to link a suspect to a particular crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://superiorcourtblog.com/sean-erenstoft-lectures-on-authenticating-web-evidence/ Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney, Wendy Segall Hides Evidence.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraud detection===
Online retailers and payment processors use geolocation to detect possible [[credit card fraud]] by comparing the user's location to the billing address on the account or the shipping address provided. A mismatch – an order placed from the US on an account number from Tokyo, for example – is a strong indicator of potential fraud. IP address geolocation can be also used in [[fraud detection]] to match billing address postal code or area code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Identity Theft|last=Vacca|first=John R.|publisher=[[Prentice Hall Professional]]|year=2003|isbn=9780130082756|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks can prevent "[[phishing]]" attacks, [[money laundering]] and other security breaches by determining the user's location as part of the authentication process. [[Whois]] databases can also help verify [[IP address]]es and registrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcall.com/business/finance/mc-biz-bank-share-location-20171127-story.html|title=Sharing your location with your bank seems creepy, but it's useful|last=Barba|first=Robert|work=[[The Morning Call]]|date=2017-11-18|accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government, law enforcement and corporate security teams use geolocation as an investigatory tool, tracking the Internet routes of online attackers to find the perpetrators and prevent future attacks from the same location.

===Geo marketing===
Since geolocation software can get the information of user location, companies using [[geo (marketing)|geomarketing]] may provide [[web content]] or products that are famous or useful in that location. Advertisements and content on a website may be tailored to provide the information that a certain user wants.&lt;ref name=wants&gt;[http://www.internetretailer.com/2010/06/25/personalized-web-site-content-gives-retailers-edge Internet Retailer “Personalized web site content gives retailers an edge’, June 25, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional licensing===
[[Internet]] movie vendors, online broadcasters who serve live streaming video of sporting events, or certain TV and music video sites that are licensed to broadcast their videos of episodes/music videos are permitted to serve viewers only in their licensed territories. By geolocating viewers, they can be certain of obeying licensing regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/CinemaNow-appeases-studios-by-locating-Web-surfers/2100-1023_3-253169.html|publisher=CNet|title=CinemaNow appeases studios by locating Web surfers|date=2001-02-26|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online gambling websites must also know where their customers violate gambling laws, or risk doing so.

Jim Ramo, chief executive of movie distributor Movielink, said studios were aware of the shortcomings going in and have grown more confident now that the system has been shown to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,64178,00.html |publisher=Wired News |author=Associated Press |title=Geolocation: Don't Fence Web In |date=2004-07-12 |accessdate=2006-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909221543/http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,64178,00.html |archivedate=2006-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaming===
A [[location-based game]] is a type of [[pervasive game]] &lt;!--typically?--&gt;for [[smartphone]]s or other [[mobile device]]s in which the [[gameplay]] evolves and progresses via a player's real-world location which is typically reported via [[GPS]]. Examples of such games include [[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]] and [[Pokémon Go]].

==Life==

George Clerk was born in  Edinburgh on 31 October 1715, the second son of [[Sir John Clerk, 2nd Baronet]] of Penicuik, and Janet Inglis, daughter of [[Sir John Inglis, 2nd Baronet]] of [[Cramond]]. He was educated at the [[University of Edinburgh|universities of Edinburgh]] and [[University of Leyden|Leyden]]. From his father he received in patrimony the lands of Drumcrieff in [[Annandale]], and by [[cousin marriage|marriage with his cousin]] Dorothea Clerk-Maxwell, daughter of his uncle William by Agnes Maxwell, heiress of [[Middlebie]], [[Dumfriesshire]], he obtained the lands of Middlebie, [[Name_change#Historical_usage|adopting thereupon his wife's name]], Clerk Maxwell.

He was a commissioner of the customs, king's remembrancer in the exchequer, and one of the trustees for improving fisheries and manufactures in Scotland. Both in his private and public capacity he promoted the agricultural and commercial interests of the country. At Dumfries he erected at considerable expense a linen manufactory, and he set on foot a variety of projects for the mining of lead and copper in the county. In 1755 he addressed two letters to the trustees for the improvement of the fisheries and manufactures of Scotland, regarding the common mode of treating wool, which were published by direction of the board in 1756. He was also the author of a paper on shallow ploughing, read before the members of the [[Philosophical Society]], and published in the third volume of their essays. He was a remarkably clever draughtsman, and etched a variety of views of Scotland. On the death of his elder brother in 1782, he succeeded to the baronetcy and estates of Penicuik. 

In 1783 he was one of the joint founders of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died 29 January 1784.

[[John Clerk, Lord Eldin|George's father]], his brother [[John Clerk of Eldin|John]] and himself were friends of [[James Hutton]].

==Family==

He married Dorothea Clerk Maxwell of Middlebie.

He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son [[John Clerk-Maxwell]]. He had four other sons and four daughters.

He was the great-grandfather of the famous physicist [[ James Clerk Maxwell]].

A '''Guarantee of Origin''' ('''GO''' or '''GoO''') is a tracking instruments defined in article 15 of the [[Renewable Energy Directive 2009|European Directive 2009/28/EC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenfact.com/|title=Greenfact|website=greenfact.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GO labels electricity from renewable sources to provide information to electricity customers on the source of their energy. Guarantees of origin are the only precisely defined instruments evidencing the origin of electricity generated from renewable energy sources.

== Certificate ==
In operation, a GO is a green label or tracker that guarantees that one MWh of electricity has been produced from renewable energy sources. Guarantees of origin are traded. When a company buys guarantees of origin, as documentation for the electricity delivered or consumed, the guarantees of origin are cancelled in the electronic certificate registry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aib-net.org/certification/c_faq/reliability&lt;/ref&gt; This single standardized instrument makes it possible to track ownership, verify claims and ensure that guarantees of origin are only sold once and that there is no double counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aib-net.org/certification/c_faq/reliability|title=Reliability &gt;&gt;|website=www.aib-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In their most accomplished form, guarantees of origin are issued electronically for a controlled quantity of electricity generation (1 GO per MWh), traded and redeemed (i.e. used) by suppliers as evidence to their customers of the quality of the delivered electricity. Generation from renewable energy sources is the most sought-after attribute. A new development concerns guarantees of origin for cogeneration heat plants (or CHP). Some countries already have guarantees of origin issued for all types of electricity generation.

AIB statistics from 2016 show that Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands are the largest markets for guarantees of origin in Europe. While Europe's biggest market, Germany, halted its rapid growth, the Dutch market continued to grow at a faster pace than the rest, almost reaching 50 TWh in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://renewablesnow.com/news/demand-for-documented-renewable-power-in-europe-continues-to-grow-559820/ |title=Demand for documented renewable power in Europe continues to grow |publisher=Renewablesnow.com |date=2017-02-28 |accessdate=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guarantees of origin should not be confused with the [[Eugene Green Energy Standard]] or [[EKOenergy]] labelling scheme. Both provide consumers with more information about their power ([[transparency (market)|transparency]]). However, Eugene and EKOenergy go further by requiring additionality. Besides, Eugene and EKOenergy are private initiatives whereas guarantees of origin arise from European regulations.&lt;ref&gt;see Directives 2001/77/EC, [[Directive 2004/8/EC|2004/8/EC]] and logically 2003/54/EC, all applicable in the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
The GO is standardized through the European Energy Certificate System (EECS) provided by the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB). The [[European Energy Certificate System|EECS]] makes trade, cancelation and use of GOs standardized across AIB members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aib-net.org/certification/introduction/content|title=Content &gt;&gt;|website=www.aib-net.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

=== Production period ===

Refers to the month and year when the electricity was produced.

=== Issued ===

GOs created in a month for electricity produced in an earlier month.

=== Transfer ===

Transfer is the delivery process of GO from one party to another.

=== Import – export ===

GOs can originate from another country than the country of consumption. GOs can be imported (exported) from another country either via import (export), or via cancellation.

=== Cancellation ===

Cancellation is analogous to physical 'use' of a GO certificate and is the method for allocating the attributes of the electricity to the single end-user. Cancelling a GO is the only way to redeem its benefits while ensuring that the certificate will not be traded, given, sold, or used by another end-user. Consumer information and avoidance of double counting is the main objective of this system.

==History==

The region of Gurgaon originally fell under the [[Kuru Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of India|last=|first=|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc, 2010|year=|isbn=1615301224|location=|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest people to inhabit the city were Hindus of the [[Ahir clans|Ahir]] clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gurugram.gov.in/history/|title=History {{!}} Gurugram|website=gurugram.gov.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yadu]] tribes were a part of this clan and today their descendants commonly hold the last name ''Yadav''. In the [[Mahabharata]], Gurgaon is described as the village of [[Drona|Guru Dronacharya]], guru of the [[Kaurava]]s and [[Pandava]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-gurgaon-to-gurugram-how-the-epic-mahabharata-inspired-haryana-govt-to-change-millennium-city-s-name-323801|title=Gurgaon to Gurugram: How the epic ‘Mahabharata’ inspired Haryana govt to change millennium city's name|date=2016-04-13|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 4th century BCE, the city was absorbed by the [[Maurya Empire]] as part of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]'s earliest expansions of his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Constance Jones; James D.

On 12 April 2016, [[Chief Minister of Haryana]] [[Manohar Lal Khattar]] announced a proposal to officially rename the city ''Gurugram'' ([[Sanskrit]]: गुरुग्राम, lit. ''village of the [[Guru]]''), subject to the approval of the [[Government of Haryana|Haryana cabinet]] and the [[Government of India|Union Government]]. He argued that the new name would help to preserve the "rich heritage" of the city by emphasising its history and mythological association with [[Dronacharya]].&lt;ref name="indianexpress-gurugram"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gurgaon-gurugram-rename-mewat-nuh-haryana-government/|title=Gurgaon is now ‘Gurugram’, Mewat renamed Nuh: Haryana government|date=12 April 2016|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hs-gurugram"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/gurgaon/welcome-to-the-new-office-of-gurugram-police-commissioner/story-MnJBQaVSz2w5II5qOe0p6O.html|title=Welcome to the new office of Gurugram police commissioner|website=Hindustan Times|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times-paradox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Gurgaon-The-city-whose-middle-name-is-paradox/articleshow/52948904.cms|title=Gurgaon: The city whose middle name is paradox|website=The Times of India|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 2016, Manohar Lal Khattar officially announced that the Union Government had approved the name change, and thus the city and district would henceforth be known as Gurugram.&lt;ref name="toi-nameofficial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Good-morning-Gurugram-The-names-official/articleshow/54553616.cms|title=Good morning, Gurugram.

=== Transit systems ===

==== Public transit ====
In November, 2013, Gurgaon launched an ''[[Ciclovia]]''-inspired initiative known as ''Raahgiri Day''—in which a corridor of streets are closed to motor vehicle traffic on Sunday mornings to encourage the use of non-motorized transport and participation in outdoor leisure activities. Gurgaon was the first city in India to implement such a program, followed by New Delhi, and later Noida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New area in Gurgaon to have 'Raahgiri Day'|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/new-area-in-gurgaon-to-have-raahgiri-day-114022700947_1.html|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=Business Standard|date=27 February 2014|agency=IANS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=fwire|title=New area in Gurgaon to have 'Raahgiri Day'|url=http://www.firstpost.com/fwire/new-area-in-gurgaon-to-have-raahgiri-day-1411729.html|accessdate=28 November 2014|agency=IANS|publisher=Firstpost|date=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesofindia-raahgiri"&gt;{{cite web|title=Raahgiri: Less honking, more bonding — How Gurgaon showed the way|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Raahgiri-Less-honking-more-bonding-How-Gurgaon-showed-the-way/articleshow/51468982.cms|accessdate=15 April 2016|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Utilities ==
Electricity in Gurgaon is provided by government-owned [[Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam]]. Gurgaon has power consumer base of 360,000 with average power load of 700-800 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Essar withdraws application for distribution licence in Gurgaon |url= http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-essar-withdraws-application-for-distribution-licence-in-gurgaon-370169|accessdate=25 October 2013 |date= 22 October 2013 |agency=PTI}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are frequent power outages in the city, especially during the peak consumption season of summer. Apart from the power deficit, the equipment used by the power department like transformers, panels and transmission lines is either old or overburdened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Night-long outage in Old Gurgaon as transformer trips on demand |url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Night-long-outage-in-Old-Gurgaon-as-transformer-trips-on-demand/articleshow/35530345.cms |accessdate= 10 June 2014 |agency=TNN |publisher= The Times of India |date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

=== Flooding ===
Gurgaon is notorious for its urban floods every monsoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/haryana/dont-travel-to-water-logged-gurugram-police-advises-delhiites-heavy-traffic-jam-on-delhi-jaipur-highway_1912850.html|title=Traffic nightmare in Gurgaon; waterlogging on NH8 hits Delhi-Jaipur route, schools shut|date=2016-07-29|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en|newspaper=Zee News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The areas on NH-8 around Hero Honda Chowk, Basai, Dhankot, sector 37 etc. see massive urban floods and headlines grabbing traffic jams reported widely in news media.  A recent research report puts the blame on the broken natural water body linkage and obstructions in the flow in the city due to frantic construction during the last decades.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ballotboxindia.com/ap/gurgaon-floods/5182049549/|title=Why Gurgaon Floods, a report on watershed management and imminent dangers the city faces.|date=2016-07-11|access-date=2017-02-16|language=hi|newspaper=Why Gurgaon Floods, a report on watershed management and imminent dangers the city faces.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurgaon's Ghata Jheel, Badshahpur Jheel, Khandsa Talab were linked to [[Najafgarh drain]] which links to [[Yamuna river]], via natural water channels and drains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As per the ground reports and research, the three natural water bodies are struggling for their existence with encroachments on their lands and natural channels. Agencies responsible have tried to create artificial water bodies to compensate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Huda-to-speed-up-construction-of-additional-discharge-drain-under-service-road-of-NH-8/articleshow/51617586.cms|title=Huda to speed up construction of additional discharge drain under service road of NH-8 - Times of India|access-date=2017-02-16|newspaper=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the efforts fail due to unpredictable rain and water flow patterns leading to deployment of water pumps to fight the situation.

In 2012 Punjab &amp; Haryana High court banned ground water usage for construction activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gurgaon-builders-left-high-and-dry/1/208705.html|title=Gurgaon builders left high and dry|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NGT has recently reprimanded authorities for drain concretization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/gurgaon/ngt-seeks-report-on-drawbacks-and-impact-of-concretization-of-natural-drains/story-PuuS2lJHU4JZhmoRWr93PP.html|title=NGT seeks report on drawbacks and impact of concretization of natural drains|date=2017-02-01|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en|newspaper=Hindustan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
Ghani was born on October 29, 1960 in the [[Logar Province]] of Afghanistan. An ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] from the [[Ahmadzai (Ghilji clan)|Ahmadzai]] tribe of the [[Ghilji]], Ghani’s grandfather brought King Zahir Shah’s father, King [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], into power in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="politicalpast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalpast.com/Hashmat_Ghani_Ahmadzai/|title=Hashmat Ghani Ahmadzai|publisher=politicalpast.com|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father served [[King Zahir Shah]] in many ministerial roles, last holding the title of Minister of Transport from the late 1950s until the King was deposed in 1973. Following the overthrow of the King's government, Ghani and his family joined the former King and royalists in exile as part of what came to be known as the Rome Group, which flourished as a political organization though it was not a formal political party.&lt;ref name="afghan-bios"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghan-bios.info/index.php?option=com_afghanbios&amp;id=81&amp;task=view&amp;total=6&amp;start=1&amp;Itemid=2|title=Database|publisher=afghan-bios.info|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grand Council Chieftain of the Kuchis ==
Hashmat Ghani Ahmadzai, chief of the Grand Council of Kuchis, is among the wealthiest and most influential Kuchis, thanks to a large family inheritance based on land ownership as well as a successful transport company. He is also a vice president of an American security and reconstruction company. As chief of the Kuchi council, which represents the interests of largely settled Kuchi tribes, Ghani deals with important Afghan politicians, including former President [[Hamid Karzai]]. But he says ideas he has put forward to improve life for the poorest nomads, such as providing community centers and integrating them into settled societies, Ghani advocated the establishment of an office for nomadic affairs within Karzai's administration. The office, according to Ghani's vision, would help mediate land disputes and work to build trust among Kuchis and northern ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001|author=Coll, S.|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=9781594200076|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ToYxFL5wmBIC|page=285|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the Grand Council Chieftain of the Kuchis in 2002.

}}'''Hermann Dietrich Upmann''' (born 1 May 1816 in Bielefeld-Altstadt,Germany  - d. 29. January 1894 [[Bremen]], [[Germany]]) was a [[bank]]er, [[merchant]] and cigar manufacturer in [[Cuba]], creator of the [[H. Upmann]] 1844 brand.

With 23 years he embarked for the New World in 1839 to work for an import / export Company: The Gravenhorst &amp; Co. During the voyage, a Briton persuaded him to stay in [[Havana]] where the tobacco business was flourishing. Upmann accepted the suggestion. He learned the processes and secrets of cigar manufacturing, purchased a local cigar [[factory]] at 85 San Miguel Street, Havana, and created the H. Upmann 1844 brand, which is among the oldest cigar brands in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cigars-review.org/cigars/H-Upmann.htm|title=H. Upmann Cigars - Cuban Cigar Reviews|website=www.cigars-review.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand thrives in the international market. In 1855 he received the first of many prizes that he would obtain over the following years. He achieves the qualification of "''Provider of His Majesty [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Don Alfonso XII]], King of Spain''". His is one of the five largest tobacco factories in Cuba. Hermann Upmann becomes a director of the [[Havana cigar|Havana Cigar]] Brand Association, an organization that works to confront the production and sale of [[counterfeit]] cigars .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alnavio.com/la-familia-alemana-que-creo-un-imperio-de-habanos-en-cuba|title=La familia alemana que creó un imperio de habanos en Cuba|last=Latina|first=Noticias y actualidad de Venezuela, México y América|work=Noticias y actualidad de Venezuela, México y América Latina|access-date=2017-10-01|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He nevertheless finds the tropical climate in Cuba difficult, so he decided against a lasting stay.His youngest brother, August Ludwig Upmann (born 1818) started to work with him and thus stayed in Cuba. Hermann Dietrich Upmann returned to Germany in 1848 and founded the cigar company Gebrüder Upmann &amp; Co. Bremen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.h-upmann.de/6.html|title=1844 - 1870 - H.Upmann &amp; Co.

In 1864, his nephew, [[Heinrich Upman]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n, arrived in Cuba. With capital contributed mainly hisuncle, they found an organization dedicated to the banking operations: initially catering to tobacco dealers and manufacturers, whose operations are spread through the Antilles. The company has grown to such an extent that it is transformed into a vertical operation: they take care of the seedbeds, plant, harvest, manufacture, pack and, with their own shipping company, transport their products to other markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-S5IDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT235&amp;dq=herman+upmann&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQmeLWis_WAhXRI1AKHSl3DOQ4ChDoAQg0MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=herman%20upmann&amp;f=false|title=Top 10 Cuba|last=Travel|first=D.

Hermann Upmann retired in 1890, and was succeeded at [[H. Upmann &amp; Co.|H.Upmann &amp; Co]] by his nephew, [[Heinrich Upmann]], who continued the business with his partners [[Heinrich Runken]] and [[Theodore Garbade]]. The later was president of the Union of Cigar manufacturers of the Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nUkrAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=teodoro+garbade&amp;dq=teodoro+garbade&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxzNHptsrWAhUKYlAKHQoMC0YQ6AEIPjAE|title=Colección legislativa|last=Cuba|date=1920|publisher=Rambla y Bouza|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Heinrich’s death in 1914, he was succeeded by his nephews Hermann and Albert (Alberto) Upmann.

Hermann Upmann died in Bremen 1894 and is buried in the Upmann family grave at the {{Interlanguage link|Riensberger Friedhof|de|Riensberger Friedhof|WD=}} in Bremen.

icCube is a company founded in Switzerland that provides [[business intelligence]] software of the same name. The solution can be fully embedded as an integrated solution, can be hosted in a managed environment or installed locally, on premises.

The BI tool allows end-users to create or edit dashboards themselves and is capable of processing data from multiple sources in real-time. The solution distinguishes itself by making the dashboards, the dashboard builder, the schema/cube builder and the server monitoring application accessible from a browser only. No software has to be installed at the device of the end-user.

Next to the browser-based dashboard builder, data can be accessed by running queries directly on the OLAP cube using MDX, SQL or R.

== History ==
icCube sells an [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP) server.

Starting in June 2010 with its first public community version (0.9.2). Since then, the company has released new versions multiple times per year.

== Architecture ==

icCube is implemented in [[Java programming language|Java]] and follows [[J2ee|J2EE]] standards. For the latter, it embeds both an [[Http|HTTP]] server ([[Jetty (web server)|Jetty]]) and a servlet container to handle all the communication tasks.

Being an in-memory OLAP server, the icCube server does not need to source its data from a RDBMS; any  [http://www.iccube.com/support/documentation/user_guide/schemas_cubes/datasources.html data source] that exposes its data in a tabular form can be used; several plugins exists for accessing files, HTTP stream, etc. Accessing datasource that expose JSON objects is also supported (e.g., MongoDB). icCube is then taking care of possibly complex relations (e.g., many-2-many) implied by the JSON structure.

Accessing icCube (cube modeling, server monitoring, MDX queries, Web reporting and dashboards) is performed through a unique Web interface.

The icCube OLAP server does not use any caching or pre-aggregation mechanism.

=== Interfaces ===

icCube uses  [[Multidimensional Expressions]] (MDX) as its query language and several extensions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwebbbi.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/iccube/|title=Chris Webb on icCube MDX Declared Functions}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the original language : function declarations, vector (even at measures level), matrix, objects, Java and R interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccube.com/newsletter/release-2.5/|title=icCube extends MDX with OO capabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;
icCube patented an MDX debugger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com.ar/patents/US8533218|title=Debugging system for multidimensional database query expressions on a processing server}}&lt;/ref&gt;
icCube supports a standard interface and a proprietary one.
The [[XML for Analysis]] (XMLA protocol can connect to any XMLA compatible reporting tool.

icCube supports its own proprietary protocol called GVI. [[Http|HTTP]] based, it can be extended.
This protocol leverages the Google Visualization wire protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/dev/implementing_data_source|title=Implementing the Chart Tools Datasource Protocol (V0.6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Javascript is the primary implementation language and a Java mapping library is also available.

==Personal life==
Jean-Claude Decaux was the son of a shoe salesman in Beauvais, France.&lt;ref name=newyork&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married with three children and lived in Paris.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

His death was announced on 27 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/27/news/companies/jean-claude-decaux-dies/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-27/outdoor-advertising-pioneer-jean-claude-decaux-dies-at-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At the age of 18, inspired by an argument with his father over the family shoe store's window display, Jean-Claude started a business creating billboards along French roadways.&lt;ref name=newyork&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, legislation in France placed restrictions on billboard use which forced Decaux out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/59/JCDecaux-S-A.html | title=History of JCDecaux S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded JCDecaux in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Directory of Company Histories | volume=76 | page=213 | editor=Tina Grant | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UskAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a deal with the city of Lyon, proposing that he would build bus shelters and keep them clean in exchange for advertising space there. The company quickly expanded to other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Ascent of Media: From Gilgamesh to Google via Gutenberg | author= Roger Parry | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieVEXO6FQm4C&amp;pg=PT125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Decaux personally designed the [[Sanisette | Sanisette public toilet]], a self-cleaning public toilet, as a replacement for the [[Pissoir | '''pissoirs''']] of Paris.&lt;ref name=newyork&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Toilet Wars | author=Peter Hellman | page=42 | journal=New York Magazine | date=May 3, 1993 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EiEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Inclusive Urban Design: Public Toilets | author=Clara Greed | page=80 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sW3_7Zzn_4C&amp;pg=PA80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir''' '''John Gilbert Newton Brown''' [[CBE]] (1916–2003) was Publisher of the [[Oxford University Press]] and has been credited as one of the great leaders of British publishing throughout its post [[World War II]] recovery.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-john-brown-730102.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born on 7 July 1916 and was educated at [[Lancing College]] and [[Hertford College, Oxford]].  After university, he travelled to India to join the Oxford University Press at its [[Bombay]] branch in 1937.  At the outbreak of war, Brown was commissioned into the [[Bombay Light Horse]] before transferring to the [[Royal Artillery]].  He was taken prisoner by the Japanese after the fall of [[Singapore]] and spent the remaining war years as a [[prisoner of war]].

Following release, he rejoined the [[OUP]] in London in 1946 and was appointed Sales Manager in 1949 and Publisher in 1956.  He was elected President of the Publishers' Association in 1963 and helped to found the Book Development Council with John Attenborough.  Brown left the OUP to join the [[Blackwell Publishing]] Group in the 1980s.  He rose to be group Vice-President in 1987, a position he held until his death in 2003.

Brown was appointed CBE in 1966 and knighted in 1974.  He is survived by his wife, son and two daughters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7649">'''Kyvos''' is a [[big data]] [[business intelligence software]] developed by an American [[privately held company]] named '''Kyvos Insights'''. The company, headquartered in [[Los Gatos, California]], was founded in 2012. The software provides [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]]-based [[multidimensional analysis]] on big data and cloud platforms and was launched officially in June 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/300077320/startup-kyvos-insights-exits-stealth-offers-olap-for-hadoop-software.htm|title=Startup Kyvos Insights Exits Stealth, Offers OLAP For Hadoop Software|last=Whiting|first=Rick|date=June 30, 2015|work=CRN Magazine|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://adtmag.com/articles/2015/06/30/kyvos-olap.aspx|title=Kyvos Emerges from Stealth with OLAP on Hadoop|last=Ramel|first=David|date=June 30, 2015|work=ADTmag|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December the same year, the company was listed among the 10 Coolest Big Data Startups of 2015 by [[CRN (magazine)|CRN Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/applications-os/300079062/the-10-coolest-big-data-startups-of-2015.htm/10|title=The 10 Coolest Big Data Startups Of 2015|last=Whiting|first=Rick|date=December 8, 2015|work=CRN Magazine|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The software uses [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]] technology to enable [[business intelligence]] on big data platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.datanami.com/2015/06/30/kyvos-debuts-olap-for-hadoop/|title=Kyvos Debuts OLAP for Hadoop|last=Woodie|first=Alex|date=June 30, 2015|work=Datanami|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report published by [[Forrester Research]] in 2016,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+Native+Hadoop+BI+Platforms+Q3+2016/-/E-RES129500|title=The Forrester Wave™: Native Hadoop BI Platforms, Q3 2016|last=Evelson|first=Boris|date=September 13, 2016|work=Forrester Research|access-date=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they evaluated several native [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] business intelligence (BI) platforms on 22 parameters, Kyvos was referred to as a platform that gave new life to OLAP by bringing it to Hadoop. As per the report, Kyvos enables analysis on Hadoop based on OLAP schemas, aggregations, and predefined drill-down paths. It pre-calculates aggregates at multiple levels of dimensional hierarchies to improve query response times as compared to SQL-on-Hadoop platforms. Users can analyze data through the Kyvos visualization tool or by using other BI platforms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Kyvos was originally built for Hadoop and later on added support for Cloud platforms such as [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS), [[Google Cloud Platform|Google Cloud]] &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=117535|title=Kyvos Insights Now Supports Google Cloud|last=Rowe|first=Sam Del|date=April 12, 2017|work=Destination CRM|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft Azure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/kyvos-insights-embraces-microsoft-azure-hdinsight/|title=Kyvos Insights embraces Microsoft Azure, HDInsight|last=Brust|first=Andrew|date=March 22, 2016|work=ZD Net|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it supported only MDX queries and integrated with [[data visualization]] tools such as [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] and [[Tableau Software|Tableau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2942859/big-data/kyvos-serves-up-hadoop-on-cubes.html|title=Kyvos serves up Hadoop on cubes|last=Jackson|first=Joab|date=July 1, 2015|work=Computer World|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, Kyvos 4.0 added support for SQL connectivity extending integration to other BI tools such as [[BusinessObjects|Business Objects]], [[Cognos]],  [[MicroStrategy]], [[Power BI]] and [[Qlik]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In late 2018, Version 5 of the software was built specifically for the cloud with elastic OLAP to provide a cloud native way to scale up and down for changing data workloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.datanami.com/this-just-in/kyvos-insights-announces-the-availability-of-kyvos-version-5/|title=Kyvos Insights Announces the Availability of Kyvos Version 5|last=|first=|date=November 15, 2018|work=Datanami|access-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dzone.com/articles/kyvos-releases-version-5|title=Kyvos Releases Version 5|last=Ferrell|first=Lauren|date=November 16, 2018|work=DZone|access-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luis Héctor Álvarez Álvarez''' (October 25, 1919 – May 18, 2016) was a Mexican industrialist and politician. Álvarez was a member of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]]. In 1958 he was a candidate for the [[Presidency of Mexico]]. He has also served as [[Mayor of Chihuahua]], president of his party and was the coordinator of the dialogues for peace in [[Chiapas]].

Luis Héctor Álvarez dedicated most of his life to the textile industry. He first became involved in politics in [[Ciudad Juárez]]. In 1956 the PAN nominated him as candidate to Governor of Chihuahua. He lost the election to PRI candidate [[Teófilo Borunda]]. After the election an [[electoral fraud]] was claimed by Álvarez and his party. In an act of [[civil disobedience]], Alvarez headed a caravan from [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] to [[Mexico City]].
In 1958, he ran as the PAN candidate in the federal election against [[Adolfo López Mateos]] where he lost.

In the following years Álvarez dedicated himself mainly to his private enterprise, until 1983 when he was elected [[Municipal President]] of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]]. Being an opposition figure, Álvarez constantly clashed with the state and federal governments. Álvarez claimed he was not given the proper legal resources and participation in his city's decisions. In protest, Álvarez started a [[hunger strike]] that lasted 40 days. The strike also contested the 1986 elections in Chihuahua in which opposition parties claimed an [[electoral fraud]] had taken place once again.

In 1987 he was elected 14th president of the PAN party and in 1990 he won the re-election.
His tenure as president of the party is controversial. His supporters claim that during his administration the party became the strongest opposition force in Mexican politics. His detractors on the other hand claim that his party strayed away from its original doctrine and was now run by the “neo-panistas” (e.g. [[Manuel Clouthier]], [[Vicente Fox]], [[Francisco Barrio Terrazas]] and [[Ernesto Ruffo Appel]]). Prominent party members, including [[Pablo Emilio Madero]], [[Jesus González Schmal]], [[Jose González Torres]] and [[Bernardo Bátiz]], left the PAN in protest arguing that Álvarez's policy of dialogue with [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] legitimized his government which was under intense national criticism of perpetrating an [[electoral fraud]].

He was elected to the [[Senate of Mexico|Senate]] for Chihuahua from 1994 to 2000, during which period he served as a member of the Commission of Concord and Pacification in Chiapas that was in charge of the peace negotiation between the Federal Government and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]]. In 2000, President Vicente Fox designated him Coordinator of the Dialogue for La Paz in Chiapas.
During this time he never was able to contact the leadership of the EZLN.

On December 15, 2006, President [[Felipe Calderón Hinojosa]] designated him head of the [[Commission for the Development of the Indigenous People]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/394374.html Luis H. Alvarez, comisionado para pueblos indígenas] by [[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Álvarez's wife, [[Blanca Magrassi Scagno]], an activist and important figure within the PAN, died on October 9, 2015, at the age of 92.&lt;ref name=sdp&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Muere Blanca Magrassi, promotora de la participación política de las mujeres |url=http://www.sdpnoticias.com/nacional/2015/10/09/muere-blanca-magrassi-promotora-de-la-participacion-politica-de-las-mujeres |work=[[sdpnoticias]] |date=2015-10-09 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maslak''' is one of the main [[business district]]s of [[Sarıyer]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], located on the European side of the city. It was formerly an exclave of the municipality of [[Şişli]], though being far north and actually closer to the municipalities of Sarıyer and [[Beşiktaş]]. Therefore, a legislation was approved by the Interior Commission of the Turkish Parliament on October 18, 2012, that shifted the jurisdiction of the Maslak district from Şişli to Sarıyer.

Maslak is in direct competition with the nearby [[Levent]] business district for new [[skyscraper]] projects. At present, the tallest completed skyscraper in Maslak&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/zo/?id=100016 Emporis: Maslak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319220350/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/zo/?id=100016 |date=2007-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the 47-floor ''Spine Tower'' which reaches a structural height of 202 meters;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spine-tower.com/|title=Maslak Spine Tower}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/spine-tower-istanbul-turkey|title=Spine Tower}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the tallest skyscraper currently under construction in Maslak (as well as Istanbul and the rest of Turkey) is the [[Diamond of Istanbul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=diamondofistanbul-istanbul-turkey|title=Diamond of Istanbul}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises three centrally-connected towers, the tallest of which will have 53 floors above ground and will reach a structural height of 270 meters (thus surpassing the current tallest completed skyscraper in Istanbul, the 54-floor, 261 meters tall [[Istanbul Sapphire]] in the nearby [[Levent]] business district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;id=kilertower-istanbul-turkey&amp;lng=3|title=Sapphire Tower}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The Diamond of Istanbul will also be the first [[steel]] skyscraper in Turkey, where (as opposed to the situation in the [[United States]]) constructing with steel costs more than constructing with [[concrete]]. The reason for choosing steel was its relative strength in resisting [[earthquake]]s (Istanbul is located along an [[active fault]]), whereas concrete is more [[Fireproofing|fire-resistant]].

The stations ''[[Istanbul Technical University|İTÜ]]-Ayazağa'' and ''Atatürk Oto Sanayi'' along the [[M2 (Istanbul Metro)|M2]] line of the [[Istanbul Metro]] serve the Maslak business district and its surrounding neighbourhoods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3546">The '''New Hire Registry''' is a program established in the United States pursuant to the ''Personal Responsibility and Work        Opportunity Reconciliation Act'' (PRWORA) of 1996, 42 U.S.C. 653a, which required each state, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government for its own employees, to establish - or contract with a provider to operate - a system where all new hires by any employer must be reported to a state-established New Hire Registry for that state.&lt;ref&gt;http://newhire-reporting.com/va-newhire/FAQ.aspx Virginia New-Hire Reporting Center Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), retrieved 4 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  All employers of employees for wages have been required since 1997 to register with their state for reporting, and to report new hires within 20 days of employment, except employers who file new hire reports electronically, who must file a report every 12 to 16 days. The ostensible purpose of the program is to check for "[[deadbeat parent]]s", e.g. persons not paying required child support orders, but may also be used for abuse of other payment-related programs such as [[unemployment insurance]].

==Who is required to comply==
All employers of employees for wages must register with their state's New Hire Registry, and are required to report to the registry all new hires or all rehires of former employees who have been separated from the employer for more than 60 days. All employees must be reported, including employees who were hired or worked for less than one day,  domestic employees such as a maid, gardener, cook, etc., and seasonal employees.&lt;ref&gt;http://newhire-reporting.com/md-newhire/FAQ.aspx Maryland State Directory of New Hires, Frequently Asked Questions, #4, Retrieved 4 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The law's reporting requirements strictly include all employees for wages. An employer must report all persons who would be considered employees under federal rules for withholding of employment taxes to the state's New Hire Registry. Reporting of [[independent contractor]]s is not required, but is encouraged.

While reporting of employees who are no longer working for the employer may not seem to be helpful, since the report includes the address of the employee, it may be useful in tracking down an employee who has unpaid child support payments or might be committing unemployment insurance fraud.

==Exemptions==
No employer is exempt from reporting new hires, with the exception of Federal intelligence agencies where the director of the agency has determined that reporting may jeopardize the safety of certain employees or may compromise National Security.

==Report Format==
The report which is required to be filed includes the name, address and social security number of every new hire, as well as the name, address, and [[Federal Employer Identification Number]] of the employer, for each new hire made within the last 20 days or within the last two weeks for employers filing electronically.

==Single State vs. Multistate Employers==
An employer within a single state files with the New Hire Registry of the state where they operate; multistate employers may choose to either file new hire reports with each state where the employee works, or instead may file a single combined report for all employees for all states where it operates with one state's New Hire Registry, but must not make both reports.

==Requirement of States operating the Registry==

'''Nola Therese Fraser''' ([[married and maiden names|née]] '''Chalhoub''')  is an Australian small business owner, former nurse and former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] candidate on two occasions for the seat of [[Electoral district of Macquarie Fields|Macquarie Fields]]. Fraser became a [[whistleblower]] at two Sydney hospitals.

== Whistleblower ==

Fraser rose to prominence when she publicly criticised the administration of [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]] and [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]] hospitals in south-western [[Sydney]]. Her claims were backed by fellow nurses Valerie Owen, Vanessa Brag, Sheree Martin and Yvonne Quinn. On 5 November 2002, Fraser took her concerns to the health minister, and her local member of parliament, [[Craig Knowles]]. Fraser claimed that upon cataloguing the dangers patients faced at the hospitals, the minister threatened her.

Knowles demanded evidence, which the nurses provided, but after three weeks there had been no word on any investigation. It was reported that [[New South Wales Department of Health]] officials had been destroying incriminating documents. Meanwhile, an internal review concluded that the nurses' claims merited investigation by the [[Health Care Complaints Commission]].

On 25 February 2003, the HCCC recommended that no action be taken, having made "no findings that support any loss of confidence by the community in the Macarthur Health Service." The findings came three weeks before [[New South Wales state election, 2003|2003 state election]], which Labor won.

Fraser and her colleagues brought public attention to this matter with the help of [[talkback radio]] host [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]]. As HCCC investigations continued, according to a 2003 ''Sydney Morning Herald'' report, "those staff who were considering reporting their concerns about the failures watched helplessly as the whistleblower nurses were sidelined and victimised, their jobs placed in limbo." The department ordered a second investigation, led by the head of the [[Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care]]. A copy of the HCCC's interim report was leaked to the ''Sun-Herald''. The HCCC had concluded that of 47 complaints, at least 17 patients "had died after receiving unsafe, inadequate or questionable care" at Camden and Campbelltown. But the report did not lay blame with any individual. In response, the opposition [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] led by [[John Brogden (politician)|John Brogden]] took up the nurses' concerns, decrying what they described as a "cover-up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/12/1071125658578.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Exposing a tragic mess | date=13 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] inquiry into Knowles' behaviour cleared the minister in September 2005.&lt;ref name=icac-findings&gt;{{cite press release | title =ICAC makes no findings of corrupt conduct in relation to the Hon. Craig Knowles MP | publisher =Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) | date= 13 April 2005 | url =http://www.icac.nsw.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/article/2600 | accessdate =2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political campaigns ==

After Knowles resigned from Parliament in 2005, Fraser contested his seat of [[Electoral district of Macquarie Fields|Macquarie Fields]] for the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]. Fraser achieved a swing of 12% for her party, not enough to defeat Labor's [[Steven Chaytor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/state_government_elections/election_results/district_index/macquarie_fields/results/2005_byelection|title=2005 Macquarie Fields By-Election Results |date=22 September 2005|publisher=[[New South Wales Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser was again endorsed by the Liberals for the [[New South Wales state election, 2007|March 2007 election]]. However, Fraser was unable to improve on her by-election result and was defeated by Labor's candidate, Dr [[Andrew McDonald (Australian politician)|Andrew McDonald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/state_government_elections/electoral_districts/all_districts_/macquarie_fields/results_2007/perferential_count |title=2007 State Election Results|date=3 January 2008|publisher=[[New South Wales Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser again stood for Macquarie Fields at the [[New South Wales state election, 2011]] but this time as an independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://macarthur-chronicle-camden.whereilive.com.au/news/story/nsw-election-2011-macquarie-fields-candidates/|title=NSW Election 2011: Macquarie Fields candidates|date=19 March 2011|work=Macarthur Chronicle|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gained approximately 11% of the primary votes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/elections/nsw/2011/guide/macq.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal candidate Sam Eskaros won 37% of the primary vote but despite a heavy swing against him the sitting ALP member Andrew McDonald retained the seat with 51.5% of the two party preferred vote.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

'''North Bay Growth &amp; Innovation Forum''' is a program created by the city of [[Santa Rosa, California]], and the city's [[chamber of commerce]]. The goal of the program is to enable the creation and growth of new businesses in the Santa Rosa area through education, mentoring and exposure to capital sources. The program matches angel or venture capital investors with aspiring entrepreneurs and/or existing businesses from start-up to mid-size.

At each forum topics may include fund raising, developing business plans and how best to leverage [[social media]].

The NBGIF series has won regional, statewide and national awards.

==History of NBGIF==
In 2006, realizing that the best strategy for business growth was to encourage “home grown” companies, the City and Chamber partnered on beta-testing the Venture Communities model created by Golden Capital Network, producing the first forum in October 2006. Three subsequent events were produced with Golden Capital’s assistance, and in the fall of 2008, the City and Chamber left the Golden Capital Network nest and transformed the Venture Communities model into the North Bay Growth &amp; Innovation Forum as it is today.

==Event format==
Since late 2008, Forum events have included: 
* Rapid Roundtables: An opportunity to learn from experts on topics such as “Due Diligence &amp; Negotiating the Deal,” “From Bootstrapping to Big Banks – Alternative Finance,” and “Best Practices in Internet Marketing – Leveraging SEO, Email and Social Networking;”
* Speakers on entrepreneurism, emerging market trends, taking advantage of a down economy and a review of the local entrepreneurial market;
* Poster exhibition from presenting entrepreneurs and selected local companies; and
* Company investment pitches to an investor panel.

Panelists at each event award "Best in Show" to the most promising presenting companies. Past "Best in Show" winners have included Seasons Studios, Mosaic Assist, True2Life Apparel and Aethos Technologies.

==Awards==
* 2007 Honorable Mention – Economic Development Programs; [[International Economic Development Council]]	
* 2008 Award of Merit for Economic Development Programs; California Association for Local Economic Development (CALED)
* 2009 The “Light Bulb” Went On, Innovative/Entrepreneurial Spirit; North Bay Leadership Council.

==Past participating companies==
Over 70 companies have participated in the program and have received more than $25 million in funding as a result. A few notable companies:
* Aeres Motors
* Autonet
* Barefoot Motors
* BarspaceTV
* Construction Exchange
* Displaire (now Pix2O)
* Mas Wine Company
* [[Red Condor]]
* Rotofactory
* Smart Motion
* VIDA Products
* Wave Track

==Coaching and mentoring==
NBGIF provides access to experts at no charge prior to each event to assist companies in strengthening their business plans and their presentation skills. One-on-one and group training and coaching are provided well in advance of the Forum, ensuring that the participants are well prepared to present their businesses in front of a panel of prospective investors. Participants and the audience get the benefit of  feedback from experienced entrepreneurs and investors.

[[File:OLAP Cube.svg|thumb|An example of an OLAP cube]]

In database engineering in computing, '''OLAP cube''' is a term that typically refers to a multi-dimensional [[array data structure|array]] of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Gray, Jim |author2=Bosworth, Adam | author3=Layman, Andrew | author4=Pirahesh, Hamid |title=Data Cube: A Relational Aggregation Operator Generalizing Group-By, Cross-Tab, and Sub-Totals | booktitle=Proceedings of the International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) | year=1996 | pages=152–159 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/492099/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''OLAP'' is an acronym for '''[[online analytical processing]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/overview-of-online-analytical-processing-olap-15d2cdde-f70b-4277-b009-ed732b75fdd6 |title=Overview of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) |publisher=support.office.com |accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a computer-based technique of analyzing data to look for insights. The term ''cube'' here refers to a multi-dimensional
dataset, which is also sometimes called a [[hypercube]] if the number of dimensions is greater than 3.

== Terminology ==
A cube can be considered a multi-dimensional generalization of a two- or three-dimensional [[spreadsheet]].  For example, a company might wish to summarize financial data by product, by time-period, and by city to compare actual and budget expenses.  Product, time, city and scenario (actual and budget) are the data's dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.653 | title=Cybertec releases OLAP cubes for PostgreSQL | publisher=PostgreSQL | date=2006-10-02 | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cube'' is a shorthand for ''multidimensional dataset'', given that data can have an arbitrary number of ''[[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]]''. The term [[hypercube]] is sometimes used, especially for data with more than three dimensions. A cube is not a "cube" in the strict mathematical sense, as all the sides are not necessarily equal. But this term is used widely.

''Slice'' is a term for a dimension which is held constant for all cells so that multi-dimensional information can be shown in a two-dimensional physical space of a [[spreadsheet]] or [[pivot table]].

Each cell of the cube holds a number that represents some ''measure'' of the business, such as sales, profits, expenses, budget and forecast.

OLAP data is typically stored in a [[star schema]] or [[snowflake schema]] in a [[relational database|relational]] [[data warehouse]] or in a special-purpose data management system. Measures are derived from the records in the [[fact table]] and dimensions are derived from the [[dimension table]]s.

== Hierarchy ==
The elements of a dimension can be organized as a [[hierarchy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/awcourse/oracle/server.920/a96520/glossary.htm#432038 | title=Oracle9i Data Warehousing Guide hierarchy | publisher=Lorentz Center | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of parent-child relationships, typically where a parent member summarizes its children. Parent elements can further be aggregated as the children of another parent.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.olapcouncil.org/research/glossaryly.htm | title=OLAP and OLAP Server Definitions | publisher=The OLAP Council | year=1995 | accessdate=2008-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, May 2005's parent is Second Quarter 2005 which is in turn the child of Year 2005.  Similarly cities are the children of regions; products roll into product groups and individual expense items into types of expenditure.

== Operations ==
Conceiving data as a cube with hierarchical dimensions leads to conceptually straightforward operations to facilitate analysis. Aligning the data content with a familiar visualization enhances analyst learning and productivity.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt; The user-initiated process of navigating by calling for page displays interactively, through the specification of slices via rotations and drill down/up is sometimes called "slice and dice".  Common operations include slice and dice, drill down, roll up, and pivot.

[[File:OLAP slicing.png|thumb|OLAP slicing|350x350px]]
''Slice'' is the act of picking a rectangular subset of a cube by choosing a single value for one of its dimensions, creating a new cube with one fewer dimension.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt; The picture shows a slicing operation: The sales figures of all sales regions and all product categories of the company in the year 2005 and 2006 are "sliced" out of the data cube.

{{Clear}}
[[File:OLAP dicing.png|thumb|OLAP dicing|350x350px]]
''Dice'': The dice operation produces a subcube by allowing the analyst to pick specific values of multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/courses/cmput690/glossary.html | title=Glossary of Data Mining Terms | publisher=University of Alberta | year=1999 | accessdate=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The picture shows a dicing operation: The new cube shows the sales figures of a limited number of product categories, the time and region dimensions cover the same range as before.

{{Clear}}
[[File:OLAP drill up&amp;down.png|thumb|alt=OLAP-functionalities|OLAP Drill-up and drill-down|350x350px]]
''Drill Down/Up'' allows the user to navigate among levels of data ranging from the most summarized (up) to the most detailed (down).&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt;
The picture shows a drill-down operation: The analyst moves from the summary category "Outdoor-Schutzausrüstung" to see the sales figures for the individual products.

{{Clear}}
''Roll-up'': A roll-up involves summarizing the data along a dimension. The summarization rule might be computing totals along a hierarchy or applying a set of formulas such as "profit = sales - expenses".&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt;

{{Clear}}
[[File:OLAP pivoting.png|thumb|OLAP pivoting|350x350px]]
''[[Pivot table|Pivot]]'' allows an analyst to rotate the cube in space to see its various faces. For example, cities could be arranged vertically and products horizontally while viewing data for a particular quarter. Pivoting could replace products with time periods to see data across time for a single product.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/multidimensional-views?cat=technology | title=Computer Encyclopedia: multidimensional views |publisher=Answers.com | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture shows a pivoting operation: The whole cube is rotated, giving another perspective on the data.

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; an abstract representation of a [[projection (relational algebra)|projection]] of an [[RDBMS]] relation. Given a [[relation (database)|relation]] of order ''N'', consider a projection that subtends ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' as the key and ''W'' as the [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residual]] [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]]. Characterizing this as a [[function (mathematics)|function]],

:''f'' : (''X'',''Y'',''Z'') → ''W'',

the attributes ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' correspond to the axes of the cube, while the ''W'' value corresponds to the data element that populates each cell of the cube.

Insofar as two-dimensional output devices cannot readily characterize three dimensions, it is more practical to project "slices" of the data cube (we say ''project'' in the classic vector analytic sense of dimensional reduction, not in the [[SQL]] sense, although the two are conceptually similar),

:''g'' : (''X'',''Y'') → ''W''

which may suppress a primary key, but still have some semantic significance, perhaps a slice of the triadic functional representation for a given ''Z'' value of interest.

The motivation&lt;ref name=DataCubeGray1995/&gt; behind [[OLAP]] displays harks back to the ''cross-tabbed report'' paradigm of 1980s [[DBMS]], and to earlier [[contingency table]]s from 1904. The resulting spreadsheet-style display, where values of ''X'' populate row $1; values of ''Y'' populate column $A; and values of ''g'' : ( ''X'', ''Y'' ) → ''W'' populate the individual cells "southeast of" $B2, so to speak, $B2 itself included.

'''Pieter Kenyon Fleming-Voltelyn van der Byl''', [[Legion of Merit (Rhodesia)|GLM]] [[Independence Decoration (Rhodesia)|ID]] (11 November 1923 – 15 November 1999) was a [[Rhodesia]]n politician who served as his country's Foreign Minister from 1974 to 1979 as a member of the [[Rhodesian Front]] (RF). A close associate of [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Prime Minister]] [[Ian Smith]], Van der Byl opposed attempts to compromise with the British government and domestic black nationalist opposition on the issue of majority rule throughout most his time in government. However, in the late 1970s he supported the moves which led to majority rule and internationally recognised independence for Zimbabwe.

Van der Byl was born and raised in [[Cape Town]], the son of the South African politician [[Pieter Voltelyn Graham van der Byl|P V van der Byl]], and served in the Middle East and Europe during the Second World War. After a high-flying international education, he moved to the [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] British colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]] in 1950 to manage family farms. He went into politics in the early 1960s through his involvement with farming trade bodies, and became a government minister responsible for propaganda. One of the leading agitators for [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] in 1965, Van der Byl was afterwards responsible for introducing press censorship. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to persuade international opinion to recognise Rhodesia, but was popular among members of his own party.

Promoted to the [[Cabinet of Rhodesia|cabinet]] in 1968, Van der Byl became a spokesman for the Rhodesian government and crafted a public image as a die-hard supporter of continued white minority rule. In 1974 he was made Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence at a time when Rhodesia's only remaining ally, South Africa, was supplying military aid. His extreme views and brusque manner made him a surprising choice for a diplomat (a November 1976 profile in ''[[The Times]]'' described him as "a man calculated to give offence"&lt;ref name="spanier"&gt;David Spanier, "Rhodesia's Foreign Minister a man calculated to give offence", ''The Times'', Thursday 4 November 1976, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;). After offending the South African government, Van der Byl was removed from the Defence Ministry.

In the late 1970s Van der Byl was willing to endorse the Smith government's negotiations with moderate black nationalist leaders and rejected attempts by international missions to broker an agreement. He served in the short-lived [[government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia|government]] of [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] in 1979, following the [[Internal Settlement]]. After the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, Van der Byl remained in politics and close to Ian Smith; he loudly attacked former RF colleagues who had gone over to support [[Robert Mugabe]]. He retired to South Africa after the Mugabe government abolished the parliamentary seats reserved for whites in 1987, and died in 1999 at the age of 76.

==Family and early life==
Van der Byl was born in [[Cape Town]], the son of Joyce Clare Fleming, a Scot, and Dutch-descended [[Major Pieter Voltelyn Graeme van der Byl]], a member of [[Jan Smuts]]' South African cabinet during [[World War II]]. Like his father, Van der Byl was educated at the [[Diocesan College]] in Rondebosch&lt;ref name="rhodesiana"&gt;[http://www.rhodesiana.com/rsr/rsr3-004.html Rhodesian Personalities]: Pieter Kenyon Fleming-Voltelyn van der Byl&lt;/ref&gt; but his studies were interrupted by war in 1941.&lt;ref name="van der vat"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/30/guardianobituaries1 Obituary: Pieter van der Byl: Rich, white aristocrat behind Rhodesia's bid to stop black rule], [[Dan van der Vat]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 November 1999, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the [[South African Army]] during the [[Second World War]]&lt;ref name="rhodesiana" /&gt; and served with the British [[7th Queen's Own Hussars]];&lt;ref name="spanier" /&gt; he saw active service in the Middle East, Italy and Austria.

After being [[demobilised]], Van der Byl studied law at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref name="list"&gt;List of Members of Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt; where his aristocratic manner stood out. "P. K." was always elegantly dressed and coiffured, and acquired the nickname "the [[Piccadilly]] Dutchman".&lt;ref name="van der vat"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a Third-class degree in his Part II Law examinations in 1947,&lt;ref name="cambridgeregister"&gt;Historical Register of Cambridge University, supplement 1941–1950 (Cambridge University Press, 1952), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; and went on from Cambridge to study at the [[Harvard University]] Graduate School of Business Administration from 1947 to 1948 (although he did not obtain a degree at the latter).&lt;ref name="harvardalumni"&gt;Harvard Alumni Directory 1986, p. 1256. Van der Byl is counted in the Class of 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied at the [[University of Witwatersrand]] in South Africa.&lt;ref name="war"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/rhodesiansatwar/pages/Players.html |title=Rhodesians at war |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027000628/http://www.geocities.com/rhodesiansatwar/pages/Players.html |archivedate=27 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}: The main players&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most conspicuous features of Van der Byl was his manner of speech: although his ancestry was Cape Dutch and his early life was in Cape Town, South Africa, he had what were described (by Chris Whitehead, editor of ''[[Rhodesians Worldwide]]'') as "what he thought was an aristocratic English nasal drawl and imperial English mannerisms".&lt;ref name="Whitehead"&gt;[http://www.rhodesiana.com/rsr/rsr3-004.html PK, Chris Whitehead] Rhodesian personalities&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead was of the opinion that Van der Byl had "adopted" this accent, in common with others who heard him like [[Denis Hills]], who wrote of Van der Byl having "a flow of mannered phrases which he delivers in a flawed Guards officer accent".&lt;ref name="accent"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9shBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22a+flow+of+mannered+phrases+which+he+delivers+in+a+flawed+Guards+officer+accent%22&amp;dq=%22a+flow+of+mannered+phrases+which+he+delivers+in+a+flawed+Guards+officer+accent%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ0Jmbt6_MAhWFDsAKHZZFCAgQ6AEIHTAA ''Rebel People''], Denis Hills, George Allen and Unwin, 1978, page 204 This [http://www.memoriesofrhodesia.com/images/mackenzie/89.jpg Rhodesian newspaper cartoon] shows another reaction.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This personal characteristic was intensely irritating to many people including South African government ministers, but Van der Byl's aristocratic mannerisms appeared uncontentious to many Rhodesian whites. They believed that his "nasal drawl" was the product of his time as an officer in the [[Queen's Royal Hussars|Hussars]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] education: William Higham described him as "a popular Minister of Defence who, despite his British upper crust accent – undoubtedly honed during his swashbuckling career as an officer in the hussars – hailed from a noble Cape family."&lt;ref name="Higham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/rhodesiansatwar/pages/Players.html |title=William Higham Players |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027000628/http://www.geocities.com/rhodesiansatwar/pages/Players.html |archivedate=27 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to Rhodesia===
Van der Byl moved to [[Southern Rhodesia]] in 1950 to manage some of his family's tobacco farming interests, hoping to make his own fortune.&lt;ref name="van der vat" /&gt; Having visited the country many times as a youth, he remarked that after reading about the profits to be made from tobacco he "suddenly got a rush of blood to the crotch about the tobacco boom and decided I was going to go up there and make the family fortune in a place I liked and wanted to be in."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W0KNBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=p%20k%20van%20der%20byl%20tobacco%20blood%20crotch&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Unpopular Sovereignty: Rhodesian Independence and African Decolonization''], Luise White
University of Chicago Press, 2015, page 30&lt;/ref&gt; He welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of [[big game hunting]]: in that year in [[Angola]], then under [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese rule]], he set a world record for the biggest elephant shot, which stood until 1955.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;"Pieter van der Byl" (obituary), ''The Times'', 10 January 2000, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Van der Byl was made a Director of the United Dominions Corporation (Rhodesia) Ltd, having already become an active member of the Rhodesia Tobacco Association. In 1956, he was elected by the members of the [[Selous, Zimbabwe|Selous]]–[[Gadzema]] district to represent them on the Tobacco Association council. He was also Deputy Chair of the Selous Farmers' Association in 1957. His first involvement in government was in 1960 when the Rhodesia Tobacco Association made him one of their representatives on the National Native Labour Commission, on which he served for two years. In 1961, he also represented the [[Rhodesia Tobacco Association]] on the council of the [[Commercial Farmers' Union|Rhodesian National Farmers' Union]].&lt;ref name="who's who"&gt;"Who's Who of Southern Africa 1971", Rhodesia, Central and East Africa Section, Combined Publishers (Pty.) Ltd, Johannesburg 1971, p. 1286–154&lt;/ref&gt; He was recognised as a leading spokesman for Rhodesian tobacco farmers.&lt;ref name="rhodesiana" /&gt;

Dominion Party politician [[Winston Field]] had also led the Rhodesia Tobacco Association, and Van der Byl agreed with him on politics in general. He joined the [[Rhodesian Front]] when it was set up under Field's leadership. At the [[Southern Rhodesia general election, 1962|1962 general election]], Van der Byl was elected comfortably to the [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] for the Hartley constituency, a rural area to the south-west of [[Harare|Salisbury]].&lt;ref name="source book"&gt;''Source Book of Parliamentary Elections and Referenda in Southern Rhodesia 1898–1962'' ed. by F.M.G. Willson (Department of Government, University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Salisbury, 1963), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===Ministerial office===
In 1963, [[Winston Field]] appointed Van der Byl as a junior government [[Whip (politics)|whip]],&lt;ref name="who's who" /&gt; and on 16 March 1964 he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Justice with responsibility for the Information Service.&lt;ref name="willson"&gt;"Holders of Administrative and Ministerial Office 1894–1964 and Members of the Legislative Council 1899–1923 and the Legislative Assembly 1924–1964" by F.M.G. Willson and G.C. Passmore, University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Van der Byl family were identified as strongly liberal in South African politics, he became identified with the right wing of the party and helped to depose Field from the premiership in early April 1964, when Field failed to persuade the British government to grant Southern Rhodesia its independence. The new Prime Minister, [[Ian Smith]], appointed him Deputy Minister for Information.&lt;ref name="willson" /&gt; At this time, Van der Byl's chief adviser was a South African called [[Ivor Benson]], who also served as press censor.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d9wPAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Ivor+Benson The Radical Right: A World Directory]'', Ciarán Ó Maoláin (editor), Longman, 1987, page 244&lt;/ref&gt; Benson believed that an international communist conspiracy was plotting to overthrow white rule in Rhodesia.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xj-MAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Cold%20War%20in%20Southern%20Africa%3A%20White%20Power%2C%20Black%20Liberation&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q=Benson&amp;f=true The Impact of anti-communism on white Rhodesian political culture c.1920&amp;ndash;1980]'', D Lowry, in ''Cold War in Southern Africa: White Power, Black Liberation'', Sue Onslow, (editor)  Routledge, 2009, page 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in the Legislative Assembly on 12 August 1964 he attacked proposals for greater independence for broadcasters by referring to what he perceived to be the social effect in Britain:

:To suggest that the [[BBC]], forming opinion in the minds of the people of England, has been an influence for good in any way, when you consider the criminality of large areas of London; when you consider the [[Mods and Rockers]], and all those other things; when you consider the total moral underminings which have been taking place in England, much to all our distress, in the last fifteen to twenty years, the Hon. Member can hardly bring that up as an argument in favour of the freedom of broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9jV1AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=To+suggest+that+the+BBC%2C+forming+opinion+in+the+minds+of+the+people+of+England%2C+has+been+an+influence+for+good+in+any+way%2C+when+you+consider+the+criminality+of+large+areas+of+London&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22To+suggest+that+the+BBC%2C%22+ ''Rhodesia: The Road to Rebellion''], James P. Barber, Institute of Race Relations, 1967, page 291&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1964, Van der Byl and his Ministry had control of broadcasting in Rhodesia.&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;Robert Blake, "A History of Rhodesia", Eyre Methuen, 1977, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in Parliament he described the aims of his Department as "not merely to disseminate information from an interesting point of view but to play its part in fighting the propaganda battle on behalf of the country".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9jV1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22not+merely+to+disseminate+information+from+an+interesting+point+of+view+but+to+play+its+part+in+fighting+the+propaganda+battle+on+behalf+of+the+country%22&amp;dq=%22not+merely+to+disseminate+information+from+an+interesting+point+of+view+but+to+play+its+part+in+fighting+the+propaganda+battle+on+behalf+of+the+country%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUz7KTxq_MAhUkJcAKHW-UDj4Q6AEIHTAA ''Rhodesia: The Road to Rebellion''], James P.

Barber, Institute of Race Relations, 1967, page 293&lt;/ref&gt;

===1965 election===
In May 1965 the Rhodesian Front government went to the country in a [[Rhodesian general election, 1965|general election]] with Van der Byl one of the leading campaigners. Discussion of unilaterally declaring independence had already begun. Van der Byl argued that only a small fraction of Rhodesian business opposed it; however, his campaign speeches typically included an argument against business involvement in politics. He cited [[Johannesburg]] mining interests' support for the Progressive Party in South Africa, big business support for the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] in Germany, and the [[Bolshevik]] revolution in Russia being financed by United States big business.&lt;ref name="bowman"&gt;Larry W. Bowman, "Politics in Rhodesia: White Power in an African State", Harvard University Press, 1973, p. 80, citing ''Rhodesia Herald'', 30 April 1965 and 5 May 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhodesian Front won a landslide victory, winning every single one of the 50 constituencies which had predominantly European voters. At the Rhodesian Front Congress of August 1965, party members strongly attacked the press for failing to support the government. A demand for it to be made compulsory for all political articles to be signed by the author met with Van der Byl's approval.&lt;ref name="barber"&gt;''Rhodesia: The Road to Rebellion'' by James Barber (Oxford University Press, 1967), p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

===UDI===
Within the government, Van der Byl was one of the loudest voices urging Ian Smith to proceed to a [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]]. He angrily denounced the threat of sanctions from Britain, saying on 4 May 1965 that economic destruction of Rhodesia would mean total economic destruction of [[Zambia]], formerly Northern Rhodesia. This statement was interpreted as a military threat by David Butler, the Leader of the Opposition.&lt;ref name="new warning"&gt;"New warning by Smith on independence", ''The Times'', Wednesday 5 May 1965, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Byl was given the task of selling the UDI to Rhodesian whites and to world opinion. In September 1965, it was announced that he would tour the United Kingdom to promote Rhodesian independence. According to [[David Steel]], he claimed then that France and the United States would lead the international recognition of the UDI government.&lt;ref name="steel"&gt;David Steel, "I told you so from the start", ''The Times'', Thursday 6 March 1980, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Deputy Minister of Information on 22 October&lt;ref name="gazette1965"&gt;Rhodesia Government Gazette, vol. 43 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; and so was present at, but did not sign, the [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] on 11 November 1965.

[[File:Udi2-rho.jpg|thumb|The signing of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence. Van der Byl appears, obscured, in a light-coloured suit at the top right of the picture.]]
Van der Byl was greeted by a speech strongly critical of the Rhodesian government from the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Michael Ramsey]], who supported the use of armed force to bring the Rhodesians in line with United Kingdom policy on decolonisation. He responded by comparing the speech to "the tragic connivance at the destruction of Czechoslovakia in exchange for the useless appeasement at Munich in 1938".&lt;ref name="speech"&gt;"Speech deplored by Minister", ''The Times'', Thursday 28 October 1965, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Byl's response used the phrase "kith and kin" to refer to the ethnic links between the white Rhodesians and the people of the United Kingdom. He saw no contradiction between signing a letter declaring "constant loyalty" to the Queen and declaring independence a few days later;&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; the Rhodesian Government was careful at the time of UDI to state its continued loyalty to the British Crown, though it later declared Rhodesia a republic.

Despite his enthusiasm for propaganda, Van der Byl was outraged when the BBC subsequently set up a radio station at [[Francistown]] in Botswana which broadcast for 27 months, criticising UDI and urging Rhodesians to revoke it. He was later to claim the station was inciting violence,&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;Letter from P.K. van der Byl to ''The Times'' published on Wednesday, 25 January 1978, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; although this was denied by some who had been regular listeners.&lt;ref name="letter2"&gt;Letter from H.C. Norwood to ''The Times'' published on Monday, 20 February 1978, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January 1966, two months after the UDI, Van der Byl was willing to be quoted as saying that Rhodesian Army troops would follow a "scorched earth" policy should the United Kingdom send in troops, comparing their position to that of the Red Army when Nazi forces invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941. He was highly critical of [[Harold Wilson]], describing him as a "highly dangerous, uninformed and conceited little man."&lt;ref name="scorched"&gt;"'Scorched Earth' in Rhodesia if Britain sends troops", ''The Times'', Thursday, 27 January 1966, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship===
[[File:CensoredRhodesiaHerald.jpg|thumbnail|The ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Rhodesia Herald]]'' front page of 21 September 1966 shows the effect of censorship imposed by Van der Byl's ministry.]]

Internally, his policy was enforced through Ministry control of TV and radio and through censorship of newspapers. From 31 December 1965, the Ministry of Information expanded its brief and was renamed the Ministry of Information, Immigration and Tourism, which meant that it was also responsible for deciding whether to grant or revoke permits to visit Rhodesia. Several foreign journalists were expelled: John Worrall, correspondent for ''[[The Guardian]]'', went in January 1969. ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|The Rhodesia Herald]]'', then in opposition to both the Rhodesian Front and UDI, frequently appeared with large white spaces on its news pages where censored stories had been placed. Stories and editorials personally critical of Van der Byl were immediately removed.

Censorship was tightened still further on 8 February 1966 when it was made illegal to indicate where material had been removed. The censor was also given the power to alter existing material or to move it around the newspaper. Dr [[Ahrn Palley]], the lone white opposition MP, described the powers as "censorship gone mad", and insisted that there would no longer be any guarantee that anything published in the newspapers was authentic. Van der Byl responded by saying that the new measures were a reflection on the newspapers which had made such powers necessary.&lt;ref name="drastic"&gt;"Drastic powers for the Rhodesian Censor", ''The Times'', Wednesday, 9 February 1966, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 Van der Byl was reported by Malcolm Smith, the former editor of the ''Herald'', as remarking that a high degree of [[self-censorship]] was required, and support for the government was essential.&lt;ref name="censorship"&gt;Malcolm Smith, "How censorship has affected the Rhodesian press", ''The Times'', Tuesday, 7 November 1967, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Herald'' (and the ''Bulawayo Chronicle'') defied the restrictions, boldly printing blank spaces which identified removed material. Van der Byl personally visited the newspaper offices on the day the new regulations came in to warn the staff that if the paper was printed as proposed, they would "publish at your peril." However the papers continued to appear with identifiable censorship in defiance of the government, and in 1968 the regulations were scrapped.

====Deportation====
Shortly after UDI, 46 academics working at University College, a racially non-segregated institution, in Rhodesia wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' in London, denouncing the move. Officers of the [[British South Africa Police]] visited many of those who had signed to search their houses. Shortly afterwards, the residence permit of one of the academics came up for renewal, which would normally be automatic. In fact, it was revoked and the academic was deported. Van der Byl was the responsible minister and all but admitted that the reason was his opposition to UDI.&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;Christopher Hill, "The crisis facing Rhodesia's non-racial university", ''The Times'', Monday, 8 August 1966, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Byl's strategy seemed to work at home, with many Rhodesians remaining unaware until the end just how much was their country's vulnerability and isolation. ''The Times'' was later to describe him as a "skilled propagandist who believed his own propaganda."&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; When sanctions on Rhodesia were confirmed in January 1967, Van der Byl compared their situation with Spain following World War II, saying that the isolation of Spain had not stopped it from becoming one of the most advanced and economically successful countries in Europe. However, when Van der Byl made informal approaches in April 1966 to see if he might visit Britain "for social reasons" during a tour of Europe, the [[Commonwealth Relations Office]] replied that he would not be recognised as enjoying any form of recognition or immunity.&lt;ref name="rebuff"&gt;"Rebuff to a Rhodesian Minister", ''The Times'', Tuesday, 3 May 1966, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Other European governments refused to recognise [[Rhodesian passport|his passport]] and expelled him from the country.&lt;ref name="hansard3"&gt;Hansard, 5 December 1966, vol. 737, col. 1065&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider role in politics=== 
On 13 September 1968 he was promoted to be the full Minister of Information, Immigration and Tourism. Van der Byl's aristocratic background, military experience and academic credentials combined to give him an almost iconic status within the Rhodesian Front. Many were impressed by his exploits as a big-game hunter, which began when he shot his first lion in a garden in Northern Rhodesia at the age of 15.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Writing in South Africa's ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'', Michael Hartnack remarked that many in the Rhodesian Front believed him to be "a 19th century-style connoisseur, a man of culture and an aristocrat-statesman", adding that "poseurs are an incipient hazard in any unsophisticated society."&lt;ref name="hartnack"&gt;[https://archive.li/20070515082426/http://www.dispatch.co.za/2001/11/06/editoria/LP.HTM "White seal, Black messiah]," Michael Hartnack, ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'', Tuesday, 6 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Within the somewhat claustrophobic confines of white Rhodesian society outside the RF, Van der Byl was achieving some degree of respect.

In politics he assumed the position of hard-line opponent of any form of compromise with domestic opponents or the international community. He made little secret of his willingness to succeed Ian Smith as Prime Minister if Smith showed even "the least whiff of surrender," and did his best to discourage attempts to get the Rhodesians to compromise. When [[Abel Muzorewa]] had his passport withdrawn in September 1972 after returning from a successful visit to London, the government did not attempt to counter the rumour that its action was taken following Van der Byl's personal order.&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;"Bishop Muzorewa has his passport taken away", ''The Times'', Monday, 11 September 1972, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1972 Van der Byl sparked a row over the agreement which Rhodesia and the United Kingdom had made in November 1971. Under this agreement, Rhodesia had agreed to certain concessions to African nationalism in return for the prospect of recognition of its independence; however, implementation of the agreement was to be delayed until the [[Pearce Commission]] reported on whether the settlement proposals would be approved by the people of Rhodesia. Van der Byl insisted that Rhodesia would not implement any part of the agreement unless Rhodesia's independence was first acknowledged, regardless of the answer from the Pearce Commission. When the Pearce Commission reported that the [[Whites in Zimbabwe|European]], [[Indians in Zimbabwe|Asian]] and [[Coloured#Southern Africa|Coloured]] (mixed race) populations of Rhodesia were in support but the African population were opposed, the agreement was ditched. Many outside and inside Rhodesia had hoped that the government would implement some of the agreement even if Pearce reported against it.&lt;ref name="tougher"&gt;"Tougher Rhodesian line on settlement proposals", ''The Times'', Monday, 10 April 1972, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

His derision of working class British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politicians also caused problems. When, in January 1966, three visiting Labour MPs were manhandled, kicked and punched while attempting to address 400 supporters of the Rhodesian Front, Van der Byl blamed the three for refusing an offer from his Ministry to co-ordinate the visit, and pointed out that they were breaking the law which required government permission for any political meeting of more than 12 people.&lt;ref name="mps"&gt;"British M.P.s manhandled by Mr. Smith's supporters", ''The Times'', Thursday, 13 January 1966, p. 10.

The propaganda circulated by his Ministry (typically including references to "happy, smiling natives") was considered laughable. Visiting British journalist [[Peregrine Worsthorne]], who knew Van der Byl socially, reported seeing a copy of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' on his coffee table.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140109192901/https://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/ich/witness/PDFfiles/RhodesiaUDI.pdf Interview for Centre for Contemporary British History witness seminars.  ("I remember being shocked to find open on the coffee table in PK's house, who was then Minister of Information (I am not sure even if he had such a grand title, he ultimately of course became Foreign Minister, war minister to all intents and purposes) a recently perused copy of Mein Kampf.  This bears out your comment about the fascist element, which cannot be overlooked.  I was fond of PK, but he was a racial supremacist admirer of Hitler.")]&lt;/ref&gt; His propaganda strategy became increasingly unsuccessful abroad, where Van der Byl alienated many of the foreign journalists and politicians that he came into contact with. [[Max Hastings]], then reporting for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', described him as "that grotesque parody of a [[Dornford Yates]] English gentleman" and said that he and Smith "would have seemed ludicrous figures, had they not possessed the power of life and death over millions of people"; Van der Byl had him deported.&lt;ref name="hastings"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M0Z2V87pVW8C&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=%22would+have+seemed+ludicrous+figures,+had+they+not+possessed+the+power+of+life+and+death+over+millions+of+people%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oY8ANCh1cy&amp;sig=GXemKR_qXd9zeIvfZ_Xz87vB8dQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX9NqbjZXWAhUMIcAKHZBMClwQ6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=byl&amp;f=false ''Going to the Wars''], Max Hastings, Macmillan, 2000, pages 185-189&lt;/ref&gt;

While still popular with the Rhodesian Front members, he was criticised at the 1972 Party Congress for his lack of success in improving Rhodesia's image around the world; however, he retained the confidence of Ian Smith and was kept on in a government reshuffle on 24 May 1973. That winter saw him promote a new Broadcasting Bill to transfer control of the monopoly [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation]]. [[Allan Savory]], then the lone white opposition MP, criticised the Bill for the composition of the proposed board, which was dominated by strong supporters of the Rhodesian Front. Van der Byl insisted, somewhat unsuccessfully to foreign observers, that the government was not trying to take over broadcasting.&lt;ref name="sect"&gt;"Sect members accused of evading conscription", ''The Times'', Thursday, 6 December 1973, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minister of Defence===
Van der Byl was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence on 2 August 1974. These were two distinct portfolios, the first of which (Foreign Affairs) did not amount to much in a state which lacked any form of international recognition. The Defence portfolio, at a time when Rhodesia was drifting into civil war, was an important post; although his previous political experience had been largely in the area of public relations, he was now charged with responsibilities which were central to the survival of Rhodesia.

He promoted aggressive measures against the insurgents, and in so doing, he also sought to raise his own political profile. Clad in immaculately tailored battledress, he would fly by helicopter to a beleaguered army outpost; wearing dark glasses and sporting a swagger stick, deliver a rousing speech for the benefit of the troops and the TV cameras – then return to Salisbury in time for dinner. He drew heavily on [[Winston Churchill]]'s oratory style for some of his inspiring speeches.&lt;ref name="war"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OurStory posting :[http://www.ourstory.com/thread.html?t=226309#195012 account of a PK tour of inspection, 1974] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928082841/http://www.ourstory.com/thread.html?t=226309#195012 |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Minister of Defence, Van der Byl was known to join army counter-insurgency operations while armed with a hunting rifle (with the words "I'd like to bag one of these chaps ..."), and would regularly visit army positions and entertain the troops with his own generous supply of "scotch whisky and fine wines." Such behaviour endeared him to many in Rhodesia: he was far more popular with the troops than his predecessor as Minister of Defence, [[Jack Howman]]. However, this popularity did not extend to senior members of the South African and Rhodesian governments.

Rhodesia's strategic position underwent a fundamental change in June 1975 when the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] government suddenly withdrew from [[Mozambique]] which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians continued use of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.

There were rumours in February 1976 that Soviet tanks were being unloaded in Mozambique to help in the war. Unluckily for Van der Byl, the British Foreign Office minister was [[David Ennals]], one of those who had received rough treatment in 1966. Ennals announced that in the event of a racial war breaking out in Rhodesia, there would be no British help. Van der Byl responded by claiming this indicated Britain accepting Rhodesia's independence.&lt;ref name="naked"&gt;"Rhodesia says any Soviet interference would be 'naked aggression'", ''The Times'', Tuesday, 17 February 1976, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He attacked Abel Muzorewa for supporting President Machel, saying that "being a good churchman and a Bishop there is a very strong possibility he might be a communist".&lt;ref name="guerillas"&gt;Nicholas Ashford, "Rhodesia admits 1,000 guerillas are operating inside border", ''The Times'', Saturday, 6 March 1976, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the example of Mozambique, the Zambian and Botswana governments permitted guerrillas to establish bases from which they could threaten and infiltrate Rhodesia. Van der Byl told a newspaper reporter that this had to be expected.&lt;ref name="knipe1"&gt;Michael Knipe, "Rebels open third front against Rhodesia", ''The Times'', Friday, 11 June 1976, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; As infiltration grew, he declared at the beginning of July that the Rhodesian Army would not hesitate to bomb and destroy villages that harboured guerillas.&lt;ref name="knipe2"&gt;Michael Knipe, "Smith Cabinet rejects plan to open white farm areas to blacks", ''The Times'', Saturday, 3 July 1976. Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 and 1976, the South African government conducted delicate negotiations with neighbouring states: the South Africans wanted to encourage those states to maintain economic relations with South Africa and Rhodesia while limiting the activities of the ANC, ZANU and ZAPU. However, increasingly aggressive actions by the Rhodesian army outside its own borders resulted in the failure of this conciliatory approach.

A cross-border [[Selous Scouts]] raid into Mozambique on 9 August 1976 (dubbed "[[Operation_Eland|the Nyadzonya Raid]]") killed over 1,000 people without Rhodesian fatalities, with Van der Byl insisting that the government had irrefutable proof that the raid had targeted a guerrilla training camp. He was unwilling to disclose the nature of the proof, though he invited the UN to conduct its own investigation into the raid.&lt;ref name="knipe3"&gt;Michael Knipe, "Rhodesians ask UN to investigate camp raid", ''The Times'', Wednesday, 25 August 1976. Page 1&lt;/ref&gt; The raid produced a high body count and a major haul of intelligence and captured arms; according to ZANLA's own figures, which were not publicly circulated, most of those present in the camp had been armed guerrillas, though there were some civilians present.{{#tag:ref|The official ZANLA report, dated 19 August 1976, specifies that before the raid on Nyadzonya there had been 5,250 people in the camp, of whom 604 were unarmed refugees and the rest were armed guerrilla fighters. The report says that 1,028 guerrillas were killed, 309 were wounded and around 1,000 had gone missing. "It should be mentioned ... that the comrades have only one desire, to go for training," it goes on to say: "... The attitude of the comrades towards the revolution is now much deeper than before ... keeping them in bases often referred to as "Refugee Camps" keeps robbing them of their morale and their desire to concentrate seriously on revolutionary matters."&lt;ref name=lohman4/&gt;|group="n"}} In a successful attempt to win global sympathy, ZANU clamoured that Nyadzonya had been full of unarmed refugees, leading most international opinion to condemn the Rhodesian raid as a massacre.&lt;ref name="lohman4"&gt;{{cite journal

Van der Byl had sanctioned the incursion largely on his own initiative. Although a tactical success, the incursion caused a final break with Zambia and Mozambique. The South African government was greatly displeased that its earlier diplomatic efforts were compromised and made this clear to Ian Smith. Smith appeared to consider this "the final straw" as far as Van der Byl's defence portfolio was concerned.&lt;ref&gt;The Past is Another Country, Martin Meredith, p280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign affairs===
Van der Byl took over at a time when South Africa was putting increasing pressure on the Rhodesians to make an agreement on majority rule. In March 1975, he had to fly urgently to Cape Town to explain why the Rhodesian government had detained Rev. [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]], who was accused of plotting against other black nationalist leaders. The South Africans were extremely displeased with this action and suspected that the real reason was that the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and preferred to negotiate with [[Joshua Nkomo]].&lt;ref name="knipe4"&gt;Michael Knipe, "Sithole arrest linked with death list", ''The Times'', Friday, 7 March 1975, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Byl was unsuccessful in reassuring the South Africans and Ian Smith was forced to follow him.

[[File:Victoria Falls Bridge over Zambesi.jpg|thumb|The [[Victoria Falls Conference (1975)|Victoria Falls Conference]] took place at the centre of the [[Victoria Falls Bridge]] in August 1975.]]
Gradually the South Africans grew unwilling to help Rhodesia. The remaining 200 South African policemen transferred to help in the guerilla war were removed suddenly in August 1975, a move which appeared to precede even more disengagement. Van der Byl responded in a speech on 8 August which asserted that "The terrorists who are trained and equipped outside our border and who invade our country with the willing help of other governments are here for a much wider purpose than the overthrow of Rhodesia. They are here to represent a force which sees Rhodesia as just one more stepping stone to victory over South Africa because they see South Africa as a vital key to the security of America, Europe and the rest of the western world."&lt;ref name="strain"&gt;"Relations under strain at Pretoria meeting", ''The Times'', Saturday, 9 August 1975, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Rhodesian government [[Victoria Falls Conference (1975)|held talks]] with the African National Council on the railway bridge across the [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] in August 1975 (the train in which the talks took place was strategically in the middle of the bridge so that the ANC were in Zambia while the Rhodesians remained in Rhodesia), Van der Byl was not a member of the Rhodesian delegation. This was a curious omission given his position. He did however participate in talks with Joshua Nkomo that December.

Van der Byl's habit of referring to the African population as "munts"&lt;ref name="PrivateEye1977"/&gt; (he asserted that "Rhodesia is able to handle the munts"&lt;ref name="chilly"&gt;"Chilly reception awaits Rhodesian leader after television remark", ''The Times'', Monday, 20 October 1975, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;) led to extreme unpopularity with the South African government, and he did not attend talks with South African Prime Minister [[John Vorster]] in October 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?num=30&amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enGB751GB751&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=657&amp;tbm=bks&amp;ei=WMb2W7_aJMu4jwSSmIfgDg&amp;q=%22van+der+Byl%22+%22munts%22&amp;oq=%22van+der+Byl%22+%22munts%22&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...13177.22464.0.23495.16.16.0.0.0.0.113.1391.14j2.16.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.ePkmBXC7nsA ''Summary of World Broadcasts: Non-Arab Africa''], BBC Monitoring Service, Issues 5021-5096, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; This was interpreted as being connected to Vorster's dislike of Van der Byl who, despite being of Afrikaner origin, had adopted English mannerisms.&lt;ref name="PrivateEye1977"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cqRnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22van+der+Byl%22+%22munts%22&amp;dq=%22van+der+Byl%22+%22munts%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvqYjso-jeAhXo3YMKHbIjC4sQ6AEIKjAA ''Private Eye''], Issues 393-407; Issues 409-418, 1977, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; 

When, on 26 August 1976, the South African government announced the withdrawal of all its military helicopter crews from Rhodesia, Van der Byl was outspoken in his criticism and Vorster was reported to have refused to have anything to do with "that dreadful man Van der Byl."&lt;ref name="rhodesiana"/&gt; Smith decided that he "clearly ... had no option"&lt;ref name="smith197"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Smith
|1997
|p=197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 9 September 1976 executed a sudden cabinet reshuffle that ended Van der Byl's tenure as Defence Minister. Smith claimed the South African dislike of Van der Byl was partly motivated by the memory of his father, who had been in opposition to the National Party.&lt;ref name="smith197"/&gt;

===Contribution to diplomacy===
As the prominence of the issue of Rhodesia increased in the late 1970s, attention on Van der Byl increased. Reporters noted his impressively quotable lines at press conferences (such as his explanation for why the Rhodesian government did not usually give the names of guerrillas which it had hanged: "Why should we? Anyway, it's academic because they're normally dead after it").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XGl0AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Why+should+we%3F+Anyway+its+academic+because+they+are+normally+dead+van+der+Byl&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Why+should+we%3F%22+ ''The Past Is Another Country: Rhodesia 1890-1979''], Martin Meredith, A. Deutsch, 1979, page 284&lt;/ref&gt; While negotiating with the Patriotic Front put together by ZANU and ZAPU at the [[Geneva Conference (1976)|Geneva Conference]] in November 1976, he described ZANU leader Robert Mugabe as "this bloodthirsty Marxist puppet" and the Patriotic Front proposals as "almost a parody, a music hall caricature of communist invective".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yHgNAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22almost+a+parody,+a+music+hall+caricature+of+communist+invective%22&amp;dq=%22almost+a+parody,+a+music+hall+caricature+of+communist+invective%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD9PbOhJ3WAhXIDcAKHbi6DhQQ6AEIKDAA ''A Short Thousand Years: The End of Rhodesia's Rebellion''], Paul L. Moorcraft, Galaxie Press, 1979, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Mugabe repeatedly arrived late to the meetings held during the conference, and on one occasion Van der Byl tersely reprimanded the ZANU leader for his tardiness. Mugabe flew into a rage and shouted across the table at Van der Byl, calling the Rhodesian minister a "foul-mouthed bloody fool!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

{{Quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=... it is better to fight to the last man and the last cartridge and die with some honour. Because, what is being presented to us here is a degree of humiliation ...|source=&lt;small&gt;Van der Byl comments on a British peace plan in 1977&lt;ref&gt;The Past is Another Country, Martin Meredith, p291&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}}
At this conference, which was organised by Britain with American support, Van der Byl rejected the idea of an interim British presence in Rhodesia during a transition to majority rule, which was identified as one of the few ways of persuading the Patriotic Front to endorse a settlement.&lt;ref name="rebuffed"&gt;"'British presence' idea rebuffed by Mr Smith", ''The Times'', Saturday, 4 December 1976, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was adjourned by the British foreign minister, [[Anthony Crosland]], on 14 December 1976,&lt;ref name="wessels215216"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wessels
|2010
|pp=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately never reconvened. The nationalist leaders said they would not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule were made the only topic for discussion.&lt;ref name="sibanda213"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Sibanda
|2005
|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, on 7 January 1977, Van der Byl announced the Rhodesian government's rejection of every proposal made in Geneva.&lt;ref name="rejects"&gt;"Rhodesia rejects all proposals", ''The Times'', Saturday, 8 January 1977, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, Van der Byl was finding pressure put on him by more moderate voices within Rhodesia and hinted that the government might amend the Land Tenure Act, which effectively split the country into sections reserved for each racial group. He also remarked that Bishop Abel Muzorewa "can be said to represent the African in this country",&lt;ref name="knipe5"&gt;Michael Knipe, "Mr Richard warns Salisbury not to reject peace plan", ''The Times'', Friday, 21 January 1977, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; which indicated the direction in which the Smith government was hoping to travel: an accommodation with moderate voices within Rhodesia was likely to be a better end than a capitulation to the Patriotic Front. Van der Byl was prepared to support this strategy and did not go along with the 12 Rhodesian Front MPs who formed the [[Rhodesian Action Party]] in early 1977 claiming that the Front had not adhered to party principles.

Although Van der Byl was now prepared to say that he supported the transition to majority rule, he was quick to put restrictions on it when interviewed in April 1977. He insisted that majority rule would only be possible on a "very qualified franchise—that's what the whole thing is about", and also said that any settlement must be endorsed by a two-thirds majority of the existing House of Assembly (which was largely elected by white Rhodesians).&lt;ref name="knipe6"&gt;Michael Knipe, "Mr Van der Byl demands guerrillas scale down war before Rhodesia settlement", ''The Times'', Monday, 25 April 1977, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Over the summer of 1977 he continued to warn that insistence on capitulation to the Patriotic Front would produce a white backlash and put negotiations back.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;"Warning of 'white backlash'", ''The Times'', Wednesday, 29 June 1977, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Rhodesian government was forced to put its internal settlement negotiations on hold during a joint US-UK initiative in late 1977. Van der Byl's public comments seemed to be aimed at ensuring this mission did not succeed, as he insisted that it had no chance of negotiating a ceasefire, described the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration as "mindless", and the joint mission as being "Anglo-American-Russian".&lt;ref name="ashford"&gt;Nicholas Ashford, "Rhodesian doubts on Carver mission", ''The Times'', Wednesday, 2 November 1977; p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; When a plan was published, he described it as "totally outrageous" and involving "the imposition of unconditional surrender on an undefeated people who are not enemies".&lt;ref name="brush"&gt;"Lord Carver denies he was given 'brush off' by leaders in Africa", ''The Times'', Friday, 11 November 1977, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal settlement===
The mission did fail and the internal settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/1978/04/17/BGY510270250/?s=sithole Rhodesia: New Black Foreign Minister, Dr. Elliott Gabellah Criticises American Opposition to Internal Settlement Plans], [[ITN]], 17 April 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and the guerrilla war continued; [[Lord Richard Cecil]], a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978&lt;ref&gt;Rory Peck Trust :[http://www.rorypecktrust.org/remember.htm list of journalists killed in war] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706185250/http://www.rorypecktrust.org/remember.htm |date=6 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.&lt;ref name="cecilobit"&gt;"Lord Richard Cecil" (obituary), ''The Times'', Saturday, 22 April 1978, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In May Van der Byl greeted news of massacres in [[Zaire]] as "a blessing in disguise" because they might ensure that warnings about Soviet penetration in Africa were heeded.&lt;ref name="blessing"&gt;"Kolwezi 'a blessing in disguise'", ''The Times'', Monday, 29 May 1978, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He denounced the British government the following month for refusing to recognise that a massacre of Elim missionaries was perpetrated by the Patriotic Front.&lt;ref name="cleary"&gt;Frederick Cleary, "Call from Salisbury for Owen explanation", ''The Times'', Wednesday, 28 June 1978, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; As the date for the full implementation of the internal settlement grew nearer, Van der Byl's profile decreased, but he remained active in politics: he was elected unopposed for the whites-only Gatooma/Hartley seat to the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia House of Assembly. He handed over power to his African successor on 1 June 1979, and became instead Minister of Transport and Power and Minister of Posts in the new government.

===Lancaster House===
When "the wheels came off the wagon" (as he put it)&lt;ref name="rhodesiana"/&gt; at [[Lancaster House Agreement|Lancaster House]] in 1979, Van der Byl greeted the event with amused detachment. He was not a member of any delegation at the conference and did not attend. The weekend after the agreement, he called on the Rhodesian Front to revitalise itself as the only true representative of Europeans in Rhodesia,&lt;ref name="future"&gt;Nicholas Ashford, "Future looks doubtful for Smith party", ''The Times'', Saturday, 17 November 1979, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and he ascribed the result of the conference to "a succession of perfidious British governments".&lt;ref name="spanier2"&gt;David Spanier, "Ceasefire accord sought this week", ''The Times'', Monday, 19 November 1979, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ian Smith's memoirs, Van der Byl organised a meeting between Ian Smith and Lieutenant-General [[Peter Walls]], Commander of the Rhodesian Army, shortly before the first Zimbabwean elections in February 1980, where they agreed a strategy to prevent Robert Mugabe winning.&lt;ref name="smith336"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Smith
|1997
|p=336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They met again on 26 February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's interim government would win enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which were all Rhodesian Front, to deny Mugabe victory. However, the early election results in March dented this confidence.

Smith asked Walls for details of his plan ("Operation Quartz")&lt;ref name="quartz"&gt;[http://www.rhodesia.nl/quartz.htm Operation Quartz – Rhodesia 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; for using force to prevent [[ZANU-PF]] taking power by force if it lost the election. Walls insisted that ZANU-PF would not win the election. When it did happen, both Smith and Van der Byl believed that the Army should step in to prevent Mugabe taking over. Walls took the view that it was already too late, and while the others wished for some move, they were forced to concede to this view.&lt;ref name="smith336"/&gt;

===In Zimbabwe===
Van der Byl had been elected unopposed to the new [[House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|House of Assembly]] for [[Kadoma, Zimbabwe|Gatooma]]/[[Chegutu|Hartley]] and remained a close associate of Smith, becoming Vice-President of the 'Republican Front' (later renamed the [[Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe]]). At the [[Zimbabwe parliamentary election, 1985|1985 general election]] the boundaries for the White Roll seats were altered and Van der Byl fought in Mount Pleasant, opposing Chris Andersen.&lt;ref name="raath3"&gt;Jan Raath, "Time stands still for Smith as whites face up to reality", ''The Times'', Thursday, 27 June 1985, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Andersen had broken with the Rhodesian Front to sit as an Independent and became Minister of State for the Public Service in Robert Mugabe's government. Van der Byl lost the election heavily,&lt;ref name="raath"&gt;Jan Raath, "Smith wins battle in Bulawayo", ''The Times'', Friday, 28 June 1985, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; polling only 544 votes to 1,017 for Andersen and 466 for a third candidate. The Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe still controlled the election of ten white Senators and Smith agreed to elect Van der Byl to one of the [[Senate of Zimbabwe|Senate]] seats.

Parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished in 1987. Van der Byl made his last speech in Parliament on 10 September, in which he praised Robert Mugabe for the "absolute courtesy" he had shown since independence. He noted that he was the last surviving member of the 1965 government remaining in Parliament, and declared he hoped "I would have been cherished .. as a sort of national monument, and not flung into the political wilderness". His speech loudly denounced the former Republican Front and Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe members who had gone over to the government, describing them as "dreadful souls screaming in agony". The government minister Dr [[Edson Zvobgo]] responded with a poem referring to the number of rebels killed fighting troops under Van der Byl's command.&lt;ref name="raath2"&gt;Jan Raath, "Zimbabwe prize-fighters don kid gloves", ''The Times'', Saturday, 12 September 1987, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage, issue and retirement==
On 31 August 1979 at Schloss Waldstein in Austria, Van der Byl married [[Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria (1922–1993)#Marriage|Princess Charlotte Maria Benedikte Eleonore Adelheid of Liechtenstein]]. She was thirty years his junior, the daughter of Prince Heinrich of Liechtenstein and granddaughter of [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]], the last emperor of Austria. The couple had three sons: Pieter Vincenz, Valerian, and Casimir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1999/S-Africa-s-Van-der-Byl-Dies-at-76/id-c07dfd7e2d9b4c6fa00a46cfae6a2ed6|title=S. Africa's Van der Byl Dies at 76|agency=Associated Press|date=17 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Van der Byl had inherited from his mother a property described as "the magnificent estate .. near Caledon in the Western Cape," and following the end of his political career had no need to keep a home in Zimbabwe, so he quit the place. He left as a rich man, with an attractive young wife, and enjoyed his retirement. He frequently visited London, where he was a good friend of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Viscount Cranborne]], who put him up for membership of the [[Turf Club (Gentlemen's Club)|Turf Club]].&lt;ref name="vallely"&gt;Paul Vallely and John Rentoul, "A Lordly plot to save their place", ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 December 1996, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Both were members of [[White's Club]] and were often seen there when Van der Byl was in town.&lt;ref&gt;"Pinochet revisited", ''[[Evening Standard]]'', 18 January 1999. Page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days after his 76th birthday, Van der Byl died at Fairfield, in [[Caledon, Western Cape]]. In his obituary,&lt;ref name="van der vat" /&gt; [[Dan van der Vat]] wrote "The arrival of majority rule in South Africa made no difference, and he died a very wealthy man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/30/guardianobituaries1 | title=Pieter van der Byl: Rich, white aristocrat behind Rhodesia's bid to stop black rule | work=Guardian | date=30 November 1999 | accessdate=9 November 2012 | author=van der Vat, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Railroad Tycoon II''''' is a [[train simulator|train]] and [[business simulation]] video game for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Dreamcast]] in the [[Railroad Tycoon (series)|''Railroad Tycoon'' series]]. The Dreamcast version is a Gold Edition with improved graphics and gameplay.  ''Railroad Tycoon II: Gold Edition'' was ported to [[Linux]] by [[Loki Software]].

Gameplay is displayed in [[dimetric projection|dimetric view]], unlike the top-down view of ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Railroadtyccon screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot from ''Railroad Tycoon II''.]]
''Railroad Tycoon II'' is a [[railroad simulation]] that covers the entire history of railroads from inception to the present day and beyond. The player chooses a map and assumes the role of chairman of a [[railroad company]]. The player tries to make profits for investors and completes various other objectives while being hindered by rivals, random events such as train breakdowns, [[train robber]]s, economic swings, and scripted events particular to the scenario.

Most of the gameplay consists of building tracks, stations and trains, which are used for hauling passengers and freight from one station to another. Delivery revenue can vary by time, distance, demand, cargo type, economic state, station improvements and difficulty level. Companies can connect to and use each other's track and stations, so revenue can be split. Expenses include the fuel, track and engine maintenance and management fee. The fuel cost depends on the cargo weight and the distance each engine runs. Engine maintenance depends on engine age and the engine's type (some locomotives cost more to maintain than others). The elder engines cost more to keep them on the line. The track maintenance is solely calculated from track [[Distance|mileage]].

The player will determine what kind of cargo(es) to put on/off at each station that the player adds to its routing. Way-points may also be inserted to override default track selection where multiple paths are possible.

There are many industries in the game, and each can produce and/or convert specific cargoes. For example, coal mines produce coal, iron mines produce iron, and, in the advanced game, a [[steel mill]] can convert 1 load of [[iron]] plus 1 load of [[coal]] into 2 loads of [[steel]]. The players are encouraged to find a chain of production to make new cargo by hauling the right type of cargo to each step of the industries. By doing this right, the player can haul raw materials one way, "create" manufactured return cargo, and make even more money hauling finished products back the other way.

===Locomotives and industry===
One of the key elements of game play relates to the player purchasing and operating a variety of locomotives, each of which possesses different attributes relating to speed, fuel type, preferred cargo, and the ability to traverse hills and steep track grades. In general, the player should balance the cost of operating a train and the time required to transport cargo, with the balance being that the profit from cargo delivery outweighs train operating costs. The player also may purchase various industrial plants to earn extra money based on amount of cargo received and delivered. Basic industry, such as [[bakery|bakeries]], [[Textile manufacturing|textile mill]]s, and [[Tool and die maker|tool and die factories]], earns less profit than advanced factories such as [[Canning|canneries]], steel mills and [[car|automobile]] plants, although the latter require multiple goods delivered to produce one final product. Furthermore, idle industries which do not produce goods will generate a negative profit, thus increasing overall operating costs and [[Overhead (business)|overhead]].

The following locomotives are available for game play. Locomotives are only seen in specific time periods and scenarios. In addition to the attributes described above, locomotives are subject to "mechanical reliability", which is a randomly generated factor influencing how often a locomotive will break down. All locomotives begin their operational lives with a set chance of mechanical failure, with some types more prone to breakdowns than others. Breakdown percentage chance increases the older a locomotive becomes. A train may also suffer a [[train wreck|wreck]], which completely destroys the locomotive and all hauled cargo.

The game also features one futuristic train, the "Mag-Lev TBX-1" which is portrayed as released in the (then) future date of 2008.  The train operates using [[Maglev]] technology which, as of 2015, has been prototyped in both Europe and Japan.  The first successful Maglev train to be operated was the [[SCMaglev]] with speeds approaching 400 miles per hour.

===Economics===

Gameplay also includes financial manipulation of companies, issuing [[bond (finance)|bond]]s, [[share repurchase]]s, [[stock issue]]s, manipulating [[dividend]]s, merging with other companies and declaring [[bankruptcy]]. These features are required in some scenarios and may be used for either great financial gain or total fiscal disaster.

In normal financial mode, the player may buy or sell any companies' stocks at various prices depending upon the economy. On advanced settings, the broker may allow the player to [[margin (finance)#Margin buying|buy on margin]] or [[short (finance)|short sell]] stocks if he has enough value of stocks or cash to rely on. The computer players may also engage in these practices and will attempt to bankrupt the player when he is heavily in debt.

The economy may fluctuate during gameplay, with five economic states possible: Booming, Prosperity, Normal, [[Recession]] and [[Depression (economics)|Depression]]. When the economy is good, the revenue of hauled goods and stock prices will be higher. Bond interest rates will also be adjusted with the economy level, including the interest received from cash and the interest paid for the bonds.

===Campaigns and scenarios===

The original game features eighteen missions, divided between North America, Europe and the rest of the world. The missions can be played on three difficulty levels, and each also includes three listed objectives.  Completing only the first objective awards the player a bronze medal, the first two a silver medal, and all three a gold medal. The player may play any mission in each set as many times as they wish; they may also continue even though a mission has been failed. The final score for the whole 18 mission campaign is calculated by the difficulty level and the number of each type of medal achieved.

In addition to the campaign, ''Railroad Tycoon II'' features many single scenarios. As with the campaign, each scenario is based on a geographical location, which may be fictional. Most scenarios also have a medal system similar to that of the campaign, although any scenario may be played in [[sandbox mode]] as well. Many scenarios constrain the player to some specific point on the timeline and feature scripted events: for example, the [[Korea]]n map presents an [[alternate history|alternative history]] as the player is informed about the averted [[Korean civil war]].

Additional single scenarios may be created using the [[map editor]] included. Maps may be imported, drawn from scratch, or edited from existing maps and saved under new names. Many fan creations have been shared on various [[fan site]]s.

==Development==
In late 1997, [[Bruce Shelley]] said of his chance of developing ''Railroad Tycoon II'', "I would be happy to work on such a game but there are real doubts about its ability to generate sufficient sales in this blockbuster market where a few of the games make most of the money."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19990506043125/http://www.gamecenter.com:80/News/Item/Cont/0,4,0-1280_2,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
The soundtrack of ''Railroad Tycoon II'' consist mostly of classical "railroad" blues and bluegrass genre from the era the game revolves around. These pieces were not, unlike most contemporary games, midi files, but rather high quality studio recordings; some even with vocals. This fact has contributed to the solid ratings this game has received.&lt;!--The soundtrack consists of the following tracks:--&gt;

===Editions===
''Railroad Tycoon 2: Gold'' is a collection of ''Railroad Tycoon 2'' and ''Railroad Tycoon 2: The Second Century'', in one package. ''Railroad Tycoon 2: Platinum'' is equivalent to the ''Gold Edition'' plus over 50 community-made maps added and enhanced mouse-wheel support. Maps (scenarios) developed specifically for the platinum edition may not function in some earlier versions. The last official [[patch (computing)|patch]] to ''Railroad Tycoon 2'' was [https://web.archive.org/web/20130414213020/http://www.shacknews.com/file/2301/railroad-tycoon-2-platinum-156-patch platinum v1.56] on February 19, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PhilSteinmeyer.com  » Blog Archive   » The missing Railroad Tycoon 2 map…|url = http://www.philsteinmeyer.com/55/the-missing-railroad-tycoon-2-map/|website = www.philsteinmeyer.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 2000, ''Railroad Tycoon II'' had been released in 39 unique [[Stock keeping unit|SKU]]s worldwide, including eight Windows versions in English alone. PopTop's Phil Steinmeyer wrote that roughly 33% of the game's sales derived from the ''Gold'' edition and ''Second Century'' expansion, and that the port for Macintosh "sold respectably", while the PlayStation version was unsuccessful. He accredited the game's number of versions with its commercial success, and wrote in August 2000, "Overall, had we only released the original game, in English, for Windows only, our sales would be less than a quarter of what they are now."&lt;ref name=steinmeyersales&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050317062552/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/029/034/isf_column.html |url=http://www.cdmag.com:80/articles/029/034/isf_column.html |title=Inside the Sausage Factory; Language Barriers |author=Steinmeyer, Phil |date=August 14, 2000 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine]] |archivedate=March 17, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Steinmeyer remarked that ''Railroad Tycoon II'' continued to sell "pretty well".&lt;ref name=cgmprev&gt;{{cite journal |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303225823/http://www.cgonline.com/computer-games-magazine/article/return_of_the_king1/ |url=http://www.cgonline.com/computer-games-magazine/article/return_of_the_king1/ |title=Return of the King |author=Sones, Benjamin E. | issue=150 | date=May 2003 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine]] |archivedate=March 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uzi Katz''' (born September 1960) is an Israeli businessman and the chief executive officer of [[Telit]] until it was uncovered that '''Oozi Cats''' was allegedly the same person as '''Uzi Katz''', who was indicted for property fraud in the United States in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/14/telit-communications-chief-oozi-cats-us|title=Telit Communications chief fired after fraud allegations|first1=Shane|last1=Hickey|first2=Rupert|last2=Neate|date=14 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40921599|title=Telit chief Oozi Cats resigns after US fraud allegations|author=|date=14 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Villeneuve-d'Ascq''' ({{IPA-fr|vilnœvdask}}; {{lang-pcd|Neuvile-Ask}}) is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|department]] in northern [[France]]. With more than 60,000 inhabitants and 50,000 students, it is one of the main cities of the [[Métropole Européenne de Lille]] and the largest in area (27.46&amp;nbsp;km²) after [[Lille]]; it is also one of the main cities of the [[Hauts-de-France]] [[Regions of France|region]].

Built up owing to the merger between the former [[communes of France|communes]] of [[Ascq]], [[Annappes]] and [[Flers-lez-Lille]], Villeneuve-d'Ascq is a [[planned community|new town]] and the cradle of the first automatic metro system of the world ([[Véhicule Automatique Léger|VAL]]).

Villeneuve-d'Ascq is nicknamed the 'green [[technopole]]' thanks to the implantation of many researchers — two campus of the [[University of Lille]]; many graduate engineering schools — and companies in a pleasant living environment. Owing to its [[activity centre]]s, its [[Haute Borne]] European scientific park and two [[shopping mall]]s, Villeneuve-d'Ascq is one of the main economic spots of the [[Hauts-de-France]] [[Regions of France|region]]; [[multinational corporation]]s such as [[Bonduelle]], [[Cofidis]] and [[Decathlon Group|Decathlon]] have their head office there.

Outside its academic, scientific and business facilities, Villeneuve-d'Ascq is mostly known because of its sporting events &amp;ndash; two stadiums ([[Stade Pierre-Mauroy]] and [[Stadium Lille Métropole]]) are located there and some of its sport teams are playing in the top division; its museums &amp;ndash; the most famous is the one of modern, contemporary and outsider art (the [[Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art|LaM]]); its green ways and its medical facilities for disabled people.

==Name==
Its name means "new city of Ascq" in [[French language|French]]. Ascq is possibly derived from the [[Flemish language|Flemish]] word for "ash". The name of the city is generally written without the customary (official) hyphen.

==Geography==
The city counts approximately {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of greenspace, lakes, forests and arable lands.
It is located between [[Lille]] and [[Roubaix]], at the crossroads of the principal freeways towards [[Paris]], [[Ghent]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Brussels]].

==History==
Development on what is now Villeneuve-d'Ascq can be traced back to Celtic [[Gaul]] era, and are anchored in two feudal mounds, a [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] site and a [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] one.

The area was selected in the 1960s to accommodate a [[planned community|new town]] then designated the name ''Lille-Est'', which was to channel the growth of the agglomeration of Lille city and development of institutions based in the area. The commune of Villeneuve-d'Ascq was created in 1970 by the amalgamation of the communes of [[Ascq]], [[Annappes]] and [[Flers-lez-Lille|Flers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/methodes/nomenclatures/cog/fichecommunale.asp?codedep=59&amp;codecom=009 INSEE]&lt;/ref&gt; Its name evokes at the same time the new (''neuve'') and the old: former commune Ascq and its memory as martyr town of 1 April 1944, date on which the Nazis massacred 86 men ([[Ascq  massacre]]).

== Early life ==
Álvaro Saieh was born on September 14, 1949, in [[Villanueva (La Guajira)]], [[Colombia]]. Of Palestinian ancestry, his parents are Chilean José Saieh and Colombian Elena Bendeck.

At the age of three his family moved to Talca, Chile, where they started Casa Saieh, a family business that offered from electrical appliances to clothing. In this city, he started his education, finishing high school at Liceo Abate Molina. At 17 years old he moved to Santiago to pursue a degree in commercial engineering at Universidad de Chile, from which he graduated in 1972. In 1973 he started a postgraduate degree in Economics at the same university. Later, he attended The University of Chicago, where he pursued a master´s degree in arts (1976) and a PhD in economics.

His first years as a professional he worked in the public sector, being an economic adviser for the Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo and the Ministerio de Obras Públicas. He was also an economic adviser for the Banco Central de Chile and delegate of the Superintendencia de Bancos at Banco Continental.

== Business career ==
In the 1980s Álvaro Saieh started his business activity, acquiring -along with other investors of Arabic roots, including Carlos Abuhomor- the Banco Osorno y la Unión. During the 1990s he also acquired AFP Provida, currently one of the leading pension fund managers in Chile; then, during the same decade, he sold both companies to international groups.

=== CorpBanca ===
These first operations were followed by the acquisition, in 1995, of the Banco Concepción, a bank that presented a negative equity and an important subordinated debt to the State. In less than 10 years Saieh would transform it into Chile's fourth largest private bank, now known as Corpbanca.

This institution gradually grew up, entering the global market with operations in several countries of Latin America, such as Peru, Argentina and Colombia, and opening offices in Madrid and New York City. Within this process of growth, in 2011 CorpBanca made the largest investment of a Chilean company abroad, acquiring Banco Santander Colombia in an operation close to US $1.2 billion. Later, Saieh acquired Helm Bank, transforming CorpBanca Colombia into the fifth private bank of the country.

=== CorpGroup ===
In the following years Álvaro Saieh expanded his activities, creating CorpGroup, a conglomerate with investments in the financial, retail, real estate, hotel, and media business.

==== ''Itaú CorpBanca'' ====

==== ''SMU'' ====
In 2007 the Saieh family purchased Unimarc supermarkets, entering the retail business. This marked the beginning of SMU, the third supermarket chain in Chile and the one with the largest national coverage. SMU operates with wholesale chains (Alvi and Mayorista 10), convenience stores (Ok Market), supermarkets (Unimarc), and a hardware chain (Construmart). SMU is also present in Peru, through Mayorsa supermarkets.

==== ''VivoCorp'' ====
VivoCorp is the company that gathers all the real estate business of CorpGroup, with 70 stand-alone stores, 60 strip malls and 3 power centers. With 350,000 m2 between malls and outlet stores, its main assets are Mall Vivo San Fernando, Mall Vivo Los Trapenses, Panoramic Mall and El Centro Mall, in addition to the participation in Casa Costanera. VivoCorp also owns Maipú and Peñuelas outlet stores, in addition to the early opening of La Florida and Temuco outlet stores.

During 2017 two major projects are also expected to materialize: Mall Vivo Coquimbo and Mall Vivo Imperio, in addition to the construction of Mall Vivo Santiago.
