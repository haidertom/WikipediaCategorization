[[File:Arts District, Las Vegas, United States (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Pink Cadillac in the Downtown Arts District.]]

The '''Las Vegas Arts District''', or the '''18b''' in [[Downtown Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] was created in 1998 as an 18 block zone set aside to encourage art and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Downtown Arts District  | url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/nevada/las-vegas/review-178016.html | work=[[Fodor's Travel]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district won [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'s ''Best of Las Vegas'' award in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Ken |last = White| title=Downtown Arts District finally taking hold | url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/bestoflv/2005/bestartsdistrict.jsp;jsessionid=BMGLLJLEFKAA | work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as the 18b, the Las Vegas Arts District contains a mix of independent businesses including [[vintage clothing]] boutiques, antique stores, art galleries, hair salons, restaurants,  
The 18b is located halfway between the Fremont East Entertainment district and the Stratosphere Resort, clustered around Main and Charleston, bounded loosely by Commerce Street to the West, Hoover Avenue to the North, Fourth Street to the East and Wyoming Avenue at the south. It is an easy bike ride, walk or bus ride from Fremont Street.  The name, "18b," represents the original Arts District area, which consisted of 18 blocks. Today, the Arts District area has grown beyond those original 18 blocks and is a classic urban mix of residential, commercial and cultural uses that will continue to grow as the hub of the arts scene in Las Vegas.

The "First Friday" Art Walk is a monthly arts and cultural event drawing up to 30,000 visitors into the neighborhood on the first Friday evening of each month. This event encourages people to flock downtown to browse, buy, eat, drink and mingle. The event is a festival environment with food and beverage vendors, music, visual performances and artists/artisans/craftspeople displaying their works.

== Events ==
The district hosts a ''First Friday'' art walk on the first Friday of every month.  First Friday offers an eclectic group of artists as well as "entertainers of all types, including local bands, fire breathers, acrobats, break dancers, fortune tellers and performance artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Artsy Schmartzy | url=http://www.jewishlasvegas.com/page.aspx?id=148648 | publisher=[[United Jewish Communities]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''First Friday'', Preview Thursday is held preceding night before the block party. It is a subdued night of gallery openings and special events around the arts district without the large crowds that the main event can bring.

== Boundaries ==
The district is loosely bounded by Hoover Avenue, Wyoming Avenue, [[Las Vegas Boulevard]], and Commerce Street. The official bounds are visible on the ''City of Las Vegas'' website.

The '''Asian American Arts Centre (AAAC)''' is a [[non-profit organization]] located in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] in [[New York City]]. Founded in 1974, it is one of the earliest [[Asian-American|Asian American]] community organizations in the United States. The Arts Centre presents the ongoing developments between contemporary Asian &amp; Asian American art forms and Western art forms through the presentation of performance, exhibitions, and public education. AAAC’s permanent collection, which it has accumulated since 1989, contains hundreds of contemporary Asian American art works and traditional/folk art pieces. The organization also has an Artists Archive which documents, preserves, and promotes the presence of Asian American visual culture in the [[United states|United States]] since 1945. This includes the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], especially the [[New York metropolitan area|greater New York area]]; the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]; and some artists in [[Canada]], [[Hawaii]], and overseas. The artists include Asian Americans producing art, Asian artists who are active in the United States, and other Americans who are significantly influenced by Asia. [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] in outlook, the Arts Centre’s understanding of ‘Asia’ encompasses traditions and influences with sources ranging from [[Afghanistan]] to Hawaii.

== Mission ==

The mission of the Asian American Arts Centre is to affirm and promote the preservation and creative vitality of Asian American cultural growth through the arts, and its historical and aesthetic linkage to other communities. AAAC accomplishes this by utilizing art, performances, [[new media]], and public education. Aiming to engage other communities and concerns in a creative encounter, the Arts Centre brings cultural events in contemporary visual art to the general public. AAAC has come to see the arts in terms of their historical and spiritual relationship to diverse neighborhoods.

== History ==

The Asian American Arts Centre was founded in 1974 in New York as the [[Asian American Dance Theatre]] (AADT), a not-for-profit community arts organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artspiral.org/|title=Asian American Arts Centre - Home|website=artspiral.org|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the older community arts organizations in Chinatown, Manhattan, beginning with the start of the [[Asian American movement]] and growing out of [[Basement Workshop]] with other Asian American cultural and political organizations in New York.

In 1974, the organization operated out of the [[New York Public Library]] to offer dance classes and dance presentations to the community. It obtained its original location on the third floor of 26 Bowery Street as an Artist-In-Residence (AIR) tenant in 1976; the education programs were expanded into a Saturday Community School on-site, which included dance and later art classes for children and adults. The organization started its Arts-in-Education program in 1978, conducting workshops and lectures in city-wide public schools.

In 1982, the organization created the Asian American Artists' Slide Archive (the first public archive for Asian American artists in the United States), started an annual nine-month Artists-in-Residence program, and organized its first exhibition, ''Eye to Eye''. This exhibition, which featured a panel with [[John Yau]], [[David Diao]], [[Margo Machida]], [[Lucy Lippard]], Lydia Okumura, Kit Yin Snyder, and [[John Woo]], was the first of its kind to bring together Asian American visual artists on the East Coast.

=== Exhibitions and performances at Bowery location (1983–2010) ===

==== 1983 - 1993 ====
The ''Eye to Eye'' exhibition initiated a series of visual art exhibitions as part of a new program within the AADT called the Asian Arts Institute, consisting of three to five contemporary visual art exhibitions and one folk art exhibition each year. The Traditional Arts Presentation and Documentation program began in 1985. The organization adopted its current name, the Asian American Arts Centre (AAAC), in 1987 to encompass both the dance company (AADT) and the visual arts program.

In addition to regular exhibitions at the Bowery location in Chinatown, AAAC held many of its programs at other sites and locations in the country. In 1989, the Arts Centre organized its most ambitious exhibition, ''CHINA: June 4, 1989'', in response to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square student massacre.]] Accumulating contributions from over 300 artists over the next several months, ''CHINA: June 4, 1989'' was exhibited at the Blum Helman Gallery and PS1 (now [[MoMA PS1]]) in 1990, and travelled to Austin, Texas, Cleveland, Ohio, and later to Flint, Michigan in 1994. In conjunction with the ''CHINA: June 4, 1989'' visual art exhibition, the dance company mounted a program of performances in 1990 titled A Memorial Performance of Music, Poetry and Dance which featured [[Zuni Icosahedron|Zuni Icosahedron’s]] U.S. debut of “Deep Structure…” among other performances by contributing artists. A smaller selection of artworks from this exhibition, including art by [[Martin Wong]], was exhibited in Hong Kong in 1990 for the first memorial of the protests. The Arts Centre was contracted to curate an exhibition in the U.S. Senate’s [[Russell Senate Office Building|Russell Rotunda]] in Washington, D.C. upon the escape of [[Chai Ling]] and [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], two former leaders of the student demonstrations, from China. However, upon the rejection of two proposed artworks by [[Byron Kim]] and [[Zhang Hongtu]] for the exhibition by Senate sponsors, AAAC refused to participate and withdrew the artworks it had planned to exhibit shortly before the show’s debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artspiral.org/past_exhibitions/june4/pdfs/review_international_examiner.pdf|title=‘Controversial’ Tiananmen art show casualty of flap over NEA|last=Lau|first=Alan|date=19 September 1990|work=International Examiner|access-date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asian American Dance Theatre continued to perform under the artistic direction of Eleanor Yung in New York and around the United States until 1992, and was structured around four areas of programming: (1) its annual New York Dance Season, (2) touring and special performances, (3) Arts-in-Education programs, and (4) the Community School. AADT held its own New York Season in contemporary dance every year from 1976 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artspiral.org/aadt.php|title=Asian American Arts Centre - Asian American Dance Theatre|website=www.artspiral.org|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance company’s total repertoire, however, encompassed contemporary dance and traditional Asian folk/classical dance from countries such as China, Japan, Korea, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bali, and the Pacific Islands. For its touring performances, AADT’s programs usually consisted of traditional dances and sometimes contemporary dances. AADT also organized special programs such as the ''D’Asia Vu Performance Series'', which ran from the late 1980s to early 1990s. The Arts-in-Education programs and Community School were continued from earlier programming begun in the late 1970s.

During the 14-year run of AADT’s New York Season, the dance company performed at various sites and events throughout New York including Riverside Dance Festival, [[Marymount Manhattan College]] Theater, [[Pace University]] Schimmel Center, [[Dance Theater Workshop]], Open Eye Theater, Clark Center NYC, and Synod House. For its touring performances, AADT performed at colleges and sites in [[Texas]], [[Ohio]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], and numerous other states throughout the country. AADT collaborated with notable choreographers Saeko Ichinohe, Sun Ock Lee, and Reynaldo Alejandro in the Asian New Dance Coalition; the company also invited guest choreographers, dancers, performers, and artists such as Yung Yung Tsuai, [[Muna Tseng]], [[Zuni Icosahedron]], [[Sin Cha Hong]], poets [[Kimiko Hahn]] &amp; Shu Ting, playwright [[David Henry Hwang]], and artist [[Zhang Hongtu]]. Several dance company performances are currently archived in video format at the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/asian-american-dance-theater-video-archive#/?tab=about|title=Asian American Dance Theater Video Archive - NYPL Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.nypl.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AAAC has produced exhibition catalogs, videos, and sound recordings that document visual arts, oral traditions,&lt;ref name="Cheung, King-Kok 1997 pp. 42"&gt;Cheung, King-Kok (editor) (1997). An Interethnic Companion to Asian American Literature. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 42. {{ISBN|0-521-44790-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Fong Ten, et al. (1991). ''Singing to Remember''. (VHS tape) New York: Asian American Arts Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; music, and performances. ''ARTSPIRAL,'' a magazine published by AAAC that focuses broadly on city-wide Asian American cultural issues, ran as an annual print publication from 1988 to 1993; it was revived in 2008 as an online blog.&lt;ref name="Cheung, King-Kok 1997 pp. 42"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artspiral.blogspot.com/|title=Artspiral|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Artists-in-Residence program, which supported 19 young artists in total, including [[Zhang Hongtu]], [[Margo Machida]], Yong Soon Min, [[Byron Kim]], and [[Dinh Q. Lê]], concluded in 1993.

==== 1993 - 2010 ====
After 1993 AAAC's programs consisted of four areas: (1) contemporary Asian American art exhibitions, (2) folk art exhibitions and research, (3) public education, and (4) the development of a permanent collection. These programs encompassed the preservation of Asian cultural traditions as well as the development of contemporary Asian and Asian American art forms.

AAAC’s main annual exhibition presented young Asian American artists or artists significantly influenced by Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/15/arts/art-review-where-witty-meets-gritty.html|title=ART REVIEW; Where Witty Meets Gritty|last=Cotter|first=Holland|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts Centre also organized annual solo exhibitions for mid-career artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/23/arts/art-review-when-east-goes-west-the-twain-meet-here.html|title=ART REVIEW; When East Goes West, The Twain Meet Here|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=|work=|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists who have exhibited at AAAC include [[Vito Acconci]], [[Ai Weiwei]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artspiral.org/artspiral_magazine/issue_01/mcevilley.html|title=Asian American Arts Centre--Artspiral Magazine Issue #1|website=www.artspiral.org|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomie Arai]], [[Shusaku Arakawa]], [[Natvar Bhavsar]], [[Wafaa Bilal]], [[Luis Camnitzer]], [[Chen Zhen (artist)|Chen Zhen]], [[Emily Cheng]], [[Mel Chin]], [[Albert Chong]], [[Kip Fulbeck]], Chitra Ganesh, [[Gu Wenda]], [[Zarina (artist)|Zarina Hashmi]], [[Tehching Hsieh]], Venancio C.

The Folk Art program consisted of performances, lectures, and exhibitions, and presented traditional artists during the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]] every year. AAAC produced a collection of materials—including a video documentary titled ''Singing to Remember'' in 1971; and later in 2000, CD audio recordings, essays, and song lyrics compiled in a book titled ''Uncle Ng Comes to America''—that captured the life story and artistry of Ng Sheung Chi, also known as Uncle Ng.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artspiral.org/uncle-ng.php|title=Asian American Arts Centre - Uncle Ng|website=artspiral.org|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ng, a native of [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan County]] in southwestern China—a region that generated the majority of Chinese immigrants to Chinatown before the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]]—immigrated to the U.S. in 1979. Ng became well-known in New York’s Chinatown as a singer and composer of ''muk’yu'', or [[wooden fish]], a type of narrative folk song typically sung in the Toisanese dialect. Gaining national recognition as a folk artist due to the Arts Centre’s efforts, Ng was awarded the [[National Heritage Fellowship]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/fellows/ng-sheung-chi|title=Ng Sheung-Chi|date=2013-01-24|work=NEA|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Folk Art program also showcased traditions such as [[seal carving]], [[Shadow play|shadow puppets]],  pointed brush technique in [[Chinese calligraphy]], and ornamental art in classical [[Chinese architecture]]. As a gateway for artists, dancers, staff, interns, students, teachers, volunteers, and audience, AAAC has passed on the traditional and contemporary dynamics of its community’s heritage.

The Public Education program began with [[figure drawing]] classes, evolving to offer gallery talks, performances, [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]] workshops, and the on-site Saturday Community Art School for children. The off-site education programs took place in public and private schools, and in other community sites in the five boroughs in New York. “Stories of Chinatown”, an off-site program organized in partnership with M.S. 131 that ran from 2001 to 2007, brought local seniors and youth together to make ceramic mural portraits portraying the seniors’ lives.

A frequent recipient and benefactor of government grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) since the 1970s, the Arts Centre experienced a loss in funding when Congress reduced the NEA’s annual budget from $180 million to $99.5 million in 1996 as a result of pressure from conservative American interest groups and Congress members including the [[American Family Association|American Family Foundation]], [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]], and former U.S. Senator [[Jesse Helms#National Endowment for the Arts|Jesse Helms]] amid controversy around government funding toward sexually explicit art by artists such as [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and [[Andres Serrano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/895438/the-national-endowment-of-the-arts-nea-has-been-under-fire-from-republicans-for-36-years/|title=People have been trying to get rid of the National Endowment for the Arts for 36 years|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also impacted the availability of state- and city-level grant funding from the [[New York State Council on the Arts]] (NYSCA) and [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs]] (DCLA), both of which receive funding from the NEA. As a local cultural non-profit that derived a large portion of its budget from public funding, AAAC was forced to scale back its programming from the mid-1990s to the late-2000s.

=== Norfolk location (2010–present) ===
In 2010, AAAC officially moved its location from 26 Bowery Street to 111 Norfolk Street. No longer possessing a gallery space, the Arts Centre continues to remain active in the Lower Manhattan community by organizing off-site exhibitions and panel discussions, and by pursuing public arts education through its blog, social media sites, and contributions to publications such as ''Asian American Matters: A New York Anthology'' by Russell Leong. Concurrently, AAAC has redistributed much of its organizational activity towards archival documentation, historical record-keeping, and organizing its extensive permanent collection. As part of its off-site programming, the Arts Centre has frequently collaborated with the [[New Museum|New Museum’s]] biennial Ideas City Festival—in 2013, it hosted a panel discussion at the Festival titled ''Space Time: Presence'' that addressed concepts of quantum [[Spacetime|space-time]] in both an aesthetic and scientific context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newmuseum.tumblr.com/post/48716889539/robert-lee-from-the-asian-american-arts-centre|title=Interview with Robert Lee from the Asian American Arts Centre|last=|first=|date=|work=New Museum|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with Think!Chinatown in 2018, AAAC produced a video introduction to fifty artists in its archive, made public in its ''Art Across Archives'' program.

Along with 20 other New York City-based organizations including the [[Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute]], [[En Foco]], and [[Picture the Homeless]], AAAC has both endorsed and received an endorsement from the People’s Cultural Plan (PCP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peoplesculturalplan.org/|title=the Peoples Cultural Plan|website=the Peoples Cultural Plan|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; an equity initiative launched in 2017 to redistribute city government funding and support to artists, art workers, tenants, community art organizations, and various historic neighborhoods in New York City. The PCP’s policy plan for the city is made up of three platforms: equitable housing, land, and development policies; labor equity; and public funding equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/392512/how-nycs-new-cultural-plan-and-the-peoples-plan-can-work-together/|title=How NYC’s New Cultural Plan and the "People’s Plan" Can Work in Tandem|date=2017-07-26|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archive==

The Arts Centre includes a digital and physical archive. The archive documents Asian American art over the last 60-plus years, and in many cases, the relationship between the artist and AAAC. The physical archive, which is stored at 111 Norfolk Street, consists of approximately 1700 entries of artists’ materials, including biographical materials, publications, statements, project plans, reviews, exhibition materials (press releases, fliers, etc.), catalogs, taped interviews, and samples of works via slides, photographs and/or digital files. The digital archive, which accounts for 10% of the physical archive and contains over 170 entries, is called ''artasiamerica'' and is accessible online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artasiamerica.org/|title=HOME - artasiamerica - A Digital Archive for Asian / Asian American Contemporary Art History|website=www.artasiamerica.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rozeta Paryż notre-dame chalger.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Rayonnant]] [[rose window]] in [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. In [[Gothic architecture]], [[light]] was considered the most beautiful revelation of [[God]], which was heralded in its design.]]

'''Beauty'''  is a property or characteristic of an [[animal]], [[idea]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], person or [[Location (geography)|place]] that provides a [[perception|perceptual]] experience of [[pleasure]] or [[Contentment|satisfaction]]. Beauty is studied as part of [[aesthetics]], [[culture]], [[social psychology]], [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]]. An "ideal beauty" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.

[[Unattractiveness|Ugliness]] is considered to be the opposite of beauty.

The experience of "beauty" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and [[harmony]] with [[nature]], which may lead to feelings of [[sexual attraction|attraction]] and [[emotional well-being]]. Because this can be a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] experience, it is often said that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."&lt;ref name="phrase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html|title=Beauty is in the eye of the beholder|accessdate=December 4, 2007|publisher=The Phrase Finder|year=2007|author=Gary Martin| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071130023507/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html| archivedate= November 30, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the empirical observations of things that are considered beautiful often aligning with the aforementioned nature and [[health]] thereof, beauty has been stated to have levels of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] as well.

There is also evidence that perceptions of beauty are determined by [[natural selection]]; that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html|title=A Darwinian theory of beauty|author=|date=|website=ted.com|accessdate=May 1, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211012601/http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html|archivedate=February 11, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek==
The classical Greek noun that best translates to the English-language words "beauty" or "beautiful" was [[wikt:κάλλος|κάλλος]], ''kallos'', and the adjective was καλός, ''kalos''. However, ''kalos'' may and is also translated as ″good″ or ″of fine quality″ and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty. Similarly, ''kallos'' was used differently from the English word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bears an erotic connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Konstan|first1=David|title=Beauty - The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-992726-5|pages=30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Koine Greek]] word for beautiful was ὡραῖος, ''hōraios'',&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 23:27, Acts 3:10, Flavius Josephus, 12.65&lt;/ref&gt; an adjective etymologically coming from the word ὥρα, ''hōra'', meaning "hour". In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with "being of one's hour".&lt;ref name="Euripides, Alcestis 515"&gt;Euripides, ''Alcestis'' 515.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, ''hōraios'' had many meanings, including "youthful" and "ripe old age".&lt;ref name="Euripides, Alcestis 515"/&gt;

The [[Beauty (ancient thought)|earliest Western theory of beauty]] can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the [[pre-Socratic]] period, such as [[Pythagoras]]. The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between [[mathematics]] and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the [[golden ratio]] seemed more attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Seife, Charles (2000). ''[[Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea]]''. Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-029647-6}}. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek architecture]] is based on this view of symmetry and [[ratio|proportion]].

Plato considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful (''to kalon'') and virtue, arguing that "Virtue aims at the beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical philosophy]] and sculptures of men and women produced according to the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in [[Renaissance]] Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a "classical ideal". In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose [[human physical appearance|appearance]] conforms to these tenets is still called a "classical beauty" or said to possess a "classical beauty", whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, [[Renaissance]] and [[Humanism|Humanist]] thinkers rejected this view, and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions. Renaissance artists and architects (such as [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his "Lives of Artists") criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view of [[Gothic art]] lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.

==Middle Ages==
In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Catholic philosopher|Catholic philosophers]] like [[Thomas Aquinas]] included beauty among the [[Transcendentals|transcendental]] attributes of [[being]].  In his [[Summa Theologica]], Aquinas described the three conditions of beauty as: integritas (Wholeness), consonantia (harmony), claritas (radiance of form)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1039.htm#article8 Summa Theologica, Part 1, Question 39, Article 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Gothic Architecture of the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages|Late]] [[Middle Ages]], light was considered the most beautiful revelation of [[God]], which was heralded in design.  Examples are the [[Stained glass#Medieval_glass_in_Europe|stained glass]] of Gothic [[Cathedral|Cathedrals]] including [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Chartes Cathedral]].

==The Age of Reason==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'', by [[Sandro Botticelli]]. The goddess Venus is the classical personification of beauty.]]

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] argued that beauty is "unity in variety and variety in unity".&lt;ref&gt;An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue; In Two Treatises&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of beauty, with [[John Keats]] arguing in "Ode on a Grecian Urn" that

:  Beauty is truth, truth beauty, —that is all.
:  Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

==The Romantic period==
In the Romantic period, [[Edmund Burke]] postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==The 20th century and after==
The 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in [[postmodernism]]'s anti-aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture by Hal Foster&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;The Will to Power&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher [[Guy Sircello]] proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept.&lt;ref&gt;A New Theory of Beauty. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Love and Beauty.

Beauty is also studied by psychologists and neuroscientists in the field of [[experimental aesthetics]] and [[neuroesthetics]] respectively.

==Human beauty==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}

The characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of ''inner beauty'', which includes psychological factors such as [[Personality type|personality]], [[intelligence]], [[wiktionary:grace|grace]], [[politeness]], [[charisma]], [[integrity]], [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] and [[elegance]], and ''outer beauty'' (i.e. [[physical attractiveness]]) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.

Standards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.

A strong indicator of physical beauty is "[[averageness]]".&lt;ref name="Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990"&gt;Langlois, J.H., Roggman, L. (1990). "Attractive faces are only average." ''Psychol. Sci.''

This was first noticed in 1883, when [[Francis Galton]] overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images.&lt;ref name="Galton, 1878"&gt;Galton, F. (1878).

A feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a [[waist–hip ratio]] of approximately 0.70. Physiologists have shown that women with [[Female body shape|hourglass figures]] are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3682657.stm|title=Hourglass figure fertility link|last=|first=|date=4 May 2004|work=BBC News|access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4953-barbie-shaped-women-more-fertile/|title=Barbie-shaped women more fertile|last=Bhattacharya|first=Shaoni|date=5 May 2004|website=New Scientist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other commentators have suggested that this preference may not be universal.

Beauty standards are rooted in cultural norms crafted by societies and media over centuries. Globally, it is argued that the predominance of white women featured in movies and advertising leads to a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] concept of beauty, breeding cultures that assign inferiority to women of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harper|first=Kathryn|last2=Choma|first2=Becky L.|date=2018-10-05|title=Internalised White Ideal, Skin Tone Surveillance, and Hair Surveillance Predict Skin and Hair Dissatisfaction and Skin Bleaching among African American and Indian Women|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-018-0966-9|journal=Sex Roles|doi=10.1007/s11199-018-0966-9|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, societies and cultures across the globe struggle to diminish the longstanding [[internalized racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weedon|first=Chris|date=December 6, 2007|title=Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective|url=|journal=Gender Forum Electronic Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[black is beautiful]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;cultural movement sought to dispel this notion in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DoCarmo|first=|date=December 20, 2007|title=Dr. DoCarmo's Notes on the Black Cultural Movement|url=|journal=|publisher=Bucks County Community College|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of beauty in men is known as '[[bishōnen]]' in Japan. Bishōnen refers to males with distinctly [[Femininity|feminine]] features, physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in Japan and typically exhibited in their [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Japanese idol|idols]]. A multibillion-dollar industry of [[Japanese Aesthetic Salons]] exists for this reason. However, different nations have varying male beauty ideals; Eurocentric standards for men include tallness, leanness, and muscularity; thus, these features are idolized through American media, such as in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films and magazine covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.doctornerdlove.com/new-impossible-standards-male-beauty/|title=The New (And Impossible) Standards of Male Beauty|last=|first=|date=2015-01-26|work=Paging Dr. NerdLove|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eurocentrism and beauty ===
The prevailing eurocentric concept of beauty has varying effects on different cultures. Primarily, adherence to this standard among African American women has bred a lack of positive reification of African beauty, and philosopher [[Cornel West]] elaborates that, "much of black self-hatred and self-contempt has to do with the refusal of many black Americans to love their own black bodies-especially their black noses, hips, lips, and hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Matters|last=West|first=Cornel|publisher=Vintage|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These insecurities can be traced back to global idealization of women with light skin, green or blue eyes, and long straight or wavy hair in magazines and media that starkly contrast with the natural features of African women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/socabs/docview/233235409/334D89ECD5AB4AF8PQ/1?accountid=11243|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, internalized [[colorism]] is rooted in Indian culture, in which prevailing value placed on fairer skin tones fuels the [[skin whitening]] industry; products like [[Fair &amp; Lovely (cosmetics)|Fair &amp; Lovely]] thrive in India, with endorsement from [[Bollywood]] celebrities, as well as a general idealization of fair women throughout the film, media, and advertising industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shevde|first=Natasha|date=|title=All's Fair in Love and Cream: A Cultural Case Study of Fair &amp; Lovely in India|url=http://www.michelepolak.com/200fall11/Weekly_Schedule_files/Sheyde.pdf|journal=Advertising &amp; Society Review|volume=9|pages=1-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, such Eurocentric beauty standards are maintained through Indian culture, and encourage women to artificially change their appearances to adhere to beauty norms and ideals. Further, a societal divide exists between the northern and southern regions of India, as fairer complexioned North Indians are culturally associated with beauty, intelligence, and wealth, based merely on adherence to Eurocentric beauty ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&amp;t=continent:Asia!Asia/country:India!India&amp;sort=YMD_date:D&amp;maxresults=20&amp;f=advanced&amp;val-base-0=colorism&amp;fld-base-0=alltext&amp;docref=news/165B3F3483519048|title=50 Shades of Colorism in India|last=Youth|first=Awaaz|date=|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East Asian cultures, familial pressures and cultural norms shape beauty ideals; professor and scholar Stephanie Wong's experimental study concluded that expecting that men in Asian culture didn't like women who look “fragile” impacted the lifestyle, eating, and appearance choices made by Asian American women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Stephanie N.|last2=Keum|first2=Brian TaeHyuk|last3=Caffarel|first3=Daniel|last4=Srinivasan|first4=Ranjana|last5=Morshedian|first5=Negar|last6=Capodilupo|first6=Christina M.|last7=Brewster|first7=Melanie E.|date=December 2017|title=Exploring the conceptualization of body image for Asian American women.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/aap0000077|journal=Asian American Journal of Psychology|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=296–307|doi=10.1037/aap0000077|issn=1948-1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/papers/homoegenization-of-asian-beauty/|title=The Homogenization of Asian Beauty - The Society Pages|last=Le|first=C.N|date=June 4, 2014|website=thesocietypages.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the male gaze, media portrayals of Asian women as petite and the portrayal of beautiful women in American media as fair complexioned and slim-figured induce anxiety and depressive symptoms among Asian American women who don't fit either of these beauty ideals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further, the high status associated with fairer skin can be attributed to Asian societal history; upper-class people hired workers to perform outdoor, manual labor, cultivating a visual divide overtime between lighter complexioned, wealthier families and sun tanned, darker laborers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This along with the Eurocentric beauty ideals embedded in Asian culture has made skin lightening creams, [[rhinoplasty]], and [[blepharoplasty]] (an eyelid surgery meant to give Asians a more European, "double-eyelid" appearance) commonplace among Asian women, illuminating the insecurity that results from cultural beauty standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Beauty presents a standard of [[social comparison theory|comparison]], and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved. People who do not fit the "beauty ideal" may be ostracized within their communities. The television sitcom ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to society's unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive. However, a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty. In ''[[Malèna]]'', a strikingly beautiful Italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may "woo" their husbands. The documentary ''[[Beauty in the Eyes of the Beheld]]'' explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful.

How much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty.

The '''Blythe Intaglios''' or '''Blythe Geoglyphs''' are a group of gigantic figures incised on the ground near [[Blythe, California]] in the [[Colorado Desert]]. The ground drawings or geoglyphs were created by humans for an, as of yet, unknown reason. The [[intaglio (burial mound)|intaglios]] are located east of the [[Big Maria Mountains]], about {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of downtown Blythe, just west of [[U.S. Highway 95]] near the [[Colorado River]].  The Blythe Intaglios are the most well-known of the over 200 intaglios in the [[Colorado Desert]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leska|first=Amy|date=2008|title=A brief introduction to the intaglios of the Mojave Desert|url=|journal=Trough to trough|volume=|pages=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colorado Desert contains the only known desert intaglios in North America.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; These intaglios are mostly located along the Colorado River. The Blythe Intaglios contain three human figures, two four-legged animals, and a spiral; although Harner (1953) reported two spirals.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harner|first=Michael|date=1953|title=21. Gravel Pictographs of the Lower Colorado River Region|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest human figure in the Blythe Intaglio group  is {{convert|171|ft|m}} long. The intaglios are best viewed from the air.

[[Geoglyphs]] are found throughout the world, the construction methods range from earthen mounds, piles of stone, or the removal of surface plants or soil. The most famous desert intaglios are the [[Nazca Lines]] in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maillard|first=Frederico|date=2009|title=Geoglyphs on the Har Karkom Plateau (Negev, Israel)|url=|journal=Papers, XXIII Valcamonica Symposium 2009|volume=|pages=208–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blythe Geoglyphs or intaglios (anthropomorphic geoglyphs) were created by scraping away layers of darker rocks or pebbles to reveal a stratum of lighter-valued soil. The displaced rocks outlined the figures and the exposed soil was stamped down which makes it more difficult for plants to grow in the lines. The intaglios are located on flat terraces in the Colorado River floodplain.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"/&gt; While these "gravel [[pictograph]]s" are found through the deserts of southeastern California, human figures are found only near the Colorado River. Other intaglios depict mountain lions, birds, snakes, and unidentified zoomorphic and geometric shapes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The figures are so immense that many of them were not observed by non-Indians until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Gilreath, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;  The set of Blythe Intaglios and nearby geoglyphs include several dozen figures, thought to be ceremonial in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gilreath, pp. 288-89&lt;/ref&gt; No Colorado River Native American group has claimed to have made the intaglios, although some have claimed to use them.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"/&gt; Many of the intaglios are believed to date from the prehistoric period, but their age and the identity of their creators are still uncertain. If the quadruped figures represent horses (reintroduced in North America by the Spanish) then a historical date would be supported.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"/&gt; Jay von Werlhof and his collaborators  obtained 13 AMS radiocarbon dates for the figures, ranging from 900 BCE to 1200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;von Werlhof et al. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
In 1932, George Palmer, a pilot flying between [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] and [[Blythe, California]] noticed the Blythe geoglyphs.&lt;ref name=jk289&gt;Gilreath, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; His find led to a survey of the area in 1932 by Arthur Woodward, Curator of History and Anthropology at the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref&gt;Welfare and Fairley, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm J. Rogers subsequently studied and sketched the Blythe Intaglios in 1939.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"/&gt; After National Geographic published an article about the Blythe Intaglios in 1952, people began to visit the site which led to some destruction of the intaglios.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The interest in the Blythe intaglios lead to the search for and discovery of more desert intaglios. The Bureau of Land Management erected fences in 1974 to protect the intaglios and the Blythe Intaglios were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Similar intaglios, named the Ripley Group, were found nearby in Arizona across the Colorado River from Ripley, California.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"/&gt;

==Topock Maze==
The [[Topock Maze]] or Mojave Maze, another geoglyph site near [[Needles, California]], covers {{convert|18|acre|m2}} and consists of a series of parallel [[windrow]]s approximately five feet apart.&lt;ref name="jk289"/&gt; However, it is unclear whether the Topock Maze was created by Native Americans.

[[Edward Curtis]] reported in 1908 that, "The Mohave Indians near by have utilized the area ... in recent years, as a maze into which to lure and escape evil spirits, for it is believed that by running in and out through one of these immense labyrinths, one haunted with a dread may bewilder the spirit occasioning it, and thus elude them."&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an unpublished mid-20th century report cited second-hand ethnographic information that, prior to 1900, the "Mohave used to put some of their men in the center of the area of alignment and left them to find their way out of the maze without crossing the gravel alignments. By doing this they would leave the devil behind them."&lt;ref name="Gilreath, p. 289"&gt;Gilreath, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ruth Musser-Lopez reviewed historic and archaeological evidence concerning the "maze" and found strong support for the conjecture that the feature was originally created as a result of late-nineteenth-century gravel harvesting for railroad construction and thus unrelated to the Blythe geoglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Musser-Lopez 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, old foot trails exist in undisturbed ground and stop at, but do not cross the lines of gravel indicating that the gravel is more recent than the trails. The Mojave people have denied knowing the origin of the Topock Maze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Musser-Lopez|first=Ruth|date=2011|title="Mystic Maze" or "Mystic Maize": The Amazing Archaeological Evidence|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Society for California Archaeology|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figures==
Patterns and circles at the site suggest that local groups may have danced there.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Trails lead to the intaglios and rock alignments and rock cairns are often nearby the intaglios.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Ethnographer [[Boma Johnson]] has tried to place the figures in context of [[Yuman]] [[oral history]] and [[cosmology]].&lt;ref name=jk289/&gt; From this understanding, the figures portray mythic characters, and are often found where mythic events are thought to have occurred.&lt;ref name=jk289&gt;Gilreath, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; One of the notable mythic figures is a 20-to-25-meter long humanoid figure located next to a second glyph, this of a quadruped resembling a [[mountain lion]].&lt;ref name=jk289&gt;Gilreath, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall figures bearing a likeness to [[Mastamho]] and [[Kataar]], the "hero twins of the creation myth," can be seen near [[Fort Mojave]] in Arizona.

Some researchers hypothesize that the intaglios are stopping points on a keruk pilgrimage or simply the practice of the keruk ceremony at various places.&lt;ref name="Altschul &amp; Ezzo 1995 133–145"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altschul &amp; Ezzo|first=|date=1995|title=Ceremony and Warfare along the Lower Colorado River during the Protohistoric Period|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Society for California Archaeology|volume=|pages=133–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keruk was a mourning ceremony that was practiced by various Native Americans in southern California. The keruk included the reenactment of the creator's death and the recognition of the people who had died since the last keruk. Warfare has been offered a possible explanation as to the spread along the Colorado River of ceremonies such as the keruk and the similar style of desert intaglios.&lt;ref name="Altschul &amp; Ezzo 1995 133–145"/&gt;

Of the nearly 60 sites containing humanoid figures, almost all of them have a deeply entrenched torso, while the limbs are much more shallowly etched into the surface. Often, the head and/or one or more arms of the figure will not have been represented at all.&lt;ref name=jk289/&gt; The largest human figure is 171 feet (52 m) long, while the smallest is 95 feet (29 m) long.&lt;ref name="Gilreath, p. 289"/&gt;

==Location==
The majority of the Blythe geoglyphs are located {{convert|16|mi|km}} north of [[Blythe, California]], off [[Highway 95]], at the [[Interstate 10]] exit and down several dirt roads for {{convert|15.5|mi|km}}. An historical marker (No. 101) placed by the California Department of Public Works, Division of Highways, commemorates the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Marael |title=Why Stop? A Guide to California Roadside Historical Markers |year=1995 |publisher=Gulf Publishing Company |location=Houston, TX |isbn=9780884159230 |oclc= 32168093 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chain link fences surround several of the figures.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; 
The intaglios were featured prominently in the Hardy Boys novel ''[[Mystery of the Desert Giant]]''', published in 1961.

==Early work: The Spiritual in Art and the Goddess==
Sherman’s early-career paintings, drawings, and prints were of flowers. He closely observed and recorded their transformation from life to death. He characterized this exploration as a gateway to his ''Goddess Series''. 

In the 1980s, Sherman was a significant artistic interpreter of the [[Goddess movement]] that had begun worldwide in the 1970s.  Sherman embraced the feminine energy of the goddess as a powerful force, and created a visual language that was inspired by the work of Los Angeles-based Lithuanian archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]].  Sherman's depictions of goddesses from the [[Neolithic]] period and the traditions of ancient Europe were described by Starr Goode as abstracted, fanciful images which sometimes verged on the grotesque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Starr Goode, “Interview with Charles Sherman”, video, "The Goddess in Art", Group W cable TV, Santa Monica, CA, 1987|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es21DPajqvI|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her interview of Charles Sherman was one of 21 interviews of scholars and artists by Starr Goode for her cable series, ''The Goddess in Art'' (1986-1991). The videos are in the permanent collection of the [[Getty Research Institute]] in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Getty Research Institute|url=http://primo.getty.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=GRI&amp;afterPDS=true&amp;institution=01GRI&amp;docId=GETTY_ROSETTAIE178735|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Sherman exhibited his predominantly black and white acrylic paintings in goddess-themed Los Angeles exhibitions, such as ''The Goddess in Contemporary Art'' exhibition of 1988, curated by Nancy Ann Jones at the [[Social and Public Art Resource Center]] in Venice, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Charles|title=Exhibitions/Collections/Performance, Charles Sherman Infinity Sculpture and Design|url=http://www.charlesshermanart.com/mbr_bio.php|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings have been published in books about the goddess including ''The Once and Future Goddess'' by [[Elinor Gadon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gadon|first1=Elinor|title=The Once and Future Goddess|date=1989|publisher=Harper and Row|isbn=978-0062503541|pages=225|ref=''The Nine Muses'' illustration}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as cover art for several print editions of the poetry journal ''Sheela-Na-Gig'' (now online).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell Haugen|first1=Hayley|title=About, ''Bird Goddess'', (illustration), Infinity Ring section, ''Sheila-Na-Gig online''|url=https://sheilanagigblog.com/about/|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;Sherman also gave gallery talks, and in 1993, a painting workshop, "The Animal Goddesses of Old Europe", at the [[Craft and Folk Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Charles|title=Publications/Lectures,Charles Sherman Infinity Sculpture and Design|url=http://www.charlesshermanart.com/publications-lectures.html|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, [[Jungian archetypes]] of the feminine are still present in Sherman's oeuvre, but in forms emphasizing beauty, reduced to the [[Minimalism]] art form of the Möbius.

==Art and activism==
Sherman has also used [[performance art]] as a vehicle to express strongly held viewpoints and make political statements. During his 1989 tenure as president of the Los Angeles Artists' Equity Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hannigan|first1=Teri|title=Charles Sherman|url=http://terihannigan.com/charles-sherman/|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman assisted artist [[Tom Van Sant]] with his ''[[Goddess of Democracy]]'' project in downtown Los Angeles. The 1000-pound statue was built by Van Sant and members of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Artists' Equity Association in support of the pro-democracy uprising by students in Beijing during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. Beijing artists had built a monumental ''Goddess of Democracy'' statue that had been destroyed by Chinese troops who stopped the rebellion with what became a bloody massacre. The Los Angeles ''Goddess of Democracy'' suffered a similar fate; vandals toppled the statue at its Chinatown location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Citron|first1=Alan|title='Goddess' Statue Damaged by Vandals to be Repaired"|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-06/local/me-349_1_van-sant|website=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Los Angeles times|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Sherman collaborated with feminist artist [[Cheri Gaulke]] in front of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] for ''Who’s Burning America?'' As a criticism of the U.S. government subsidy of tobacco, Sherman designed a large-scale billboard showing the American flag with a cigarette burning a hole through it.  He displayed the billboard on the side of a truck parked in front of the museum, while Gaulke, dressed as Senator [[Jesse Helms]], a strong supporter of the tobacco industry, set an American flag on fire with a giant cigarette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Puig|first1=Claudia|title=Morning Report: Art"|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-05/entertainment/ca-2840_1_jesse-helms|website=''The Los Angeles Times''|publisher=Los Angeles times|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bible Series==
In the early 1990s, Sherman began work on a series of bronze sculptures, drawings and prints, to give visual interpretation to the “…complexity and deep humanity of biblical characters.” His study of the Old Testament Bible resulted in a personal, mystical visualization of a rich biblical past and our developing mythology. He expressed his interpretation of the Bible not only through art, but also by lectures at art galleries and Jewish temples. His ''Kabbalah Mandala'' motif first appeared in 1993 as an illustration in the book ''God, Sex and Kabbalah'' by Rabbi Allen S. Maller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maller|first1=Rabbi Allen|title=God Sex and Kabbalah|date=1983|publisher=Maller|isbn=0-86628-019-7| pages=192|ref=''Kabbalah Mandala'' illustration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Two Faces of Eve by Charles Sherman.jpg|thumb|The Two Faces of Eve (1996), bronze, The Bible Series]]

In the introduction to his catalogue, “The Bible Series” (1998), Sherman wrote that he intended this body of work to deal with “…issues of gender, spirit, and the Divine.” His bronze sculpture ''The Two Faces of Eve'' (1996) depicts a nude [[Eve]] embraced by and gazing into the eyes of a female-faced serpent, a mirror image of herself.  The subjects of his bronze sculptures from this period range from the depiction of traditional Bible stories, such as his wall sculpture ''Jacob and Esau Wrestling in the Womb'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Birth and Youth of Esau and Jacob"(illustration), ''Women in the Bible: Rebecca - Her Story''|url=http://www.womeninthebible.net/women-bible-women/rebecca/|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to the contemporary subject of ''The Warrior'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corson|first1=Suzanne|title=The Warrior Statute by Charles Sherman"|url=http://komencsnj.org/6583-2/|website=Susan G. Komen|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an homage to [[Deena Metzger]], writer, teacher, counselor, and breast cancer survivor. 
The end of the century would find Sherman creating ''Golda'' (1999), a monumental bronze portrait head of Israeli teacher and fourth Prime Minister of Israel, [[Golda Meir]].  The sculpture would be installed in the new millennium at the Golda Meir Center for Political Leadership at the [[Metropolitan State University of Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolitan State University of Denver"Our Past, Our History" 09/1988, “Meir home relocates to Auraria Campus and becomes MSU Denver’s Golda Meir Center” (see ''Golda'' in expanded story)|url=https://www.msudenver.edu/our-past/ourhistory/#1980s/|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman was invited to give a lecture at the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golda Meir Center for Political Leadership ''Speakers''|url=https://www.msudenver.edu/golda/events/speakers/|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Infinity Ring: Sculpture and Jewelry Design==
Along with his figurative work, Sherman had been concurrently creating abstract and organic sculpture, and in 2002 began investigating circular forms he called ''Infinity Rings'', based on a three-dimensional form of the Möbius strip. This new body of work was a technical challenge; he first had to find a way to build monumental sculptures from clay that would withstand the tendency to collapse during high temperature [[kiln]] firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Charles|title=The Infinity Ring: Inspiration and Process", Charles Sherman Infinity Sculpture and Design|url=http://www.charlesshermanart.com/mbr_statement.php|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has continued to explore the infinity ring form in diverse materials, and also combined rings to create multiple ring sculptures.

Sherman began to incise words into his clay infinity ring sculptures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sculptor Charles Sherman Works in Van Nuys|url=http://museumsanfernandovalley.blogspot.com/2013/01/sculptor-chares-sherman-works-in-van.html|website=The Museum of San Fernando Valley|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosophical manifestos such as, ''God is a Verb'', ''Art is a Verb'', and ''Love is a Verb'', or verse fragments from the Bible, such as “I am to my Beloved as my Beloved is Mine” in either English or Hebrew. Sherman’s ceramic infinity ring sculpture, ''God is a Verb'' was in the 2007 ''Dead Sea Scrolls'' exhibition at the [[San Diego Natural History Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''San Diego Magazine'' "Museums"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA223&amp;lpg=RA1-PA223&amp;dq=Charles+Sherman+dead+sea+scrolls+exhibition+2007&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-hFYD3pyUM&amp;sig=3dR8ZF54TAj8xXwMmgmKWWTg4ZY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLnIKi_57OAhUX4mMKHWWsAQAQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Charles%20Sherman%20dead%20sea%20scrolls%20exhibition%202007&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sherman has created infinity rings from various media, including bronze, stainless steel, Lucite, aluminum, and glass mosaic, but prefers the mobility of clay. "If I could make one statement about art, it’s that the essence of art is that ''it's a verb, not a noun.'' It´s a process, and when you fully understand that, you let the art take its own course. Even clay has a life of its own and knows where it wants to go and I try to facilitate that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Featured Artist: Charles Sherman|url=http://www.collectors.com.sg/?menu=artists&amp;view=34&amp;artist=Charles-Sherman|website=Collectors Contemporary|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Sherman has written that it is his intention to express universal spiritual values with his sculpture. This emphasis on spirituality is especially a feature of Sherman’s later work in symbolic jewelry design. Sherman’s jewelry designs are sculptures in miniature of his larger works. He has said that these designs are based upon “[[sacred geometry]].”&lt;ref name="OneToWatch"/&gt;  Some are symbols from world religions, such as [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Hinduism]].  Sherman has received numerous awards for his sculpture, including First Place at the 1989 Los Angeles All City Art Open, juried by [[Henry Hopkins (curator)|Henry Hopkins]] and Merry Norris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Charles|title=Awards/Art Affiliations, Charles Sherman Infinity Sculpture and Design|url=http://www.charlesshermanart.com/awards-affiliations.html|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded First Place in Inspirational Design in an international design competition, the 2012 JCK Jeweler’s Choice Awards for his Trinity Cross pendant,&lt;ref name="OneToWatch"/&gt; and in 2014, the [[Jewelers of America]] association selected Sherman as one of ten new jewelry designers to debut their collections at the professional organization’s ''JA New York Summer Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Designers Who'll Debut at JA New York Summer", ''National Jeweler''|url=http://www.nationaljeweler.com/independents/trade-shows/2671-10-designers-who-ll-debut-at-ja-new-york-summer|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The bylaws of the Writers Association indicate that it is a “mass group voluntarily formed from China's authors,” but, during this period, it was not purely an organization of such a nature.

The Chinese Writers' Association publishes several magazines, including 《人民文学》 ''Renmin wenxue'' (People's Literature) (monthly), 《中国作家》 ''Zhongguo zuojia'' (Chinese Writer) (bimonthly), 《诗刊》 ''Shi kan'' (Poetry) (monthly), 《民族文学》 ''Minzu wenxue'' (Folk Literature) (monthly), 《小说选刊》 ''Xiaoshuo xuankan'' (Selected Novels) (monthly), and ''Newspaper of Art'' (weekly).

'''Christopher Fratin''' (1 January 1801 – 16 August 1864), also known as '''Christophe Fratin''', was a noted French sculptor in the [[animalier]] style, and one of the earliest French sculptors to portray animals in bronze.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kjellberg|first1=Pierre|title=Bronzes of the 19th Century|date=1994|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-88740-629-7|pages=495}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 June 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Fratin was born in [[Metz]], [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], [[France]] the son of a [[taxidermist]]. He first studied drawing under Pioche in Metz and later worked in [[Paris]] at the studio of [[Théodore Géricault]].&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Eagle and Prey by Christophe Fratin, Central Park, New York City.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Eagles and Prey by Fratin, Central Park, New York City]]
He exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] from 1831–1842 and 1850–1862, as well as at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London in 1851. Fratin never signed his bronzes but instead used a stamp showing his last name in straight block letters. One of the stamps he used (''pictured'') showed the "n" reversed, not by design but due to an error on the part of the maker of the stamp. Bronzes bearing this stamp have the appearance of not seeming to be genuine when in reality they are.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

Fratin received monumental commissions in France and elsewhere, including the ''Deux Aigles Gardant Leur Proie'' (''Eagles and Prey'', created 1850) displayed since 1863 in New York City's [[Central Park]]. Many of his small bronzes—including his miniature bronzes which were more affordable due to their smaller size—were sold commercially to the general public during his lifetime. Today, Fratin's sculpture is on permanent display in the [[Louvre]], the city museums of [[Metz]], [[Lyon]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Nîmes]] and at the [[Peabody Institute]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. The [[Georg Eisler]] archive in [[Vienna]] also has on display works by Fratin.

A number of Fratin's pieces portray horses, especially portraits of famous horses such as ''Fermer, cheval anglais pur-sang'', a wax of which he debuted at the Salon of 1831, the same exhibition in which [[Antoine-Louis Barye|Barye]]'s ''Tigre dévorant un gavial'' was featured.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

At [[Montrouge]] Square in Paris appears a colossal bronze group standing 2 meters high entitled ''Cheval attaqué par un lion'', executed in 1852. Fratin received many commissions from the State including groups designed for the botanical garden and the [[esplanade]] of his hometown; amongst the groups were two dogs, a deer at bay, a purebred horse, and some eagles. He also produced a number of whimsical bear sculptures, one being ''Ours jouant de la cornemuse'' which shows a bear holding a musical instrument.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Fratin died on 17 August 1864 at [[Le Raincy]] ([[Seine-Saint-Denis]])&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; and is buried in [[Montmartre Cemetery]]. He is honored in Metz where a street is named after him.

'''Durdy Bayramov''' ([[Russian Language|Russian]]: Дурды Байрамов; April 14, 1938 - February 14, 2014) was an [[academician]] and artist who was awarded the highest honorary title in his country: “[[People’s Artist]] of [[Turkmen SSR]]”. In his native [[Turkmen language]], Durdy Bayramov’s name is simply “Durdy Bayram” (without the Slavic-style “ov” suffix added to [[Russify]] names during the Soviet era). The name "Bayram" means “celebration” in [[Turkic languages]].

== Early life and education ==
Bayramov was born in [[Baýramaly]] in the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]], then part of the [[Soviet Union]], on April 14, 1938. He lost both parents at a young age and lived as a homeless child before being placed in an orphanage in [[Serdar (city)|Serdar]] (then known as Kyzyl-Arvat), where he was raised. Growing up, Bayramov endured starvation and the many hardships that accompanied [[World War II]] and the post-war devastation. Later, he benefited from the guidance of exceptional teachers who recognized his talent and supported the young artist in his efforts to become a professional painter. His first art teacher was Gennadiy Brusentsov, a Russian artist who taught at the Shota Rustaveli Turkmen Art College in [[Ashgabat]]. Bayramov and Brusentsov developed a lifelong friendship, with Brusentsov acting as Bayramov’s mentor over the years. Brusentsov’s portrait of a young Bayramov, titled ''Young Soccer Player'', is in the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Katalog Sobraniya: Seriya Zhivopis XVIII-XX Vekov.

Turkmenistan: International Magazine, Vol. N. 3 (84), pp. 80-89. Retrieved from http://www.turkmenistaninfo.ru/_data/pdf/2012_03_N3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Another great influence on Durdy Bayramov’s life and artistic career was art instructor {{Interlanguage link multi|Dmitry Mochalsky|ru|3=Мочальский Дмитрий Константинович}}, his professor at the prestigious {{Interlanguage link multi|Surikov Art Institute|ru|3=Московский государственный академический художественный институт имени В. И. Сурикова}} in Moscow, which Bayramov attended between 1959 and 1965. Mochalsky was a recipient of the highest honorary title in arts in the former Soviet Union—People’s Artist of the USSR—and was widely respected for his “ability to highlight the essential, while setting aside the extraneous details.” &lt;ref&gt;The State Tretyakov Gallery. 2009. “Dmitrii Mochalskii – Romantik Sozializma: 23 Aprelya-7 Iyunya, 2009.” (Дмитрий Мочальский – Романтик Социализма: 23 Апреля-7 Июня, 2009)[Dmitri Mochalski – Romantic of Socialist Realism: April 23-June 7, 2009]. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/ru/calendar/exhibitions/exhibitions1662/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J6KEVbj6?url=http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/ru/calendar/exhibitions/exhibitions1662/ |archivedate=2013-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He passed that approach on to many of his students, including Durdy Bayramov.

== Career ==

=== 1960s ===
Upon completion of his formal education in 1965, Bayramov joined the [[USSR Union of Artists]] and began his career as a professional artist. The [[landscape]] genre was the first to captivate Durdy Bayramov. Many of his early landscape works (some dating to his student years) earned high praise from critics. His celebrated painting Peaceful Land (1969) is considered a classic example of Turkmen landscape painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalogue of Paintings and Drawings for Golden Jubilee Exhibition of the People’s Artist of Turkmenistan Durdy Bayramov|year=2008|publisher=Dubai: Keyik Bayramova|author=Mukhatova, Ogulabat and Kurban Agaliyev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Bayramov married his beloved muse, Dunyagozel “Gozel” Ilyasova, who would be one of his most frequently painted subjects and remain an inspiration for his work throughout his life. Bayramov devoted to her an entire series of works on paper titled Gozel, which includes 53 portraits of Gozel and four flower drawings dedicated to her.

From 1965–1968, Bayramov served as an art instructor at the Shota Rustaveli Turkmen State College of Arts in Ashgabat.

=== 1970s ===
Bayramov’s first major artistic honours arrived when he was named winner of the Turkmen SSR Lenin [[Komsomol]] prize in 1970 and of the USSR in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Pimenova, S. 1974, November 27. “Dve Schastlivye Sudby.” (Две Счастливые Судьбы) [Two Fortunate Fates]. Znamya Oktyabrya, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he completed what is considered the first Turkmen self-portrait, a work formerly held in the collections of the USSR Union of Artists in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Yerlashova, S. 1975. Painting of Soviet Turkmenia. Leningrad (St. Petersburg): Aurora Art Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Bayramov pioneered the Second World War as a theme among Turkmen painters. His painting ''Frontline Assistance'' captured the deep patriotism of ordinary Turkmen women willing to sacrifice their most prized possessions to help soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Prelatov, Y. 1981, December 1. “Vistavki—Lyblyu Svoi Krai.” (Выставки—Люблю  Свой Край) [Exhibitions—Love My Homeland]. Pravda.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theme developed by Bayramov during this period was the process of making [[Turkmen rug|Turkmen carpets]]. This theme is seen in his famous work titled ''Turkmen Carpet Makers'' (1971), which depicts women at work in a carpet factory. This masterpiece of Soviet-era Turkmen art was first exhibited at the State Museum of Oriental Art in Moscow in 1971 and was later acquired by the State Tretyakov Gallery in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Kistovich, Irena. 2010. “Turkmenskaya ‘Semerka.’ Razmyshleniya ob Uhodyashem.” (Туркменская «Семерка». Размышления oб Уходящем) [The Turkmen ‘Seven’: Reflections on the Past]. Sibirskie Ogni, Vol. 05/2. Retrieved from http://xn--90aefkbacm4aisie.xn--p1ai/content/turkmenskaya-semerka-razmyshleniya-ob-uhodyashchem&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1971 until 1973, eager to assist up-and-coming artists, Bayramov returned to his position as art instructor at the Shota Rustaveli Turkmen State College of Arts in Ashgabat.

In the mid-1970s, Bayramov embarked on what was to become his most celebrated series, ''Cultural Figures''. This series contains portraits of individuals recognized by Bayramov as having made important contributions to Turkmen cultural heritage during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The creation of ''Cultural Figures'' would span more than four decades and result in more than 150 individual portraits.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, Bayramov was named an Honoured Art Worker of the [[Turkmen SSR]], and in 1984 he was awarded second prize and a [[Laureate]] Diploma for the contest commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Turkmen SSR and Communist Party of the TSSR. He remained highly productive throughout the 1980s despite personal hardships associated with [[perestroika]] (ca. 1985–1991), which caused a scarcity of basic household goods and food products for many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Children of Perestroika": Moscow Teenagers Talk About Their Lives and the Future|year=1992|publisher=London: Routledge|author=Adelman, Deborah.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayramov persevered and worked tirelessly, trying to lose himself in his art. He continued to expand his artistic repertoire through an increased focus on portraits and still lifes, especially flowers.

In 1985, Bayramov began work on one of his most celebrated thematic compositions—his monumental tribute to the great Spanish artists of the past titled ''Golden Mist''. This work would not be completed until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Blagodatov, Nikolay and Durdy Bayramov. 2012. Durdy Bayramov. Toronto: Keyik Bayramova, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, Bayramov’s popularity and renown grew as a result of numerous solo exhibitions, including those held in Moscow, Russia (1980, 1984); [[Berlin]], [[German Democratic Republic]] (1981); [[Ulyanovsk]], Russia (1984); Ashgabat, Turkmenistan (two exhibitions in 1986 alone); and [[Budapest]], Hungary (1986).

=== 1990s ===
Following continued critical and popular success at home and abroad, in 1991 Bayramov was awarded the highest artistic title in his home country: [[People’s Artist]] of Turkmenistan.

In 1998, Bayramov was appointed an Academician of the National Academy of Arts of Kyrgyzstan, along with fellow artists Suhrob Kurbanov, [[Tahir Salahov]], Turgunbai Sadykov, and Erbolat Tolepbai. In conjunction with the presentation of this award, Bayramov contributed works to the International Exhibition of the Academicians of [[Kyrgyzstan]] at the Academy of Arts in [[Bishkek]].&lt;ref&gt;Toktosunova, G. I. (Ed.). 2005. “Otchyot Deystvitelnyh Chlenov i Chlen-Korrespondentov Nazionalnoi Akademii Khudozhestv Kyrgyzskoi Respubliki.” (Отчёт Действительных Членов и Член-Корреспондентов Национальной Академии Художеств Кыргызской Республики) [Report of the Full and Corresponding Members of the National Academy of Arts of the Kyrgyz Republic]. Bishkek: National Academy of Arts of the Kyrgyz Republic.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
Throughout the 2000s, Bayramov continued to travel and work extensively both within Turkmenistan and around the world. This included trips to [[Ukraine]], where he held a solo exhibition in the Kiev National Museum of Russian Art in 2000, Russia (2003), [[Thailand]] (2004), [[Turkey]] (2002 and 2004), [[Maldives]] (2004), the [[United Arab Emirates]] (multiple trips between 2003 and 2007), [[Netherlands]] (2008), Italy (2009), Belgium (2010), and France (2010). In 2008, Bayramov celebrated his 70th birthday and his 50-year milestone as an artist with two retrospective exhibitions of his work in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.

Based on his lifetime artistic achievements and contributions to the culture of Turkmenistan, in 2008 Bayramov was awarded the “For the Love of the Motherland” medal, presented to him by the [[President of Turkmenistan]].

=== 2010s ===

Bayramov continued his prolific artistic output into the 2010s, creating more than ninety oil paintings between 2010 and 2014.

In 2012, Bayramov spent six months in Canada where he created a well-known series of landscape paintings titled ''Canadian Autumn''. In 2014, Bayramov’s paintings were displayed in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, marking the first exhibition of his work in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Samuel. 2014, June 25.

In 2015, a solo exhibition of Durdy Bayramov’s works was held at the World Bank Art Program in Washington, DC, with the support of the Embassy of Turkmenistan in the US. The opening of this exhibition coincided with celebrations of the 24th anniversary of Independence and the 20th anniversary of the Neutrality of Turkmenistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.tm/en/neutral-en/3758-the-festive-reception-in-washington-on-the-occasion-of-independence-day-and-the-20th-anniversary-of-turkmenistan-s-neutrality |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230844/http://www.mfa.gov.tm/en/neutral-en/3758-the-festive-reception-in-washington-on-the-occasion-of-independence-day-and-the-20th-anniversary-of-turkmenistan-s-neutrality |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }} (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic style ==
Durdy Bayramov created more than 5,000 artworks during his prolific career, including [[oil paintings]] and works on paper. He was also a passionate photographer, though he considered this activity a part of his artistic process and never attempted to exhibit his photographs. For this reason his considerable photographic work would not be exhibited until after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Bayramova Keyik, Robert Pontsioen, and Jeren Balayeva. 2015.

Toronto, ON: Durdy Bayramov Art Foundation; and Washington, DC: Asian Cultural History Program, Smithsonian Institution. {{ISBN|978-0-9939443-1-4}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayramov worked extensively across four genres: [[portraits]], [[still lifes]], [[Landscape painting|landscapes]], and [[genre painting|thematic compositions]], though he has long been best known for his portraits. As early as 1975, it was noted that “although he paints genre pictures and landscapes, one could say that portraiture claims his special attention.” &lt;ref&gt;Yerlashova, S. 1975. ''Painting of Soviet Turkmenia.'' Leningrad (St. Petersburg): Aurora Art Publishers, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his contemporaries, he was considered to be the “unsurpassed master of the portrait genre.”&lt;ref&gt;Glazunova, T. 2007, December. “Kumiry i Poklonniki.” (Кумиры и Поклонники) [Idols and Admirers]. Neytralniy Turkmenistan, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bayramov penetrated deep into the character and inner life of his subjects to reflect their diverse personalities on canvas, while emphasizing their best qualities. Bayramov said he did this by “always looking for that special spark that exists within each person.” &lt;ref&gt;Zenko, Walter. 2012. ''Bayramov Paints East to West &amp; West to East.'' [Interview with Durdy Bayramov]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlX5L9ddZPc&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to harmonize the contextual discoveries of [[Impressionism]], the attention to detail of [[Classical Realism]], and Turkmenistan’s rich artistic traditions. Bayramov found inspiration in people from all walks of life, regardless of their social, economic, or ethnic background. His subjects include a wide variety of individuals, from villagers to scientists, strangers to family members, children to seniors. Bayramov’s empathetic nature and close rapport with his subjects helps to explain his success in this genre.

Although Bayramov is best known for his [[portraiture]], his work in the [[still life]] and [[landscape]] genres is also highly respected. Flowers held a special place in Bayramov’s still life works. He was particularly passionate about painting the rich colours and textures of the red poppies that carpet the foothills of Turkmenistan every spring. The depiction of fruit in Bayramov’s still lifes symbolizes the abundance of nature and his love for his native land’s fruit in particular. He often depicted apples, melons, pomegranates, etc. arranged on traditional [[Turkmen rug|Turkmen carpets]], which feature ''göl'' woven motifs and vibrant colours, and on Turkmen ornamental felts called {{Interlanguage link multi|''keche''|ru|3= Кошма}}.

The Durdy Bayramov Art Foundation’s mission statement is: "To celebrate Durdy Bayramov’s life and legacy through inspirational programs which cultivate cultural exchanges and stimulate the vitality of the arts." Having grown up an orphan, Durdy Bayramov was a passionate advocate for young and aspiring artists, often purchasing art supplies for those that could not afford them.  To honour and build on this legacy, the Foundation focuses much of its efforts on programming for children and youth and administers a scholarship program for promising young artists who may otherwise not have the chance to pursue their love of art.&lt;ref&gt;"Durdy Bayramov Art Foundation."

The Durdy Bayramov Art Foundation actively engages the public through exhibitions, events, and educational outreach activities. This includes educational programs, such as a collaboration in 2015 with the Community MicroSkills Development Centre in Toronto in carrying out [[Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada]] (LINC) classes that utilized art to help familiarize recent immigrants to Canada with Canadian culture and the English language. The Foundation has also collaborated with the [[Smithsonian Institution]]’s Asian Cultural History Program, the [[Embassy of Turkmenistan in Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Textile Museum of Canada]] in carrying out lectures on [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] art, the history and [[cultural heritage]] of [[Turkmenistan]], and Durdy Bayramov’s life and significance in the art world.

In 2015 the Foundation held its inaugural exhibition at the Bayramov Museum, titled ''Through the Eyes of Durdy Bayramov: Turkmen Village Life, 1960s-80''s. This was the world’s first exhibition of Bayramov’s [[Monochrome photography|black-and-white photographs]] and was a Featured Exhibition in the CONTACT Photography Festival.&lt;ref&gt;"Through the Eyes of Durdy Bayramov: Turkmen Village Life, 1960s-80s."

==Undated==
The bulk of [[Sanskrit literature|literature in Classical Sanskrit]] dates to the Early Medieval period, but in most cases cannot be dated to a specific century.

The vocalized [[Masoretic Text]] of the Hebrew Bible developed during the 7th to 10th centuries.

The Old English ''[[Beowulf]]'' is dated to anywhere between the 8th and early 11th centuries.

'''''Egyptians Raising Water from the Nile''''' is an 1890–1891 painting by [[John Singer Sargent]]. It is part of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/50.130.16/ |title=Egyptians Raising Water from the Nile &amp;#124; John Singer Sargent &amp;#124; 50.130.16 &amp;#124; Work of Art &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |website=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sargent made several trips to Egypt, Greece and Turkey as part of a project commissioned by the Boston Public Library to explore the origin of Western religion through art. Whilst in Egypt he created this canvas in 1890–91, depicting a group of locals drinking or collecting water from the Nile which had been raised to the bank by a [[shaduf]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14229">The '''Enfer''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ̃|ˈ|f|ɜːr}}; {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃fɛʁ|lang}}, literally, ''Inferno'' or ''Hell'') is a special department of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris. It is a special collection of books and manuscripts of an erotic or pornographic character which, because of their rarity and value, may be seen only with authorization. The Enfer was established 1836-1844 and is one of the most famous [[Private Case]] collections. In 2013, the Enfer contained about 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century to the present.

== Meaning ==
The roots of the Enfer at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] date to the end of the 17th century. The catalogue, which was introduced in the then Bibliothèque du Roi ("Royal Library"), already separated "good" and "bad" books. In 1702, orthodox and heterodox theological treatises, literary and entertaining novels, love and adventure stories were given different [[Library classification]] press marks (or "call numbers"). By the mid-18th century, there were 24 "ouvrages licencieux" ("scandalous works"),&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue des livers imprimés de la Bibliothèque du Roy: Belles-Lettres, 1re–2e partie'', Paris 1750&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Pietro Aretino]]'s [[Whore dialogues|prostitute dialogue]] "Ragionamenti". These scandalous works were kept mostly in a special "cabinet" (a bookcase), and there are likely to have been fewer than 50 before the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 — although legal deposit was introduced  in 1537 by [[Francis I of France|François I]]. However, "ouvrages licencieux" were banned in France generally; so clandestine editions were printed in Holland or Switzerland and distributed and sold in secret. Such books found their way into the Royal Library only after seizures of banned books or, more rarely, as gifts or purchases. Such books were not made available to the reading public, although they appeared in library catalogues.

During the [[French Revolution]], the book collections of fleeing aristocrats and secularized monasteries contributed significantly to the growth of public libraries. However, as a result of strict censorship under [[Napoleon]], many banned books were destroyed. In the [[Bibliothèque nationale]] particularly notable books were first separated from the general library in 1795, and the foundations of the later Réserve (Rare Books collections) was established.  Between 1836 and 1844, the concept (not the press mark) "Enfer" appeared for the first time in the library inventories for morally-dubious writings. The library director, [[Joseph Naudet]], characterized these works as follows: "fort mauvais, mais quelquefois très précieux pour les bibliophiles, et de grande valeur vénale; cet enfer est pour les imprimés ce qu'est le Musée de Naples pour les antiques." ("extremely reprehensible from a book collector’s view but sometimes highly valuable and of great resale value; this hell is for the pamphlets, what the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Napels Museum]] is for ancient art.").&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Françoise Quignard, Raymond-Josué Seckel: ''L’Enfer de la Bibliothèque. Éros au secret.'' Paris 2007. Pg. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact circumstances under which this closed-collection of books was built up during the reign of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] are not known. Howeverm a significant influence was likely to have been the increasing prudery of the bourgeoisie in post-revolutionary France. By establishing a sequestered collection of erotic material, the ordinary reader was screened from works that were considered objectionable and detrimental to the moral health of readers.

== Name ==
The first collection of books called an Enfer is attributed to the [[Les Feuillants Abbey|Feuillants]] convent in Paris, on the [[Rue Saint-Honoré]]. These monks reportedly kept in the attic, ironically described as "hell", a large number of Protestant writings that had been given to the convent in 1652. The name apparently played on the fate that frequently befell the authors and readers of [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|forbidden and heretical works]] (i.e., burning). Collections of theological writings of a similar character, not always carrying this title, were widely used, most famously in the [[Vatican Library]].

At the time of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], at the latest, the word "enfer" was widely used to refer to a clandestine or sequestered collection. [[Pierre Larousse]]’s ''Encyclopedia Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle'' (Paris 1866-1877) defined the word as "endroit fermé d'une bibliothèque, où l'on tient les livres dont on pense que la lecture est dangereuse; exemple: l'Enfer de la Bibliothèque nationale." ("A closed area in a library, containing books whose reading is considered dangerous, for example: The 'hell' of the Bibliothèque nationale.").&lt;ref&gt;''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle''. Administration du grand dictionnaire universel, Paris 1866–1877, Vol. 7, pg. 557 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k205359t/f561.chemindefer]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the Bibliothèque nationale received a huge book collection from Auguste Lesouëf and his sister (whose married name was Smith); 34 of these items were given the press mark ''Enfer Smith-Lesouëf''. The prints and photographs of the Bibliothèque nationale also received a special press mark, if they were seen as morally questionable.

Other libraries separated their Erotica from their general collections, in a similar way to the [[Bibliothèque nationale]]. These libraries often used obscure collection names and press marks, such as The Private Case at the [[British Museum]], the *** (or ''Triple star'') collection at the [[New York Public Library]], the Δ (Greek Delta) collection in the [[Library of Congress]] and the Φ collection (Greek Phi) at the Bodleian Library.&lt;ref&gt;Dass die größte pornografische Sammlung in der Vatikanischen Bibliothek zu finden sei, ist allerdings eine weit verbreitete Legende.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inventory and cataloguing ==

After the establishment of the Enfer, the public were curious about which, and how many, works were contained in the collections. It was assumed to be a very impressive collection, as many books had been seized during the French [[Ancien Régime]], at the peak of literary libertinism, during the life of authors such as the [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirab|Comte de Mirabeau]], the [[Marquis de Sade]] or [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif|Rétif de la Bretonne]]. From 1848 to 1850, the Enfer was subject to a public attack, accused of the negligent loss of a large numbers of books. Two-thirds of original 600 books were rumoured to have been lost, not least because unsupervised young employees had acted as attendants. In fact, the library then had, at most, 150 books. The first supplementary volume of the ''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle'' of 1877 discuss the popular opinions about the Enfer:

"Il existe à la Bibliothèque nationale un dépôt qui n’est jamais ouvert au public; c’est l’Enfer, recueil de tous les dévergondages luxurieux de la plume et du crayon. Toutefois, le chiffre de ce recueil honteux n’est pas aussi élevé qu’on l’imagine généralement, puisque le nombre des ouvrages n'y est que de 340 et celui des volumes de 730. Mais il est bon de noter que cette catégorie ne comprend que les livres d’une obscénité révoltante, ceux qu’il est défendue de communiquer sous quelque prétexte que ce puisse être." 
("In the Bibliothèque nationale there is a stock that is not open to the public; it is the Enfer, the rendezvous of all the excesses of the pen and the pencil. However, the size this shameful collection is not as high as one generally imagines, as the number of books is only 340 and the volumes only 730. But it is good to note that this category includes only the repulsive obscene books, those that are forbidden to circulate under any pretext.")&lt;ref&gt;''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle''. Administration du grand dictionnaire universel, Paris 1866–1877, Suppl. 1, pg. 366 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k398030/f365.chemindefer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enfer experienced renewed growth during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], particularly due to the tightened censorship. In 1865 and 1866, the collection grew by more than 330 items; in 1876, there were 620 titles, of which more than half originated from seizures. In 1886, the collection had increased to slightly more than 700, including many cheap reprints of Libertine novels from the [[Ancien Régime]]. The Enfer remained virtually inaccessible. To be allowed to consult one of his books a strongly-reasoned application needed to be made to the head office, and the decision of a committee was required.

Between 1876 and 1886, the original press mark for the Enfer, which had been in use since the late 17th century, was replaced with ''Y2''. This press mark is used in 1896 in the general catalogue of the Bibliothèque nationale. From 1909 to 1913, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and others prepared, without the support or knowledge of library management, a special bibliographic catalog, which recorded 854 titles and described the works. (The library had managed to stop the first, less well disguised start, made by the linguist Robert Yve-Plessis after 1900.) Apollinaire's catalog was issued in an edition of 1,500 copies, a second edition of 1919 sold 2,000 copies, clearly showing the scale of the public interest in the Enfer. The 1978 catalog of the Enfer by [[Pascal Pia]] added around 700 titles.

== Repurposing ==
The work of Apollinaire and Pias contributed largely to publicising the Enfer and the literature it contains. The stock of the Enfer was enlarged in the 20th century mainly through acquisitions from ordinary bookstores. In the 1980s, the renowned publishing firm [[Fayard]] published a seven-volume collection of out-of-copyright novels held in the Enfer, with contemporary photographs and explanatory introductions. Book historians are concerned with the material that is preserved in the Enfer, while new cultural historians study the pre-revolutionary pornography found in it. A prominent example is [[Robert Darnton]], who points to the emancipatory potential of the texts in which social and religious criticism are often embedded in moral transgressions.

The development of the book market, changing moral standards and the widespread repeal of censorship regulations have changed the character of the Enfer. Through the mass availability of erotic and pornographic works it has lost a sense of purpose. Already in 1909, serial fiction was kept in it to protect it against theft. The further growth of this cheaply-produced literature led, in 1932, to a separate press mark within the collection, replaced between 1960-69 by two more specific signatures of the general catalog, which in turn were abandoned without being replaced.

The Bibliothèque nationale closed the Enfer press mark in 1969, but opened it again in 1983, for practical reasons; for librarians and library users, it was easier to find all the erotic works under a single press mark. The acquisition policy of the Bibliothèque nationale is, however, no longer based only on genre. While efforts are made to continue collecting erotic material, the decisive factor now is rarity or bibliophilic quality. Besides older works that were missing from the Enfer, contemporary and foreign books are added to the Enfer. By 2013, the collection had grown to 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ online catalogue of the Bibliothèque nationale] lists 2,706 entries, of which around 100 are empty (accessed on 9 February 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1977, access to the Enfer is no longer stricter than for the rest of the Réserve collections.

The current official [[flag]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]] ([[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]: ''{{lang|haw|Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i}}'') had also previously been used by the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|kingdom]], [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|protectorate]], [[Republic of Hawaii|republic]], and [[Territory of Hawaii|territory]] of [[Hawaiian archipelago|Hawaii]]. The flag includes the flag of a foreign country, the [[Union Jack]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], a remnant of the [[British Empire]]'s [[Paulet affair (1843)|influence]] on [[History of Hawaii|Hawaiian history]].

==Design==
[[File:Flag-of-hawaii-flying.jpg|thumb|right|The flag of Hawaii flying in [[Haleakalā National Park]]]]
The [[canton (heraldry)|canton]] of the flag of Hawaii contains the [[Union Jack|Union Flag]] of the [[United Kingdom]], prominent over the top quarter closest to the flag mast. The field of the flag is composed of eight horizontal stripes, symbolizing the eight major islands ([[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]], [[Maui]], [[Kahoolawe|Kaho{{okina}}olawe]], [[Lanai|Lāna{{okina}}i]], [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]], [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]], and [[Niihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]]). Other versions of the flag have only seven stripes, probably representing the islands with the exception of Kaho{{okina}}olawe or Ni{{okina}}ihau. The color of the stripes, from the top down, follows the sequence: white, red, blue, white, red, blue, white, red. The colors were standardized in 1843, although other combinations have been seen and are occasionally still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaii.gov/hidocs/hawaiinames.html#flag |title=Name and Insignia of Hawaii – State Flag |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |date=March 1, 2006 |publisher=Hawaii State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070511012617/http://www.hawaii.gov/hidocs/hawaiinames.html#flag |archivedate=May 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[BBC History]]'', Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a survey conducted by the [[North American Vexillological Association]] (NAVA) placed Hawaii's flag 11th in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territorial flags ranked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nava.org/digital-library/design/surveys/2001-State-Provincial-Flag-Survey.pdf|title=2001 State/Provincial Flag Survey  - NAVA.org|work=nava.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Hawaii (1896).svg|thumb|Flag of Hawaii in 1896]]
There are various accounts of the earliest history of the flag of Hawaii. One relates how King [[Kamehameha I]] flew a British flag, probably a [[Red Ensign]], given to him by British explorer Captain [[George Vancouver]] as a token of friendship with [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. Subsequent visitors reported seeing the flag flying from places of honour, as it was then considered an official Hawaiian flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Hawaii|title=flag of Hawaii - United States state flag|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the union jack added diagonal red cross of St Patrick in 1801, so did the flag of Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35890670 |title=Which flags still include the union jack? |website=BBC News|date=March 24, 2016 |first=Justin |last=Parkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adviser to Kamehameha noted that the Union Flag could draw Hawaii into international conflict, as his kingdom could be seen as an ally of the United Kingdom, and he subsequently lowered the Union Flag over his home at [[Kamakahonu]]. While disputed as historically accurate, one account stated that in order to placate U.S. interests during the [[War of 1812]], a flag of the U.S. was raised over Kamehameha's home, only to be removed when British officers in the court of Kamehameha vehemently objected to it. This explains why the resulting flag of Hawaii was a deliberate hybrid of the two nations' flags.&lt;ref name="quaife"&gt;{{cite book | last = Quaife | first = Milo | authorlink = |author2=M. J.

In 1816, Kamehameha commissioned his own flag to avoid this conflict, which has evolved into the current flag. It was probably designed by one of the commanders of the Royal Hawaiian Navy, former officers of the British [[Royal Navy]], who advised Kamehameha, based on a form of the [[British ensign|British naval flag]]. There is debate as to the actual designer: some credit [[Alexander Adams (Hawaii)|Alexander Adams]], others [[George Charles Beckley]]. It was very similar to the flag of the British [[East India Company]] in use about this time which had only red and white stripes. Captain Adams used this flag for the first time on a Hawaiian trade mission to [[China]] in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= From sword to share: or a fortune in five years at Hawaii |author= Henry Whalley Nicholson |pages=83–85 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JfwrAAAAYAAJ |publisher= W.H. Allen &amp; Co |year=1889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original flag was designed to feature stripes alternating in the order red-white-blue, also attributed to various historical flags of the United Kingdom. The flag used at the first official flying of the flag of Hawaii mistakenly placed the stripes in the order white-red-blue,&lt;ref name="fotw.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/us-hi_hi.html |title=Hawaii: historical flags |publisher=Fotw.net |accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it seems explorers to the island disagree about the exact order of colors and the number of stripes up to the late 1840s. There may have been possibly different versions of the flag with different numbers of stripes and colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Reversal of the Hawaiian Flag |year=1906|publisher= |author= Howard M. Ballou | ISBN= 0-8028-5088-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol7GL0CNCH4C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | pages= 5–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of stripes also changed: originally, the flag was designed with either seven or nine horizontal stripes, and in 1845 it was officially changed to eight stripes. The latter arrangement was adopted and is used today.&lt;ref name="quaife" /&gt;

== ''Ka Hae Hawaii'' Day ==
In 1990, Governor of Hawaii [[John D. Waihee III|John Waihee]] proclaimed July 31 to be ''Ka Hae Hawaii'' Day, the Hawaiian [[Flag Day]]. It has been celebrated each year since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/lvhalau/HawFlagProcl.html |title=Hawaiian Flag Day Proclamation |accessdate=October 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703123112/http://members.aol.com/lvhalau/HawFlagProcl.html |archivedate=July 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the same date as ''Lā Hoʻihoʻi Ea'', [[Sovereignty Restoration Day]], a holiday of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]] that is celebrated by proponents of the [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hoʻokahua Staff|title=Lā Hoʻihoʻi Ea: Hawaiʻi Commemorates Sovereignty Restoration Day|date=July 2014|work=Kaleinamanu Hawaiian Cultural Center, Kamehameha Schools|url=https://apps.ksbe.edu/kaiwakiloumoku/lahoihoiea|accessdate=September 3, 2011|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag used by the [[governor of Hawaii]] is a red and blue bi-color. In the middle of the eight white stars appears the name of the state in all capital letters. During the time Hawaii was a United States territory, the letters in the middle of the flag were "TH", which stood for "Territory of Hawaii".&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaii.gov/hidocs/hawaiinames.html#governor |title=Name and Insignia of Hawaii – Governor's Flag |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |date=March 1, 2006 |publisher=Hawaii State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070511012617/http://www.hawaii.gov/hidocs/hawaiinames.html#governor |archivedate=May 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

'''Goguryeo art''' is the art of [[Goguryeo]], an ancient [[Korea]]n kingdom (37 BCE &amp;ndash; 668 CE) which occupied large areas of present-day [[Northeast China]] and [[Korea]]. Its distinct style is marked by flowing lines and vivid colors.  The prime examples of this style are [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|tomb murals]] excavated in [[North Korea]] and [[Manchuria]], which were produced from the 3rd to 7th centuries.

'''Golden Cock and Hen''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''{{lang|zh|《金黄公鸡与母鸡》}}'') is painting during [[Korea]]’s [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon dynastic]] period. The painting, which is belonging to the early 19th century, was painted by an unknown artist. The painting itself measures about 114.3 cm in height and 45.7 cm in width. With the decorative elements, the complete painting measures 200.7 cm in height and 62.9 cm in width. This painting represents a combination of two established themes of Korean painting: birds and flowers. Also it consists of ten symbols of longevity–the [[sun]], [[mountain|mountains]] eater, [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[cloud]]s, [[pine|pine trees]], [[turtle]]s, [[crane (bird)|cranes]], [[deer]]s and [[mushroom]]s. In the central scene, there is a cock and hens perched on a tree and a rock respectively. This represents fortune and future. Currently, the painting is displayed in [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/40073|accessdate=2017-11-22 |title=Golden Cock and Hen |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In the traditional Chinese culture, rooster had been given a significant place. Ancient Chinese people believed that the rooster was a kind of moral animal with excellent qualities. This aspect also affected the neighboring Asian coutries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.163.com/17/0119/13/CB57A3PP00014AED.html |title=“鸡文化”对古人生活的影响 |publisher=北京晚报、网易新闻 |accessdate=2017-11-22 |author=倪方六 |date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Joseon dynasty]] of [[Korean peninsula]], auspicious creatures such as the [[tiger]], [[dragon]], [[crane (bird)|crane]] and [[deer]] were represented in a series of artworks demonstrating the importance and universality of these creatures in the Korean Art and culture. The painting, "Golden Cock and Hen" was created in the early 19th century AD, during [[Korean peninsula]]’s [[Joseon dynasty]]. The painting itself measures 114.3 cm in height and 45.7 cm in width. With the external decorative elements, the complete piece measures 200.7 cm in height and 62.9 cm in width. Due to the lack of documentation, the artist and the specific creation date of the painting cannot be predicated.&lt;ref name=met /&gt;

In 1919, this painting was granted to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]] by Rogers Foundation. Between 1984 and 2015 the painting has been displayed seven times in [[New York City|New York]], [[New Orleans]], [[Honolulu]], [[San Francisco]], [[Tulsa]] and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=met /&gt;

In [[show business]], a '''guest appearance''' is the participation of an outsider performer (such as a [[musician]] or [[actor]]) in an event such as a [[music record]] or [[concert]], [[Performance|show]], etc., when the performer does not belong to the regular cast, band or other performing group. In music, such an outside performer is often referred to as a '''guest artist'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dance Encyclopedia |first1= Anatole |last1= Chujoy |first2= Phyllis Winifred |last2= Manchester |year= 1967 |publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |page= 434 |chapter= Guest Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[performance art]], the terms '''guest role''' or '''guest star''' are also common, the latter term specifically indicating the guest appearance of a [[celebrity]]. The latter is often also credited as '''special guest star''' or '''special musical guest star''' by some production companies. 

In [[pop music]], guest appearances are often described with the words '''featuring''', '''with''', or '''and'''. It is abbreviated in credit lists as '''feat.''', '''ft.''', '''f/''', or '''f.'''. 

In a [[television series]], a guest star is an actor who appears in one or a few episodes (sometimes an entire [[story arc]]). 

In [[radio]] and [[television shows]], a guest star is a guest on the show who is a celebrity.

==Classical performance arts==
Guest appearances have been known in [[theatre]], [[ballet]], and [[classical music]] for centuries, with guests both from the home country and from abroad. The advent of [[air transport]] has made this practice much more practical and global.&lt;ref name=laine&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EFD9163BF935A15754C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title= The Ballet Star as Guest Artist |first= Barry |last= Laine |authorlink=Barry Laine |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical music, guest [[orchestra conductor]]s are a common practice.

Guest artists should not be confused with touring groups, troupes, orchestra, or even individual artists, although the distinction may be blurred. In the case of touring, their act is independent in itself, while the guest takes part in the act of the resident staff.

The duration of involvement of a guest artist may vary, from separate short-term acts with fees per concert to fixed temporary [[contract]]s for several seasons.

==Contemporary music==
&lt;!--This section is redirected to from [[Guest vocalist]].--&gt;
In the early days of the [[pop music]] industry the [[band (music)|band]]s were relatively stable units, and while guests were not uncommon, they were seldom given credits on album covers. For example, [[Eric Clapton]] was not credited in print for his guitar performance in the release of "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]" of [[the Beatles]]. Still the term "featuring" was used as early as in the July 1954 [[UK Singles Chart]] by "[[The Four Aces]] featuring [[Al Alberts]]" with "[[Three Coins in the Fountain (song)|Three Coins In The Fountain]]" at 5th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.everyhit.com/ | title=UK Top 40 Hit Database | accessdate=July 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gradually guest appearances have become a fully credited staple of music industry. The custom of guest appearance has become especially prominent in [[rap music]], and this influenced [[rock music]]ians as well.&lt;ref name=aust&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22799180-16947,00.html |title= Voices Find Gilt by Association |first= Mark |last= Edwards |date= November 22, 2007 |work= [[The Australian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To have a guest star on a record, the [[production coordinator]] must obtain permission from the [[record label]] of the guest and make sure that proper credits are delivered to the host record label to be printed on the album cover, often in the form "''Artist name'',  courtesy of ''Record Label name.''" The permission is not always granted and sometimes negotiations may take a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Bobby |last= Borg |year= 2003 |title= The Musician's Handbook: A Practical Guide to Understanding the Music Business |isbn= 0-8230-8357-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for guest appearances==
A common reason for guest appearances is to draw attention to an act by including a celebrity into it. And vice versa, in the fashion-driven environment of show industry, older stars keep themselves in the limelight by associating themselves with emerging stars.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

In rap, mutual and multiple guest starring was recognized as a way to diversify the performance.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

In theatre and ballet, guest appearances diversify actors' repertory and experience under different choreographers, and give more acting opportunities. Even for established stars prestigious overseas engagements increase their home status. Conversely, a guest star benefits the receiving troupe, bringing new inspiration and technique. Audience would welcome diversity, and theatrical business benefits as well: theatre connoisseurs will come to see the same piece with a new star.&lt;ref name=laine/&gt;

==Drawbacks==
Commercialization of guests policy may also have negative consequences. Local theatres may limit the growth opportunities for their performers in favor of guests. Sometimes rehearsal times are inadequate to fully integrate the home and guest styles. Touring increases physical load on an actor. It is also associated with multiple stress factors: from [[jet lag]]s to close calls due to unanticipated travel delays.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

With a television series, the appearance of a special guest star could mark the moment when a series "[[Jumping the shark|jumps the shark]]"; that is, a doomed attempt to reverse a decline in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= Jump the Shark |title= Special Guest Star |url= http://www.jumptheshark.com/forum/Special-Guest-Star/30 |accessdate= October 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Vanda's Room''''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: '''''No Quarto da Vanda''''', 2000) is a [[docufiction]] (a subgenre of [[cinéma vérité]]) film by Portuguese director [[Pedro Costa]].

== Overview ==
The film follows the daily life of Vanda Duarte, a [[heroin]] [[Substance dependence|addict]], in the [[Shanty town|shanty]] outskirts of [[Lisbon]]. The film's focus is also on the community of the district and its townscape. ''No Quarto da Vanda'' follows the drama film ''[[Ossos]]'' (1997) in which Vanda Duarte plays as an [[actress]].

The film took a year to shoot after the (mostly) one-person crew settled in the location, ''Fontainhas district'', where Vanda and the community including [[Cape Verde]]an [[immigrants]] lived depressed lives.

In spite of its three-hour length, the director Pedro Costa made the film in a [[Realism (arts)|realist]] style by using fixed shots entirely. Melancholic life of the community was shot on [[DV]] in a low-key way. Costa said about his impression of the district:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I entered the Fontainhas area, there were colors and smells that made me remember the things and events of the past, and also ideas about people to which I am attracted. These ideas nestled close to each other, living together even as they led very solitary lives because of violent and painful separation. A form of interesting and incompatible relationships existed in this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yidff.jp/2001/cat021/01c031-e.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film also sees this shanty district slowly being [[demolished]]. The displaced inhabitants are featured in Costa's next film ''[[Juventude em Marcha]]'' (''Colossal Youth'', 2006).

==Acclaim==
Despite its highly fictional nature, its elusive classification and its documentary-like hybridization allowed it to win the [[FIPRESCI]] Prize at the [[Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival]] in 2001 "for presenting life in its near-original form".&lt;ref&gt;http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Yamagata_International_Documentary_Festival/2001#FIPRESCI_Prize&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fipresci.org/awards/awards/awards_2001.htm#yamagata {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203083711/http://www.fipresci.org/awards/awards/awards_2001.htm |date=2008-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedro Costa collected the France Culture Award (Foreign Cineaste of the Year) for directing the film at [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Cannes_Film_Festival/2002#France_Culture_Award&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibitions change monthly and feature both emerging and established artists; the exhibitions are solo, group or thematic in orientation. At Hillyer, work from artists living and working in the mid-Atlantic region, particularly the D.C. area, exists alongside the work of their international peers. By exhibiting this variety of international art adjacent to local works, Hillyer creates a dialogue of cultural exchange.
Some of Hillyer's past exhibitions include works by [[Joan Belmar]], [[Solomon Wondimu]], [[Yar Koporulin]] and [[Jessika Tarr]].

== Cultural Exchange Programs ==
IA&amp;A runs an internationally focused career training program. This [[U.S. Department of State]]-approved program allows international trainees to partake in professional training within arts and cultural-related organizations throughout the United States.  Each year, IA&amp;A provides visa assistance to about 100 international trainees.&lt;ref name="Washington Post" /&gt;

== Design Studio ==
IA&amp;A's Design Studio provides print and web design. It offers all print, multimedia and web site design services, as well as copywriting and editing. The Design Studio works with IA&amp;A's Traveling Exhibitions department, Hillyer Art Space, Cultural Exchange Programs and the Membership Program to provide professional graphic design materials.

'''''Judith Slaying Holofernes''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] early [[Baroque]] artist [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]  completed between 1614 and 1620.&lt;ref name="Gardner583"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The work shows the scene of [[Judith beheading Holofernes]], common in art since the early [[Renaissance]], as part of the group of subjects art critics have called the "[[Power of Women]]", which show women triumphing over powerful men. The subject takes an episode from the [[apocrypha]]l [[Book of Judith]] in the [[Old Testament]],  which recounts the assassination of the [[Assyria]]n general [[Holofernes]] by the [[Israelite]] heroine [[Judith]]. The painting shows the moment when Judith, helped by her maidservant, beheads the general after he has fallen asleep drunk.

The painting is relentlessly physical, from the wide [[spurts of blood]] to the energy of the two women as they perform the act.&lt;ref name="Gardner583" /&gt; The effort of the women's struggle is most finely represented by the delicate face of the maid, who is younger than in most paintings, which is grasped by the oversized, muscular fist of Holofernes as he desperately struggles to survive. Although the painting depicts a classic scene from the Bible, Gentileschi drew herself as Judith and her mentor [[Agostino Tassi]], who was tried for and convicted of her rape, as Holofernes. Gentileschi's biographer Mary Garrard famously proposed an autobiographical reading of the painting, stating that it functions as "a cathartic expression of the artist's private, and perhaps repressed, rage".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Garrard, ''Artemisia Gentileschi'' (1989), qtd. in {{cite book

==Related works==
Gentileschi's self-insertion was reversed in an influential composition by [[Cristofano Allori]] (c. 1613 onwards), which exists in several versions and copied a conceit of Caravaggio's recent ''[[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio, Rome)|David with the Head of Goliath]]''; here the head is a portrait of the artist, Judith his ex-mistress, and the maid her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, ''The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque'', p. 270, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-902163-29-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentileschi painted another painting, ''[[:File:Gentileschi judith1.jpg|Judith and her Maidservant]]'' (1613–14), which shows Judith holding a dagger while her maidservant carries a basket containing a severed head. ''[[:File:Gentileschi judith1.jpg|Judith and her Maidservant]]'' is displayed in the Palazzo Pitti, in Florence. A further three paintings by Gentileschi, in Naples, Detroit and Cannes, show her maid covering the head of Holofernes, while Judith herself looks out the frame of the picture.

[[Judith beheading Holofernes]] has been depicted by a number of artists including [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Caravaggio]].

[[File:Judith Beheading Holofernes by Caravaggio.jpg|left|thumb|[[Caravaggio]], ''[[Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)|Judith Beheading Holofernes]],'' c. 1598–1599. In Caravaggio's version the beheading seems effortless, in stark contrast to Gentileschi's depictions]]
[[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)|Judith Beheading Holofernes]]'' is believed to be the main source of this work, and his influence shows in the naturalism and violence Gentileschi brings to her canvas. In both there is a notable absence of decorative detail in the background.&lt;ref name="WGOA"&gt;"[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/gentiles/artemisi/judit.html Judith Beheading Holofernes]". [[Web Gallery of Art]]. Retrieved on June 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Gentileschi's father, [[Orazio Gentileschi]], was also a famous painter; he was also very much influenced by Caravaggio's style and painted his own version of the tale, ''[[:File:Orazio Gentileschi - Judith and Her Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes.JPG|Judith and Her Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes]]''.

'''Kilwa Kisiwani''' is a community on an [[Indian Ocean]] [[island]] off the southern coast of present-day [[Tanzania]] in eastern Africa. Historically, it was the center of the [[Kilwa Sultanate]], a medieval sultanate whose authority at its height in the 13th-15th centuries CE stretched the entire length of the [[Swahili Coast]]. Kilwa Kisiwani has been designated by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] along with the nearby stonetown [[Songo Mnara]].

== History and archaeology ==
Kilwa Kisiwani is an archaeological [[city-state]] site located along the Swahili Coast on the Kilwa [[archipelago]]. It was occupied from at least the 8th century CE and became one of the most powerful settlements along the coast. The seasonal wind reversals would affect trade circulations.&lt;ref name=Elkiss1973&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elkiss|first1=Terry A.|title=Kilwa Kisiwani: The Rise of an East African City-State|journal=African Studies Review|date=1973|volume=16|issue=1|pages=119–130|doi=10.2307/523737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade connections with the Arabian Peninsula as well as India and China influenced the growth and development of Kilwa, and, though there are Islamic words and customs that have been adapted to the culture, the origins are African.&lt;ref name=Pollard2008 /&gt; Many of the Swahili settlements showed complex layouts that reflected social relations between groups, however at Kilwa, there are many questions still left unanswered about the town layout. The cemeteries were located on the edge of the town, which was common for the region, and large, open spaces were likely used for social gatherings.&lt;ref name=FWJ2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleisher|first1=Jeffery|last2=Wynne-Jones|first2=Stephanie|title=Finding Meaning in Ancient Swahili Spatial Practices|journal=Afr Archaeol Rev|date=2012|volume=29|pages=171–207|doi=10.1007/s10437-012-9121-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important city for trade, around the 13th century there were increased fortifications and a greater flow of goods. For these to take place, there would need to be a form of political administration overseeing the city, controlling the movement of goods. Much of the trade networks were with the [[Arabian peninsula]]. Kilwa Kisiwani reached its highest point in wealth and commerce between 13th and 15th centuries CE.&lt;ref name="Pollard2008"/&gt;

Evidence of growth in wealth can be seen with the appearance of stone buildings around the 13th century CE, before which all of the buildings were [[wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]]. The socio-economic status of the individuals residing there could be clearly seen in the type of structure they were living in. Among Kilwa's exports were spices, tortoiseshell, coconut oil, ivory, and aromatic gums, as well as gold.&lt;ref name=Elkiss1973 /&gt; At around this time, Kilwa had seized control over the trade of gold at [[Sofala]]. The wealthy also possessed more commercial goods than the individuals who were of the lower class did. Luxury cloths and foreign ceramics were among a few of the items they would have owned, though some items, such as luxury clothes, do not preserve in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name=Pollard2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Edward John|title=THe maritime landscape of Kilwa Kisiwani and its region, Tanzania, 11th to 15th century CE|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|date=2008|volume=27|pages=265–280|doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2008.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For approximately 500 years, Kilwa was minting coins. This lasted from about A.D 1100-1600 and the coins have been found across the region, including [[Great Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name=CHAMI98&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chami|first1=Felix A.|title=A Review of Swahili Archaeology|journal=African Archaeological Review|date=1998|volume=15|issue=3|pages=199–218|doi=10.1023/a:1021612012892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine resources were abundant and utilized for food. Food sources would also come from the surrounding land. But because of the huge impact the sea, with all of the resources and trade opportunities, had on Kilwa, the archaeological investigation of the harbors and ports is considered to be quite important. The soil at Kilwa that was found over the limestone was of poor quality, so the land food sources came from the areas of higher ground. However, the soil in the Kilwa region would have been suitable for growing cotton, which could be used in sail manufacturer. 12th century [[spindle whorl]]s have been found, indicating that cotton was used and processed in this area.&lt;ref name="Pollard2008"/&gt;

===Ceramics===
At first, most of the focus was placed on the archaeology of Kilwa's ports and harbors, however, more and more emphasis is being placed on Kilwa's hinterlands. 
Ceramic artifacts are plentiful at the site and can be divided into two groups: regional and coastal. All of the ceramics with regional distribution were locally produced, but the area of distribution is limited. These unglazed ceramics were referred to as Kitchen Wares, though their uses were not necessarily just as cooking vessels.  All of the varieties of locally produced pottery found in the region were also uncovered at the site of Kilwa itself.&lt;ref name=WJ2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wynne-Jones|first1=Stephanie|title=Creating urban communities at Kilwa Kisiwani, Tanzania, CE 800-1300|journal=Antiquity|date=2007|volume=81|pages=368–380|doi=10.1017/s0003598x00095247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Kitchen Wares could be seen throughout the region, there were ceramics that were mostly seen within Kilwa itself. These included modeled forms and red-burnished wares. The distribution pattern of the red-burnished wares was coastal. Other ceramic types that were seemingly restricted to town were the imported ceramic vessels from the Arabian peninsula and China. Imported ceramic materials are not found in rural areas. They were used as a sign of social status by the elite. They were kept in wall niches made just for the purpose of displaying them. These imported ceramics played important symbolic roles along the Swahili Coast. The symbolism attached to the imported ceramics was so strong that it carried on to modern Swahili culture. The lack of imported goods in the hinterlands indicates that, while Kilwa was undergoing a process of urbanization, the local communities did not undergo a dramatic transformation.&lt;ref name=WJ2005 /&gt;

===Preservation===
In 2004, Kilwa Kisiwani was inscribed on UNESCO's [[List of World Heritage in Danger]]. There is a serious rapid deterioration of the archaeological and monumental heritage of these two islands due to various agents like erosion and vegetation. The eastern section of the Palace of Husuni Kubwa, for example, is progressively disappearing. The damage to the soil caused by rainwater wash is accentuating the risks of the collapse of the remaining structures on the edge of the cliff. The vegetation that proliferates on the cliff has limited the progression of the rain-wash effect but causes the break-up of the masonry structures. The [[World Monuments Fund]] included Kilwa on its 2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites, and since 2008 has been supporting conservation work on various buildings.

==Notable features==

===Great Mosque===
The [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]] is a [[Jama Masjid|congregational]] [[mosque]] on the island of Kilwa Kisiwani, in [[Tanzania]]. It was likely founded in the tenth century, but the two major stages of construction date to the eleventh or twelfth and thirteenth century, respectively. It is one of the earliest surviving mosques on the Swahili Coast.

The smaller northern prayer hall dates to the first phase of construction. It contained a total of 16 bays supported by nine pillars, which were originally carved from [[coral]] but later replaced by timber. The structure was entirely roofed, and was perhaps one of the first mosques in the area to have been built without a courtyard.

In the early fourteenth century, [[Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman]], who also built the nearby [[Palace of Husuni Kubwa]], added a southern extension which included a great dome. This dome was described by [[Ibn Battuta]] after he visited Kilwa in 1331.

===Palace of Husuni Kubwa===
[[File:Kilwa Kisiwani Fort.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The fort on the banks of Kilwa Kisiwani.]]
Husuni Kubwa (the "Great Fort"), situated outside the town, was an early 14th-century sultan's palace and emporium.  Other defining features include [[causeway]]s and platforms at the entrance of the Harbour made from blocks of reef and coral nearly a meter high. These act as breakwaters, allowing mangroves to grow which is one of the ways the breakwater can be spotted from a distance. Some parts of the causeway are made from the bedrock, but usually the bedrock was used as a base. Coral stone was used to build up the causeways with sand and lime being used to cement the cobbles together. Some of the stones were left loose.&lt;ref name=Pollard2008intertidal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Edward|title=Inter-Tidal Causeways and Platforms of the 13th- to 16th-Century City-States of Kilwa Kisiwani, Tanzania|journal=The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=2008|volume=1|issue=37|pages=98–114|doi=10.1111/j.1095-9270.2007.00167.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palace of Husuni Kubwa is a ruined structure on the island of Kilwa Kisiwani, in [[Tanzania]]. The majority of the palace was erected in the 14th century by [[Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman]], who also built an extension to the nearby [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]], although portions may date back to the 13th century. The palace was inhabited only for a brief period of time, and abandoned before its completion.

The structure was built out of [[coral]] stone on a high bluff overlooking the [[Indian Ocean]]. It consists of three major elements: a south court, used primarily for commerce; a residential complex including over one hundred individual rooms; and a wide stairway leading down a mosque that was situated on the beach. Other notable features include pavilion, which likely served as a reception hall, and an octagonal swimming pool. All of Husuni Kubwa spans across approximately two acres. The coral rag was set in limestone mortar and cut stone was used for decorative pieces, door jams, and vaults. The rooms were about 3 meters tall. The roof was made from cut limestone blocks laid across cut timbers and the floors were white plaster. The main entrance to Husuni Kubwa is from the shore. Most of the imported glazed pottery recovered at the site was Chinese celadon, though there were a few Ying Ch'ing stoneware sherds present. A Yuan dynasty flask dated to about C.E. 1300. Neither the Kilwa Chronicle nor any Portuguese accounts describe a building comparable to Husuni Kubwa.&lt;ref name=Chittick63&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chittick|first1=Neville|title=Kilwa and the Arab Settlement of the East African Coast|journal=The Journal of African History|date=1963|volume=4|issue=2|pages=179–190|doi=10.1017/s0021853700004011|jstor=179533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Husuni Ndogo===
Husuni Ndogo ("Little Fort") is built from coral rubble and limestone mortar. The rectangular enclosure wall surrounds the complex and at each corner stands a tower. The foundations extend two meters below ground level. It appears to have been built as a fort, but the exact purposes and uses are somewhat unknown. There is some evidence that it, for at least a time, was used as a mosque. Architecturally, it appears to be different from other buildings along the coast, resembling buildings constructed under the Caliphs of the Umayyad at around C.E. 661-750. However, whether or not the structure is related or even dates to the Arabic buildings remains uncertain, though it seems unlikely.&lt;ref name=Chittick63 /&gt;

[[File:City of Kilwa, 1572.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1572 depiction of the city of Kilwa from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''Civitates orbis terrarum''.]]
A document written around CE 1200 called ''al-Maqama al Kilwiyya'', discovered in [[Oman]], gives details of a mission to reconvert Kilwa to [[Ibadism]], as it had recently been affected by the [[Ghurabiyya Shia]] doctrine from southern Iraq.

According to local oral tradition, in the 11th century the island of Kilwa Kisiwani was sold to Ali bin Hasan, son of the "King" of [[Shiraz]], in Persia. Another tradition relates that his mother was [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]] (Habesha). Ali bin Al-Hasan is credited with founding the island city and with marrying the daughter of the local king. Though he was credited with the founding, he had arrived at an already inhabited area. He did, however, come to power and is credited with fortifying the city and increasing trade.&lt;ref name=Elkiss1973 /&gt; Tradition also relates that it was the child of this union who founded the Kilwa Sultanate. Archaeological and [[documentary research]] has revealed that over the next few centuries, Kilwa grew to be a substantial city and the leading commercial [[entrepôt]] on the southern half of the [[Swahili Coast]] (roughly from the present Tanzanian-Kenya border southward to the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] River), trading extensively with states of the Southeast African hinterland as far as Zimbabwe. Trade was mainly in gold, iron, ivory and other animal products of the interior for beads, textiles, jewelry, porcelain and spices from Asia.

By the 12th century, under the rule of the Abu'-Mawahib dynasty, Kilwa had become the most powerful city on the Swahili Coast. At the zenith of its power in the 15th century, the Kilwa Sultanate claimed authority over the city-states of [[Malindi]], Mvita (Mombasa), [[Pemba Island]], [[Zanzibar]], [[Mafia Island]], [[Grande Comore|Comoro]], [[Sofala]] and the trading posts across the channel on [[Madagascar]].

[[Ibn Battuta]] recorded his visit to the city around 1331, and commented favorably on the generosity, humility, and religion of its ruler, [[Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman]]. Ibn Battuta also describes how the sultan would go into the interior and raid the people taking slaves and other forms of wealth. He was also particularly impressed by the planning of the city and believed that it was the reason for Kilwa's success along the coast.&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=Ross E.|title=The adventures of Ibn Battuta, a Muslim traveler of the fourteenth century|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520243854|edition=Rev. ed. with a new pref.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this period date the construction of the [[Palace of Husuni Kubwa]] and a significant extension to the [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]], which was made of [[coral]] stones—the largest mosque of its kind. Kilwa was an important and also wealthy city for the trade of gold, because of this some of the people who lived in Kilwa had a higher standard of living, but many others were also poor. The wealthy enjoyed indoor plumbing in their stone homes and the poor lived in mud huts with thatched roofs.&lt;ref&gt;The Travels of Ibn Battuta&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 16th century, [[Vasco da Gama]] extorted tribute from the wealthy Islamic state. In 1505 another Portuguese force commanded by D. [[Francisco de Almeida]] took control of the island after besieging it. It remained in Portuguese hands until 1512, when an Arab mercenary captured Kilwa after the Portuguese abandoned their outpost. The city regained some of its earlier prosperity, but in 1784 was conquered by the [[Oman]]i rulers of [[Zanzibar]]. After the Omani conquest, the [[France|French]] built and manned a fort at the northern tip of the island, but the city itself was abandoned in the 1840s. It was later part of the colony of [[German East Africa]] from 1886 to 1918.

==Tourism==
The town is located within the [[Kilwa District]] of the [[Lindi Region]].

It is possible to visit the island of Kilwa Kisiwani and most people base themselves in Kilwa Masoko. The town Kilwa Masoko can be reached by bus from Dar es Salaam (leaving Mbagala bus stop), and is served by [[Coastal Aviation]]. There are numerous basic guesthouses and a handful of tourist hotels, mostly spread along Jimbiza beach and the beautiful and highly regarded Masoko Pwani.

A permit is needed to visit the ruins of Kisiwani itself, and can be easily obtained from the local government building on the main road in Kilwa Masoko. Once the permit has been obtained it is easy to arrange [[dhow]] transport over the narrow channel to Kisiwani.

although the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The written materials in the list adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] based on their "especially high historical o=r artistic value".&lt;ref name="bunkapamphlet"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt; The list presents 56 entries from the 7th century [[Tang Dynasty]] to the [[Kamakura period]] with more than half originating in China. The total number of items is higher, however, since groups of related objects have been joined as single entries. The list contains works that have been originally compiled in China by Chinese authors. A large proportion of these works are [[Chinese classics]].&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

Written language was introduced to Japan around 400 AD in the form of Chinese books written in [[Classical Chinese]]. Japanese interest in Chinese writings and culture gradually increased towards the end of the 6th century when Japanese rulers sent missions to the mainland for cultural studies, and to bring back books. During circa 300 years in the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and Tang Dynasties, a large number of Chinese books were brought to Japan. By the 8th century, Chinese works were customarily copied at Japanese libraries to satisfy the demand for education of the male aristocracy. Until the early 17th century, copying in Japan was largely by hand. However, Chinese printed editions of the [[Song Dynasty]] were imported following an increased trading activity at the start of the [[Kamakura period]] (after 1192). The designated manuscripts are either transcriptions of the original works produced in China or in Japan or are Chinese printed editions. The Chinese manuscripts, both handwritten and printed editions, were imported to Japan at the time. The designated treasures are housed in [[Buddhist temple|temples]], museums, libraries, [[Shinto shrine|shrines]], universities and in private collections.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

The objects in this list represent about one fourth of the 227 National Treasures in the category "writings". They are complemented by 68 Japanese book National Treasures of the [[List of National Treasures of Japan (writings: Japanese books)]] and 103 other written National Treasures of the [[List of National Treasures of Japan (writings: others)]].&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

==Treasures==

===Chinese manuscripts===
Japan's first experience with books and written language&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Inscriptions on imported coins and artefacts are older but were not perceived as language by the Japanese at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; came from books written in [[Classical Chinese]] in China, brought to Japan from the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korean kingdoms]], at least by the 5th and probably by the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p278"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p279"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, the scholar [[Wani (scholar)|Wani]] came to Japan in 406 and brought with him the [[Confucius|Confucian]] [[Analects]] and [[Thousand Character Classic]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The Thousand Character Classic as known today was not compiled at the time of Wani throwing doubt on the accuracy of this legend.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p278"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p279"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zuzao-one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were followed, in later years, by the [[Five Classics]] ([[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Odes]], [[Book of History]], [[Book of Rites]], [[I Ching|Book of Changes]] and the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]]), which, by the 6th century, became well-known among the Japanese literary elite.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p279"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zuzao-one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sansom-p63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1931|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventeen-article constitution]], compiled in 604 by [[Prince Shōtoku]], has quotations that allow the identification of 18 Chinese books known to have existed in Japan at the time:&lt;ref name="kornicki-p279"/&gt; Odes, Rites, [[Xiao Jing|Classic of Filial Piety]], Analects, [[Zuo Zhuan|Chronicle of Zuo]], the Han Chronicles ([[Book of Han]] and [[Book of the Later Han]]), [[Wen Xuan]] anthology, [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] and other classical Chinese writings.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;According to another source, the text composed by Prince Shōtoku shows familiarity with fifteen Chinese literary, historical, and philosophical works: [[Book of Songs (Chinese)|the Odes]], [[Book of History]], [[Classic of Filial Piety]], [[Analects]], [[Chronicle of Zuo]], [[Book of Rites]], [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]], [[Records of the Grand Historian]], [[Book of Han]], [[Wen Xuan]], [[Mencius (book)|Mencius]], [[Mozi (book)|Mozi]], [[Tao Te Ching|Laozi]], [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] and [[Han Feizi (book)|Han Feizi]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sansom-p82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1931|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p457"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of Chinese books to Japan reached its first peak in the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties.&lt;ref name="zuzao-one"/&gt; During this period books were brought to Japan through two sources: people, who were mostly literate, moving from the continent; and by official missions sent out by the Japanese court.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p279"/&gt; Four [[Japanese missions to Sui China|envoys to Sui China]] were dispatched under Prince Shōtoku, but this number quickly increased during the Tang dynasty, which saw 16 [[Japanese missions to Tang China|envoys]] of circa 200 to 600 people, each sent to study Chinese culture and to acquire Chinese books.&lt;ref name="zuzao-one"/&gt; One of the most well-known missions was that by [[Kibi Makibi]] who left Japan in 717, spent 17 years in China and returned with books on various subjects.&lt;ref name="zuzao-one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sansom-p90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1931|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of works imported during this period include the first Chinese [[pharmacopoeia]] (Xinxiu Bencao), compiled and imported in the same year (713), and Tang poetry by [[Li Bai]], [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] and [[Bai Juyi]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Bai Juyi was the most influential Tang Dynasty poet in Japan and his collected works were imported in 836.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zuzao-one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p283"/&gt; Towards the end of the Tang Dynasty, at the end of the 9th century, about half of the canon of Chinese literature was present in Japan, including texts of all major Tang poets.&lt;ref name="zuzao-one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p283"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Book Catalogue in Japan'', compiled between 876 and 884 by the aristocrat and scholar [[Fujiwara no Sukeyo]], showed entries for 1,568 Chinese books, located in Japan, in classics, history, philosophy and anthologies.&lt;ref name="zuzao-one"/&gt; Due to the cessation of missions to China in the late 9th century, relatively few Chinese books were imported through the mid and late [[Heian period]].&lt;ref name="kornicki-p286"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some books such as the [[Yupian]] or the Meihōki were lost early in China, because of the persecution against Buddhism or for other reasons. The titles survived, however, because of the large volume of books previously imported to Japan, which were then subsequently re-exported to China.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p280"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kozanji-nt"/&gt; Today, some of the oldest extant manuscripts of Chinese books dating to the Tang Dynasty are located in Japan.&lt;ref name="FeldherrHardy2011-p477"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldherr|first1=Andrew|last2=Hardy|first2=Grant|title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Beginnings to Ad 600|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIa5yxiJKPwC&amp;pg=PA477|accessdate=2011-05-29|date=2011-12-02|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-921815-8|page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few of the early imported manuscripts have survived. Some of those that survived are listed as National Treasures below.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p280"/&gt; Twenty Chinese book National Treasures exist that were created in China and subsequently imported to Japan. Of these, 19 date to the Tang Dynasty and one to the [[Southern Song]]. The designated items are of various type: six treasures are manuscripts of the Five Classics of [[Confucianism]] and associated commentaries, four are poetry and prose [[Anthology|anthologies]] of Chinese poets, calligraphers and [[Emperor Huizong of Song]], four are [[Chinese dictionary|dictionaries]], five are anecdote collections and one is a [[Sheet music|music score]].&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

===Japanese manuscripts===
In Japan, until the Heian period, the language of government and ritual was Classical Chinese in which was composed decrees, codes, commands, communications and certificates.&lt;ref name="AdolphsonKamens2007-p112"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adolphson|Kamens|2007|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ2-p342"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ2-p343"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Chinese books were essential for the education of the (male) aristocracy, and beginning readers studied books such as the [[Mencius (book)|Mencius]] or the Thousand Character Classic.&lt;ref name="AdolphsonKamens2007-p113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adolphson|Kamens|2007|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ2-p346-354"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|pp=346–354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 7th century, to prepare selected sons of the nobility for a government career, [[Emperor Tenji]] established the [[Daigaku-ryō]] ("Academy").&lt;ref name="lerner-p52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lerner|2009|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ2-p367"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the curriculum consisted mainly of [[Four Books and Five Classics|Confucian Classics]] and Chinese history.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In addition medicine, astronomy, mathematics and music were taught.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lerner-p52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ2-p367"/&gt; Chinese learning thrived in the 9th century, and the Academy's curriculum saw a rise in literary composition based on the Chinese books Wen Xuan, [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and the Books of Han and Later Han.&lt;ref name="AdolphsonKamens2007-p112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ2-p343"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ2-p368"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sansom-p235"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1931|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in China at the time, Classical Confucian studies, especially the historical and political side of Confucianism, were still held in high esteem in the Heian period with commentaries used for study dating to the Han Dynasty.&lt;ref name="sansom-p234"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1931|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one of the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese emperor]]'s prescribed activities was listening to lectures on the Chinese classics, histories, and poetic anthologies.&lt;ref name="CHoJ2-p354"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese books had reached Japan since circa 400 AD and had been imported in large quantities through a number of missions during the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] Dynasties. Official missions ended after 894, but books continued to reach Japan in the mid to late Heian period through commercial exchange or via priests travelling to China.&lt;ref name="CHoJ2-p344"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imported Chinese books were copied at Japanese libraries, but unlike [[sutra]] copying little is known about the actual copying process of Chinese secular works in Japan.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p91"/&gt; The Japanese aristocracy and clergy sponsored the transcription of religious and government texts on a large scale by the [[Nara period]].&lt;ref name="cox-p156"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cox|2007|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state library was the Zusho-ryō ("Bureau of Archives") established by the [[Taihō Code]] from 701.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Promulgated one year later in 702.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p365"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to the Daigaku-ryō, it oversaw the custody (collection and preservation) and transmission of Buddhist and Confucian books from the Nara period, until its destruction by fire in the mid-Heian period (11th century).&lt;ref name="zuzao-one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lerner-p52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p365"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p1075"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=1075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection depended largely on the copying of texts held elsewhere.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p365"/&gt; In addition to the Zusho-ryō, books were also copied at imperial palace libraries, private libraries of aristocrats, temple libraries and at libraries of organs of the state.&lt;ref name="lerner-p52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p365"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p366"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Heian period, the majority of works held in libraries (both those produced in China and those copied in Japan) consisted of Chinese works and scholarly collections were dominated by Chinese secular works.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p370"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Heian period, the great fire of [[Kyoto]] in 1177, and the burning of temples by the [[Taira clan|Taira]] in 1180, destroyed a large part of the literary heritage.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p371"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lerner-p53"/&gt; During the [[Kamakura period]], the warrior class founded new libraries such as the [[Kanazawa Bunko]].&lt;ref name="lerner-p53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lerner|2009|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 23 Chinese book National Treasures that are transcriptions produced in Japan. Of these four date to the Nara period, 17 to the Heian period and two to the Kamakura period. The designated items are of various type: four are historical chronicles, four are poetry collections, three are [[Chinese dictionary|dictionaries]] or reference books, two are medical or botanical books and one is a book on politics.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

===Song printed editions===
Printing had been known in Japan from at least the 8th century, when a large number of [[dharani]] known as [[Hyakumantō Darani]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;There are about 1000 extant, but contemporary sources such as the [[Shoku Nihongi]] mention that up to one million dharani were produced.&lt;/ref&gt; were printed from 764 to 770 and placed in miniature wooden [[pagoda]]s. These count among the oldest extant printed texts in [[East Asia]] and were likely made by [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock printing]].&lt;ref name="kornicki-naraprint"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|pp=114–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eliot-p111"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliot|Rose|2009|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyakumantō Darani were ritual Buddhist printings, neither meant for distribution nor for reading.&lt;ref name="kornicki-naraprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eliot-p111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-generalprint"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|pp=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice of devotional printing continued into the Heian period. The first practical printing in Japan can be dated to the 11th century and is associated with sutra commentaries and doctrinal works for which handcopying did not entail religious merit.&lt;ref name="kornicki-generalprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-heianmuromprint"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|pp=117–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eliot-p112"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliot|Rose|2009|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the increasing popularity of printing, many texts, particularly Japanese literature, continued to be copied by hand on manuscript [[scroll]]s. Commercial printing did not become common until the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="kornicki-heianmuromprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing in China initially had a similar development, starting with the printing of religious scriptures, prayers and popularly useful texts such as [[almanacs]] or calendars which were produced for local use by temples. By the [[Five Dynasties]], the government realized the opportunities of printing political and ideological texts such as the [[Chinese Classics|Classics]].&lt;ref name="brokaw-p23"/&gt; The ensuing [[Song Dynasty]] saw great advancements in art, religion and philosophy with scholarly activity greatly facilitated by printed books.&lt;ref name="varley-p83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Varley|2000|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="varley-p84"&gt;{{Harvnb|Varley|2000|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Chinese publishing industry took off during the Song Dynasty, several hundred years before the same happened in Japan.&lt;ref name="brokaw-p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brokaw|Chow|2005|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enhanced by the Song interest of foreign trade and the maritime activity of the Taira, the book exchange between China and Japan saw a second peak after the Sui and Tang Dynasties starting in 1192.&lt;ref name="zuzao-one"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuzao|Xiaolan|2010|pp=226–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="varley-p83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zuzao-two"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuzao|Xiaolan|2010|pp=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese visitors to Song China returned with a large number of printed books, on a variety of subjects such as history, philosophy, Buddhism, Confucianism, literature, medicine and geography, causing a revival of pure scholarship, which had been sidelined during the earlier obsession with poetry in the Heian period courtier society.&lt;ref name="varley-p83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="varley-p84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zuzao-two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eliot-p106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliot|Rose|2009|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supply of imported printed editions of Chinese texts was insufficient to meet the demand and by the time of the Taira supremacy collections of Chinese books had become status symbols among the upper class of Japan.&lt;ref name="varley-p84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books were collected and formed the nuclei of many new libraries, in particular those associated with [[Zen]] temples of Kyoto and [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] or those founded by samurai families of the [[Kantō region]].&lt;ref name="kornicki-p371"/&gt;&lt;ref name="varley-p84"/&gt; These libraries became centers of learning and to a great extent stimulated the varied and energetic scholarly activities of the coming medieval age.&lt;ref name="varley-p84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sansom2-p200"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1961|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important of these new libraries in the Kamakura period was the Kanazawa Bunko, established in 1275 by [[Hōjō Sanetoki]].&lt;ref name="kornicki-p372"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p467"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal-p228"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eclectic in scope, it had a huge collection of books embracing the literary culture of all of East Asia, including a great number of Song editions of Chinese works.&lt;ref name="sansom2-p200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p467"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p373"/&gt; The collection was dispersed at the end of the 16th century and partially transferred to [[Edo]] by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]].&lt;ref name="frederic-p467"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p373"/&gt; Librarians of Kanazawa Bunko used an ownership seal, making it possible to trace existing copies back to that library.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p373"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Muromachi period]] [[Uesugi Norizane]] revived in 1432 the [[Ashikaga Gakko]] library that came to house a bulk of mainly Confucian texts and [[Exegesis|exegetical]] works.&lt;ref name="sansom2-p200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p375"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wedgeworth-p408"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgeworth|1992|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p374"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen sets of [[Southern Song|Song]] printed books have been designated as National Treasures. Many of them have been handed down in feudal era [[Japanese clans]] and were stored at libraries such as Kanazawa Bunko, Ashikaga Gakko or at monasteries such as the one of [[Tōfuku-ji]]. They cover mainly Chinese Classics such as books and commentaries on [[Records of the Grand Historian]], the [[Book of Han]], the [[Book of Later Han]], [[Classic of History]], [[Book of Rites]], [[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Songs]] or the [[Book of Changes]]. Two are encyclopedias.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"&gt;{{cite web

This is a list of notable '''[[game designer|video game designers]]''', past and present, in alphabetical order.  The people in this list already have Wikipedia entries, and as such did significant design for notable computer [[computer game]]s, [[console game]]s, or [[arcade game]]s. It does not include people in managerial roles (which often includes titles like "Producer" or "Development Director") or people who developed a concept without doing actual design work on the game itself (sometimes applicable to "co-creator" or "creator" roles). Just because a game is listed next to a designer's name does not imply that person was the sole designer. As with films, the credits for video games can be complicated.

[[Frank Weston Benson]] made paintings, drawings and etchings of '''Wildlife'''. He also made portraits, waterscapes, landscapes, interiors and other works of art.

Benson, an avid [[birdwatching|birdwatcher]] and hunter from a young age, spent nearly every non-winter weekend hunting or fishing.&lt;ref name=Bedford17&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford, 17.]]&lt;/ref&gt; He initially became interested in painting to capture the [[wildlife]] he enjoyed, particularly birds.&lt;ref name=Bedford8&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford, 8.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Benson's interest in painting initially grew out of his desire to be an [[ornithology|ornithological]] illustrator. As a teenager, he spent the spring, summer and fall outdoors nearly every weekend bird watching, hunting or fishing.&lt;ref name="Bedford17"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bedford8&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford, 8.]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892 Benson bought a hunting shack on [[Cape Cod]] with his brothers-in-law, Edward Peirson and Maurice Richardson. ''Swan Flight'', exhibited at the St. Botolph Club in 1893, was Benson's first known exhibition of [[Anatidae|wildfowl]].&lt;ref name=Bedford263&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford, 263.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Entering the turn of the century wildfowl was not a marketable subject, but once he began creating and exhibiting his works the wildfowl paintings always sold.&lt;ref name=Bedford26&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford]], 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson, a sportsman at heart, had a solid body of work of [[wildlife]] scenes and birds, generally [[Anseriformes|waterfowl]]. His works included oil paintings, watercolors, etchings and drypoint.

Benson made ''Swan Flight'', a group of wild swans in formation against a gray sky from the [[Cape Cod]] hunting cabin off of Nauset that he bought with his brothers-in-law. It was the first work he exhibited of wildfowl, a subject matter that Benson explored over the years of his artistic career. The painting was sold soon after it was completed, a dynamic that continued throughout his career. To a New York dealer, Benson once expressed: "I made a [painting of a wildfowl] the other day at home and I looked forward to exhibiting it and, almost before it was dry, a visitor saw it and carried it off! It’s my good fortune to be doing what people like, but it keeps me on the jump."&lt;ref name=Bedford26/&gt; 4

Early Morning" is the culmination of Benson's appreciation of birds and Japanese composition, which was popular both in Boston and Paris. The silhouetted images of the birds flying over water is similar to the Japanese screen by Maruyama Ōkyo "Geese Flying over a Beach". One of Benson's early interests was depiction of the bird life near Salem; His first oil paintings are still lifes of birds. Benson may have seen that screen at Boston importer Bunkyo Matsuki's shop or the Matsuki home in Salem before it was purchased by Charles Freer in 1898. Having seen the work at a New York exhibition in 1900, a [[New York Times]] critic noted that it was "especially good… with the ducks in flight and the gray expanse of marsh and sky rose-flushed in the east with the dawn."&lt;ref&gt;[[#BMA|''Early Morning'', Boston Museum of Art.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The restaurant's founder was originally a tour guide of Natchez's nearby [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] mansions and she believed tourists would also be interested in this type of restaurant.&lt;ref name="Roadside"/&gt; Also a mammy character had been portrayed in the very popular 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', about the same time plans for the restaurant were being made.&lt;ref name="Roadside"/&gt; During the [[American Civil Rights Movement|Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s the Mammy's skin was repainted a lighter shade.&lt;ref name="Roadside"/&gt; The current owner said of the Mammy, "There is honor in everything you do and for those who have young people.

The author of ''Crossings: A White Man's Journey Into Black America'' described the restaurant as "a massive statue&amp;mdash;twenty-eight feet [8.5 m] high&amp;mdash;of a black woman dressed like [[Aunt Jemima]], wearing a red scarf, a white blouse, and a red hoopskirt that actually houses a restaurant",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crossings: a white man's journey into Black America |last=Harrington |first=Walt |year=1999 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=978-0-8262-1259-7 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoWIyPvjLrwC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=mammy%27s+cupboard&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=id5sToiQKuGCsgKLud3kBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=mammy%27s%20cupboard&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the authors of ''Frommer's USA'' said that if you want to visit the restaurant, "you need to check your political correctness at the door".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Frommer's USA |last=Warnock |first=Kathleen |author2=Kraus, Naomi |year=2009 |publisher=Frommer's |isbn=978-0-470-38746-7 |page=435 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEMImk1MFM0C&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=mammy%27s+cupboard+political+correctness&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mvJsTobCJbSPsALquIzVBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mammy%27s%20cupboard%20political%20correctness&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant's homemade pie was covered in the book ''American Pie''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Pie: Slices of Life (and Pie) from America's Back Roads |last=Le Draoulec |first=Pascale |year=2003 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-095732-2 |pages=82–84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbvN1zlFDu0C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=mammy%27s+cupboard+pie&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MO9sTo7LHu2FsgLzudS2CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mammy%27s%20cupboard%20pie&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the newspaper ''[[The Press Democrat]]'' for [[National Pie Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20090121/LIFESTYLE/901210305?Title=Rejoice__It_s_National_Pie_Day |title=Rejoice!

'''''Men of the Docks''''' is an [[oil painting]] on canvas completed by the American artist [[George Bellows]] in 1912. Depicting the docks of [[New York City]], this {{convert|114.3|by|161.3|cm|adj=on}} painting was sold to the [[National Gallery]] in London in 2014 for $25.5 million.

==Description==
''Men of the Docks'' is a  {{convert|114.3|by|161.3|cm|adj=on}} [[oil painting]] on canvas.&lt;ref name="NatGat1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Key Facts |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/george-bellows-men-of-the-docks/*/key-facts |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VA9lE7F9?url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/george-bellows-men-of-the-docks/*/key-facts |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |publisher=National Gallery, London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a group of men, wearing overcoats smeared in grime, standing at a dock in [[Brooklyn]] together with some [[draft horse]]s. These men appear to be [[day labor]]ers, at the docks to find work. They look to the left, as if receiving a message, while a large steam liner looms over them to their right. Behind them are a [[tugboat]] and the waters and ice floes of the harbor in winter. Further behind them are the skyscrapers of the lower [[Manhattan]] skyline. The winter weather about them is bleak and gray.&lt;ref name="NatGal2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/george-bellows-men-of-the-docks |title=George Bellows, Men of the Docks |publisher=National Gallery |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VAA1GjiJ?url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/george-bellows-men-of-the-docks |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Craftsman"/&gt;

A writer for ''[[The Craftsman (magazine)|The Craftsman]]'' considered ''Men of the Docks'' to be "free of affectation of soul or technique", presenting a situation of solidity the way a normal man would see it, thus holding onto the scene through reality.&lt;ref name="Craftsman"/&gt; However, the art critics Robert W. Snyder and Rebecca Zurier consider the painting to leave viewers in suspense as to the exact nature of the message received by this group of men, whether it is news that no work is available or notice that the men can begin their labor. This tension, they write, paired with the juxtaposition of the skyline and harbor (almost hidden from land), emphasizes the precariousness of the laborers' situation.&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt;

==Completion==
[[File:George bellows.jpg|thumb|[[George Bellows]], {{circa}} 1900]]
The artist, [[George Bellows]], arrived in New York City in 1904.&lt;ref name="NatGal2"/&gt; He completed ''Men of the Docks'' in 1912.&lt;ref name="NatGat1"/&gt; At the time the [[Ashcan School]], a group of painters who focused on the daily life in New York, was prominent. Bellows, and ''Men of the Docks'', has been considered part of this [[art movement|movement]].&lt;ref name="Franham"/&gt;

In the early 20th century, day laborers in the New York docks worked depending on the availability of ships to unload, and thus when not working they often stood nearby, waiting for news that there was work.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{cite book |title=Metropolitan Lives: The Ashcan Artists and Their New York |last1=Snyder |first1=Robert W. |first2=Rebecca  |last2=Zurier |chapter=Picturing the City |pages=97–98 |isbn=978-0-937311-27-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaEWfZr3A1EC |publisher=National Museum of American Art |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subject of men at the New York docks was a common one for Bellows, as well as fellow Ashcan painters such as [[Everett Shinn]]. ''Men of the Docks'' is the largest example of Bellows' treatment of the subject.&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

==Provenance==
''Men of the Docks'' was exhibited at the Vanderbilt Gallery of the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1912,&lt;ref name="Meltzer"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=The World To-day: A Monthly Record of Human Progress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvQzAQAAMAAJ|volume=21 |date=May 1912 |title=Art at our National Academy |last=Meltzer |first=Charles Henry |pages=2291–94 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Cornell Alumni News |issue=32 |title=Exhibition of Paintings |volume=15 |page=380 |year=May 1913 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RaxDAQAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellows again exhibited the work at the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] of 1915, winning a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia |issn=0195-8798 |page=204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ceFKAAAAYAAJ |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=1920 |editor1=Lindsay Rogers |editor2=James S. Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was purchased for the [[Maier Museum of Art]] at [[Randolph Macon Woman's College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], in 1920; at the time, the college was one of the foremost for women intent on studying art. At the recommendation of Professor [[Louise Jordan Smith]], students and locals raised $2,500 to purchase the work. Beginning with this painting, the Maier collection eventually grew to include 3,500 works.&lt;ref name="Conant"/&gt;

After the 1980s, Randolph College faced decreasing enrollment and financial difficulties. As such, in 2007 it decided to sell four of its works&amp;nbsp;– including ''Men of the Docks''. All of these works were taken from the Maier Museum in late 2007. Bellows' painting was scheduled to be auctioned at [[Christie's]] in New York, and expected to sell for $25–35 million. This would have been a record for an American painting sold at auction.&lt;ref name="Franham"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/1126/218.html |last=Franham |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VA5F17v9?url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/1126/218.html |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |first=Alan |work=Forbes |title=Ashcan on Fire |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |date=November 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this prospective sale faced controversy at the college. Students made "Missing" posters overlaid showing photocopies of ''Men of the Docks'' and the three other paintings which were to be sold.&lt;ref name="Conant"&gt;{{cite web|last=Conant |first=Eve |date=October 9, 2007 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/42498 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VA5ZAPR0?url=http://www.newsweek.com/shot-through-art-103439 |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |title=A Shot Through the Art |work=[[Newsweek]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawsuit against the sale continued over the next several years, with detractors including the Association of Academic Museums and Galleries, the [[College Art Association]], and the [[Association of Art Museum Directors]]. As the art market deflated, a Virginia judge blocked the sale in November 2007, but in March 2008 opponents of the sale had to drop their suit as they were unable to post the $1&amp;nbsp;million bond required of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lookingaround.blogs.time.com/2008/03/10/maier/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VA6XgcAi?url=http://entertainment.time.com/2008/03/10/maier/ |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |last=Lacayo |first=Richard |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=Look Out Bellows – Looking Around |date=March 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the painting was lent to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., to be included in a comprehensive exhibition of Bellow's career. This exhibition later continued on to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, and the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920215452/http://www.nga.gov/press/exh/2835/2835_list.pdf |url=http://www.nga.gov/press/exh/2835/2835_list.pdf |date=July 17, 2012 |title=George Bellows; June 10, 2012&amp;nbsp;– October 8, 2012 |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |archivedate= September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Bellows June 10 – October 8, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VA7H6KkB?url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/bellowsinfo.shtm |url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/bellowsinfo.shtm |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |publisher=National Gallery of Art |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, ''Men of the Docks'' was bought by the [[National Gallery]] in London in February 2014 for a total of $25.5&amp;nbsp;million (£15.6&amp;nbsp;million). The money was acquired from a fund established by [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|Sir John Paul Getty]]. Director [[Nicholas Penny]], said that the painting was a new direction for the gallery, as a non-European painting in a European style.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt; The museum also touted a “new, transatlantic academic partnership, the first of its kind between an American college and a UK gallery” established by the sale, in which curators could lecture at Randolph and students of the college could do their internships at the National Gallery.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/national-gallery-spends-255m-on-george-bellows-men-of-the-docks--its-first-major-american-painting-9113161.html |work=The Independent |title=National Gallery spends $25.5m on George Bellows' Men of the Docks&amp;nbsp;– its first major American painting |last=Clark |first=Nick |date=February 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VAC3U9kb?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/national-gallery-spends-255m-on-george-bellows-men-of-the-docks--its-first-major-american-painting-9113161.html |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Bellows Painting Moves From Virginia to London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330205502/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/arts/design/a-bellows-painting-moves-from-virginia-to-london.html?_r=0 |archivedate=March 30, 2014 |last=Vogel |first=Carol |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |date=February 6, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/arts/design/a-bellows-painting-moves-from-virginia-to-london.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critic Charles Henry Meltzer, reviewing after the National Academy exhibition, described ''Men of the Docks'' as "irritating ... yet full of talent" owing to its "deliberate carelessness" in the drawing of the crowd, which he found to have character.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; The writer for ''The Craftsman'' found the painting to be "an important painting of the year", "a freshly painted canvas&amp;nbsp;... presented with the thrill and wonder inherent in the edges of great seaport towns".&lt;ref name="Craftsman"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Craftsman |pages=129–30 |title=The Spring Academy: Its Tendencies and Successes| volume=22 |issue=2 |date=May 1912 |oclc=1565375 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yY1AAQAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Porter of Christie's described ''Men of the Docks'' as "the definitive essay on the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century. It’s big, brawny, tough."&lt;ref name="Franham"/&gt; Alan Franham of ''[[Forbes]]'' called it "a class by itself", noting that, as opposed to the work's value of millions of dollars, prints by the artist could be bought for $50,000.&lt;ref name="Franham"/&gt; The curator Christopher Riopelle considers the painting to "evoke something of the raw and unbeautiful energy of the urban experience in what was at the time one of the world's fastest-growing cities" through its "wilful awkwardness and brutality".&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5350">{{about|the form of lyrical verse}}
An '''ode''' (from {{lang-grc|ᾠδή|ōdḗ}}) is a type of [[lyric poetry|lyrical stanza]]. It is an elaborately structured [[poem]] praising or glorifying an event or individual, describing nature intellectually as well as emotionally. A classic ode is structured in three major parts: the ''[[strophe]]'', the ''[[antistrophe]]'', and the ''[[epode]]''. Different forms such as the ''homostrophic ode'' and the ''irregular ode'' also exist.

Greek odes were originally poetic pieces performed with musical accompaniment. As time passed on, they gradually became known as personal lyrical compositions whether sung (with or without musical instruments) or merely recited (always with accompaniment). The primary instruments used were the [[aulos]] and the [[lyre]] (the latter was the most revered instrument to the [[ancient Greeks]]).

There are three typical forms of odes: the Pindaric, Horatian, and irregular. Pindaric odes follow the form and style of [[Pindar]]. Horatian odes follow conventions of [[Horace]]; the [[Odes (Horace)|odes of Horace]] deliberately imitated the Greek lyricists such as [[Alcaeus (poet)|Alcaeus]] and [[Anacreon]]. Irregular odes use rhyme, but not the three-part form of the Pindaric ode, nor the two- or four-line [[stanza]] of the Horatian ode. The ode is a lyric poem. It conveys exalted and inspired emotions. It is a lyric in an elaborate form, expressed in a language that is imaginative, dignified and sincere. Like the lyric, an ode is of Greek origin.

==English ode==

The lyrics can be on various themes. The earliest odes in the English language, using the word in its strict form, were the ''Epithalamium'' and ''Prothalamium'' of [[Edmund Spenser]].

In the 17th century, the most important original odes in English are by [[Abraham Cowley]]. These were [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]], but had irregular line length patterns and rhyme schemes. Cowley based the principle of his [[Pindariques]] on an apparent misunderstanding of Pindar's metrical practice but, nonetheless, others widely imitated his style, with notable success by [[John Dryden]].

With Pindar's metre being better understood in the 18th century, the fashion for Pindaric odes faded, though there are notable actual Pindaric odes by [[Thomas Gray]], [http://www.thomasgray.org/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=pppo ''The Progress of Poesy''] and [http://www.thomasgray.org/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=bapo ''The Bard''].

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight,
To me did seem
Apparelled in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hath been of yore;—
Turn wheresoe'er I may,
By night or day,
The things which I have seen I now can see no more....
Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,
Hath had elsewhere its setting,
And cometh from afar:
Not in entire forgetfulness,
And not in utter nakedness,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come
From God, who is our home...
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(Excerpt from Wordsworth's ''Intimations of Immortality'')

Around 1800, [[William Wordsworth]] revived Cowley's  Pindarick for one of his finest poems, the ''[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality|Intimations of Immortality]]'' ode. Others also wrote odes: [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] who wrote odes with regular stanza patterns. Shelley's ''[[Ode to the West Wind]]'', written in fourteen line [[terza rima]] stanzas, is a major poem in the form. Perhaps the greatest odes of the 19th century, however, were Keats's ''Five Great Odes of 1819'', which included "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]", "[[Ode on Melancholy]]", "[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]", "[[Ode to Psyche]]", and "[[To Autumn]]". After Keats, there have been comparatively few major odes in English. One major exception is the fourth verse of the poem ''[[Ode of Remembrance|For the Fallen]]'' by [[Laurence Binyon]], which is often known as ''The Ode to the Fallen'', or simply as ''The Ode''.

W.H. Auden also wrote ''Ode'', one of the most popular poems from his earlier career when he lived in London, in opposition to people's ignorance over the reality of war. In an interview, Auden once stated that he had intended to title the poem ''My Silver Age'' in mockery of the supposedly imperial Golden age, however chose ''Ode'' as it seemed to provide a more sensitive exploration of warfare.

''Ode on a Grecian Urn'', while an ekphrasis, also functions as an ode to the artistic beauty the narrator observes. The English ode's most common [[rhyme scheme]] is ABABCDECDE.

The '''Prix de Rome''' ({{IPA-fr|pʁi də ʁɔm|pron}}) or '''Grand Prix de Rome'''&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Grand orx}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French scholarship for arts students, initially for painters and sculptors, that was established in 1663 during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France]]. Winners were awarded a bursary that allowed them to stay in Rome for three to five years at the expense of the state. The prize was extended to architecture in 1720, music in 1803, and engraving in 1804. The prestigious award was abolished in 1968 by [[André Malraux]], the Minister of Culture.

==History==
The Prix de Rome was initially created for painters and sculptors in 1663 in France during the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. It was an annual [[bursary]] for promising artists having proved their talents by completing a very difficult elimination contest. The prize, organised by the ''[[Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture]]'' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture), was open to their students. From 1666, the award winner could win a stay of three to five years at the [[Palazzo Mancini]] in Rome at the expense of the King of France. In 1720, the Académie Royale d’Architecture began a prize in architecture. Six painters, four sculptors, and two architects&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S. "Prix de Rome", ''Grove Dictionary of Art online''&lt;/ref&gt; would be sent to the [[French Academy in Rome]] founded by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] from 1666.

Expanded after 140 years into five categories, the contest started in 1663 as two categories: painting and sculpture.  Architecture was added in 1720.  In 1803, music was added, and after 1804 there was a ''prix'' for engraving as well. The primary winner took the "First Grand Prize" (called the ''agréé'')&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael. ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Second Prizes" were awarded to the runners-up.

In 1803, [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] moved the French Academy in Rome to the [[Villa Medici]] with the intention of preserving an institution once threatened by the [[French Revolution]]. At first, the villa and its gardens were in a sad state, and they had to be renovated in order to house the winners of the Prix de Rome. In this way, he hoped to retain for young French artists the opportunity to see and copy the masterpieces of antiquity and the Renaissance.

[[Jacques-Louis David]], having failed to win the prize three years in a row, considered suicide. [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Ernest Chausson]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] attempted the Prix de Rome, but did not gain recognition.  Ravel tried a total of five times to win the prize, and the last failed attempt in 1905 was so controversial that it led to a complete reorganization of the administration at the [[Paris Conservatory]].

During World War II (1939–45) the prize winners were accommodated in the [[Villa Paradiso]] in Nice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://enligne.cg06.fr/jean-moulin/bottaro.html|last=Moulin|first=Jean|year=2014|publisher=Conseil général des Alpes-Maritimes|title=Nice, cité-refuge ?|accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Prix de Rome was abolished in 1968 by [[André Malraux]], who was Minister of Culture at the time. Since then, a number of contests have been created, and the academies, together with the [[Institut de France]], were merged by the State and the Minister of Culture. Selected residents now have an opportunity for study during an 18-month (sometimes 2-year) stay at The Academy of France in Rome, which is accommodated in the Villa Medici.

The heyday of the Prix de Rome was during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, ''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; It was later imitated by the [[Abd-el-Tif prize|Prix Abd-el-Tif]] and the [[Villa Abd-el-Tif]] in Algiers, 1907–1961, and later [[Prix d'Indochine]] including a bursary to visit the [[École des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]] in [[Hanoi]], 1920–1939, and bursary for residence at the [[Casa de Velázquez]] in Madrid, 1929–present.

&lt;ref name=Foot1A&gt;Though sent to Rome in 1741.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot01&gt;"After the students present for the architecture competition left, only eight returned to make an ''esquisse'', but none were admitted to continue"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot2A&gt;Noted as Jollivet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot02&gt;Carried over from 1757.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name=Foot03&gt;From 1767 through 1772, the winners of the Prix de Rome were deprived of the usual scholarship that funded their trips to Rome; this occurred because of the vengeance exacted by [[Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]] in an enormous abuse of his power. Having quarreled with the Académie d'Architecture, Poisson de Vendières sent his personal manservants instead to Rome instead of the winners of the Grand Prix.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot04&gt;Carried over from 1771.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot05&gt;In 1773 the funding for the scholarship to Rome was reestablished for architects through the generosity of the Abbé Terray, successor of the Marquis de Marigny.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot06&gt;1775 was the last year that a third prize (Troisieme Prix) was awarded.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot07&gt;Carried over from 1778.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot8A&gt;Fontaine would never win the Prix de Rome; however, a space at the Mancini Palace opened up in 1787 due to the delay in awarding the prize for that year, and Fontaine became the resident ''pensionnaire'', remaining in Rome until 1790.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot08&gt;Carried over from 1787.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot9A&gt;"The projected entrants boycotted the contest by renouncing their status of students until the Académie adopted the changes they demanded in the old regulations.''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot09&gt;From 1794–96 no competitions were held, since the Académies established by the Ancien Régime had been abolished by the Republican government. They were re-established by decree of 28 October 1796 under a new body known as the [[Institut de France]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prix de Rome (Netherlands)==
{{main article|Prix de Rome (Netherlands)}}

A Prix de Rome was also established in the [[Kingdom of Holland]] by [[Louis Bonaparte|Lodewijk Napoleon]] to award young artists and architects. During the years 1807–1810 prize winners were sent to Paris and onwards to Rome for study. In 1817, after the [[Netherlands]] had gained its independence, [[William I of the Netherlands|King Willem I]] restarted the prize; though it took until 1823 before the new "Royal Academies" of Amsterdam and Antwerp could organize the juries. Suspended in 1851 it was reinstated in 1870 by [[William III of the Netherlands]]. Since then the winners have been selected by the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam under the main headings of architecture and the visual arts.

==Prix de Rome (Belgium)==
{{main article|Prix de Rome (Belgium)}}

The Belgian Prix de Rome (Dutch: Prijs van Rome) is an award for young artists, created in 1832, following the example of the original French Prix de Rome. The [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp]] organised the prize until 1920, when the national government took over. The first prize is also sometimes called the Grand Prix de Rome. There were distinct categories for architecture, painting, sculpture and music.

[[File:Sachets déshydratants sodepac.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Sachets containing [[desiccant]]s]]
A '''sachet''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|ʃ|eɪ|}} is a small cloth scented bag filled with [[herb]]s, [[potpourri]], or [[Aroma compound|aromatic ingredients]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmonds, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duff, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Small+municipalities&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]. ''"small perfumed bag," 1838, from Fr. sachet (12c.), dim. of sac (see sac). A reborrowing of a word that had been used 15c. in the sense "small bag, wallet."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oster54"&gt;Oster, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; A sachet is also a small porous bag or [[packet (container)|packet]] containing a material intended to interact with its atmosphere;  for example, [[desiccant]]s are usually packed in sachets which are then placed in larger packages.

A sachet can be defined as a small soft bag containing perfumed or sweet-smelling items also referred to as an ''ascent bag,'' ''scent bag'', ''sweet bag'', ''sachet bag'', ''sachet de senteurs'', ''spiced sachet'', ''potpourri sachet'', ''scented sachet'', ''perfume cushion'', ''smelling cushion'', ''scented cushion'', ''fragrant bag'', ''pomander'' and "dream pillow."&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, p. 4080&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweringen, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gasc, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tibbins, p. 943&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="remedies"&gt;[http://www.superbherbs.net/remedies3.htm Natural Remedies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CulturalChina"&gt;[http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions337.html Cultural China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822202747/http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions337.html |date=2010-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural history ==
During the Chinese [[Warring States period]] a scented sachet was an ornament worn on the body and used to absorb sweat, repel insects and ward off evils.&lt;ref name="CulturalChina"/&gt; In the [[Han Dynasty]] both boys and girls wore sachets and in the [[Tang Dynasty]] and [[Song Dynasty]] scented bags gradually became preferred only by women.&lt;ref name="CulturalChina"/&gt;  A scented sachet became a love token in the [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="CulturalChina"/&gt; 

In medieval Europe the sachet was known as a "plague-bag". These were generally  worn around the neck, or dangled from the waist. It was believed that they provided protection against [[parasites]] and [[Miasma theory|miasma]]ta. These "sachets" contained sweet powders, [[Acorus calamus|aromatic calamus]], [[Benzoin (resin)|benzoin]], [[storax]], [[galingale (disambiguation)|galingale]], [[cloves]], and other fragrances from a herb or flower garden.&lt;ref name="Hemphill2426"&gt;Hemphill, pp. 24-26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella of Spain]] used fragrant sachets consisting of dried [[rose]] and [[carnation]] petals, [[Orris root|orris]] and [[Acorus calamus|calamus]] root, and other ingredients like powdered [[coriander]] seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century a sachet filled with [[hops]] was called a "''Pulvinar Humuli''" and used by [[George III of Great Britain]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg]] to help induce sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Gutenberg ebook  [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19352/19352-8.txt Herbal Simples Approved for Modern Uses of Cure]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, a small cloth bag filled with [[potpourri]] may be laid among garments in a [[Chest of drawers|dresser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sachet Merriam-Webster definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Scented sachets are for containing odorous substances to be laid among handkerchiefs to perfume them. They are also used to make [[undergarment]]s and outer garments sweet smelling as well as placed amongst [[linens]].&lt;ref&gt;Fettner, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Scented sachets are also hung in closets and cupboards. They are also put into briefcases and luggage. Some are used in stationary packets and others are put under pillows to help one sleep.&lt;ref name="Hemphill2426"/&gt; Scented sachets are "sweet bags" (an old name for a small sachet cloth bag) and are put in automobiles, [[clothes dryer]]s, clothes closets, inside or about children's stuffed animals, on the backs of chairs, and on doorknobs.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;
Sachets with herbs like hops and lavender act as a sedative.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, pp. 322, 333&lt;/ref&gt; These type of sachets are often put in closets and dresser drawers for their scents.&lt;ref&gt;Sisko, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Some "dream pillow" types of scented sachets (i.e. "hop pillows") are made with sleep inducing ingredients like [[humulus|hops]], [[chamomile]], [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]], [[Scutellaria|skullcap]], and [[lavender]] that help promote sleep.&lt;ref name="remedies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garland, p. 268 ''Pillows stuffed with dried hops are an old treatment for insomnia.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chopra, p. 40 ''A sachet of hops is traditionally placed under a child's pillow to deliver sleep-inducing aromatherapy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lust, p. 370 ''A small pillow filled with dried hops and slept on is a well-known folk remedy in many European countries for inducing a calm, restful sleep.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HerbalPot-Pourris"&gt;[http://flagandpennants.net/how-to-make-herbal-pot-pourris-sachets-and-pillows How To Make Herbal Pot-Pourris, Sachets And Pillows]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmersmarketonline.com/howto23.htm Here's How To Make a Dream Pillow] ''Dream pillows are used to promote restful sleep and pleasant dreams. They are small and flat, placed in a standard pillow, and stuffed with a sachet of calming and sleep-inducing dried herbs... George Washington reportedly used one filled with hops...''&lt;/ref&gt; These scented sachets of aromatic herbs are also referred to as "herb pillows" or "sleep pillows" and are designed to overcome sleeplessness.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, p. 123 ''The "herb pillows" of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (little sacks of aromatic herbs thought to be a remedy for sleeplessness) always included lavender, clovepinks and costmary as principal ingredients.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 111 ''There are several herbs that have a reputation for easing insomnia, and by creating a blend of these leaves and flowers, you can make small "herb pillows" to help you sleep.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy-Hiscock, p. 159 ''Sweet Dream Pillow - This pillow is designed to encourage relaxation and soothe restless sleep.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klru.org/ctg/resource/Article/Dream_Pillows/ Dream Pillows]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caldwellpl.org/ajax/ajax.php?q=making-herb-pillows Making herbal pillows]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalexchangestore.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=NA5568&amp;gdftrk=gdfV2932_a_7c135_a_7c313_a_7cNA5568 Dream Pillows]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ram's 1606 booklet ''Little Dodoen'' gave a sachet formula to take to bed to help one sleep:
{{cquote|''Take dry rose leaves keep them in a glass which will keep them sweet and then take powder of mints, powder of cloves in a grosse powder. Put the same to the Rose leaves then put all these together in a bag and take that to bed with you and it will cause you to sleep, and it is good to smell unto at other times.''&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Certain herbs used in these type sachet "sleep pillows", like hops, have a soporific and a slight narcotic effect.&lt;ref name="Garland229"&gt;Garland, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; These herb filled sachets are even called "dreamtime pillows".&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; There are formulas using rosemary seeds to fill sachets and these are to be hung in a bedroom to promote sleep.&lt;ref name="Garland229"/&gt;  The traditional method to treat insomnia with herb filled sachets of hops or lavender is to place them in, under or near your sleeping pillow.&lt;ref&gt;Calbom, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitrea, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kothe, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The "dream pillow" or "sleep pillow" sachet concept has been used for decades to help overcome sleeplessness.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; These "sleep pillows" have a therapeutic effect and hops as an ingredient to this type of sachet are considered best at inducing sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Oster, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; One type of "sleep pillow" sachet recipe by herb and flower author Penny Black calls for violets, rose petals, rosemary, tonka bean, vanilla bean, and a drop of lemon oil.&lt;ref&gt;Black, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Scented sachets are many times homemade and come in many sizes, styles, shapes and fragrances. A typical size would be approximately 4&amp;nbsp;inches square or thereabouts - some as small as a one-inch ball and others as large as an 8&amp;nbsp;inch square.&lt;ref name="remedies"/&gt; Many are in the shape of a plump little pillow.&lt;ref&gt;Black, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The [[potpourri]] mix put inside the sachet can be herbal items or flower parts.&lt;ref&gt;Black, pp. 57-71&lt;/ref&gt; Some sachets that are made from spices like [[allspice]], [[anise]]ed, [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, [[nutmeg]], and [[vanilla bean]]s are referred to as "spiced sachets."&lt;ref&gt;Seton, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; A scented sachet used as a pot holder that is stuffed with allspice, cinnamon and cloves will release an apple pie smell when a hot dish is put on it.&lt;ref name="remedies"/&gt;

Other scented sachets are made from the [[winter savory]], [[lavender]], [[rosemary]], tops of [[hyssop]], chippings of ''cassia ligna'', [[Cedar wood|cedar]], and [[sassafras]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; This type is not only used to make garments sweet smelling but keep away destructive insects and worms.&lt;ref name="Cox259"&gt;Cox, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Sachets with dried moth-repellent herbs like wormwood, southernwood, costmary, lavender, pennyroyal, lemon verbena rosemary, rue, sage and tansy are called "moth bags."&lt;ref name="Oster54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garland, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

A sachet base can be made where you can add certain aromatic or perfumed oils later to make various sachets. Some types of sachets are called "Patchouli Sachet" (that goes with woolens and blankets); "Florida Sachet" (which ingredients are fruity); "Oakasia Sachet"; "Orange-rose Sachet"; and "Sweet Bag of linen".&lt;ref&gt;Strobell, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Some scented sachets even have names like ""Heliotrope Sachet" and "Tonka Bean Sachet." &lt;ref&gt;Freeman, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Others still are called "Provencal pillows", "Country pillows" and "Pillows for Love".&lt;ref name="Garland229"/&gt;

Some are even made into Sweet Bag necklaces.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Some are decorated with embroidery, beads, buttons, ribbons, and fancy cloth. The oldest formula printed for a list of ingredients in an America scented sacket comes from a Colonial Williamsburg book, [[The Compleat Housewife]], published in 1742.&lt;ref&gt;Fettner, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Signum manus''''' (sometimes also known as ''Chrismon'') refers to the medieval practice, current from the [[Merovingian period]] until the 14th century in the [[Frankish Empire]] and its successors, of signing a document or charter with a special type of [[monogram]] or [[royal cypher]].

The term ''Chrismon'' was introduced in [[New Latin]] specifically as a term for the [[Chi Rho]] monogram. As this symbol was used in Merovingian documents at the starting point of what would diversify into the tradition of "cross-signatures", German scholarship of the 18th century extended use of the term ''Chrismon'' to the entire field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/MKL1888:Chrismon Chrismon] in ''Meyers Konversations-Lexikon'' 4th ed. (1888/9).&lt;/ref&gt; In medievalist [[paleography]] and ''Diplomatik'' (''ars diplomaticae'', i.e. the study of [[:wikt:diploma#Latin|documents or charters]]), the study of these signatures or sigils was known as ''Chrismologia'' or ''Chrismenlehre'', while the study of [[Christian cross variants|cross variants]] was known as ''Staurologia''.&lt;ref&gt;from ''[[stauros]]'' "stake, cross"; the same term ''Staurologia'' in a different context may also refer to the field of [[Theology of the Cross]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chrismon'' in this context may refer to the [[Merovingian period]] abbreviation ''I. C. N.'' for ''in Christi nomine'', later (in the [[Carolingian period]]) also ''I. C.'' for ''in Christo'', and still later (in the high medieval period) just ''C.'' for ''Christus''.&lt;ref&gt;  Gatterer (1798), 
[https://books.google.ch/books?id=NaRAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA64  p. 64f].&lt;/ref&gt;

A cross symbol was often drawn as an invocation at the beginning of documents in the early medieval West. 
At the end of documents, commissioners or witnesses would sign with a ''signum manus'', often also in the form of a simple cross. This practice is widespread in Merovingian documents of the 7th and 8th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:161f)&lt;/ref&gt; A related development is the widespread use of the cross symbol on the obverse side of early medieval coins, interpreted as the ''signum manus'' of the moneyer.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:163f)&lt;/ref&gt;
The tradition of minting coins with the monogram of the ruling monarch on the obverse side originates in the 5th century, both in Byzantium and in Rome. This tradition was continued in the 6th century by Germanic kings, including the Merovingians. These early designs were ''box'' monograms. The first ''cruciform'' monogram was used by [[Justinian I]] in the 560s. [[Tiberius III]] used a cruciform monogram with the letters ''R, M'' for Rome and ''T, B'' for Tiberius; [[Pope Gregory III]] used the letters ''G, R, E, O''.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:173)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest surviving Merovingian royal charters, dating to the 7th century, have the box monograms of [[Chlothar II]] and [[Clovis II]].&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:167)&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 7th century, the use of royal monograms was abandoned entirely by the Merovingian kings; instead, royal wax seals were first attached to the documents, and the kings would sign their name in full.

The ''signum manus'' in the form of a modified cross symbol first appears in charters of both Frankish Gaul and Anglo-Saxon England in the late 7th and early 8th century. [[Charlemagne]]  first used his cruciform monogram, likely inspired by the earlier papal monograms, in 769, and he would continue to use it for the rest of his reign. The monogram spells ''KAROLVS'', with the 
consonants ''K, R, L, S'' at the ends of the cross-arms, and the vowels ''A, O, V'' displayed in ligature at the center.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:172)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Louis the Pious]] abandoned the cross monogram, using again a H-type or box monogram.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:182)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''So Young''''' ({{zh|t=致我們終將逝去的青春|s=致我们终将逝去的青春}}) is a 2013 Chinese drama film directed by [[Zhao Wei]]. It is based on the best-selling novel of the same name ''To Our Youth that is Fading Away'' by Xin Yiwu. The film is Zhao's [[directorial debut]].

The film's English-language title alludes to the song ''[[So Young (Suede song)|So Young]]'' by the British alternative rock band [[Suede (band)|Suede]] from their [[Suede (album)|self-titled debut album]]. In addition to the novel, the film was also based in part by Zhao's own personal college experience in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/china-box-office-gi-joe-443910|title=China Box Office: ‘G.I.

==Plot==
Zheng Wei starts her college freshman year as a civil engineer major to be in the same city as her childhood playmate, Lin Jing, whom she is determined to marry one day. When Wei visits Jing at his college dormitory however, Jing's roommate tells her Jing left for America. Unable to understand why Jing abruptly left without saying goodbye, Wei is left confused and heartbroken.

Back in her college dormitory, Wei becomes close friends with her three roommates, Ruan Guan, the most beautiful and popular girl in the class; Li Weijuan, a practical and realistic girl who comes from a poor town but determined to marry well; and Zhu Xiaobei, a tomboy. The four girls talk about their goals in life, and all cheer to Ruan Guan's ambition—to have a youth that never fades away.

Wei is befriended by Lao Zhang and his roommate Xu Kaiyang, architecture majors, during the college clubs and activities fair. Kaiyang came from a well-to-do family and starts a romantic pursuit for Wei, but Wei only regards him as a friend. One evening Wei goes to Lao Zhang and Kaiyang's dorm room to borrow their DVDs. Wei is amazed and disgusted by the messy condition of the male dormroom, except one bed and corner that is uncannily neat and clean. Lao Zhang explains that this spot belongs to their disciplined and hardworking roommate, Chen Xiaozheng. Laozhang exits for a moment to find his DVDs, leaving Wei alone in the room. Wei sees a near finished building model on the table and curiously starts fumbling with the parts. At this moment Xiaozheng comes back and angrily yells out, "What are you doing?" Startled and swinging around to see yelled, Wei knocks the model off the table. Xiaozheng manages to save his model by shoving Wei out of the way, who falls in a mess to the floor. Enraged in humiliation, Wei angrily demands an apology from Xiaozheng, but Xiaozheng coolly replies that he has nothing to apologize for and that it was her fault for touching his model. From this moment, Wei becomes determined to repeatedly humiliate and bring trouble to Xiaozheng until she gets the apology she believes she deserves. Through her attempts Wei comes to the startling realization that in fact, she likes Xiaozheng. From Lao Zhang and Weijuan, Wei learns that Xiaozheng comes from a poor family and was raised by a strict mother, hence his aloof and disciplined personality. Wei declares her interest in Xiaozheng, then openly, relentlessly, and shamelessly stalks Xiaozheng to get his attention, much to his annoyance. Eventually, Xiaozheng, impressed by her enthusiasm, determination, and spirit finds that he has come to like Wei too, and the two start going together.

During the rest of their college life and relationship, Xiaozheng and Wei find that they have starkly contrasting personalities. Although he appreciates Wei's fiery enthusiastic personality, Xiaozheng also reprimands Wei at times for her laid-back and undisciplined attitude towards her coursework. Wei asks Xiaozheng why he is always so serious about everything. Xiaozheng replies, "I don't know what your attitude towards your life is, but my life is like a building that can only be built once, so I cannot afford any margin of error, not even a centimeter's width." Due to his family's modest financial circumstances, Xiaozheng feels that he needs to do anything and everything he can to ensure the best possible professional future for himself.

Eventually graduation comes upon Wei and Xiaozheng. At the on-campus recruitment and interview fair, Wei hopes she and Xiaozheng can find work at the same institute thus remain together. Unbeknownst to Wei, Xiaozheng has applied to and obtained a graduate fellowship to study architecture in America. When Wei finally learns of his plan, she confronts Xiaozheng to ask why she was the last one to know. Xiaozheng attempts to explain with difficulty that he could not tell her because he was afraid of hurting her and reiterates that he can not make any mistake in his life. He then apologizes, saying that he had to make this choice of leaving her to make a better future for himself.

A few years later, Wei has now become a mature professional who excels in her work, and is much different from her bygone youthful days. One day she suddenly encounters Lin Jing. Jing explains that he left abruptly because he learned his father was having an affair with Wei's mother, so he could not face Wei. He never went to America, but avoided contact with Wei.  The one time when he saw Wei on at her campus, she was happy with Xiaozheng. Now however, he wants to come back and rekindle their friendship and, if possible, romance. At this time, Xiaozheng also returns from America, now as a renowned and accomplished architect. Though he has everything professionally that he was determined to get, Xiaozheng finds the life that he has gained empty and crippled. He deeply regrets letting go of Wei, realizing his time with her was the only time he was himself, thus he also wants to rekindle their relationship. However, Wei on their first meeting firmly rejects Xiaocheng. Not long afterward, Ruan Guan is killed in a car accident when trying to meet her university boyfriend for one last time before she is getting married to another man. Wei, in grief, asks Lin Jing to marry her. However, she later calls it off when Lin Jing tells Wei about another girl that loved him during their time apart. Afterwards, Xiaocheng and Wei meet once more at the aquarium to reminisce. There Xiaozheng asks Wei, "Can I start over, and love you again?" to which Wei replies, "Xiaozheng, we spent our youth together, we owe each other nothing... youth is something you can only relive in memory."

Xin Yiwu, author of the novel, has mentioned that Zhao Wei was actually her choice to play the lead character of "Zheng Wei". However, Zhao declined the offer, and opted to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Clair (China Edition): February, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Mark Chao and Han Geng, a majority of the cast are newcomers, including Yang Zishan, who played the story's protagonist Zheng Wei.&lt;ref&gt;ELLE (China Edition): October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao stated, "They're very green and new. Sometimes they even lack common sense. But I like working with them because they're down-to-earth...What they lack in experience, they replace with enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.news.yahoo.com/vicki-zhao-confident-young-063700870.html Vicki Zhao confident with "So Young"].

==Production==
For this film, Zhao Wei intended to take the story in a panorama view to the life of college students in the 1990s, "not just a love triangle", "I'd like to devote this film to everyone out there who had a similar youth... It’s a memory shared by those who were born on the Chinese Mainland between the 1970s and early 80s."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeoutbeijing.com/features/Books__Film/20358/Preview-So-Young.html Preview: So Young].

==Reception==

===Critical response===
After the premiere of the film in Beijing, it has gained favorable reviews from critics and audience, and has been dubbed a "mature directorial debut".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ent.sina.com.cn/m/c/w/2013-04-22/10563905325.shtml 赵薇《致青春》获好评：成熟的处女作] Sina.com April 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also gained positive reviews from English-language critics. Dereke Elley of ''[[Film Business Asia]]'' gave the film a 7 out of 10,  describes the film as "an impressive directorial debut" and praised the film's "powerhouse first 90 minutes" as "that draw an involving portrait of love, friendship, ambition and broken dreams among a group of university students..." However, Elley criticized the last portion of the film, and states "as the film abruptly flashes forward several years to pick up the characters in the big city, all the dramatic credit accumulated to that point is squandered by a final 40 minutes that seem rushed and fabricated, with none of the earlier dramatic traction."  Elley summoned up "As a two-part movie running some three hours, ''So Young'' could have been a truly epic portrait of youthful emotional errors and their later consequences. As it stands, it's a remarkable directorial debut by Zhao that's well acted by its ensemble cast but is more of an ambitious, great-looking torso than a single movie." Elley also states "One can only hope that one day an extended Director's Cut of the film will eventually emerge on ancillary."&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/so-young|title=Review: So Young|publisher=''Film Business Asia''|date=16 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926025547/http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/so-young|archivedate=26 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maggie Lee of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as an "accomplished directing debut" and "a lyrical ode to youth at its most fearless and foolhardy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-so-young-1200491146/|title=So Young Review|work=Variety|date=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Kerr of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote "Anchored by an engaging performance by Yang Zishan in her first lead role, Zhao's film proves the actress turned director adept with images and actors." "The film’s first 90 minutes make for a complete enough film that the bloated, soapy final 40 become a distraction from Zhao and Li’s careful character construction earlier on. It’s been rumored that Zhao’s original cut clocked in at three hours, and so in that light the rushed, half-baked feel of the last act becomes clear. But even with more time the “adult” segment of the film feels out of place, tonally and stylistically. Thankfully Zhao makes the most of her cast, who carry the film farther than it has a right to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/young-film-review-563017|title=So Young: Film Review|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tay Huizhen of ''MovieXclusive'' (Singapore) gave the film a rating of 4.5/5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviexclusive.com/detail.php?c=42&amp;desc=S&amp;p=2393&amp;t=so-young-33268251052020432456235583689321435303403873826149-2013_2393|title=Review: So Young|publisher=MovieXclusive|date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún''''' is a book containing two [[narrative poem]]s and related texts composed by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. It was published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] and [[HarperCollins]] on 5 May 2009.

The two poems that make up most of the book were probably written during the 1930s, and were inspired by the legend of [[Sigurd]] and the fall of the [[Niflungs]] in [[Norse mythology]].{{clarify|reason=clarify on norse/germanic sources and naming|date=September 2018}} Both poems are in a form of [[alliterative verse]] inspired by the traditional verse of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century. [[Christopher Tolkien]] has added copious notes and commentary on his father's work.

==Plot==

===The New Lay of the Völsungs===

====Upphaf====
After the creation of the Nine Worlds by the [[Aesir]], the walls of [[Asgard]] are besieged by an army of [[jötunn]]s and [[troll]]s. Wielding the hammer [[Mjöllnir]], [[Thor]] succeeds in driving these "foes immortal" back to [[Jotunheim]]. However, there are new perils to come.

A female seer prophesies the apocalyptic battle of [[Ragnarök]] and speaks of how [[Odin]] shall be slain by the wolf [[Fenrir]] and Thor by the [[Midgard serpent]]. There is but one chance for the doom of the nine worlds to be averted. If on the day of battle a mortal warrior, a slayer of serpents and descendant of Odin, fights alongside the gods, the forces of evil shall be defeated and the world shall be reborn.

In response, Odin scatters his seed among mortals in hopes of birthing "the world's chosen". Although many great heroes soon join him in [[Valhalla]], the serpent slayer's coming continues to be awaited.

====Andvari's gold====
Ages later, Odin, [[Loki]], and [[Hoenir]] arrive at the cave of the [[Norse dwarves|dwarf]] [[Andvari]]. There, they encountered the demon [[Hreidmar]]'s son [[Ótr]] and, thinking him to be merely a fishing [[otter]], Loki slays him with a stone, removes his [[Fur|pelt]], and steals his catch of salmon. Enraged, Hreidmar and his other sons, [[Fafnir]] and [[Regin]], bind the three gods in unbreakable chains and demand that Otr's pelt be covered with gold as [[weregild]] for his death.

Seeking to pay the ransom, Loki seeks out the dwarf Andvari and extorts the gold ransom. Although Andvari attempts to conceal a golden ring, Loki seizes it as well. Enraged, Andvari vows that both the ring and the gold will be the death of all who possess them. Pleased, Loki returns and delivers the gold to Hreidmar and his sons. Although Loki gloatingly informs them of the curse, Hreidmar is unimpressed and boasts of the fortune he now possesses.

====Signý====
On the coasts of the North, [[Rerir]] the sea lord, grandson of [[Odin]], conducts raids in Viking [[longship]]s. He is succeeded as king by his son Völsung. The latter, whom Odin favours, has been given a [[valkyrie]] as his wife. She bears twins, [[Sigmund]] and [[Signý]], during her husband's reign.

Years later, [[Siggeir]], [[King of the Geats|King of the Gauts]] sends an emissary and demands Signý's hand in marriage as the price of peace. Sigmund counsels his father to arrange the marriage, suggesting that the Gauts will prove valuable allies.

At the wedding feast, Odin enters the hall under the veil of a hoary bearded elder under the name [[Odin's names|Grímnir]]. He drives a sword into the oak at the center of the hall and dares the men present to pull it out. After all others try and fail, Sigmund at last succeeds in pulling it from the oak. King Siggeir, coveting the sword, offers Sigmund a fortune in gold in exchange for it. Unmoved, Sigmund boasts that the sword was made for his hands and vows never to sell it.

Enraged, Siggeir declares war on King Völsung, who is slain on a beach after cutting down many Gautish warriors. Although Signý pleads for the lives of her brothers, Siggeir orders them to be bound to trees in the forest and left for the wolves to eat. Although his nine brothers perish, Sigmund slays the she-wolf and escapes into an enchanted cave. There he mates with his sister, who has entered the cave in the guise of an elvish maiden. Nine months later, she bears a son, [[Sinfjötli]].

When Sinfjötli comes of age, he visits his father in the cave and delivers the sword of Grímnir. As the years pass, father and son range through Gautland as outlaws, slaying and plundering many men. Eventually, they infiltrate the hall of Siggeir, slay the watchmen, and vow that no one inside shall be spared. Although they ask Signý to leave with them, she refuses and elects to die at her husband's side.

====The Death of Sinfjötli====
Laden with the pillaged loot of Siggeir's hall, Sigmund and Sinfjötli return by ship to the land of the Völsungs. Together they rule for many years, slaying seven kings and sacking cities far and near. Although he will live to regret it, Sigmund takes a queen from among the war captives.

Loathing the man who slew her father, the Queen brews a poisoned brew of wine for Sinfjötli. Sigmund, suspecting that the wine has been tampered with, drains the cup instead of Sinfjötli and remains unharmed. Enraged, the Queen brews a beaker of poisoned beer, which again is offered to Sinfjötli but drunk by his father with no harm. Still determined to slay Sinfjötli, the Queen also delivers him a beaker of poisoned [[ale]]. This time the cup is drunk by Sinfjötli himself, who to the horror of Sigmund falls dead. Sinfjötli is then welcomed in [[Valhalla]] by grandfather King Völsung, who comments that the serpent slayer is still awaited.

====Sigurd born====
As the years pass, Sigmund grows old, having lost both his son and his treacherous Queen. Eventually, however, he learns of the beauteous Princess [[Sigrlinn]]. Although seven young sons of kings are also asking for her hand, Sigrlinn marries Sigmund, preferring to be the mother of a mighty hero.

Enraged at this slight, the seven sons of kings invade the land of Völsung. Sigmund vows that they will be greeted by the sword of Grímnir and slays many on the field of battle. However, he is soon confronted by a one-eyed warrior. As the warrior's spear clashes with Sigmund's sword, the blade of Grímnir breaks asunder. Severely wounded, Sigmund sinks to the ground.

Although Sigrlinn vows to heal his wounds, Sigmund refuses to permit this, insisting that [[Odin]] summon him to Valhalla. He prophesies that her unborn child will be the serpent slayer and orders her to carefully preserve the fragments of Grímnir's gift. He dies and Sigrlinn is carried into slavery. However, when the parentage of her son is revealed, Sigrlinn is wed to the king of that land. [[Sigurd]] is sent to be fostered by [[Regin]], the son of [[Hreidmar]].

====Regin====
Years later, Otr's ransom remains in the keeping of Regin's brother [[Fafnir]], who has been transformed into a [[European dragon|dragon]]. Coveting the gold hoard, Regin goads Sigurd into fighting Fafnir by accusing him of [[cowardice]]. When an enraged Sigurd demands to know the reason, Regin relates the story of Otr's murder by Loki and the [[weregild]] paid by the [[Aesir]] in recompense. According to Regin, [[Hreidmar]] refused to share the gold with his sons and was subsequently slain by Fafnir. Unimpressed, Sigurd asks Regin whether he desires his brother's death for justice or the gold hoard. Regin claims that he desires only to avenge his father. The gold and the glory, he adds, are for Sigurd to keep.

Twice Regin attempts to forge a sword for Sigurd, only to see the latter effortlessly break them. At last, Sigurd goes to his mother Sigrlinn and requests the broken pieces of Grímnir. Regin takes these and forges the sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]]. Although Sigurd wishes to slay Fafnir then and there, Regin tells him he must have a horse. In response, Sigurd buys the horse [[Grani]], who was sired by Odin's eight-legged steed [[Sleipnir]], and goes forth to kill Fafnir.

Later, as the dragon returns from taking a drink of water, Sigurd hides in a subterranean hollow and stabs the fell beast in the heart. As Fafnir's black blood drains over Sigurd and hardens his flesh, the young warrior withdraws his sword and leaps into the dragon's eyesight.

Although Fafnir warns him of the curse, Sigurd is unmoved, believing that the dragon wishes only to preserve his gold hoard. As the dragon belches out his last breath, Regin arrives and attempts to claim a share of the gold, commenting that he also had a role in the slaying and forged the sword. As Sigurd mocks his foster father's logic, Regin draws a knife and slices Fafnir's heart from his chest.

Ordering Sigurd to roast it for him, Regin departs. Meanwhile, Sigurd fashions a spit and kindles a fire. After burning his finger on the roasting heart, Sigurd puts the finger in his mouth and suddenly understands the language of birds.

As he listens to the birds speaking, Sigurd decides to eat the heart whole. Upon seeing Regin sneaking towards him with a drawn blade, Sigurd draws Gram and slays his foster father. He then loads the gold hoard onto Grani and departs, listening all the while to the birds singing of the [[valkyrie]] [[Brynhild]], her quarrel with [[Odin]], and the circle of fire which surrounds her sleeping form.

====Brynhildr====
After much riding on the back of Grani, Sigurd arrives at heights of Hindarfell. As they climb the mountainside, Grani leaps the ring of lightning and fire which surrounds Brynhild. As he reaches her side, Sigurd slices her [[corslet]] with Gram and awakens the sleeping valkyrie.

Addressing Sigurd, Brynhild explains how Odin doomed her to mate a mortal man. Impetuously, Brynhild had vowed to wed but one, the serpent slayer prophesied by the seeress of Asgard. When Sigurd relates his descent from Odin and the slaying of Fafnir, Brynhild is overjoyed and explains that the gods await his coming in [[Valhalla]]. Immediately after, Brynhild and Sigurd plight their troth. There is one complication, however.

Brynhild vows that she will only wed Sigurd when he has won a kingdom for himself. After cautioning her betrothed to avoid the abode of a witch-hearted woman, she returns to the height of Hindarfell and their ways sunder. Meanwhile, Sigurd rides toward the court of the [[Niflungs]]' at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]].

====Gudrun====
One morning, Princess [[Gudrun]] of the [[Niflungs]] approaches her mother, the witch-hearted Queen [[Grimhild]], with a disturbing dream. The Niflungs were hunting a [[stag]] with a golden coat and towering horns which evaded their grasp. It was Gudrun who caught him, only to see him stung with a shaft by a spiteful woman. Her mother then gave Gudrun a [[wolf]] to ease her grief and the former bathed her in the blood of her brothers. Her mother counsels her that evil dreams are often a good omen.

As they converse, Gudrun catches sight of a warrior riding toward the court arrayed for war. A short time later, Sigurd enters the court of the Niflungs, riding upon Grani. When her father [[Gjuki]] asks his name and parentage, he is overjoyed to learn that a Völsung warrior has arrived and summons a seat for Sigurd.

As the evening wears on, Gudrun's brother [[Gunnar]] seizes a harp and sings a lay of the Niflungs' longstanding war against King [[Attila the Hun|Atli]] of the [[Huns]]. As soon as he has finished, Sigurd takes the harp and sings of Brynhild and the gold hoard. Impressed, Gunnar and [[Högni]] invite Sigurd to dwell among them as long as he desires.

As time passes and Sigurd accompanies the Niflungs in war, the glory of the Burgundian lords spreads far and wide. Sigurd, however, continues to think of his father's lost kingdom and returns there by ship. There, as he looks upon the roofless remains of his father's mead hall, Odin appears and informs him that Gram is not destined to shine in the land of the Völsungs. As a result, Sigurd returns to Worms.

At a feast thrown to celebrate Sigurd's return, [[Grimhild]] advises her sons to regularise their alliance with Sigurd by marrying him to [[Gudrun]]. As Sigurd ponders how he soon will depart to claim Brynhild, Grimhild gives him a [[potion|love potion]] to drink. Shortly after, Gudrun enters the hall. Colored by the potion, Sigurd's mind is glamoured and his mood confounded.

====Brynhild betrayed====
Brynhild continues to await the coming of Sigurd, slaying almost every [[suitor]] who dares to call. Eventually, Odin arrives on horseback and armoured as an ancient king. He prophesies that she shall wed a mortal king before two winters pass. As he departs, a ring of fire surrounds her hall and Brynhild ponders that one man only can reach her now.

Meanwhile, a radiantly happy Sigurd weds Gudrun in a feast which lasts many days and nights in the mead hall of Worms. In addition, Sigurd and his in-laws swear a [[Blood brother|blood oath]] of eternal brotherhood. Although he and Gudrun are deeply happy in their marriage, a shadow remains in Sigurd's heart.

As time passes, the news of Brynhild and the gold hoard reaches Grimhild's ears. Certain that such a Queen will bring glory to her son's court, Grimhild counsels King [[Gunther|Gunnar]] that it is time for him to wed. Riding together, Sigurd, [[Högni]], and Gunnar depart for Brynhild's mead hall.

When they reach their destination, King Gunnar's horse shies away at the sight of the fire. Although the king smites the sides of his steed, Honi still refuses to go forward. With Sigurd's permission, Gunnar borrows Grani who, unfortunately, refuses to go forward under another rider. As a result, Sigurd springs to the rescue of his blood brother.

Through a spell cast by Grimhild, Sigurd rides through the fire in Gunnar's likeness. Stunned that a different warrior has ridden through the fire, Brynhild demands to know whether "Gunnar" is the masterless warrior she has vowed to wed. "Gunnar" reminds her that, as her oath has been fulfilled, she is doomed to wed him.

That night, Brynhild and Sigurd sleep in the same bed with a drawn sword lying between them. As dawn arrives, Brynhild at last agrees to marry "Gunnar."

====Strife====
During the nuptial feast after Brynhild's wedding to Gunnar, the bride catches sight of Sigurd seated next to Gudrun. As the blood drains from her horrified face, Grimhild's spell dissipates and Sigurd at last recalls the solemn oaths he swore to Brynhild. Realizing he can no longer honourably fulfill them, he stands as cold and unsmiling as a carven stone.

During a subsequent stag hunt, Brynhild and Gudrun bathe together in the [[Rhine]] River. Hautily, Brynhild comments that the water washing Gudrun will soon wash one far lovelier. Bristling, Gudrun snaps that she is far more queenly and is married to a better man, citing Sigurd's slaying of Fafnir. Unimpressed, Brynhild boasts of Gunnar's ride through the fire and lightning to claim her. With an icy laugh, Gudrun reveals that Sigurd rode through the fire and shows the ring of Brynhild on her own hand. Shocked and horrified, Brynhild departs the river and return to her [[wikt:bower|bower]], where she curses the [[Norns]] for framing her fate.

As days pass, Brynhild refuses to eat, drink, or depart her bed. When Gunnar approaches her, she call him a coward and curses him for causing her to break her oath to marry Sigurd. Reluctantly, Sigurd agrees to speak with her and, raising her coverlet, awakens her as he once did on the heights of Hindarfell. Seething with hatred, Brynhild addresses him as "cruel forswearer," and curses both him and Gudrun to an early death.

Stunned, Sigurd speaks lovingly to her of the spell that was cast upon him and admits that his only comfort has been to see her in Gunnar's hall. Although deeply touched, Brynhild states that it is too late to avert the evil of her curse. The one comfort which she can offer is that Sigurd shall die an honourable death at the point of a sword. Deeply grieved, Sigurd and Brynhild prepare for their respective fates.

Upon returning to Gudrun, Sigurd sadly tells her of the curse, saying, "Woe worth the words by women spoken!" When Gunnar later seeks his advice, Sigurd informs him that Brynhild's only doctor should be her husband. In response, Gunnar approaches his wife, offering her a hoard of gold and silver. Unmoved, Brynhild taunts him as "a Völsung's [[squire]], a [[vassal]]'s servant." She adds that she will depart his mead hall and leave Gunnar in disgrace unless he slays his [[brother in law]].

Stunned, Gunnar insists that he has sworn a blood oath of eternal brotherhood with Sigurd and will never break it. Brynhild, however, insists that Sigurd has already broken the oath by seducing her in Gunnar's shape after riding through the fire. Devastated, Gunnar departs Brynhild's room and spends many days pondering over what to do. At last, he summons his brother [[Högni]].

Gunnar declares to [[Högni]] that Sigurd has broken the oath and must be slain. Shocked, Högni suggests that Brynhild is lying out of jealousy. Gunnar insists, however, that he loves and trusts Brynhild more than anyone in the world and adds that, by slaying Sigurd, they will be masters again of their kingdom and able to seize the gold hoard of Fafnir. Saddened, Högni declares that, in the future, the [[Niflungs]] will miss both Sigurd's prowess in war and the mighty nephews he could have sired. Knowing that he swore no oath, Gunnar approaches his [[half brother]] [[Gotthorm]] and promises him both gold and lordship if he will kill Sigurd.

Later, as Sigurd hunts with his falcon, Gutthorm accuses him of being a "wife marrer" who wishes to usurp the Niflung throne. Enraged, Sigurd grips his sword hilt and orders Gutthorm to say no more if he values his life. Waiting for a more opportune moment, Gutthorm obeys.

At dawn the following morning, Gutthorm enters Sigurd's room with a drawn sword and stabs the serpent slayer, impaling him to the mattress. Awakening, Sigurd brandishes Gram and slays his attacker on the spot. In anguish, Gudrun awakens and, in horror, cradles her dying husband. Sigurd, however, orders her not to weep and not to blame her brothers for his death. As the light drains from his eyes, Sigurd declares,

:''"Brynhild wrought this:
:''best she loved me,
:''worst she dealt me,
:''worst belied me.
:''I Gunnar never
:''grieved nor injured;
:''oaths I swore him,
:''all fulfilled them!"&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun'', page 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Gudrun screams in anguish over Sigurd's body, Brynhild cackles in laughter. When Gunnar criticises her as a cold and "fell-hearted" woman, Brynhild curses the Niflungs for murdering their blood brother. She further reveals that Sigurd's seduction of her was a lie and that the sword Gram lay unsheathed between them. To the further horror of Gunnar, Brynhild announces that she is leaving him forever.

In vain do Gunnar and his courtiers attempt to sway her from her purpose. [[Högni]] alone insists that she was born for evil and that they are all better off without her. Attiring herself in a golden [[corslet]], Brynhild falls upon her sword. As she lies dying she requests that her corpse be burned in Sigurd's [[funeral pyre]]. She requests that Sigurd's hawks be laid at each side and his dog at their feet. Their horses are to be slain and laid beside them. The sword Gram is to lie unsheathed between them as on their only night together. Her wishes are obeyed and both Sigurd and Brynhild are carried to [[Valhalla]] in the flames of a [[Viking funeral]].

Later, [[Odin]] and the other Völsungs welcome the serpent slayer whose coming they have awaited for so long. On the day of [[Ragnarök]], Brynhild will attire Sigurd for war and he shall stand deathless against the wolf [[Fenrir]] and the [[Midgard serpent]]. Although most of the [[Aesir]] gods shall die, the forces of darkness shall be struck down at Sigurd's hands. Then, under the rule of [[Baldur]], the nine worlds shall be created anew.

===The New Lay of Gudrun===
As the flames of the funeral pyre sink down and the ashes turn cold, a devastated Gudrun wanders through the forest witless. Despite loathing every moment of her life, she cannot bring herself to commit suicide.

Meanwhile, King [[Atilla the Hun|Atli]]'s [[Hunnic Empire]] grows ever stronger. Although Atli has overthrown the [[Goths]] and seized many treasures, the gold hoard of [[Fafnir]] and the beauty of Gudrun have caught his interest. Determined to claim both as his own, Atli's [[Huns]] hasten westward.

As the news reaches the Niflung court at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Gunnar asks [[Högni]] whether Atli should be met with violent resistance or appeased with [[tribute]]. Högni comments that now they have further reason to mourn the passing of Sigurd, as Atli would never have grown so bold if the serpent slayer still lived. Despite the dangers, he advises Gunnar to meet Atli on the field of battle.

[[Grimhild]], however, has another idea and counsels that Atli's friendship can be bought via Gudrun's hand in marriage. It is this advice which the Niflungs choose to take.

Gudrun they find in a forest hut where she has been weaving a [[tapestry]] which depicts the story of the gold hoard, the [[Völsung]]s, and the arrival of [[Sigurd]] into the court at Worms. Although they offer her a large payment of gold as [[weregild]] for her husband's death, Gudrun refuses to forgive her brothers or even acknowledge their presence. Only Grimhild is able to gain a response from the widow.

Grimhild advises her daughter to mourn no longer, commenting that Brynhild is dead and that Gudrun is still beautiful. She explains that King Atli wishes her hand in marriage and speaks of the great respect which the Queen of Hunland will command. Gudrun, however, is unmoved.

The widow speaks longingly of the days before Sigurd came, saying that then only nightmares vexed her. She speaks again of the dream she had before Sigurd's arrival, commenting that one half of it has already been fulfilled in Sigurd's death. Gudrun further declares that, although she now has little love for her brothers, she has no desire to see them slaughtered. Believing also that she will never again know happiness, Gudrun sees no point in remarrying.

Grimhild retorts that Gudrun should not blame her brothers. Brynhild was responsible for Sigurd's death and the Niflungs are, quite sensibly, in grief for it. Grimhild continues urging Gudrun to marry, saying that a Queen's bed is better than one cold and empty. When Gudrun angrily orders her mother to leave, Grimhild threatens to curse her daughter to unimaginable torment if she will not obey. Intimidated, Gudrun caves in to her mother's demands.

At their wedding feast, Atli blissfully drinks to Gudrun, moved both by her beauty and by dreams of the dragon hoard. After swearing oaths of kinship to the Niflungs, Atli takes Gudrun back with him to Hunland.

As the years pass, Gudrun remains unmoved, both by the glories of Hunland and by the love which Atli feels for her. Meanwhile, Atli's lust for the dragon hoard remains unquenched. At long last, he sends his herald, [[Vingi]], to summon the Niflungs to a feast in Hunland.

In response to the summons, Gunnar asks Högni whether they are vassals of Atli that they must come when he calls them. Högni is troubled, commenting that Gudrun has sent him a ring with wolf's hair woven around it. He is certain, therefore that there is a trap waiting for them in Hunland.

Gunnar, however, comments that Gudrun sent him a wooden slab graven with "[[runes]] of healing." In response, he summons for wine to be brought to the herald of Atli. As the feast continues in Gunnar's mead hall, Grimhild arrives and gives her opinion of the runic tablet.

The original runes, she says, have been shaven off the tablet but may still be read. Therefore, it is clear that the original message from Gudrun was a warning of danger. In response to his mother's advice, Gunnar informs the herald Vingi that he will not be coming to the feast in Hunland.

Laughing in amusement, Vingi responds that, as Grimhild clearly rules the Niflung kingdom, there is no need for Gunnar to come. Atli, however, had only wished for their assistance. The King of the Huns is growing old and wished for his sons by Gudrun, Erp and [[Eitill]], to have a strong protector after his death. Therefore, he had hoped that Gunnar and Högni would one day rule the [[Hunnic Empire]] in their names. Although Gunnar still suspects a trap, he agrees to come to the feast.

Although he states that he will be accompanying his brother, Högni is troubled that they aren't taking their mother's counsel. Vingi, despite knowing exactly what Atli has in mind for his in-laws, swears that the [[gallows]] shall take him and that [[common raven|raven]]s shall devour his flesh if the runes are lying.

Later, as the Niflungs depart for Hunland with Vingi, Grimhild watches as they disappear. Although silent, she is certain that she will never again look upon her sons.

After a long journey in longship and on horseback, the Niflungs arrive in Hunland and sound their horns to announce their coming. To their surprise, they find the gates barred. Vingi at last reveals the real reason for the invitation: Atli has prepared a gallows where ravens will rend the flesh of the Niflungs.

Although the lives of heralds are considered sacrosanct, Högni vows that the treacherous Vingi has forfeited his life. Dragging him to a nearby oak, the Niflungs hang Vingi within sight of the Huns.

Seething with hatred, the Huns pour forth from the mead hall's gates and hurl themselves upon the Niflungs. To Atli's surprise, Gunnar and Högni drive the Huns back inside the mead hall. With frigid loathing, Atli comes forth and refers to the Niflungs as his [[vassal]]s. He further demands Fafnir's gold hoard as the price of their lives. Gunnar, however, is unimpressed.

He vows that Atli will never receive any gold from him at all. If the King of the Huns desires the Niflungs' lives, he will pay dearly in many dead lords and warriors.

Changing tactic, Atli demands the gold as [[weregild]] for Sigurd, saying that he is entitled to it as Gudrun's husband. Gunnar, however, insists that these words are not his sister's. The lust for the gold is Atli's alone. Högni adds that, as the fighting has already begun, the time for atonement is over. Doors spring open and dozens of Hun warriors charge the Niflungs, who defend themselves until the mead hall is filled with carnage.

Meanwhile, Gudrun sits listening to the battle below and ponders that her dream has finally been fulfilled. Devastated, she curses the hour of her birth. She calls upon her husband's Gothic vassals to defend her brothers from the Hunnic "troll people."

Recalling their past wars against Atli and his Huns, the Goths turn against their lord and make common cause with the Niflungs. Högni sings of the great warriors of the past until his son Snaevar is slain before him. Unweeping, Högni continues hewing a pathway through the mead hall.

Coming at last upon Gudrun, Gunnar and Högni declare that the [[Norns]] have fated them to always give her in marriage and then slay her husband. However, Gudrun pleads with them not to tempt fate and to spare Atli's life. In response, they mock Atli as unfit for a warrior's death and grudgingly allow him to slink forth from the bloodied mead hall. As he departs in shame and anguish, the Goths and Niflungs hurl the Hunnish corpses from the roof. Meanwhile, night falls as Atli rallies warriors throughout the countryside.

Later, as the Goths and Niflungs begin nodding off to sleep, Högni notices a large column of fire moving toward the mead hall. Commenting that there are no [[dragon]]s in Hunland, Gunnar rallies his men for the final battle. Declaring that [[Valhalla]] lies open to receive them, the defenders of the mead hall succeed in holding the doorways until dawn arrives.

Five days later, the mead hall is still held by the Niflungs and Goths. Bewailing his fate, Atli declares that his power, wealth, vassals, and wife have all deserted him in the evening of his life. His counselor Beiti, however, declares that there is still another way.

Deciding to take Beiti's advice, Atli orders the mead hall built by his father to be set afire. Just before the blazing ceiling of the mead hall falls upon them, the Goths and Niflungs charge forth and are set upon by Atli's minions. Although for weapons the former have only their fists, many Hunnic necks and knees are broken before the Niflung lords are taken.

Casting his captives before Gudrun, Atli vows that he will avenge Sigurd by hurling her brothers into a pit of adders. Disgusted, Gudrun calls her husband evil and expresses hope that his death will be shameful. However, she also reminds Atli that the Niflungs are the uncles of their son Erp and Eitil. For this reason, she pleads for their lives. Atli vows that the only way he will release the Niflungs is if he is given the gold hoard that haunts his dreams.

At last relenting, Gunnar agrees to give Atli the gold, but only if his brother Högni is first slain and the heart is delivered to him. Now frantic, Gudrun pleads with Atli to spare her brother Högni. Atli, however, vows that he will have the gold despite the tears of his wife.

Atli's wise men, however, plead for caution. Fearing the queen, they persuade Atli to instead slay the [[thrall]] Hjalli. When the heart of Hjalli is delivered to him, Gunnar is unimpressed, having heard the thrall's screams. He declares that his brother's heart would never quake in such a manner. In response, the Huns visit Högni's dungeon and cut out his heart and the Niflung laughs in their faces.

Upon seeing his brother's heart, Gunnar also laughs in the faces of the Huns. The gold, he declares, is long gone, having been cast into the [[Rhine]] after Sigurd's death. Gunnar curses Atli, calling him a gold-haunted murderer. Enraged and devastated at the loss of the gold, Atli orders Gunnar to be stripped naked and cast into the pit of [[Viperidae|adders]].

As her heart hardens in hatred for her husband, Gudrun orders a harp to be sent to her brother in the pit. Smiting the strings, Gunnar chants of [[Odin]] and the [[Aesir]], of ancient kings, and the coming doom of Hunland. The whole palace listens in wonder and the snakes are stilled to sleep. At long last, an ancient adder stings Gunnar in the chest. Crying out in a loud voice, Gunnar topples over dead and the harp is stilled.

Gudrun hears the cry as she sits aghast in her bower. At last realising how to avenge her brothers, Gudrun summons her sons Erp and Eitil.

[[Viking funeral]]s are prepared for the Niflung lords and the champions of Hunland and a funeral feast is held in the remnants of Atli's palace. At long last, Gudrun appears and, presenting two goblets to her husband, she toasts his health.

As he drinks deep from the goblets, Atli feels regret over the loss of the gold. However, he also feels satisfaction that Gunnar is dead. Gudrun then announces that, in vengeance for her brothers, she has slain their sons Erp and Eitil. The goblets were made from their skulls and have been filled with a mixture of their blood and [[honey]]. The remnants of their bodies have been fed to Atli's hounds. As the mead hall explodes in horror and anguish, Atli turns pale and falls into a swoon.

As the horned moon rises, Atli is carried to his bed, as sick as one poisoned. Intending to wreak her final vengeance, Gudrun enters his chambers, wakes her husband, and drives a knife into Atli's breast.

As his life drains away, Atli snarls that Gudrun deserves to be torn apart by hounds, stoned, branded, and then [[burned at the stake]]. Laughing, Gudrun taunts him with the news that his funeral pyre has already been kindled. Within moments, a blazing inferno consumes Atli's palace and the surrounding town. The night that has proven so fatal to so many at last ends in dawn.

In the aftermath, Gudrun again wanders witless through the forest. At last, detesting her life, Gudrun casts herself into the sea, which refuses to take her.

Sitting on the edge of the sea, Gudrun ponders her woes. At long last, she calls upon Sigurd and, reminding him of their wedding vows, she implores him to return to her. Again she casts herself into the sea, wherein her grief is finally drowned.

:''"Thus glory endeth,
:''and gold fadeth,
:''on noise and clamours
:''the night falleth.
:''Lift up your hearts,
:''lords and maidens,
:''for the song of sorrow
:''that was sung of old."&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun'', page 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of composition of the two poems in ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun'', though circumstantial evidence suggests that they date from the 1930s. In his foreword, Christopher Tolkien writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"He scarely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them."&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tolkien wrote in 1967, in a letter to [[W. H. Auden]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Thank you for your wonderful effort in translating and reorganizing ''[[Völuspá|The Song of the Sibyl]]''. In return, I hope to send you, if I can lay my hands on it (I hope it isn't lost), a thing I did many years ago while trying to learn the art of writing alliterative poetry: an attempt to unify the lays about the Völsungs from the [[Elder Edda]], written in the old eight-line [[fornyrðislag]] [[stanza]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien'', Letter 295, 29 March 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Commentary==
In a prefatory text, "Introduction to the ''Elder Edda''", based partly on one of his lectures, Tolkien draws a sharp distinction between [[epic poem]]s and the [[Skald]]ic and [[eddic poem|eddic]] poems of the Nordic countries: "...epic poetry never developed in those lands";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún |last1=Tolkien  |first1=J. R. R. |authorlink1=J. R. R. Tolkien |first2=Christopher|last2=Tolkien|authorlink2=Christopher Tolkien|year=2009 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=978-0-547-27342-6|oclc=310224953 |page=20 |chapter=Introduction to the ''Elder Edda''}}&lt;/ref&gt; "verse developed its local brief, pithy, strophic, often dramatic form, not into epic, but into the astonishing and euphonious but formal elaborations of scaldic verse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún |last1=Tolkien  |first1=J. R. R. |authorlink1=J. R. R. Tolkien |first2=Christopher|last2=Tolkien|authorlink2=Christopher Tolkien|year=2009 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=978-0-547-27342-6|oclc=310224953 |page=34|chapter=The ''Prose Edda'' of Snorri Sturluson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also draws a distinction, although not as sharply, between the later elaborate skaldic verse and the simpler forms used in the poems of the ''[[Elder Edda]]''. The poems in ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún'' use these simpler forms, which, the book says, arose earlier but persisted alongside the skaldic forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún |last1=Tolkien  |first1=J. R. R. |authorlink1=J. R. R.

They are related growths, branches on the same tree, essentially connected, even possibly sometimes by the same hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún |last1=Tolkien  |first1=J. R. R. |authorlink1=J. R. R. Tolkien |first2=Christopher|last2=Tolkien|authorlink2=Christopher Tolkien|year=2009 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=978-0-547-27342-6|oclc=310224953 |page=35|chapter=The ''Prose Edda'' of Snorri Sturluson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien also mentions that the use of the term "eddic" for this simpler style of verse is a later development, even an anachronism: "Thus the term 'Eddaic', as now used, in opposition to 'Skaldic,' is a perfect reversal of its former meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún |last1=Tolkien  |first1=J. R. R. |authorlink1=J. R. R. Tolkien |first2=Christopher|last2=Tolkien|authorlink2=Christopher Tolkien|year=2009 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=978-0-547-27342-6|oclc=310224953 |page=37|chapter=The 'Prose Edda' of Snorri Sturluson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains extensive commentary by Christopher Tolkien on the sources for the two poems by his father, and the ways in which he used, mixed, and differed from those sources, as well as the larger background of legend and history behind the stories. Excerpts from notes for lectures that J. R. R. Tolkien gave on related topics are also included.

'''''Two Sisters''''' or '''''On the Terrace''''' is an 1881 [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. The dimensions of the painting are 100.5&amp;nbsp;cm × 81&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="chicago1"&gt;{{cite web

Renoir worked on the painting on the terrace of the ''[[Maison Fournaise]]'', a restaurant located on an island in the [[Seine]] in [[Chatou]], the western suburb of [[Paris]]. The painting depicts a young woman and her younger sister seated outdoors with a small basket containing balls of wool. Over the railings of the terrace one can see shrubbery and foliage with the River Seine behind it.

In 1880 to 1881, shortly before working on ''Two Sisters'', Renoir worked in this particular location on another well-known painting, ''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]''.&lt;ref name="chicago1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hermitagemuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chicago2"&gt;{{cite web

Jeanne Darlot (1863—1914), a future actress who was 18 years old at the time, was posing as "the elder sister." It is unknown who posed as the "younger sister," but it is stated that the models were not actually related.&lt;ref name="hermitagemuseum" /&gt;

Renoir began work on the painting in April 1881 and on July 7, 1881, it was bought by the art dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], for 1,500 [[French franc|francs]].&lt;ref name="chicago1" /&gt; The painting was presented for the first time to the public at the 7th Impressionist exhibition in the spring of 1882.  In 1883 it was known to be in the collection of [[Charles Ephrussi]], an art collector and a publisher, but in 1892 the painting was returned again to the collection of the Durand-Ruel family.&lt;ref name="chicago1" /&gt;

In 1925, the painting was sold to [[Annie Swan Coburn]] from Chicago for $100,000. After her death in 1932 the painting was bequeathed to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], where it has remained since 1933.&lt;ref name="chicago1" /&gt;

'''Visionary art''' is [[art]] that purports to transcend the physical world and portray a wider vision of [[awareness]] including [[supernatural|spiritual]] or [[mystical]] [[Theme (visual arts)|theme]]s, or is based in such experiences.&lt;ref name="AlexGrey"&gt;[http://alexgrey.com/media/writing/essays/what-is-visionary-art/ What is Visionary Art? by Alex Grey]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alex Grey - COSM 4.jpg|thumb|[[The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors]] by [[Alex Grey]].]]

==History==
The [[Vienna School of Fantastic Realism]], first established in 1946, is considered to be an important technical and philosophical catalyst in its strong influence upon contemporary visionary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://academyofvisionaryart.com/information/visionary-art |title=Academy of Visionary Art |access-date=2014-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312142009/http://academyofvisionaryart.com/information/visionary-art |archive-date=2014-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://visionaryrevue.com/webtext/manifesto.contents.html ''Manifesto of Visionary Art'' by L. Caruana]&lt;/ref&gt; Its artists included [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]], [[Rudolf Hausner]] and [[Arik Brauer]] among others. Several artists who would later work in visionary art trained under Fuchs, including [[Mati Klarwein]], [[Robert Venosa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venosa.com/bio.html Robert Venosa biography]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Rubinov Jacobson]] and [[De Es Schwertberger]].

==Definition==
[[File:Laurence caruana in his Bastille studio.jpg|thumb|Visionary artist [[Laurence Caruana]] with visionary art paintings.]]
Visionary art often carries themes of spiritual, mystical or inner awareness.&lt;ref name=AlexGrey /&gt; Despite this broad definition, there does seem to be emerging some definition to what constitutes the contemporary visionary art 'scene' and which artists can be considered especially influential. [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Psychedelic art]] are also direct precursors to contemporary visionary art. Notable visionary artists count [[Hilma af Klint]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], [[William Blake]], [[Morris Graves]] (of the Pacific Northwest School of Visionary Art), [[Emil Bisttram]], and [[Gustave Moreau]] amongst their antecedents.

==Schools and organizations==
The [[Vienna School of Fantastic Realism]], which includes [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]] and [[Arik Brauer]], is also a strong influence on visionary culture. It may also be considered the European version, with the names being interchangeable.

The [[Society for the Art of Imagination]], founded by [[Brigid Marlin]] serves as an important portal for visionary art events. More recently, a new wave of visionary artists collaborate to function as modern [[artist collectives|cooperatives]] involved in self-publishing and promotion of visionary artists through the internet and via festivals such as [[Burning Man]] and [[Boom Festival]], and exhibition/ritual spaces such as [[Temple of Visions]], Tribe 13, Psychedelic Dream Temple, Synergenesis and the [[Interdimensional art|Interdimensional Art]] Movement.

== History ==
Women in Focus (WIF) was founded in September, 1974 and was originally based out of and funded by the [[University of British Columbia]]. Its original mandate was to "produce feminist video and film" as an "alternative to male-defined images of women was long overdue."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Video and Film Catalogue|last=Women in Focus|first=|publisher=Women in Focus|year=1982|isbn=|location=Vancouver|pages=2|oclc=606457180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to producing a number of films and videos, including such notable titles as ''Fashion as a Social Control'' (1976)&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/146144717 ''Fashion as a Social Control'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Rape is a Social Disease'' (1975),&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/145553640 ''Rape is a Social Disease'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; WIF acted as a distributor of Canadian and International film and video made by women.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivomediaarts.com/archive-library/special-collections/women-in-focus-collection/|title=Women in Focus Collection|last=VIVO|first=|date=2018|website=www.vivomediaarts.com/archive-library/special-collections/women-in-focus-collection/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre also operated a rental library of production and post-production materials, available to members of Women in Focus,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and regularly organized workshops, screenings, trainings and conferences open to both members and the general public.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; From 1978 until 1986 Women in Focus hosted ephemeral visual arts programming in a variety of gallery spaces across Vancouver. In 1986 the Floating Curatorial Gallery, later called the Lateral Gallery, was founded and hosted year-round exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rbscarchives.library.ubc.ca/index.php/vancouver-women-in-focus-society-fonds;rad|title=Vancouver Women in Focus Society Fonds|last=UBC|first=Archives|date=2018|website=rbscarchives.library.ubc.ca/index.php/vancouver-women-in-focus-society-fonds;rad|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arcintern.wordpress.com/about/|title=Women in and out of Focus|last=Bernard|first=Stephane|date=2014-01-30|work=ARClog|access-date=2018-03-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yabba Statue SCG 1.JPG|thumb|Statue of Yabba at the Sydney Cricket Ground]]

'''Stephen Harold Gascoigne''', better known as '''Yabba''', (19 March 1878 - 8 January 1942) was an [[Australian]] sports fan, remembered as a [[heckler]] at [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] [[cricket]] and [[rugby league]] games in the early part of the 20th century. ''Yabba'' was known for his knowledgeable witticisms shouted loudly from "The Hill", a grassy general admissions area of the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].

In Yabba's era, cricket matches were watched like tennis matches, and spectators at the SCG were much quieter than today. This is the reason Yabba's comments were so clearly heard by players and other spectators.

"The Hill" area was replaced with seating in the early 1990s. The new area was then formally named ''Yabba's Hill'' in honour of his colourful comments, several of which have passed into cricketing folklore.  In 2007 the [[Doug Walters]] Stand and ''Yabba's Hill'' were demolished to make way for the new [[Victor Trumper]] Stand. On 7 December 2008 a bronze statue of Yabba, sculpted by [[Cathy Weiszmann]], was unveiled at the Sydney Cricket Ground in ''The Hill'' area of the new stand. It depicts Yabba in a characteristic pose, one hand acting as a megaphone, in the act of delivering one of his famous interjections. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Yabba was portrayed by [[Paul Chubb]] in the 1984 mini-series [[Bodyline (miniseries)|''Bodyline'']].

==Insults==
[[File:Yabba Statue SCG 2.JPG|thumb|Yabba's view across the pitch of the Sydney Cricket Ground]]
Some of Yabba's best remembered insults include:

* "I wish you were a statue and I were a pigeon."
* Telling a fly-swatting English cricket captain, [[Douglas Jardine]], to "Leave our flies alone, Jardine. They're the only friends you've got here."
* "Send 'im down a piano, see if 'e can play that!"
* "Oh for a strong arm and a walking stick!" (at bad bowling; leg spinner [[Arthur Mailey]], a regular victim of this one, quotes it several times in his book 10 for 66 and All That)
* "Those are the only balls you've touched all day!" (To an English batsman adjusting his [[box (cricket)|box]] in between overs).
* "Put a penny in him, George, he's stopped registering" (To umpire George Borwick who read [[gas meter]]s and emptied the cash boxes for a living, when [[Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi]] was scoring slowly) 
* "Your length's lousy but you bowl a good width!" (To an opposition bowler)
