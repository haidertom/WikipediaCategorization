'''''391''''' was an arts and literary magazine created by [[Francis Picabia]], published between 1917 and 1924 in [[Barcelona]], [[Zurich]] and [[New York City]].

==History and profile==
''391'' first appeared in January 1917 in [[Barcelona]], published by {{Ill|Josep Dalmau i Rafel|ca}}, founder of [[Galeries Dalmau|Les Galeries Dalmau]], and continued to be published until 1924.&lt;ref name="sas"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Brooker|author2=Sascha Bru|author3=Andrew Thacker|author4=Christian Weikop|title=The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines: Europe 1880 - 1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvsfioiQ8k8C&amp;pg=PA398|accessdate=31 January 2015|date=19 May 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-965958-6|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was created by the [[Dada]]ist Francis Picabia. Picabia produced the first four issues, which Dalmau published.&lt;ref name=sas/&gt; He was assisted in assembling the magazine by [[Olga Sacharoff]], a Georgian emigre residing in Barcelona.

The title of the magazine derives from [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s New York periodical ''[[291 (journal)|291]]'' (to which Picabia had contributed),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aránzazu Ascunce Arenas|title=Barcelona and Madrid: Social Networks of the Avant-Garde|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLnlK0xs0mQC&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=15 November 2014|date=15 March 2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-1-61148-425-0|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bore no relation to its contents. Despite Picabia's renown as an artist, it was mostly literary in content, with a wide-ranging aggressive tone, possibly influenced by [[Alfred Jarry]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. There were contributions by two men new to Dada: [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. However ''391'' remained essentially the expression of the inventive, energetic and wealthy Picabia, who stated of it: ''"Every page must explode, whether through seriousness, profundity, turbulence, nausea, the new, the eternal, annihilating nonsense, enthusiasm for principles, or the way it is printed. Art must be unaesthetic in the extreme, useless and impossible to justify."''

Starting from its fifth issue the magazine was published in New York City.&lt;ref name=sas/&gt; Its eighth issue was published in Zurich.&lt;ref name=sas/&gt; Then the magazine was published in [[Paris]] until 1924 when its last issue, number 19, was distributed.&lt;ref name=sas/&gt;

The '''Agate Casket of Oviedo''' ({{lang-es|Caja de las Ágatas}}, sometimes in English '''Agate Box''', "Box of Agates") is an elaborately decorated box, casket or small chest given by King [[Fruela II of Asturias]] and his wife Nunila to the [[cathedral of Oviedo|Cathedral of San Salvador]], [[Oviedo]], [[Spain]]. This masterpiece of 10th century [[Asturian art|Asturian]] gold work is kept in the [[Cámara Santa]] (Holy Chamber) treasury.

== Construction ==
It is a rectangular box made of wood of [[European Pear]], with a lid in the shape of a truncated pyramid. The [[Agate]] box is {{convert|42|cm|in}} long, {{convert|27.5|cm|in}} wide and {{convert|25|cm|in}} high. The wooden box is covered with sheets of gold forming unequal arches in which 99 large flat sections of veined [[agate]] are mounted. The gold is decorated with [[cabochon]] gemstones and [[coral]].  The top of the lid is a gold plaque with a cross and three large gems which was taken from an older piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= García de Castro Valdés| first= César| chapter= Cripta de San Leocadia| title= Arte Prerrománico de Asturias| date= 2004| publisher= Ediciones Nobel| location= Oviedo| ISBN = 84-8459-181-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is decorated with small animals in [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] in a kind of [[champlevé]] technique that is only found in one other work, the South German rear cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]], of the late 8th century, now in the [[Morgan Library]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 8-9, Plate 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The base of the box is made of pure silver, with a cross made of [[Gemstone|gem]]s and with a carved [[tetramorph]], representing the four evangelists: the angel of [[Saint Matthew|St. Matthew]], the Lion of [[St. Mark]], the ox of [[St. Luke]] and the eagle of [[John the Evangelist|St. John]]. The inscription which describes the donation of the box to the cathedral is engraved on the basex.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon }} "Caja de las Ágatas", Enciclopedia de Oviedo&lt;/ref&gt; It reads:

[[File:Beowulf_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics_1936_title_page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of ''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics, 1936]]
"'''''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics'''" was a 1936 lecture given by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] on [[literary criticism]] on the [[Old English language|Old English]] [[hero]]ic [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]''. It was first published as a paper in that year in the ''[[Proceedings of the British Academy]]'', and has since been reprinted in many collections.

Tolkien argues that the original poem has almost been lost under the weight of the scholarship on it; that ''Beowulf'' must be seen as a poem, not just as a historical document; and that the quality of its verse and its structure give it a powerful effect. He rebuts suggestions that the poem is an epic or exciting narrative, likening it instead to a strong masonry structure built of blocks that fit together. He points out that the poem's theme is a serious one, mortality, and that the poem is in two parts: the first on Beowulf as a young man, defeating [[Grendel]] and his mother; the second on Beowulf in old age, going to his death fighting the dragon.

The work has been praised by critics including the poet and ''Beowulf'' translator [[Seamus Heaney]]. [[Michael D. C. Drout]] called it the most important article ever written about the poem.&lt;ref name="Drout2007"/&gt; Scholars of Anglo-Saxon agree that the work was influential, transforming the study of ''Beowulf''.

==Overview==

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s essay "''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics", initially delivered as a lecture in 1936, is regarded as a formative work in modern ''[[Beowulf]]'' studies.&lt;ref name=Niles&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niles| author-link=John Niles (scholar)|first1=John D.|editor1-last=Bjork|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor2-last=Niles|editor2-first=John D.|article=''Beowulf'', Truth, and Meaning|title=A ''Beowulf'' Handbook|date=1998|publisher=U of Nebraska P|location=Lincoln, NE|isbn=0-8032-6150-0|page=5|quote=Bypassing earlier scholarship, critics of the past fifty years have generally traced the current era of ''Beowulf'' studies back to 1936 [and Tolkien's essay].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shippey&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shippey |first1=Thomas A. |author-link=Tom Shippey |editor1-last=Bjork |editor1-first=Robert E. |editor2-last=Niles |editor2-first=John D. |article=Structure and Unity |title=A ''Beowulf'' Handbook |date=1998  |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |isbn=0-8032-6150-0 |page=163 |quote=[Tolkien's essay] was seized upon eagerly, even gratefully, by generations of critics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le |first1=Alvin A. |editor1-last=Bjork |editor1-first=Robert E.|editor2-last=Niles |editor2-first=John D. |article=Symbolism and Allegory |title=A ''Beowulf'' Handbook |date=1998 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |isbn=0-8032-6150-0 |page=240 |quote=Tolkien's manifesto and interpretation have had more influence on readers than any other single study, even thought it has been challenged on just about every one of its major points.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lerer&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lerer |first1=Seth |author-link=Seth Lerer |editor1-last=Bjork |editor1-first=Robert E.|editor2-last=Niles |editor2-first=John D. |article=''Beowulf'' and Contemporary Critical Theory |title=A ''Beowulf'' Handbook |date=1998 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska |isbn=0-8032-6150-0 |pages=328,330 |quote=[Tolkien's essay] may well be the originary piece of modern ''Beowulf'' criticism. . . .

Tolkien argues that rather than being merely extraneous, these elements are key to the [[narrative]] and should be the focus of study. In doing so he drew attention to the previously neglected [[Literature|literary]] qualities of the poem and argued that it should be studied as a [[work of art]], not just as a [[historical document]].&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt; Later critics such as Hugh Magennis who agree with Tolkien on this point have cited him to defend their arguments.&lt;ref name=Magennis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magennis |first1=Hugh| title=Translating Beowulf: Modern Versions in English Verse |pages=6, 15-17 |date=2011| publisher=D.S.Brewer |isbn=978-1843842613| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1BZss2TtTisC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay is a redacted version of a [[lecture series|series of lectures]] that Tolkien delivered to Oxford undergraduates in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Sharp&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sharp |first1=Tom |title=J. R. R. Tolkien, Beowulf and the Critics. Ed. Michael D. C. Drout (Review) |url=http://www.sfsu.edu/~medieval/Volume5/Beowulf.html |publisher=San Francisco State University |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notes for these lectures exist in two [[manuscript]] versions published together in 2002 as ''[[Beowulf and the Critics]]'', edited by [[Michael D. C. Drout]]; these offer some insight into the development of Tolkien's thinking on the poem, especially his much-quoted metaphor of the material of the poem as a tower.&lt;ref name=Sharp/&gt; "''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics" is available in various collections including the 1983 ''[[The Monsters and the Critics|The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays]]'' edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]].

==Tolkien's argument==
===Rebuttal of earlier critics===
[[File:William_Paton_Ker_by_Johnstone_Forbes-Robertson_Univ_Glasgow_Hunterian_Art_Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright|Tolkien's essay repeatedly responds to comments by [[William Paton Ker]]. Late 19th century portrait by [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]]]]
Tolkien begins by noting that the original book has almost been lost under the extensive "&amp;#x202f;‘literature’&amp;#x202f;"&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [his inverted commas] on the subject. He explains that ''Beowulf'' had mainly been quarried as "an historical document",&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and that most of the praise and censure of the poem was due to beliefs that it was "something that it was ''not'' – for example, primitive, pagan, Teutonic, an allegory (political or mythical), or most often, an epic;"&lt;ref name=T7&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; or because the scholar would have liked it to be something else, such as "a heathen heroic [[Lai (poetic form)|lay]], a history of Sweden, a manual of Germanic antiquities, or a Nordic ''[[Summa Theologica]]''."&lt;ref name=T7/&gt; Tolkien gives an allegory of a man who inherits a field full of stone from an old hall. He builds a tower with some of it, but when people find the stones are older than the tower, they pull it down "to look for hidden carvings and inscriptions".&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien quotes at length what the scholar [[W. P. Ker]] thought of ''Beowulf'', namely that "there is nothing much in the story", and that "the great beauty, the real value, of ''Beowulf'' is in its dignity of style". Tolkien notes that Ker's opinion had been a powerful influence in favour of a paradoxical contrast between the poem's supposed defect in speaking of monsters, and (in Tolkien's words) its agreed "dignity, loftiness in converse, and well-wrought finish".&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien cites other critics, such as [[Raymond Wilson Chambers]] and [[Ritchie Girvan]], who objected to the poem's "wilderness of dragons" and its unworthy choice of theme. Tolkien finds it improbable that "a mind lofty and thoughtful", as evidenced by the quality of the poetry, "would write more than three thousand lines (wrought to a high finish) on matter that is really not worth serious attention".&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that heroic human stories had been held to be superior to myth, but argues that myth has a special value: "For myth is alive at once and in all its parts, and dies before it can be dissected."&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally Tolkien states directly "We do not deny the worth of the hero by accepting Grendel and the dragon."&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Man in a hostile world===
In Tolkien's view, the poem is essentially about a "man at war with the hostile world, and his inevitable overthrow in Time". The underlying tragedy is man's brief mortal life. [[Grendel]] and the dragon are identified as enemies of a Christian God, unlike the monsters encountered by [[Odysseus]] on his travels.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; What had happened is that Northern courage, exultant, defiant in the face of inevitable defeat by "Chaos and Unreason" (Tolkien cites Ker's words), fuses with a Christian faith and outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Beowulf'' poet uses both what he knew to be the old heroic tradition, darkened by distance in time, along with the newly acquired Christian tradition. The Christian, Tolkien notes, is "hemmed in a hostile world", and the monsters are evil spirits: but as the transition was incomplete in the poem, the monsters remain real and the focus remains "an ancient theme: that man, each man and all men, and all their works shall die".&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien returns to the monsters, and regrets we know so little about pre-Christian [[English mythology]]; he resorts instead to [[Elder Edda|Icelandic myth]], which he argues must have had a similar attitude to monsters, men and gods. The Northern gods, like men, are doomed to die. The Southern ([[Ancient Roman religion|Roman]] and [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek]]) pagan gods were immortal, so to Tolkien (a Christian), the Southern religion "must go forward to philosophy or relapse into anarchy":&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; death and the monsters are peripheral. But the Northern myths, and ''Beowulf'', put the monsters, mortality and death in the centre. Tolkien is therefore very interested in the contact of Northern and Christian thought in the poem, where the scriptural [[Cain]] is linked to ''eotenas'' (giants) and ''ylfe'' (elves), not through confusion but "an indication of the precise point at which an imagination, pondering old and new, was kindled".&lt;ref name=T26&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is, Tolkien states, "an historical poem about the pagan past, or an attempt at one", obviously not with modern ideas of "literal historical fidelity".&lt;ref name=T26/&gt; The poet takes an old plot (a marauding monster troubling the [[Scylding]] court) paints a vivid picture of the old days, for instance using the [[Old Testament]] image of the shepherd [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs of Israel]] in the ''folces hyrde'' (people's shepherd) of the Danes.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure: youth versus age===
{{further|On Translating Beowulf}}
[[File:Beowulf Cotton MS Vitellius A XV f. 132r.jpg|thumb|upright|First folio of the ''Beowulf'' manuscript, c. 975-1025]]

The general structure of the poem is then clear, writes Tolkien. "It is essentially a balance, an opposition of ends and beginnings. In its simplest terms it is a contrasted description of two moments in a great life, rising and setting; an elaboration of the ancient and intensely moving contrast between youth and age, first achievement and final death."&lt;ref name=T28&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Part A (youth) is lines 1 to 2199; part B (age) is lines 2200 to 3182 (the end).&lt;ref name=T28/&gt;

A secondary division of the poem occurs, Tolkien writes, at line 1887, after which all the earlier story is summarized, so a complete account of Beowulf's tragedy is given between 1888 and the end, but without the account of the gloomy court of [[Heorot]], or of the contrast between the young Beowulf and the old [[Hrothgar]].

The poem's metre, too, is founded on a balance of two halves to each line, "more like masonry than music".&lt;ref name=T30&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien argues that the poem is not meant to be an exciting narrative, nor a romantic story, but a word-picture, "a method and structure that ... approaches rather to sculpture or painting. It is a composition not a tune."&lt;ref name=T30/&gt; Far from being weakly structured, it "is curiously strong".&lt;ref name=T30/&gt; It

{{quote|is not an '[[epic poetry|epic]]', nor even a magnified '[[Lai (poetic form)|lay]]'. No terms borrowed from Greek or other literatures exactly fit: there is no reason why they should. Though if we must have a term, we should choose rather '[[elegy]]'. It is an heroic-elegiac poem; and in a sense all its first 3,136 lines are the prelude to a [[dirge]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===A singular effect===

Tolkien takes a moment to dismiss another criticism, that monsters should not have been made to appear in both halves. He replies he can see the point of no monsters, but not in complaining about their mere numbers; the poet could not, he argues, have balanced Beowulf's rise to fame through a war in [[Frisia]], against death by dragon. Similarly, he dismisses notions that the poem is primitive: it is instead a late poem, using materials left over from a vanished age:

{{quote|When new ''Beowulf'' was already antiquarian, in a good sense, and it now produces a singular effect. For it is now to us itself ancient; and yet its maker was telling of things already old and weighted with regret, and he expended his art in making keen that touch upon the heart which sorrows have that are both poignant and remote. If the funeral of Beowulf moved once like the echo of an ancient dirge, far-off and hopeless, it is to us as a memory brought over the hills, an echo of an echo. There is not much poetry in the world like this;&lt;ref name=T33&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tolkien finishes by arguing that ''Beowulf'' "has its own individual character, and peculiar solemnity;"&lt;ref name=T33/&gt; and would still be powerful even if it came from some unknown time and place; but that in fact its language, [[Old English]],

{{quote|has still essential kinship with our own, it was made in this land, and moves in our northern world beneath our northern sky, and for those who are native to that tongue and land, it must ever call with a profound appeal – until the dragon comes.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception==

===Scholars===

Scholars and critics agree on the work's wide influence. [[Tom Shippey]] wrote that the essay "was seized upon eagerly, even gratefully, by generations of critics".&lt;ref name=Shippey/&gt; [[Alvin A. Lee]] wrote that "Tolkien's manifesto and interpretation have had more influence on readers than any other single study, even though it has been challenged on just about every one of its major points."&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; [[Seth Lerer]] wrote that the essay "may well be the originary piece of modern ''Beowulf'' criticism. … The strategies … control the fundamental assumptions of Old English scholarship for the next fifty years."&lt;ref name=Lerer/&gt; R.D. Fulk commented that "No one denies the historical importance of this lecture. … opening the way to the formalist principles that played such a vital role in the subsequent development of further ''Beowulf'' scholarship. … the methodology … remains a model for emulation.".&lt;ref name=Fulk/&gt; [[Bruce Mitchell (scholar)|Bruce Mitchell]] and Fred C. Robinson call it in their ''Beowulf, An Edition'' (1998) "the most influential literary criticism of the poem ever written".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Bruce |last2=Robinson |first2=Fred C. |title=Beowulf: An Edition |date=1998 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0631172260}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Clark calls it "The most influential critical essay on the poem", stating it without qualification or justification as a known fact.&lt;ref name="BjorkNiles1998"&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, George  |title=The Hero and the Theme |editor1=Bjork, Robert E. |editor2=Niles, John D. |work=A Beowulf Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SaFdpGdjvtoC&amp;pg=PA279 |year=1998 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-6150-0 |page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Lapidge]] similarly names it "his widely influential critical discussion of the poem".&lt;ref name="Lapidge1996"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Lapidge |author-link=Michael Lapidge |title=Anglo-Latin Literature, 600-899 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTWO1z2nO1wC&amp;pg=PA273 |date=January 1996 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-85285-011-1 |page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar and translator [[Roy Liuzza]] commented that Tolkien's essay "is usually credited with re-establishing the [[fable|fabulous]] elements and heroic combats at the center of the modern reader's appreciation of the poem." Liuzza at once went on to write, however, that "the separation of the poem into 'mythical' and 'historical' elements is a false dichotomy". He argues that if myth can condense and hold the deepest sources of tension between self and the social order, and dramatises current ideologies by projecting them into the past, then even the hero Beowulf's mythic fights are at the same time throwing light on society and history.&lt;ref name=Liuzza&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liuzza|first1=Roy|author-link=Roy Liuzza|title=Beowulf: Facing page translation|date=2013|publisher=Broadview|location=Ontario, Canada|isbn=978-1-55481-113-7|page=17|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Patrick Wormald]] wrote of the essay: "it would be no exaggeration to describe [it] as one of the most influential works of literary criticism of that century, and since which nothing in ''Beowulf'' studies has been quite the same."&lt;ref name="Wormald2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wormald, Patrick |title=Times of Bede: Studies in Early English Christian Society and its Historian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KiS5C5PTVvkC&amp;pg=PA35 |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-69265-3 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wormald continues: "The arguments of Tolkien's paper were not universally accepted, and some of its effects would perhaps have been disowned by the author, but its general impact could be summarized by saying that most critics have learnt to take the ''Beowulf'' poet a great deal more seriously".&lt;ref name="Wormald2008"/&gt; Wormald added that

{{quote|Tolkien argued powerfully that, for the Germanic mentality that gave birth to the myth of ''[[Ragnarök]]'', the monsters of the poem were the ''only'' appropriate enemies for a great hero, and thus shifted ''Beowulf''  from the irrelevant fringes to the very centre of the Anglo-Saxon thought world. This naturally encouraged a pre-existent tendency to square the poem with what else was known of the 'serious' levels of Anglo-Saxon thought - chiefly the Latin scholarship of the Church. Secondly, Tolkien went far towards vindicating the structure of the poem by arguing that it was a balance of contrasting and interlocking halves. His thesis not only convinced many critics but inspired them to follow his example, with the result that Tolkien's own position has been outflanked. Whereas previous generations of scholars, Tolkien included, had been quite prepared to explain what they considered structural and stylistic blemishes as interpolations, modern writers seek evidence of artistic refinement in some of the poem's least promising features.&lt;ref name="Wormald2008"/&gt;}}

[[Michael D. C. Drout]] similarly describes the essay's importance and arguments, writing that it

{{quote|is the most important article ever written about ''Beowulf'' … Tolkien's shadow looms long over ''Beowulf'' scholarship. Much of this influence is because of the enormous success of [the essay], which is viewed as the beginning of modern ''Beowulf'' criticism. … Tolkien was so influential ... because he developed a big-picture reading of the poem that has found favour with several generations of critics. … [He] made the first widely accepted case for viewing ''Beowulf'' as aesthetically successful, and he showed how the monsters in ''Beowulf'' were symbolic (not allegorical) representations of chaos and night, set in opposition to stability and civilization. … Thus, Tolkien interpreted the theme of ''Beowulf'' to be that "man, each man and all men and all their works shall die," a theme consistent with the heathen past but one that "no Christian need despise." It was this theme, Tolkien argued, that brought the great dignity to the poem that even scholars who had regretted the monsters had noted.&lt;ref name="Drout2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Drout, Michael D. C. |author-link=Michael D. C. Drout |work=J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment | title=''Beowulf'': Tolkien's Scholarship |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B0loOBA3ejIC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-96942-0|pages=59-60}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Drout then remarks on the paradoxical success of the essay:

{{quote|The massive influence of "[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son|The Homecoming]]" and "''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics" is in some ways ironic. The great majority of Tolkien's work on ''Beowulf'' was of the sort represented by the textual commentry in ''[[Finn and Hengest]]''—detailed, philological, historical, and infinitely painstaking. Yet the most influential of Tolkien's discussions of the poem are those in which he makes the greatest unsupported (or lightly supported) generalizations and in which he discusses the poem in the broadest possible terms. Tolkien would perhaps have seen a fundamental continuity between the detailed and philological and the broader and more interpret[at]ive work, but because of the accidents of publication—and because of Tolkien's great gift for rhetoric—only the latter has shaped the field of ''Beowulf'' criticism.&lt;ref name="Drout2007"/&gt;}}

[[John Niles (scholar)|John D. Niles]] observed that "Bypassing earlier scholarship, critics of the past fifty years have generally traced the current era of ''Beowulf'' studies back to 1936",&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt; meaning to Tolkien's essay, which he called "eloquent and incisive".&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt; Niles argued that the essay quickly came to be a starting point, as scholars from then on assumed—with Tolkien—that the poem was "an aesthetic unity endowed with spiritual significance."&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt; In Niles's view, Tolkien thought that the battles with monsters and the sombre, elegiac tone of the poem expressed the "artistic designs of a deep thinker, religiously enlightened, who let his mind play over a lost heroic world of the imagination",&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt;  in other words that the ''Beowulf'' poet was a man much like Tolkien. Niles cited George Clark's observation that Tolkien left ''Beowulf'' scholars with the "myth of the poet as brooding intellectual, poised between a dying pagan world and a nascent Christian one."&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt; Niles noted that Tolkien's view of the melancholic vision of the ''Beowulf'' poet, and of the heroic fatalism of the poem's leading characters, was not wholly new, but that his view of the poet himself as a hero was.&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt;

===Press===

[[Joan Acocella]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', calls it "a paper that many people regard as not just the finest essay on the poem but one of the finest essays on English literature."&lt;ref name=Acocella&gt;{{cite web |last1=Acocella| first1=Joan |title=Slaying Monsters: Tolkien's Beowulf |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/02/slaying-monsters | publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=23 November 2014| date=2 June 2014 |authorlink=Joan Acocella |quote=In his view, the meaning of the poem had been ignored in favor of archeological and philological study.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that "Tolkien preferred the monsters to the critics."&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;

[[Regina Weinreich]], reviewing ''The Monsters and the Critics: And Other Essays'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that the title essay "revolutionized the study of the early English poem ''Beowulf,'' in which a young hero crushes a human-handed monster called Grendel. Against the scorn of critics, Tolkien defends the centrality and seriousness of literary monsters, declaring his own belief in the symbolic value of such preternatural representations of sheer evil."&lt;ref name=Weinreich&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weinreich |first1=Regina |title=In Short: THE MONSTERS AND THE CRITICS: And Other Essays. By J. R. R. Tolkien |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/17/books/in-short-243684.html?pagewanted=4 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=30 January 2015 |date=17 June 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinreich added that "''Beowulf,'' like other ancient legends, served to nourish Tolkien's imagination."&lt;ref name=Weinreich/&gt;

John Garth, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', describes the paper as "still well worth reading, not only as an introduction to the poem, but also because it decisively changed the direction and emphasis of Beowulf scholarship. Up to that point it had been used as a quarry of linguistic, historical and archaeological detail".&lt;ref name=Garth&gt;{{cite web |last1=Garth |first1=John |title=JRR Tolkien's translation of Beowulf: bring on the monsters |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/22/jrr-tolkien-translation-beowulf-monsters |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=23 November 2014 |date=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garth notes that

{{quote|Tolkien pushed the monsters to the forefront. He argued that they represent the impermanence of human life, the mortal enemy that can strike at the heart of everything we hold dear, the force against which we need to muster all our strength – even if ultimately we may lose the fight. Without the monsters, the peculiarly northern courage of Beowulf and his men is meaningless. Tolkien, veteran of the Somme, knew that it was not.&lt;ref name=Garth/&gt;}}

===Translator===
[[File:Seamus Heaney Photograph Edit.jpg|thumb|upright|The poet and ''Beowulf'' translator [[Seamus Heaney]] praised ''The Monsters and the Critics''.]]

Tolkien's paper was praised by the Irish poet [[Seamus Heaney]] in the introduction to his critically acclaimed [[translation]] of ''Beowulf''. He wrote that the "epoch-making paper"&lt;ref name=Heaney&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heaney |first1=Seamus |title=Beowulf |date=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Faber and Faber |isbn=0-571-20376-0 |page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; stood out in considering ''Beowulf'' as literature. Heaney argued that Tolkien "took for granted the poem's integrity and distinction as a work of art",&lt;ref name=Heaney/&gt; and showed how the poem achieved that status:

{{quote|Tolkien assumed that the poet had felt his way through the inherited material - the fabulous elements and the traditional accounts of a heroic past - and by a combination of creative intuition and conscious structuring had arrived at a unity of effect and a balanced order. He assumed, in other words, that the ''Beowulf'' poet was an imaginative writer rather than some kind of back-formation derived from nineteenth-century [[folklore]] and [[philology]].&lt;ref name=Heaney/&gt;}}

Heaney called the paper's literary treatment  "brilliant".&lt;ref name=Heaney/&gt; He suggested that it had changed the way that ''Beowulf'' was valued, and that it had started "a new era of appreciation" of the poem.&lt;ref name=Heaney/&gt;

===New light from Tolkien's ''Beowulf'' translation===

Tolkien's own translation of ''Beowulf'', published posthumously in 2014 as ''[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary]]'', has been linked to the essay.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garth/&gt; Shippey has argued that the translation throws light on "what Tolkien really thought in 1936". Tolkien stated, for instance, that Beowulf was not an actual picture of Scandinavia around 500 AD, but was a self-consistent picture with the marks of design and thought. This might leave the reader wondering, commented Shippey, what exactly Tolkien meant by that. Shippey argued that there was evidence from the chronology given in the 2014 book, supported by the work of scholars such as Martin Rundkvist, that there was serious trouble among the eastern Geats, with migration and the taking over of mead-halls by new leaders, at that time, just as portrayed in the poem.&lt;ref name=Shippey2017&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shippey |first1=Tom |title=JRR Tolkien's Beowulf with Dr. Tom Shippey - Lecture 3 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl8-pYYLNFQ |publisher=Signum University |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rundkvist&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rundkvist |first1=Martin |title=Mead-Halls of the Eastern Geats |url=http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/wp-content/blogs.dir/417/files/2012/04/i-622119bd51bd29c8f4006bdff70524df-Rundkvist%202011%20Mead-halls.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316213745/http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/wp-content/blogs.dir/417/files/2012/04/i-622119bd51bd29c8f4006bdff70524df-Rundkvist%202011%20Mead-halls.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Robert Knight''' (October 21, 1874 – April 15, 1953) was an [[United States|American]] [[Animal painter|wildlife]] and [[paleoart]]ist best known for his  paintings of [[dinosaur]]s and other [[prehistory|prehistoric]] animals. His works have been reproduced in many books and are currently on display at several major museums in the United States.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Knight was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].

As a child, Knight was deeply interested in nature and animals, and spent many hours copying the illustrations from his father's [[natural history]] books. Though [[blindness|legally blind]] because of [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] and a subsequent injury to his right eye, Knight pursued his artistic talents with the help of specially designed glasses, and at the age of twelve, he enrolled at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Art School]] to become a [[drawing|commercial artist]]. In 1890, he was hired by a church-decorating firm to design [[stained glass|stained-glass windows]], and after two years with them, became a [[freelancer|freelance]] illustrator for books and [[magazine]]s, specializing in nature scenes.

In his free time, Knight visited the [[American Museum of Natural History]], attracting the attention of Dr. Jacob Wortman, who asked Knight to paint a restoration of a prehistoric [[pig]], ''[[Elotherium]]'', whose [[fossil]]ized bones were on display. Knight applied his knowledge of modern pig [[anatomy]], and used his imagination to fill in any gaps. Wortman was thrilled with the final result, and the museum soon commissioned Knight to produce an entire series of [[watercolor]]s to grace their fossil halls. His paintings were hugely popular among visitors, and Knight continued to work with the museum well into the 1930s, painting what would become some of the world's most celebrated images of dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, and prehistoric humans.

One of Knight's best-known pieces for the American Museum of Natural History is 1897's ''Leaping [[Dryptosaurus|Laelaps]]'', which was one of the few pre-1960s images to present dinosaurs as active, fast-moving creatures (thus anticipating the "[[Dinosaur renaissance|Dinosaur Renaissance]]" theories of modern [[paleontologist]]s like [[Robert Bakker]]). Other familiar American Museum paintings include Knight's portrayals of ''[[Agathaumas]]'', ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Apatosaurus|Brontosaurus]]'', ''[[Smilodon]]'', and the [[Mammoth|Woolly Mammoth]]. All of these have been reproduced in numerous places and have inspired many imitations.

Knight's work for the museum was not without critics, however: many curators argued that his work was more artistic than scientific, and protested that he did not have sufficient scientific expertise to render prehistoric animals as precisely as he did. While Knight himself agreed that his murals for the Hall of the Age of Man were "primarily a work of art," he insisted that he had as much paleontological knowledge as the museum's own curators.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Victoria.

===Nationwide attention===

After Knight established a reputation at the American Museum of Natural History, other natural history museums began requesting paintings for their own fossil exhibits. In 1925, for example, Knight produced an elaborate mural for the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] which portrayed some of the [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s whose remains had been found in the nearby [[La Brea Tar Pits]]. The following year, Knight began a 28-[[mural]] series for [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]'s [[Field Museum of Natural History]], a project which chronicled the history of life on earth and took four years to complete. At the Field Museum, he produced one of his best-known pieces, a mural featuring ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]''. This confrontation scene between a [[predator]] and its [[prey]] would inspire a huge number of imitations, establishing the two dinosaurs as "mortal enemies" in the popular consciousness. The Field Museum's Alexander Sherman says, "It is so well-loved that it has become the standard encounter for portraying the age of dinosaurs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlesrknight.com/Alexander_Sherman.htm "Charles Knight: Prehistoric Visions of a Beloved Muralist"] 2002 Field Museum, In the Field article by Alexander Sherman&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charles R. Knight.jpg|thumb|Knight working on ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' in 1899.]] 
Knight's work also found its way to the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Museums]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and Yale's [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]], among others. Several [[zoo]]s, such as the [[Bronx Zoo]], the [[Lincoln Park|Lincoln Park Zoo]], and the [[Brookfield Zoo]], also approached Knight to paint murals of their living animals, and Knight enthusiastically complied. Knight was actually the only person in America allowed to paint [[Su Lin (1930s giant panda)|Su Lin]], a [[giant panda]] that lived at Brookfield Zoo during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="InterviewRKK"&gt;{{cite journal

While making murals for museums and zoos, Knight continued illustrating books and magazines, and became a frequent contributor to ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''. He also wrote and illustrated several books of his own, such as ''Before the Dawn of History'' (Knight, 1935), ''Life Through the Ages'' (1946), ''Animal Drawing: Anatomy and Action for Artists'' (1947), and ''Prehistoric Man: The Great Adventure'' (1949). Additionally, Knight became a popular [[lecture]]r, describing prehistoric life to audiences across the country.

Eventually, Knight began to retire from the public sphere to spend more time with his grandchildren, who shared his passion for animals and prehistoric life. In 1951, he painted his last work, a mural for the [[Everhart Museum]] in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. Two years later, he died in Manhattan.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Pasta-Brontosaurus.jpg|thumb|''Brontosaurus'', 1897.]]
Knight has been hailed as "one of the great popularizers of the prehistoric past", and as having influenced generations of museum-goers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=J. C.|doi=10.1525/aa.2003.105.1.143 |title=A Note on the Paintings of Prehistoric Ancestors by Charles R. Knight|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=105|pages=143–146|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Knight's work frequently appeared in dinosaur books published in the US during the first half of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Stout|2005|page=xi |ps=. "There was scarcely a dinosaur book published in the first sixty years of the 20th century that did not include examples of Knight's work."}} Many works released since then also include examples of Knight's paintings; for example, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] used one of Knight's paintings for the cover of his 1991 book ''[[Bully for Brontosaurus]]'' and another in his 1996 book ''[[Dinosaur in a Haystack]]''. Though many other paleoartists have succeeded Knight (most notably [[Zdeněk Burian]]) Knight's paintings still remain very popular among paleontology enthusiasts. A commemorative edition of Knight's 1946 book ''Life Through the Ages'' {{ISBN|0-253-33928-6}} was recently published by [[Indiana University|Indiana University Press]], and a 2007 [[calendar]] {{ISBN|0-7649-3622-0}} of Knight's paintings is also currently available. Additionally, fantasy artist [[William Stout]] has compiled a series of ''Charles Knight Sketchbooks'', which contain many rare and previously unpublished drawings and [[study (drawing)|studies]] by Knight. 
[[Image:Agathaumas.jpg|thumb|left|Knight's restoration of ''Agathaumas'' from 1897, which was later used as basis for a model ''Agathaumas'' used in the 1925 film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://silentmoviemonsters.tripod.com/TheLostWorld/LWDELGADO.html Marcel Delgado: The Man Who Made Monsters] Retrieved October 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Because Knight worked in an era when new and often fragmentary fossils were coming out of the American west in quantity, not all of his creations were based on solid evidence; dinosaurs such as his improbably-adorned ''[[Agathaumas]]'' (1897) for example, were somewhat speculative. His depictions of better-known [[ceratopsians]] as solitary animals inhabiting lush grassy landscapes were largely imaginative (the grasslands that feature in many of his paintings didn't appear until the [[Cenozoic]]).
Although Knight sometimes made musculoskeletal studies of living animals, he did not do so for his dinosaur restorations, and he restored many dinosaurs with typical reptilian-like limbs and narrow hips (Paul, 1996). In the 1920s, studies by the celebrated palaeontologists [[Alfred Romer]] and [[Gerhard Heilmann]] (Heilmann, 1926) had confirmed that dinosaurs had broad avian-like hips rather than those of a typical reptile. Knight often restored extinct mammals, birds and marine reptiles in very dynamic action poses, but his depictions of large dinosaurs as ponderous swamp-dwellers destined for extinction reflected more traditional concepts (Paul, 1996). In his catalogue to ''Life through the Ages'' (1946), he reiterated views that he had written earlier (Knight, 1935), describing the great beasts as "slow-moving dunces" that were "unadaptable and unprogressive" while conceding that small dinosaurs had been more active. Some of his pictures are now known to be wrong, such as the tripod kangaroo-like posture of the [[hadrosaurs]] and [[theropods]], whereas their spinal column was roughly horizontal at the hip; and the [[sauropods]] standing deeply in water whereas they were land-dwellers. Knight also drew dinosaur tails dragging on the ground, whereas they were held out approximately horizontally.
[[File:Font-de-Gaume.jpg|thumb|Cro-Magnon artists painting in Font-de-Gaume, 1920]] 
The late [[Stephen Jay Gould]] was one of Knight's most well-known fans, notably refusing to refer to ''Brontosaurus'' as "''[[Apatosaurus]]''" because Knight had always referred to the creature with the former name.&lt;ref name="InterviewRKK"/&gt; Gould writes in his 1989 book ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', "Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day".&lt;ref name="WorldCRK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlesrknight.com |title=Welcome to the World of Charles R. Knight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other admirers have included [[special effects]] artist [[Ray Harryhausen]], who writes in his autobiography ''An Animated Life'', "Long before Obie ([[Willis O'Brien]]), myself, and [[Steven Spielberg]], he put flesh on creatures that no human had ever seen. […] At the L.A. County Museum I vividly remember a beautiful Knight mural on one of the walls depicting the way the tar pits would have looked in ancient times. This, plus a picture book about Knight's work my mother gave me, were my first encounters with a man who was to prove an enormous help when the time came for me to make three-dimensional models of these extinct beings".&lt;ref name="WorldCRK"/&gt; Paleoartist [[Gregory S. Paul]] has also mentioned Knight as a big influence on him.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2012 a book about Knight and his art written by [[Richard Milner (historian)|Richard Milner]] titled ''Charles R. Knight The Artist Who Saw Through Time'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parrish|first1=M.

An homage to the painter was also made in the [[IMAX]] feature film, ''[[T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous]]'', in which he was portrayed by actor Tuck Milligan.

==Design ==
The visual appearance of Chitti was based on the [[G.I. Joe]] [[action figure]]s. For Chitti's [[2.0 (film)|2.0]] version look, its hair was spiked and brown coloured lenses were used for its eyes, whereas for its "good robot" look, green coloured lenses were used.

==Abilities==
Chitti is described by Vaseegaran as an advanced "[[Humanoid robot|andro-humanoid]]" robot. Over his metallic body, he sports synthetic inorganic skin molded after Vaseegaran himself. He is designed with a speed capacity of 1 Terahertz (Hz) and a memory capacity of 1 Zettabyte.

Initially, Chitti has been programmed with almost all the existing world knowledge managed to put in computable terms in his CPU, thus he is knowledgeable and proficient in all forms of academia, martial arts, communication, creative outlets, athletic skills, and scientific ingenuity. 
Underneath his synthetic skin, he is fire, water, and acid-resistant. 

In his original form, he is partially resistant to severe damage such as gunshots, though he can still be damaged or destroyed by properly aimed and adequately forceful attacks such as being chopped with an axe in the joints. Severe electrocution can also overload short-circuit him.  As long as his CPU head is still functioning, Chitti is able to repair or fix back his minor parts such as eyes. However, for large damage such as limbs being chopped off, he can only put them back in place and function at a much slower speed.

Chitti's eyes are able to not only see and scan his surroundings to extremely acute detail, including X-ray vision, but they can also serve as high-definition projectors. His eyes also allow him to pick up additional skills within seconds. He can also perform virtual phone calls, with displaying his caller or receiver through his eyes as a hologram. However, on downside, the eyes get bleached when exposed to flash light.

Chitti is able to adhere to metal objects through his selective magnetism. This allows him to both render his foes weaponless, as well as fly for a certain distance to any nearby metallic structure. He is physically able to exert superhuman speed, agility and strength; he is at least able to lift with ease a convertible car, and even pull two trucks towards himself while they are in motion. In the second half of ''Enthiran'' as well as in ''2.0'', he designs and equips himself with a "handgun", which is basically a retractable firearm within his right hand.

Chitti's only known weaknesses are flashing lights, which temporarily distort his sight, and his susceptibility to battery drainage. However, in the case of the latter, he just needs to absorb a bare minimum amount of electric power to recharge himself in a matter of seconds.

==Appearances==
In the first film, ''[[Enthiran]]'', Chitti (played by [[Rajnikanth]]) is an android robot created by Dr. Vaseegaran, (also played by Rajinikanth). Dr. Vaseegaran, who is specialised in robotics, created Chitti after a decade of intensive research. Chitti was first created without emotions however in order for the robot to understand human behaviour, Vaseegaran taught the robot about them. But then the robot fell in love with the scientist's fiancée, Sana (played by [[Aishwarya Rai]]) and thus it caused conflict between them. Angered by the robot, Vaseegaran literally chopped the robot into pieces. He was found by Dr. Bohra (played by [[Danny Denzongpa]]) and upgrade into 2.0 because of a red chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Hindu : Entertainment Chennai : Director's dream project |url=https://www.thehindu.com/fr/2005/03/11/stories/2005031101810100.htm |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He converts it into a ruthless killer and turned into an evil destructive killing machine and killed Bohra. He then went after Vaseegaran and Sana and crashed their wedding. He showed numerous other powerful abilities including shape shifting as well as duplicating. He caused so much damage and destruction to the city. However, Vaseegaran managed to defeat and stop Chitti. Since he caused so much damage and destruction to the city, he was de-activated and dismantled. His body parts were then displayed in the museum in the year 2030 as the most advanced humanoid robot ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Script decides the fate of the movie' |url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/lsquoScript-decides-the-fate-of-the-movie/article15609945.ece |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=The Hindu |date=27 December 2010 |language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chitti reappeared in the film ''[[Ra.One]]'' in a special appearance and communicated with [[G.One (character)|G.One]] (played by [[Shah Rukh Khan]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Revealed!

This appearance is non-canon, meaning both this and Chitti's film franchise don't share the same continuity.

In the 2018 film ''[[2.0 (film)|2.0]]'' with Rajnikanth reprising his role one more time, Chitti is forced to be reassembled by Dr. Vaseegaran and the Indian Army in order to stop the antagonist, [[Fifth force]], which is controlled by Pakshi Rajan, an [[Ornithologist]] (played by [[Akshay Kumar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2.0: Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar film trailer to release on Diwali 2018? |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/2point0-trailer-on-diwali-2018-rajinikanth-akshay-kumar-1346962-2018-09-23 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=India Today |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Rajinikanth Effect: 2.0 Teaser Gets Blockbuster Welcome - 32 Million Views in 24 Hours |url=https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/the-rajinikanth-effect-2-0-teaser-gets-blockbuster-welcome-32-million-views-in-24-hours-1916413 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2.0 Movie Review : Is 2.0 worth for watching or not? |url=https://www.indianpeopletimes.com/entertainment/2-0-movie-review-is-2-0-worth-for-watching-or-not|accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=indianpeopletimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;But Chitti is defeated and destroyed in his original form by the antagonist, which leads his CPU head to being rebooted in another advanced mechanical body, identifying himself as Chitti reloaded version '2.0', and will also fall in love with his female counterpart, the super-android Nila (played by [[Amy Jackson]]), also created by Vaseegaran. Alongside Chitti, there is another robot created known as "Kutty Chitti" (3.0) which is a microbot capable of shape-shifting.

The '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Republic of Croatia]]''' ({{lang-hr|Grb Republike Hrvatske}}) consists of one main shield and five smaller shields which form a crown over the main shield. The main coat of arms is a [[checkerboard]] ([[chequy]]) that consists of 13 red and 12 silver (white) fields. It's also informally known in Croatian as '''''šahovnica''''' ("chessboard", from ''šah'', "chess"). The five smaller shields represent five different historical regions within Croatia.

==History==
The checkerboard coat of arms (''šahovnica'') is first attested as an official symbol of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]] on an [[Innsbruck]] tower depicting the emblem of [[Maximilian I, Archduke of Austria]] in 1495.&lt;ref name="Wappen"&gt;Karl-Heinz Hesmer: ''Chronik griffbereit: Flaggen und Wappen der Welt''. Wissen Media Verlag GmbH, 2008. {{ISBN|978-3-577-14537-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neubecker"&gt;Ottfried Neubecker: ''Wappen – ihr Ursprung, Sinn und Wert'', {{ISBN|3-8105-1306-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared on a seal from the [[Cetingrad Charter]] that confirmed the [[1527 election in Cetin|1527 election of Ferdinand I, Archduke of Austria as king of Croatia in Cetin]].&lt;ref name="Neubecker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Historical"&gt;Robert Stallaerts: ''Historical dictionary of Croatia''. Scarecrow Press, Inc. 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-8108-6750-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Layton, Julian Thomas, Peter G. Stone: ''Destruction and conservation of cultural property''. Routledge, 2001. {{ISBN|0-415-21695-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the design has often been purported as being medieval. Historic tradition states it to be the arms of  [[Stephen Držislav of Croatia|Stephen Držislav]] in the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy, Alex J. (2003). ''The Formation of Croatian National Identity: A Centuries-old Dream''. Manchester University Press. p. 36. {{ISBN|0-7190-6502-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Split (city)|Split]] stone baptistry from the time of [[Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia|Peter Krešimir IV]] (r. 1058–1074/5) has engraved falcons that carry something that resembles a chequy on their wings, and the [[bell tower ]] of the medieval [[Church of St. Lucy, Jurandvor]] has a checkerboard pattern carved onto it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Ethnologia Europaea | volume = 25–26 | page = 78 | editor = Bjarne Stoklund | author = Jonas Frykman | author2 = Gösta Arvastson | publisher = Museum Tusculanum Press | year = 1995 | isbn = 9788772893426 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ioe1OOZG71AC&amp;pg=PA78 | accessdate = 2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the checkerboard ranges from 3×3 to 8×8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=76849|journal=Vjesnik Arheološkog muzeja u Zagrebu|publisher=Archaeological Museum in Zagreb|issn=0350-7165|title=Stari grbovi zemalja Nezavisne Države Hrvatske|trans-title=Ancient Arms of Lands of the Independent State of Croatia|language=Croatian|volume=22–23|issue=1|date=January 1942|author=Emilij Laszowski|pages=207–221|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most commonly 5×5, like in the current design. It was traditionally conjectured that the colours originally represented two ancient Croat states, [[Red Croats|Red Croatia]] and [[White Croats|White Croatia]], but there is no historical evidence to support this.

Towards the [[Late Middle Ages]] the distinction for the three crown lands ([[Croatia proper]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Slavonia]]) was made. The ''šahovnica'' was used as the coat of arms of Croatia proper &amp; together with the shields of Slavonia and Dalmatia was often used to represent the whole of Croatia in [[Austria-Hungary]]. It was used as an unofficial coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] adopted in 1848 and as an official coat of arms of the post-1868 [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (both unofficially known as [[Triune Kingdom]]). The two are the same except for the position of the ''šahovnica'' and Dalmatian coat of arms which are switched around &amp; with different crowns used above the shield – the later employing St Stephen's crown (associated with Hungarian kings).

By late 19th century ''šahovnica'' had come to be considered a generally recognized symbol for Croats and Croatia and in 1919, it was included in the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) to represent Croats. When the [[Banovina of Croatia]] was formed, the ''šahovnica'' (chequy gules and argent) was retained as the official symbol.

The  [[Ustashe]] regime which had ruled Croatia during the [[World War II]] superimposed their ideological symbol, the letter "U" above or around the ''šahovnica'' (upper left square white) as the official national symbol during their rule.

After the [[Second World War]], the new Socialist Republic of Croatia became a part of the federal [[SFRY|Second Yugoslavia]]. The ''šahovnica'' was included in the new socialist coat of arms.&lt;ref name="sahovnica"&gt;Jonas Frykman, Jonas Frykman Gösta Arvastson: ''Ethnologia Europaea'', Volume 26, 1995. {{ISBN|87-7289-342-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designed in the socialist tradition, including symbols like wheat for peasants and an anvil for workers, as well as a rising sun to symbolize a new morning and a [[red star]] for [[communism]].

During the change to multiparty elections in Croatia (as part of the collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe from the late 1980s), and prior to the establishment of the current design, the ''šahovnica'', shedding the communist symbols that were the hallmark of [[Croatia in the second Yugoslavia]], reappeared as a stand-alone symbol as both the 'upper left square red' and 'upper left square white' variants. The choice of 'upper left square red' or 'upper left square white' was often dictated by heraldic laws and aesthetic requirements.

The first-field-white variant was adopted by the [[Republic of Croatia]] and used briefly in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people= | date=1990-06-20 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8ath2k53vo | title=SRH preimenovana u RH |trans-title=Socialist Republic of Croatia is renamed to Republic of Croatia | medium=Motion picture, [[TV kalendar]] | location=[[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] | publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to constitutional changes which came into effect on 26 June 1990 the red star in the flag of [[SR Croatia]] was to be replaced by the "historical Croatian coat of arms with 25 red and white fields", without specifying order of fields.&lt;ref name="heimer1990"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeljko-heimer-fame.from.hr/hrvat/hr-hist.html#hr-1990|title=Republika Hrvatska, 1990.|last=Heimer|first=Željko|work=The Flags and Arms of the Modern Era|language=Croatian|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first-field-white variant was used at the official flag hoisting ceremony on 25 July and was later occasionally used on par with the first-field-red variant until 12 December 1990 when the current coat of arms was officially adopted.&lt;ref name="heimer1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="udrugahrvpol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhp.hr/dan|title=Dan udruge|publisher=Udruga hrvatski policajac|language=Croatian|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current design==
On 21 December 1990, the post-socialist government of Croatia, passed a law prescribing the design created by the [[graphic designer]] [[Miroslav Šutej]], under the aegis of a commission chaired by Nikša Stančić, then head of the Department of [[History of Croatia|Croatian History]] at the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb|Faculty of Philosophy]], [[University of Zagreb]].

The new design added the five crowning shields which represent the [[regions of Croatia]]. They are, from left to right:

[[Dubrovnik|Dubrovnik region]] – [[Coat of arms of Dubrovnik]]: [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], two bars gules – Two red stripes on a dark blue shield. This is a simplified variation of the [[Coat of arms of Dubrovnik]], with two red bars instead of four; it was used by [[Dubrovnik Republic]] since the 14th century.

[[Dalmatia]] – [[Coat of arms of Dalmatia]]: Bleu celeste, three leopards' heads affrontés caboshed Or, crowned Or – Three golden, crowned [[Leopard (heraldry)|heraldic leopard]] heads, two over one, on a blue shield. The depicted version from the crown differs from the traditional depiction of these arms: traditionally, the leopards are roaring and langued (i.e. with tongues visible), and the colour of the shield is [[Azure (heraldry)|heraldic azure]], not bleu celeste. Historically, this coat of arms was in use since at least the 14th century. The first officially recorded use goes back to [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis I]] and his daughter [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Queen Mary]] who both used an earlier version of the arms as part of their personal coat of arms. Until 1526 this coat of arms was also used to represent Croatia in general,&lt;ref name="Grbovnica Slavonije"/&gt; apparent from the coat of arms of several kings: [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]], [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]], [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]].

Some of the more traditional [[heraldry|heraldic]] pundits have criticized the latest design for various design solutions, such as adding a crown to the coat, varying shades of blue in its even fields, and adding the red border around the coat. The government has accepted their criticism insofar as not accepting further non-traditional designs for the [[Counties of Croatia|county]] coats of arms, but the national symbol has remained intact.

Unlike in many countries, Croatian design more commonly uses symbolism from the coat of arms, rather than from the [[Flag of Croatia|Croatian flag]]. This is partly due to the geometric design of the shield which makes it appropriate for use in many graphic contexts (e.g. the insignia of [[Croatia Airlines]] or the design of the shirt for the [[Croatia national football team]]), and partly because the [[Pan-Slavic colors]] are present in many European flags.

===Historical versions of the crown arms===
Most coats of arms used in the crown on the modern-day coat of arms differ slightly from historically accurate versions.

==Guiding designs by performance improvements==
[[File:Computer-automated design.png|thumb|right|350px|Interaction in computer-automated design]]
To meet the ever-growing demand of quality and competitiveness, iterative physical prototyping is now often replaced by '[[digital prototyping]]' of a 'good design', which aims to meet multiple objectives such as maximised output, energy efficiency, highest speed and cost-effectiveness. The design problem concerns both finding the best design within a known range (i.e., through 'learning' or 'optimisation') and finding a new and better design beyond the existing ones (i.e., through creation and invention). This is equivalent to a [[search problem]] in an almost certainly, multidimensional (multivariate), multi-modal space with a single (or weighted) objective or multiple objectives.

==Normalized objective function: cost vs. fitness==
Using single-objective CAutoD as an example, if the objective function, either as a [[Loss function|cost function]] &lt;math&gt;J\in[0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;, or inversely, as a [[fitness function]] &lt;math&gt;f\in(0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;f = \tfrac{J}{1+J}&lt;/math&gt;,

is differentiable under practical constraints in the multidimensional space, the design problem may be solved analytically. Finding the parameter sets that result in a zero first-order derivative and that satisfy the second-order derivative conditions would reveal all local optima. Then comparing the values of the performance index of all the local optima, together with those of all boundary parameter sets, would lead to the global optimum, whose corresponding 'parameter' set will thus represent the best design.  However, in practice, the optimization usually involves multiple objectives and the matters involving derivatives are lot more complex.

==Dealing with practical objectives==
In practice, the objective value may be noisy or even non-numerical, and hence its gradient information may be unreliable or unavailable. This is particularly true when the problem is multi-objective.  At present, many designs and refinements are mainly made through a manual trial-and-error process with the help of a CAD [[simulation]] package. Usually, such ''[[a posteriori]]'' learning or adjustments need to be repeated many times until a ‘satisfactory’ or ‘optimal’ design emerges.

==Exhaustive search==
In theory, this adjustment process can be automated by computerised search, such as [[exhaustive search]].  As this is an [[exponential algorithm]], it may not deliver solutions in practice within a limited period of time.

==Search in polynomial time==
One approach to [[virtual engineering]] and automated design is [[evolutionary computation]] such as [[evolutionary algorithm]]s.

===Evolutionary algorithms===
To reduce the search time, the biologically-inspired evolutionary algorithm (EA) can be used instead, which is a (non-deterministic) [[Exponential algorithm#Polynomial time|polynomial algorithm]].  The EA based multi-objective "search team" can be interfaced with an existing CAD simulation package in a batch mode. The EA encodes the design parameters (encoding being necessary if some parameters are non-numerical) to refine multiple candidates through parallel and interactive search. In the search process, '[[natural selection|selection]]' is performed using '[[survival of the fittest]]' ''a posteriori'' learning. To obtain the next 'generation' of possible solutions, some parameter values are exchanged between two candidates (by an operation called '[[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]]') and new values introduced (by an operation called '[[mutation]]'). This way, the evolutionary technique makes use of past trial information in a similarly intelligent manner to the human designer.

The EA based optimal designs can start from the designer's existing design database or from an initial generation of candidate designs obtained randomly. A number of finally evolved top-performing candidates will represent several automatically optimized digital prototypes.

There are websites that demonstrate interactive evolutionary algorithms for design. [http://EndlessForms.com EndlessForms.com] allows you to evolve 3D objects online and have them 3D printed.  [http://www.picbreeder.org PicBreeder.org] allows you to do the same for 2D images.

The '''culture of the United States of America''' is primarily of [[Western culture]] ([[Europe]]an) origin and form, but is influenced by a [[multi-culturalism|multicultural ethos]] that includes [[African American|African]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[Asian American|Asian]], [[Polynesian American|Polynesian]], and [[Latin America]]n people and their cultures. It also has its own social and cultural characteristics, such as [[American English|dialect]], [[Music of the United States|music]], [[Visual art of the United States|arts]], [[society of the United States|social habits]], [[cuisine of the United States|cuisine]], and [[Folklore of the United States|folklore]]. The [[United States|United States of America]] is an ethnically and racially [[Multiculturalism|diverse]] country as a result of large-scale migration from many countries throughout its history.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt; Many American cultural elements, especially from [[popular culture]], have [[Cultural globalization|spread across the globe]] through modern [[mass media]].

==Origins, development, and spread==

The [[Europe]]an roots of the United States are in the [[English American|English]] settlers of [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]] during [[Thirteen Colonies|British rule]]. The varieties of English people as opposed to the other peoples in the British Isles were the overwhelming majority ethnic group in the 17th century (population of the colonies in 1700 250,000) and were 47.9% of percent of the total population  of 3. 9 million. They constituted 60% of the whites at the first census in 1790 (%, 3.5 Welsh, 8.5 Scotch Irish, 4.3 Scots, 4.7 Southern Irish, 7.2 German, 2.7 Dutch, 1.7 French and .2 Swedish), The American Revolution, Colin Bonwick, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;254. The English ethnic group contributed the major cultural and social mindset and attitudes that evolved into the American character. Of the total population in each colony they numbered from 30% in Pennsylvania to 85% in Massachusetts, Becoming America, Jon Butler, 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–11. Large non-English immigrant populations from the 1720s to 1775, such as the Germans (100,000 or more), Scotch Irish (250,000), added enriched and modified the English cultural substrate, The Encyclopedia of Colonial and Revolutionary America, Ed. John Mack Faragher, 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;200–202. The religious outlook was some versions of Protestantism (1.6% of the population were English, German and Irish Catholics ).

The British colonies inherited the English language, [[English law|legal system]], and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]], which was the majority cultural heritage. Parts of what are now the United States were colonized by [[New France|France]], [[New Spain|Spain]], [[New Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[New Sweden|Sweden]], [[Danish West Indies|Denmark]], [[Russian America|Russia]], and Japan ([[Northern Mariana Islands]] and briefly [[Guam]]).{{refn|Short-lived conquests and unsuccessful colonies which had little if any lasting cultural impact include [[Norse colonization of North America]] which was mainly confined to Greenland, possession of [[St. Croix]] by the [[Knights Hospitaller]], and the Scottish colony [[Scottish colonization of the Americas#Stuarts Town.2C Carolina .281684.29|Stuarts Town, Carolina]] which pre-dates English-Scottish unification into the United Kingdom.}}  Though eventually overtaken by British or American territorial expansion, the longer they lasted the more these earlier colonial societies contributed to modern-day culture, including place names, architecture, religion, language, and food.

[[Jeffersonian democracy]] was a foundational American cultural innovation, which is still a core part of the country's identity.&lt;ref name=MJ&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nf22_zMVdqsC&amp;dq "Mr. Jefferson and the giant moose: natural history in early America"], Lee Alan Dugatkin. University of Chicago Press, 2009. {{ISBN|0-226-16914-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-16914-9}}. University of Chicago Press, 2009. Chapter x.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Jefferson's ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American and was written in reaction to the views of some influential Europeans that America's native flora, fauna, including humans, were [[degeneration|degenerate]].&lt;ref name=MJ /&gt;

Major cultural influences have been brought by historical immigration, especially from [[Culture of Germany|Germany]] in much of the country,&lt;ref name=kirschbaum&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirschbaum|first=Erik|title=The eradication of German culture in the United States, 1917-1918|year=1986|publisher=H.-D. Heinz|isbn=3-88099-617-2|page=155|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_eradication_of_German_culture_in_the.html?id=JvUMAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland and Italy in the Northeast, Japan in Hawaii.  [[Latin American culture]] is especially pronounced in former Spanish areas but has also been introduced by immigration, as has [[Asian American culture]]s (especially on the West Coast).  Forced migration during the [[Atlantic slave trade]], followed by liberation won in the [[American Civil War]] created [[African-American culture]] which pervades the South and other areas receiving internal immigrants during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migrations]].  Blending Southern and traditional African culture to some degree, this uniquely American culture has its own dialect; has contributed significant innovation in music, dance, and fashion; embraced a struggle by many African-Americans for political and economic equality; and is associated with significant populations of African-American Muslims and Christians in "[[Black church]]es".  [[Rap]] and music videos featuring African-American urban street culture have appeared in countries and melded with local performance cultures worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:Category:Rappers by nationality]] for a sampling.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many mainland [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes and nations were overpowered by European colonists and American territorial expansion, but even in the areas they were pushed out of left cultural influences such as place names, knowledge about [[New World crops]]; [[cultural appropriation]] and the history military rivalry resulted in Native American-themed sports mascots.  Native culture remains strong in areas with large undisturbed or relocated populations, including traditional government and communal organization of property now legally managed by [[Indian reservations]] (large reservations are mostly in the West, especially [[Arizona]] and [[South Dakota]]).  The fate of native culture after contact with Europeans is quite varied.  For example, [[Taíno]] culture in U.S. Caribbean territories is nearly extinct and like most Native American languages, the [[Taíno language]] is no longer spoken.  In contrast the [[Hawaiian language]] and [[culture of the Native Hawaiians]] has survived in [[Hawaii]] and mixed with that of immigrants from the mainland U.S. (starting before the [[Newlands Resolution|1898 annexation]]) and to some degree Japanese immigrants. It occasionally influences mainstream American culture with notable exports like [[surfing]] and [[Hawaiian shirt]]s.  Most languages native to what is now U.S. territory have gone extinct, and the economic and mainstream cultural dominance of English threatens the surviving ones in most places.  The most common native languages include [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Navajo language]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], [[Sioux language|Sioux]], and a spectrum of [[Inuit languages]].  (See [[Indigenous languages of the Americas]] for a fuller listing, plus [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]], and [[Carolinian language|Carolinian]] in the Pacific territories.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/most-us-canada.htm|title=Most Commonly Spoken Native American/First Nations Languages|website=Native-languages.org|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samoan people|Ethnic Samoans]] are a majority in [[American Samoa]]; [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] are still the largest ethnic group in [[Guam]] (though a minority), and along with [[Refaluwasch]] are smaller minorities in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]].

American culture includes both conservative and liberal elements, scientific and religious competitiveness, political structures, risk taking and free expression, materialist and moral elements. Despite certain consistent ideological principles (e.g. [[individualism]], [[egalitarianism]], and faith in [[freedom]] and [[democracy]]), American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity. The flexibility of U.S. culture and its highly symbolic nature lead some researchers to categorize American culture as a [[Political myth|mythic]] identity;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, James (2010) ''Interplay:Communication, Memory, and Media in the United States''. Goettingen: Cuvillier, p. 120. {{ISBN|3-86955-322-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others see it as [[American exceptionalism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The United States has traditionally been thought of as a [[melting pot]], with immigrants contributing to but eventually [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] with mainstream American culture. However, beginning in the 1960s and continuing on in the present day, the country trends towards cultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]], [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]], and the image of a [[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121231163410/http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/132541]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/factover/ch1.htm |title=''One from Many, Portrait of the USA'' |publisher=United States Information Agency |last=Clack, George |date=September 1997 |chapter=Chapter 1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dealing with Diversity"&gt;{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  |author2=Pearlie Strother-Adams  | year =2001  | title =''Dealing with Diversity''  | publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company  | location =Chicago, IL | isbn = 0-7872-8145-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the country's history, certain subcultures (whether based on ethnicity or other commonality, such as the [[gay village]]) have dominated certain neighborhoods, only partially melded with the broader culture.  Due to the extent of American culture, there are many integrated but unique social [[subculture]]s within the United States, some not tied to any particular geography. The cultural affiliations an individual in the United States may have commonly depend on [[Social class in the United States|social class]], [[Politics of the United States|political orientation]] and a multitude of demographic characteristics such as religious background, occupation, and ethnic group membership.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;

[[Mass media]] promote cross-cultural diffusion. Some subcultures have national media exposure with dedicated television channels and crossover with mainstream media (such as Latin, African American, and [[LGBT culture]], though there are many niche channels).  Some communities have local broadcast or paper publications that carry content from a specific culture, such as native radio stations or Chinese-language newspapers in [[Chinatown]]s.  Almost every subculture has a presence on the [[World Wide Web]] and [[social media]].

Military history has influenced American culture and its worldwide reach in several ways. German cuisine became stigmatized by [[World War I]]; but in contrast the end of [[World War II]] resulted in cross-fertilization of American and Japanese business techniques during reconstruction and occupation, and brought home troops with an increased taste for Italian dishes.  Wars have also forced progress on equal rights for women and racial minorities, as these groups proved their till-then unrealized potential either in industry while men were off fighting, or by serving in the military honorably and effectively.  The [[American Civil War]] highlighted differences in culture (including attitudes toward racism) between the [[Southern United States]] and the North. Though the issue of slavery was settled by the war, racism and discrimination persisted and were supported by laws in some Southern states. Combined with determined civil rights activism, later wars resulted in profound changes in social norms, including desegregation, more intermixing of Black and White cultures, and more egalitarian social roles for men and women compared to countries that have not undergone similar shifts.  [[Modern display of the Confederate flag]] and [[removal of Confederate monuments and memorials]] remain controversial cultural and political issues, though many elements of proud Southern identity and culture such as hospitality, drawl, and comfort food have nothing to do with racial division.  Some differences in modern cultural tendencies fall along liberal-conservative political lines, with people on both sides of that increasingly self-segregating.

The post-WWII economic and military power of the United States (not to mention its large, relatively unified population) also helped it become more of an exporter of its own culture and values compared to its initial tendency to import of European culture (especially in its early, largely rural decades).  The United States has also administered now-foreign territories for many years, creating opportunities for cultural intermingling among many government employees and military personnel.  The longest stays have included the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|Philippines]] (1898–1946), [[Panama Canal Zone]] (1903–1979), [[United States occupation of Haiti|Haiti]] (1915-1934,), the [[Dominican Republic]] (1916-1924), and various Japanese islands and the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] for decades after WWII.

Colonists from the United States formed the now-independent country of [[Liberia]], which inherited a considerable amount of American culture and values. Given its proximity, relatively free movement over the border, the highly integrated North American economy, strong military alliance, shared origins in British colonialism, and a common language, the English-speaking [[culture of Canada]] is strongly influenced by that of the United States.  Some Canadians resist the dominance of the United States includes requirements for domestically produced mass media, though especially since the [[Hollywood North]] phenomenon began in the 1980s, Canada also exports entertainment to the United States.  American movies may have made the biggest impact of all American exports on popular culture worldwide.

==Regional variations==
[[File:Dean Franklin - 06.04.03 Mount Rushmore Monument (by-sa)-3 new.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Rushmore]]]]
Semi-distinct cultural [[List of regions of the United States|regions of the United States]] include [[New England]], the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], the [[Southern United States]], the [[Midwestern United States]] and the [[Western United States]]—an area that can be further subdivided, on the basis of the local culture into the [[Pacific States]] and the [[Mountain States]].

[[Western United States|The western coast of the continental United States]] consisting of California, [[Oregon]], and the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] is also sometimes referred to as the [[Left Coast]], indicating its [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning political orientation]] and tendency towards [[social liberalism]].

[[Southern United States]] are informally called "the [[Bible Belt]]" due to [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism]], which is a significant part of the region's culture and Christian [[church attendance]] across the denominations is generally higher there than the nation's average. This region is usually contrasted with the [[mainline Protestant]]ism and [[Catholicism]] of the [[northeastern United States]], the religiously diverse [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Great Lakes region|Great Lakes]], the [[Mormon Corridor]] in [[Utah]] and southern [[Idaho]], and the [[Unchurched Belt|relatively secular]] [[western United States]]. The percentage of non-religious people is the highest in the northeastern state of [[Vermont]] at 34%, compared to the Bible Belt state of [[Alabama]], where it is 6%.&lt;ref name="gc.cuny.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Religious Identification Survey |work=www.gc.cuny.edu |url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm#StateFaith |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709082644/http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong cultural differences have a long history in the U.S. with the southern slave society in the antebellum period serving as a prime example. Not only social, but also economic tensions between the Northern and Southern states were so severe that they eventually caused the South to declare itself an independent nation, the [[Confederate States of America]]; thus initiating the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite book|last=Hine|first=Darlene|author2=William C.

===Fischer's theory===
[[File:Vrijheidsbeeld.JPG|alt=Statue of Liberty, seen from the statue's front-left and below|thumb|upright|The [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York City]], is an important cultural symbol in the United States, and the values that it symbolizes—the virtues of freedom and liberty—are likewise integral to United States culture]]
[[David Hackett Fischer]] theorizes that the United States is made up today of four distinct regional cultures.&lt;ref&gt;1989 book, ''[[Albion's Seed]]'' ({{ISBN|0195069056}}), Paul Berinde&lt;/ref&gt; The book's focus is on the [[folkways (sociology)|folkways]] of four groups of settlers from the [[British Isles]] that emigrated from distinct regions of Britain and Ireland to the British American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries. Fischer's thesis is that the culture and folkways of each of these groups persisted, albeit with some modification over time, providing the basis for the four modern regional cultures of the United States.

According to Fischer, the foundation of American culture was formed from four [[mass migrations]] from four different regions of the British Isles by four distinct socio-religious groups. [[New England]]'s earliest settlement period occurred between 1629 and 1640 when [[Puritans]], mostly from [[East Anglia]] in England, settled there, forming the New England regional culture. The next mass migration was of southern English [[cavalier]]s and their working class English domestic servants to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region between 1640 and 1675. This facilitated the development of the Southern American culture.

Then (between 1675 and 1725), thousands of English and Welsh [[Quaker]]s, led by [[William Penn]], settled in the [[Delaware Valley]] followed by large numbers of German Lutherans. This settlement resulted in the formation of what is today considered the "General American" culture, although, according to Fischer, it is really just a regional American culture, even if it does today encompass most of the U.S. from the mid-Atlantic states to the Pacific Coast. Finally, Scotch-Irish, English and Scottish settlers from the borderlands of Britain and Ireland migrated to [[Appalachia]] between 1717 and 1775. They formed the regional culture of the [[Upland South]], which has since spread west to such areas as [[West Texas]] and parts of the [[U.S. Southwest]].

Fischer suggests that the U.S. today is not a country with one General American culture and three or more regional sub-cultures. He asserts that the country is composed of just regional cultures, and that understanding that helps one to understand many things about modern American life. Fischer also makes the point that the development of these regional cultures derived not only from where exactly the settlers first came, but when they came. Fischer asserts that during different periods of time, a population of people will have very distinct beliefs, fears, hopes and prejudices, and that various groups of settlers brought these feelings to the New World where they more or less froze in time in America, even if they eventually changed in their place of origin.

===Woodard's theory===
Continuing the work of Fischer, [[Colin Woodard]], in his book ''American Nations'',&lt;ref&gt;2011, ''American Nations'', {{ISBN|978-0143122029}}, Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; claims an existence of eleven rival regional cultures in North America, based on the cultural characteristics of the original settlers of these regions. These regions are: Yankeedom, New Netherland, The Midlands, Tidewater, Greater Appalachia, The Deep South, New France, El Norte, The Left Coast, The Far West and First Nation (a region in parts of northern Canada and Alaska, and Greenland).

According to Woodard, these regions cross and disregard formal state or even country borders. For example, he compares the Mexican border with the Berlin wall, saying that "El Norte in some ways resembles Germany during the Cold War: two peoples with a common culture separated by a large wall."

==Language==
{{Main|Languages of the United States}}
[[File:Tree map of languages in the United States.png|right|thumb|Tree map of languages in the US]]
Although the United States has no official language at the federal level, [[Languages of the United States|28 states]] have passed legislation making [[English language|English]] the [[official language]] and it is considered to be the ''[[de facto]]'' national language. According to the [[2000 U.S. Census]], more than 97% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language spoken at home. More than 300 languages besides English have native speakers in the United States—some of which are spoken by the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous]] peoples (about 150 living languages) and others imported by immigrants.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has official status in the commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]] and the state of [[New Mexico]]; Spanish is the primary spoken language in Puerto Rico and various smaller linguistic enclaves.&lt;ref name="2007 survey"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2000 census, there are nearly 30 million native speakers of Spanish in the United States. Bilingual speakers may use both English and Spanish reasonably well but [[code-switch]] according to their dialog partner or context. Some refer to this phenomenon as [[Spanglish]].

Indigenous languages of the United States include the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], which are spoken on the country's numerous [[Indian reservations]] and Native American cultural events such as [[pow wows]]; [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], which has official status in the state of Hawaii; [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]], which has official status in the commonwealths of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]; [[Carolinian language|Carolinian]], which has official status in the commonwealth of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]; and [[Samoan language|Samoan]], which has official status in the commonwealth of [[American Samoa]]. [[American Sign Language]], used mainly by the deaf, is also native to the country.

The national dialect is known as [[American English]], which itself consists of numerous regional dialects but has some shared unifying features that distinguish it from other national varieties of English. There are four large [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect regions]] in the United States—the [[Inland Northern American English|North]], the [[Midland American English|Midland]], the [[Southern American English|South]], and the [[Western American English|West]]—and several smaller dialect regions such as those of [[New York City English|New York City]], [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]], and [[Boston accent|Boston]]. A [[standard dialect]] called "[[General American]]" (analogous in some respects to the [[Received Pronunciation|received pronunciation]] elsewhere in the [[English-speaking world]]), lacking the distinctive noticeable features of any particular region, is believed by some to exist as well; it is sometimes regionally associated with the vaguely-defined "[[Midwest]]".

===Native language statistics for the United States===

The right to freedom of expression in the American constitution can be traced to German immigrant [[John Peter Zenger]] and his legal fight to make truthful publications in the Colonies a protected legal right,{{Relevance inline|date=October 2012}} ultimately paving the way for the protected rights of American authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/zenger.html "Famous American Trials: John Peter Zenger Trial 1735"], Doug Linder.

In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. During its early history, America was a series of [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonies]] on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of [[English literature]]. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

America's first internationally popular writers were [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and [[Washington Irving]] in the early nineteenth century. They painted an American literary landscape full of humor and adventure. These were followed by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] who established a distinctive American literary voice in the middle of the nineteenth century.

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American artists primarily painted landscapes and portraits in a realistic style. A parallel development taking shape in rural America was the [[American craft]] movement, which began as a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Developments in modern art in Europe came to America from exhibitions in New York City such as the [[Armory Show]] in 1913. After World War II, New York emerged as a center of the art world. Painting in the United States today covers a vast range of styles. American painting includes works by [[Jackson Pollock]], [[John Singer Sargent]], and [[Norman Rockwell]], among many others.

Architecture in the United States is regionally diverse and has been shaped by many external forces, not only English. U.S. architecture can therefore be said to be eclectic, something unsurprising in such a multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dell Upton]]. 1998. ''Architecture in the United States-Oxford history of art.'' pp. 11 ff. {{ISBN|0-19-284217-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a single large-scale architectural influence from indigenous peoples such as those in Mexico or Peru, generations of designers have incorporated influences from around the world. Currently, the overriding theme of American Architecture is [[Skyscraper#Modern skyscrapers|modernity, as manifest in the skyscrapers]] of the 20th century.

Early [[Neoclassicism]] accompanied the Founding Father's idealization of European Enlightenment, making it the predominant architectural style for public buildings and large manors. However, in recent years, suburbanization and mass migration to the [[Sun Belt]] has allowed architecture to reflect a [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean]] style as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

O'Neill is a four-time winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for drama and the only American playwright to win the [[Nobel Prize]] for '''literature.''' After O'Neill, American drama came of age and flourished with the likes of [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[William Inge]], and [[Clifford Odets]] during the first half of the twentieth century. After this fertile period, American theater broke new ground, artistically, with the absurdist forms of [[Edward Albee]] in the 1960s.

Social commentary has also been a preoccupation of American theater, often addressing issues not discussed in the mainstream. Writers such as [[Lorraine Hansbury]], [[August Wilson]], [[David Mamet]] and [[Tony Kushner]] have all won [[Pulitzer Prizes]] for their polemical plays on American society. The [[United States]] is also the home and largest exporter of modern [[musical theater]], producing such musical talents as [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], [[Lerner and Loewe]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Kander and Ebb]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]].

While the [[Lumiere Brothers]] are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema, it is American cinema that has emerged as the most dominant force in the industry. Its history can be  separated into four main periods: the [[silent film|silent film era]], [[classical Hollywood cinema]], [[New Hollywood]], and the contemporary period. Actor [[James Dean]], who appeared in films during the classical Hollywood era until his untimely death, is widely regarded as an American cultural icon of teenage disillusionment.

American independent cinema was revitalized in the late 1980s and early 1990s when another new generation of moviemakers, including [[Spike Lee]], [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Kevin Smith]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]] made movies like, respectively: ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''; ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]''; ''[[Clerks]]''; and ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''. In terms of directing, screenwriting, editing, and other elements, these movies were innovative and often irreverent, playing with and contradicting the conventions of Hollywood movies. Furthermore, their considerable financial successes and crossover into popular culture reestablished the commercial viability of independent film. Since then, the independent film industry has become more clearly defined and more influential in American cinema. Many of the major studios have capitalized on this by developing subsidiaries to produce similar films; for example [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].

To a lesser degree in the early 21st century, film types that were previously considered to have only a minor presence in the mainstream movie market began to arise as more potent American box office draws. These include foreign-language films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', ''[[Baahubali 2]]'' and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' and documentary films such as ''[[Super Size Me]]'', ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''.

There is a regard for scientific advancement and technological innovation in American culture, resulting in the flow of many modern innovations. The great American inventors include [[Robert Fulton]] (the [[steamboat]]); [[Samuel Morse]] (the [[telegraph]]); [[Eli Whitney]] (the [[cotton gin]], [[interchangeable parts]]); [[Cyrus McCormick]] (the [[reaper]]); and [[Thomas Edison]] (with more than a thousand inventions credited to his name). Most of the new technological innovations over the 20th and 21st centuries were either first invented in the United States, first widely adopted by Americans, or both. Examples include the [[lightbulb]], the [[airplane]], the [[transistor]], the [[atomic bomb]], [[nuclear power]], the [[personal computer]], the [[iPod]], [[video games]], [[e-commerce|online shopping]], and the development of the [[Internet]].

[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|A replica of the first working transistor|187x187px]]
This propensity for application of scientific ideas continued throughout the 20th century with innovations that held strong international benefits. The twentieth century saw the arrival of the [[Space Age]], the [[Information Age]], and a renaissance in the [[health sciences]]. This culminated in cultural milestones such as the [[Apollo program|Apollo moon landings]], the creation of the Personal Computer, and the sequencing effort called the [[Human Genome Project]].

Throughout its history, American culture has made significant gains through the open immigration of accomplished scientists. Accomplished scientists include: Scottish-American scientist [[Alexander Graham Bell]], who developed and patented the telephone and other devices; German scientist [[Charles Steinmetz]], who developed new alternating-current electrical systems in 1889; Russian scientist [[Vladimir Zworykin]], who invented the motion camera in 1919; Serb scientist [[Nikola Tesla]] who patented a brushless electrical [[induction motor]] based on rotating magnetic fields in 1888. With the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party in Germany, a large number of Jewish scientists fled Germany and immigrated to the country, including theoretical physicist [[Albert Einstein]] in 1933.

In the years during and following WWII, several innovative scientists immigrated to the U.S. from Europe, such as [[Enrico Fermi]], who came from [[Italy]] in 1938 and led the work that produced the world's first self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Post-war Europe saw many of its scientists, such as rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]], recruited by the United States as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].{{Relevance inline|date=October 2012}}

==Education==

[[File:Higher education in the US by race.svg|thumb|Higher education in the US by race as of 2003|188x188px]]

Education in the United States is and has historically been provided mainly by government. Control and funding come from three levels: [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[State government|state]], and [[Local government|local]]. School attendance is mandatory and nearly universal at the elementary and high school levels (often known outside the United States as the primary and secondary levels).

Students have the options of having their education held in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s, private schools, or [[homeschooling|home school]]. In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: [[Primary education in the United States|elementary school]], [[Middle school|junior high school]] (also often called middle school), and [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]]. In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into [[Grade levels|grades]]. [[Post-secondary education]], better known as "college" in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system.

In the year 2000, there were 76.6&amp;nbsp;million students enrolled in schools from [[kindergarten]] through [[graduate school]]s. Of these, 72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically "on track" for their age (enrolled in school at or above grade level). Of those enrolled in compulsory education, 5.2&amp;nbsp;million (10.4 percent) were attending private schools. Among the country's adult population, over 85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US High school census data|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/censusandstatistics/a/highschool.htm|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[developed country|developed countries]], the U.S. is one of the most religious in terms of its demographics. According to a 2002 study by the [[Pew Global Attitudes Project]], the U.S. was the only developed nation in the survey where a majority of citizens reported that religion played a "very important" role in their lives, an opinion similar to that found in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =U.S. Stands Alone in its Embrace of Religion| work=Pew Global Attitudes Project| url = http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=167| accessdate = January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, governments at the national, state, and local levels are a secular institution, with what is often called the "[[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]]".

Although participation in organized religion has been diminishing, the public life and [[popular culture]] of the United States incorporates many Christian ideals specifically about redemption, salvation, conscience, and morality. Examples are popular culture obsessions with confession and forgiveness, which extends from [[reality television]] to [[twelve-step meeting]]s. Americans expect public figures to confess and have public [[penitence]] for any sins, or moral wrongdoings they may have caused. According to ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', examples of inadequate public penitence may include the scandals and fallout regarding [[Tiger Woods]], [[Alex Rodriguez]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Larry Craig]], and [[Lance Armstrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Hehir|first=Andrew|title=Why do we care if Lance apologizes?|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/01/20/why_do_we_care_if_lance_apologizes/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|publisher=Salon Media Group|accessdate=20 January 2013|date=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] were established by English settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination or persecution: [[Pennsylvania]] was established by [[Quakers]], [[Maryland]] by Roman Catholics, and the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] by [[Puritan]]s. Separatist [[Congregationalists]] ([[Pilgrim Fathers]]) founded [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620. They were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;M. Schmidt, ''Pilgerväter'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band V, Tübingen (Germany), col. 384&lt;/ref&gt; They and the other [[Protestant]] groups applied the representative democratic organisation of their congregations also to the administration of their communities in worldly matters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Weinstein]] and David Rubel (2002), ''The Story of America: Freedom and Crisis from Settlement to Superpower'', DK Publishing, New York, N.Y., p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E.

By the time of the [[Philadelphia Convention]] of 1787, the United States became one of the first countries in the world to codify [[freedom of religion in the United States|freedom of religion]] into law, although this originally applied only to the federal government, and not to state governments or their political subdivisions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], the framers of the [[United States Constitution]] rejected any religious test for office, and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] specifically denied the central government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion, or prohibiting its free exercise. In following decades, the animating spirit behind the constitution's [[Establishment Clause]] led to the disestablishment of the official religions within the member states. The framers were mainly influenced by secular, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals, but they also considered the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups who did not want to be under the power or influence of a [[state religion]] that did not represent them.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, George M. 1990.

The United States observes holidays derived from events in [[History of the United States|American history]], Christian traditions, and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|national patriarchs]].

[[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] is the principal traditionally American holiday. It evolved from the English [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrim's]] custom of giving thanks for one's welfare. Thanksgiving is generally celebrated as a family reunion with a large afternoon feast. [[Christmas Day]], celebrating the birth of [[Jesus Christ]], is widely celebrated and a federal holiday, though a fair amount of its current cultural importance is due to secular reasons. [[British colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] has led to some other Christian holidays such as [[Easter]] and [[St. Patrick's Day]] to be observed, though with varying degrees of religious fidelity.

[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] (also known as the Fourth of July) celebrates the anniversary of the country's [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] from Great Britain. It is generally observed by parades throughout the day and the shooting of fireworks at night.

[[Halloween]] is thought to have evolved from the ancient Celtic/Gaelic festival of [[Samhain]], which was introduced in the American colonies by Irish settlers. It has become a holiday that is celebrated by children and teens who traditionally dress up in costumes and go door to door trick-or-treating for candy. It also brings about an emphasis on eerie and frightening [[urban legends]] and movies.

Additionally, [[Mardi Gras]], which evolved from the Catholic tradition of [[Carnival]], is observed in New Orleans, [[St. Louis]], [[Mobile, Alabama]], and numerous other towns.

Federally recognized holidays are as follows:

==Names==
{{Main|Naming in the United States|African-American names}}
The [[United States]] has few [[Naming laws|laws governing given names]]. Traditionally, the right to name your child or yourself as you choose has been upheld by court rulings and is rooted in the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourteenth Amendment]] of the United States Constitution and the [[Free Speech Clause]] of the [[First Amendment]]. A few restrictions do exist. Restrictions vary by state, but most are for the sake of practicality (for example: limiting the number of characters due to limitations in record keeping software). This freedom, along with the cultural diversity in the United States has given rise to a wide variety of names and naming trends. Creativity has also long been a part of American naming traditions and names have been used to express personality, cultural identity, and values&lt;ref name="Naming rights"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=Carlton F.W.|title=Naming Baby: The Constitutional Dimensions of Naming Rights|journal=George Washington Law Review|date=November 2011|volume=80|issue=1|url=http://www.gwlr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/80-1-Larson.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baby Name Wizard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wattenberg|first=Laura|title=The Baby Name Wizard, Revised 3rd Edition: A Magical Method for Finding the Perfect Name for Your Baby|date=May 7, 2013|publisher=Harmony|isbn=0770436471|url=https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Name-Wizard-Revised-Edition/dp/0770436471/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392242718&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=baby+name+wizard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naming trends vary by race, geographic area, and socioeconomic status.

==Fashion and dress==
{{Main|Fashion in the United States}}
[[File:jeans for men.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A pair of blue jeans]]

Fashion in the United States is eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing, particularly those of recent immigrants, [[cowboy hat]]s and [[cowboy boot|boots]] and leather [[motorcycle jackets]] are emblematic of specifically American styles.

[[Jeans|Blue jeans]] were popularized as work clothes in the 1850s by merchant [[Levi Strauss]], a German-Jewish immigrant in San Francisco, and adopted by many American teenagers a century later. They are worn in every state by people of all ages and social classes. Along with mass-marketed informal wear in general, blue jeans are arguably one of US culture's primary contributions to global fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Davis Fred (1992). ''Fashion, Culture, and Identity''&lt;/ref&gt;

Though informal dress is more common, certain professionals, such as [[bankers]] and [[lawyers]], traditionally dress formally for work, and some occasions, such as [[weddings]], [[funerals]], [[dance]]s, and some parties, typically call for [[formal wear]].

==Sports==

[[File:Typical baseball game.JPG|left|thumb|upright=0.9|A typical [[Baseball diamond]] as seen from the stadium]]
[[Baseball]] is the oldest of the major American team sports. Professional baseball dates from 1869 and had no close rivals in popularity until the 1960s. Though baseball is no longer the most popular sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poll: Adults who follow at least one sport|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/mid/1508/articleId/675/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/Default.aspx|work=Harris Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is still referred to as "the [[national pastime]]." Also unlike the professional levels of the other popular spectator sports in the U.S., [[Major League Baseball]] teams play almost every day. The Major League Baseball [[Season (sports)|regular season]] consists of each of the 30 teams playing 162 games from April to September. The season ends with the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] and [[World Series]] in October.

[[File:2007 Texas Longhorns football team entry.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|The opening of [[College football]] season is a major part of American pastime. Massive [[marching band]]s, [[cheerleaders]], and colorguard are common at [[American football]] games]]
[[American football]], known in the United States as simply "football," now attracts more television viewers than any other sport and is considered to be the most popular sport in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Krane, David K.|title=Professional Football Widens Its Lead Over Baseball as Nation's Favorite Sport|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=337| publisher=Harris Interactive| date = 2002-10-30| accessdate=September 14, 2007}} Maccambridge, Michael (2004).

New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-375-50454-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 32-team [[National Football League]] (NFL) is the most popular professional American football league.
The [[National Football League]] differs from the other three [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major pro sports leagues]] in that each of its 32 teams plays one game a week over 17 weeks, for a total of 16 games with one [[Bye (sports)|bye]] week for each team. The [[National Football League regular season|NFL season]] lasts from September to December, ending with the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]] and [[Super Bowl]] in January and February.
Its championship game, the [[Super Bowl]], has often been the highest rated television show, and it has an audience of over 100 million viewers annually.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[College football]] also attracts audiences of millions. Some communities, particularly in rural areas, place great emphasis on their local [[high school football]] team. American football games usually include [[cheerleaders]] and [[marching band]]s, which aim to raise school spirit and entertain the crowd at [[halftime]].

[[Basketball]] is another major sport, represented professionally by the [[National Basketball Association]]. It was invented in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] in 1891, by Canadian-born physical education teacher [[James Naismith]]. [[College basketball]] is also popular, due in large part to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA men's Division I basketball tournament]] in March, also known as "March Madness."

[[Ice hockey]] is the fourth leading professional team sport. Always a mainstay of [[Great Lakes]] and [[New England]]-area culture, the sport gained tenuous footholds in regions like the [[American South]] since the early 1990s, as the [[National Hockey League]] pursued a policy of expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unitedstatesofhockey.com/2011/05/19/raw-numbers-the-nhls-impact-on-the-south/ |title=Raw Numbers: The NHL's Impact on the South |publisher=The United States of Hockey |date=2011-05-19 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lacrosse]] is a team sport of [[Native Americans in the United States|American]] and [[First Nations|Canadian]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] origin and is the fastest growing sport in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eight Interesting Facts About Team Sports Participation In America|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/44628826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacrosse is most popular in the East Coast area. [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]] and [[Major League Lacrosse|MLL]] are the national [[box lacrosse|box]] and [[outdoor lacrosse]] leagues, respectively, and have increased their following in recent years. Also, many of the top Division I college lacrosse teams draw upwards of 7–10,000 for a game, especially in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] areas.

[[Soccer]] is very popular as a participation sport, particularly among youth, and the [[United States men's national soccer team|US national teams]] are competitive internationally. A twenty-team professional league, [[Major League Soccer]], plays from March to October, but its television audience and overall popularity lag behind other American professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soccer will never be America's sport|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/07/soccer-will-never-be-americas-sport/ | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three-wide multiple row back.JPG|thumb|[[NASCAR]] is the most watched [[auto racing]] series in the United States]]
[[Boxing]] and [[horse racing]] were once{{When|date=February 2011}} the most watched individual sports, but they have been eclipsed by [[golf]] and [[auto racing]], particularly [[NASCAR]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Other popular sports are [[tennis]], [[softball]], [[rodeo]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[water polo]], [[fencing]], [[shooting sports]], [[hunting]], [[volleyball]], [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], [[skateboarding]], [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]], [[Disc golf]], [[cycling]], [[mixed martial arts|MMA]], roller derby, [[wrestling]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].

Relative to other parts of the world, the United States is unusually competitive in women's sports, a fact usually attributed to the [[Title IX]] antidiscrimination law, which requires most American colleges to give equal funding to men's and women's sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Amid 40th anniversary of Title IX, women set new standard in London|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/writers/ann_killion/08/12/2012-olympics-women-title-ix/ | work=CNN | date=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, however, women's sports are not nearly as popular among spectators as men's sports.

The United States enjoys a great deal of success both in the [[Summer Olympics]] and [[Winter Olympics]], constantly finishing among the top medal winners.

===Sports and community culture===
[[File:13399-Homecoming Tailgate and Game-1839 (10714677125).jpg|thumb|right|Homecoming parade at Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce in 2013]]
[[Homecoming]] is an annual tradition of the United States. People, towns, high schools and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back former residents and [[alumni]]. It is built around a central event, such as a [[banquet]], a [[parade]], and most often, a game of [[American football]], or, on occasion, [[basketball]], [[wrestling]] or [[ice hockey]]. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary. However, they usually consist of a football game, played on the school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a [[parade]] featuring the school's [[marching band]] and sports teams, and the coronation of a [[Homecoming Queen]].

American high schools commonly field football, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, soccer, golf, swimming, track and field, and cross-country teams as well.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Cuisine of the United States}}
[[File:The First Thanksgiving cph.3g04961.jpg|thumb|left|''The First Thanksgiving 1621'', oil on canvas by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]] (1899)]]
The cuisine of the United States is extremely diverse, owing to the vastness of the continent, the relatively large population (1/3 of a billion people) and the number of native and immigrant influences. Mainstream [[Cuisine of the United States|American culinary arts]] are similar to those in other Western countries. Wheat and corn are the primary cereal grains. Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as [[turkey (bird)|turkey]], potatoes, [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize|corn]], [[squash (plant)|squash]], and [[maple syrup]], indigenous foods employed by American Indians and early European settlers, African slaves and their descendants.

The types of food served at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the family's own cultural heritage. Recent immigrants tend to eat food similar to that of their country of origin, and [[Americanization|Americanized]] versions of these cultural foods, such as [[American Chinese cuisine]], [[Tex-Mex]] (Mexican-American cuisine) or [[Italian-American cuisine]] often eventually appear; an example is [[Vietnamese cuisine]], [[Korean cuisine]] and [[Thai cuisine]]. [[German cuisine]] has a profound impact on American cuisine, especially mid-western cuisine; potatoes, noodles, roasts, stews, cakes, and other pastries are the most iconic ingredients in both cuisines.&lt;ref name="Dealing with Diversity"/&gt; Dishes such as the hamburger, pot roast, baked ham, and hot dogs are examples of American dishes derived from German cuisine.&lt;ref name="History of the hot dog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-dog.org/hd/hd_history.htm|title=History of the hot dog|accessdate=2006-11-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018070129/http://www.hot-dog.org/hd/hd_history.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of the Hamburger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahamburgertoday.com/archives/2005/08/the_history_of.php|title=History of the Hamburger|accessdate=2006-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Apple pie]] is one of a number of American cultural icons]]
Different regions of the United States have their own cuisine and styles of cooking. The states of Louisiana and Mississippi, for example, is known for its [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole cooking]]. Cajun and Creole cooking are influenced by French, Acadian, and Haitian cooking, although the dishes themselves are original and unique. Examples include Crawfish Etouffee, Red Beans and Rice, Seafood or Chicken Gumbo, Jambalaya, and Boudin. Italian, German, Hungarian and Chinese influences, traditional Native American, Caribbean, Mexican and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general American repertoire. It is not uncommon for a "middle-class" family from "middle America" to eat, for example, restaurant pizza, home-made pizza, enchiladas con carne, chicken paprikas, beef stroganof and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week.

[[Soul food]], mostly the same as food eaten by white southerners, developed by southern African slaves, and their free descendants, is popular around the South and among many [[African-Americans]] elsewhere. [[Syncretism|Syncretic]] cuisines such as Louisiana creole, Cajun, [[Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine|Pennsylvania Dutch]], and [[Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex]] are regionally important. Iconic American dishes such as [[apple pie]], [[fried chicken]], [[pizza]], [[hamburger]]s, and [[hot dog]]s derive from the recipes of various immigrants and domestic innovations. [[French fries]], Mexican dishes such as [[burrito]]s and [[taco]]s, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are consumed.&lt;ref name="IFT"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ift.org/cms/?pid=1000496| author=Klapthor, James N.| title=What, When, and Where Americans Eat in 2003| publisher=Institute of Food Technologists| date=2003-08-23| accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family structure==
{{Further|Family structure in the United States}}
[[File:Families US.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[American family structure]] has no particular household arrangement being prevalent enough to be identified as the average&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian |author2=Stacey C.

Family arrangements in the United States reflect the nature of contemporary American society, as they always have. Although the [[nuclear family]] concept (two-married adults with biological children) holds a special place in the mindset of Americans, it is single-parent families, [[childless]] couples, and fused families which now constitute the majority of families.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  A person may grow up in a single-parent family, go on to marry and live in childless couple arrangement, then get divorced, live as a single for a couple of years, remarry, have children and live in a nuclear family arrangement.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The nuclear family... is the idealized version of what most people think when they think of "family..." The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). Thus has arisen the term ''postmodern family'', which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and child-free couples.- Brian K. Williams, Stacey C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom, ''Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships'', 2005.&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt;

Single-parent households are households consisting of a single adult (most often a woman) and one or more children. In the single-parent household, one parent typically raises the children with little to no help at all, from the other. This parent is the sole "breadwinner" of the family and thus, these households are particularly vulnerable economically. They have higher rates of [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], and children of these households are more likely to have educational problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Youth dependence===
Other changes to the landscape of American family arrangements include dual-income earner households and delayed independence among American youths. Whereas most families in the 1950s and 1960s relied on one income earner, most commonly the husband, the vast majority of family households now have two-income earners.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}{{clarify|reason=how does two incomes affect youth dependence?|date=August 2013}}

Another change is the increasing age at which young Americans leave their parental home. Traditionally, a person past "college age" who lived with their parent(s) was viewed negatively, but today it is not uncommon for children to live with their parents until their mid-twenties. This trend can be mostly attributed to rising [[Real estate pricing|living costs]] that are more expensive compared to those in decades past. Thus, many young adults now remain with their parents well past their mid-twenties. This topic was a cover article of TIME magazine in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Exceptions to the custom of leaving home in one's mid-twenties can occur especially among Italian and Hispanic Americans, and in expensive urban real estate markets such as New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/NY-New-York-Pricing.html New York apartments pricing and New York NY apartment reviews] Apartment Ratings&lt;/ref&gt; California,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-San-Francisco-Pricing.html San Francisco apartments pricing and San Francisco CA apartment reviews] Apartment Ratings&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Honolulu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/HI-Honolulu-Pricing.html |title=Honolulu apartments pricing and Honolulu HI apartment reviews |website=Apartmentratings.com |accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; where monthly rents commonly exceed $1,000 a month.

==Housing==
{{Expand section|material about housing pre-World War II|date=August 2016}}
[[File:831Richland.jpg|thumb|left|The [[American Foursquare]] was a popular house style from the late 19th century until the 1930s]]
Historically, Americans mainly lived in a rural environment, with a few important cities of moderate size. Following World War II, however, increasing numbers of Americans began living in the suburbs, belts around major cities with higher density than [[rural sociology|rural]] areas, but much lower than urban areas. This move has been attributed to many factors such as the automobile, the availability of large tracts of land, the convenience of more and longer paved roads, increasing violence in urban centers (see [[white flight]]), and the lower expense of housing.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Suburban tract house.JPG|thumb|A [[Neo-eclectic architecture|neo-eclectic]] home in [[Salinas, California]]]]
These new single-family houses were usually one or two stories tall, and often were part of large contracts of homes built by a single developer and often with little variation (sometimes referred to as cookie cutter houses or homes). Houses were separated. The resulting low-density development was given the pejorative label [[urban sprawl]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

This has changed;{{how|date=October 2012}}{{when|date=October 2012}} [[white flight]] has reversed, as [[Yuppies]] and upper-middle-class, [[empty nest syndrome|empty nest]] [[Baby Boomers]] return to urban living, usually in [[condominium]]s, such as in New York City's Lower East Side, [[Chicago Loop|Chicago's South Loop]] and Miami's [[Brickell]] Neighborhood. The result has been the [[gentrification|displacement of many poorer, inner-city residents]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

American cities with housing prices near the national median have also been losing the [[Household income in the United States|middle income]] neighborhoods, those with median income between 80% and 120% of the metropolitan area's median household income. Here, the more affluent members of the middle-class, who are also often referred to as being professional or upper middle-class, have left in search of larger homes in more exclusive suburbs. This trend is largely attributed to the ''[[American middle class#Middle class squeeze|Middle-class squeeze]]'', which has caused a starker distinction between the [[American middle class#statistical middle class|statistical middle class]] and the more privileged members of the [[American middle class|middle class]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods|accessdate=2006-07-25 | work=The Washington Post | first=Blaine | last=Harden | date=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more expensive areas such as California, however, another trend has been taking place where an influx of more affluent middle-class households has displaced those in the actual middle of society and converted former [[American middle class#statistical middle class|middle-middle-class]] neighborhoods into [[Upper middle class#American upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods.|accessdate=2006-07-25 | work=The Washington Post | first=Blaine | last=Harden | date=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of rural areas has been declining over time as more and more people migrate to cities for work and entertainment. The great exodus from the farms came in the 1940s; in recent years fewer than 2% of the population lives on farms (though others live in the countryside and commute to work). Electricity and telephones, and sometimes cable and Internet services are available to all but the most remote regions.

[[File:Cincinnati-suburbs-tract-housing.jpg|thumb|Suburban [[tract housing]] in [[Northern Kentucky]] near [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]]]
About half of Americans now live in what is known as the suburbs. The suburban nuclear family has been identified as part of the "[[American Dream]]": a married couple with children owning a house in the suburbs. This archetype is reinforced by mass media, religious practices, and government policies and is based on traditions from Anglo-Saxon cultures. One of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban living; is the housing occupied by the families. The suburbs are filled with single-family homes separated from retail districts, industrial areas, and sometimes even public schools. However, many American suburbs are incorporating these districts on smaller scales, attracting more people to these communities.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Housing in urban areas may include more [[apartment]]s and semi-attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns. Aside from housing, the major differences from suburban living are the density and diversity of many different subcultures, and retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with housing in urban areas.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Automobiles and commuting===

Due to the low overall population density and [[urban sprawl]], the United States is one of the few developed nations where most people commute by car.

The rise of suburbs and the need for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularity of automobiles. In 2001, 90% of Americans drove to work by car.&lt;ref name=2001summary&gt;[http://www.bts.gov/publications/highlights_of_the_2001_national_household_travel_survey/html/executive_summary.html Highlights of the 2001 National Household Travel Survey], Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation, accessed May 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively large, powerful cars. The culture in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with [[motel]]s and [[drive-in restaurant]]s. Outside of the relatively few urban areas, it is considered a necessity for most Americans to own and drive cars. New York City is the only locality in the United States where more than half of all households do not own a car.&lt;ref name=2001summary /&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s [[subcultures]] began to arise around the modification and racing of American automobiles and converting them into [[hot rods]]. Later, in the late-1960s and early-1970s Detroit manufacturers began making [[muscle cars]] and [[pony cars]] to cater to the needs of wealthier Americans seeking hot rod style, performance and appeal.

Distinct lifestyles, consumption patterns and values are associated with different classes. Early sociologist-economist [[Thorstein Veblen]], for example, said that those at the very top of the social ladder engage in [[conspicuous leisure]] and [[conspicuous consumption]]. [[Managerial Class|Upper-middle-class]] persons commonly identify [[Educational attainment in the United States|education]] and being cultured as prime values. Persons in this particular [[Social structure of the United States|social class]] tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects authority, knowledge and thus credibility. They often tend to engage in the consumption of so-called mass luxuries, such as [[designer label]] clothing. A strong preference for natural materials and organic foods and a strong health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the [[Managerial Class|upper middle class]]. [[American middle-class]] individuals in general value expanding one's horizon, partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels. Working-class individuals take great pride in doing what they consider to be "real work" and keep very close-knit kin networks that serve as a safeguard against frequent economic instability.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite book | last = Fussel | first = Paul | year = 1983 | title = Class, A Guide through the American status system | publisher=Touchstone | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-671-79225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | year = 1989 | title = ''Fear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class'' | publisher=HarperCollins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-06-097333-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working-class Americans and many of those in the middle class may also face occupation alienation. In contrast to upper-middle-class professionals who are mostly hired to conceptualize, supervise, and share their thoughts, many Americans have little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas | year = 1989 | title = ''Occupation and Class Consciousness in America'' | publisher=Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | isbn = 0-313-26111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, white collar professionals tend to be significantly more satisfied with their work.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William |author2=Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher=Pearson | location = Boston, MA | isbn = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas | year = 1989 | title = Occupation and Class Consciousness in America | publisher=Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | isbn = 0-313-26111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Elizabeth Warren]] presented her article entitled "The Middle Class on the Precipice", stating that individuals in the center of the income strata, who may still identify as middle class, have faced increasing economic insecurity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Warren|first=Elizabeth|author-link1=Elizabeth Warren|url=https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2006/01/the-middle-class-on-the-html|title= The Middle Class on the Precipice - Rising financial risks for American families|date=January 2006|journal=[[Harvard Magazine]]|accessdate=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the idea of a working-class majority.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class | publisher=Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-06-097333-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political behavior is affected by class; more affluent individuals are more likely to vote, and education and income affect whether individuals tend to vote for the Democratic or Republican party. [[Income in the United States|Income]] also had a significant impact on health as those with higher [[Income in the United States|incomes]] had better access to health care facilities, higher [[life expectancy]], lower [[infant mortality rate]] and increased health consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collison|first1=D.|last2=Dey|first2=C.|last3=Hannah|first3=G.|last4=Stevenson|first4=L. |url=https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/29/2/114/1505115|title=Income inequality and child mortality in wealthy nations|date=June 2007|department=Discussion-What is already known on this topic|journal=Journal of Public Health|volume=29|issue=2|page=116|doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdm009|accessdate=August 19, 2018|quote=[There] was evidence to suggest a statistically significant association between infant mortality and income inequality...this effect may have been because of the disproportionate influence of the USA which has 'exceptionally high income inequality and poor child health'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Ehrenfreund|first=Max|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/09/how-income-affects-life-expectancy/|title=How income affects life expectancy|date=September 25, 2015|work=[[World Economic Forum]]|accessdate=August 19, 2018|quote=More affluent Americans have quit smoking en masse over the past few decades, but the poor have not...Richer beneficiaries live longer &amp; cash more generous checks from Social Security.

In the United States occupation is one of the prime factors of [[Social structure of the United States|social class]] and is closely linked to an individual's identity. The average work week in the U.S. for those employed full-time was 42.9 hours long with 30% of the population working more than 40 hours a week.&lt;ref name="U.S. Bureau of Labor, hours worked, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/lf/aat19.txt|title=U.S. Bureau of Labor, hours worked, 2005|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Average American worker earned $16.64 an hour in the first two quarters of 2006.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of Labor, employment in 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm|title=U.S. Department of Labor, employment in 2006|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall Americans worked more than their counterparts in other developed post-industrial nations. While the average worker in [[Denmark]] enjoyed 30 days of vacation annually, the average American had 16 annual vacation days.&lt;ref name="International vacation comparison"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesizing.com/1vacatns.htm|title=International vacation comparison|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the average American worked 1,978 hours per year, 500 hours more than the average German, yet 100 hours less than the average [[Czech Republic|Czech]]. Overall the U.S. labor force is one of the most productive in the world, largely due to its workers working more than those in any other post-industrial country (excluding [[South Korea]]).&lt;ref name="CNN, work in American, UN report finds Americans most productive, 2002"/&gt; Americans generally hold working and being productive in high regard; being busy and working extensively may also serve as the means to obtain esteem.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt;

Race in the United States is based on physical characteristics &amp; skin color and has played an essential part in shaping American society even before the nation's conception.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt; Until the civil rights movement of the 1960s, racial minorities in the United States faced [[institutionalized discrimination]] and both social and economic marginalization.&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hine|first=Darlene|author2=William C. Hine |author3=Stanley Harrold |year=2006|title=The African American Odyssey|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, MA|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census recognizes four races, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American or American Indian]], African American, [[Asian American|Asian]] and [[White American|White]] ([[European American]]). According to the U.S. government, Hispanic Americans do not constitute a race, but rather an ethnic group. During the 2000 U.S. Census, Whites made up 75.1% of the population; those who are Hispanic or Latino constituted the nation's prevalent minority with 12.5% of the population. African Americans made up 12.3% of the total population, 3.6% were Asian American and 0.7% were Native American.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_QTP3&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U|title=U.S. Census Bureau, Race and Hispanic or Latino during the 2000 Census|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]—ratified on Dec 6, 1865—abolished slavery in the United States. The northern states had outlawed slavery in their territory in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century, though their industrial economies relied on raw materials produced by slaves. Following the Reconstruction period in the 1870s, racist legislation emerged in the Southern states named the [[Jim Crow laws]] that provided for legal segregation. Lynching was practiced throughout the U.S., including in the Northern states, until the 1930s, while continuing well into the civil rights movement in the South.&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"/&gt;

Chinese Americans were earlier marginalized as well during a significant proportion of U.S. history. Between 1882-1943 the United States instituted the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] barring all Chinese immigrants from entering the United States. During the Second World War, roughly 120,000 [[Japanese Americans]], 62% of whom were U.S. citizens,&lt;ref&gt;Semiannual Report of the War Relocation Authority, for the period January 1 to June 30, 1946, not dated.

Due to exclusion from or marginalization by earlier mainstream society, there emerged a unique subculture among the racial minorities in the United States. During the 1920s, [[Harlem, New York]] became home to the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. Music styles such as [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[hip hop music|rap]], [[rock and roll]], and numerous folk-songs such as [[Blue Tail Fly|Blue Tail Fly (Jimmy Crack Corn)]] originated within the realms of African-American culture, and were later adopted by the mainstream.&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"/&gt; Chinatowns can be found in many cities across the country and Asian cuisine has become a common staple in mainstream America. The Hispanic community has also had a dramatic impact on American culture. Today, Catholics are the largest religious denomination in the United States and outnumber Protestants in the Southwest and California.&lt;ref name="Religion in the U.S. by state"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/graphics/news/gra/gnoreligion/flash.htm|title=Religion in the U.S. by state|accessdate=2006-12-14 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mariachi music and Mexican cuisine are commonly found throughout the Southwest, and some Latin dishes, such as burritos and tacos, are found practically everywhere in the nation.

Economic variance and substantive segregation, is commonplace in the United States. Asian Americans have [[Household income in the United States|median household income]] and [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] exceeding that of other races.

After the attacks by Muslim terrorists on September 11, 2001, discrimination against Arabs and Muslims in the U.S. rose significantly.

==Death and funerals==
{{Off topic|date=January 2013}}
[[File:Pond in Mount Auburn Cemetery.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Auburn Cemetery]]]]

It is customary for Americans to hold a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] in a [[funeral home]] within a couple days of the death of a loved one. The body of the deceased may be [[embalmed]] and dressed in fine clothing if there will be an open-casket [[Viewing (funeral)|viewing]]. Traditional Jewish and Muslim practice include a ritual bath and no embalming. Friends, relatives and acquaintances gather, often from distant parts of the country, to "pay their last respects" to the deceased. Flowers are brought to the [[coffin]] and sometimes [[eulogy|eulogies]], [[elegy|elegies]], personal anecdotes or group prayers are recited. Otherwise, the attendees sit, stand or kneel in quiet contemplation or prayer. Kissing the corpse on the forehead is typical among Italian Americans&lt;ref name="The Italian Way of Death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/weekly/paglia960805.html|title=The Italian Way of Death|website=Salon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503064519/http://www.salon.com/weekly/paglia960805.html|archivedate=May 3, 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. [[Condolences]] are also offered to the widow or widower and other close relatives.

[[File:Tomb of the Unknowns crack.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Tomb of the Unknowns]]]]

A funeral may be held immediately afterwards or the next day. The funeral ceremony varies according to religion and culture. American Catholics typically hold a [[Catholic funeral|funeral mass]] in a church, which sometimes takes the form of a [[Requiem]] mass. Jewish Americans may hold a service in a synagogue or temple. [[Pallbearer]]s carry the coffin of the deceased to the [[hearse]], which then proceeds in a [[procession]] to the place of final repose, usually a cemetery. The unique [[Jazz funeral]] of New Orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing during the procession.

[[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] (founded in 1831) is known as "America's first garden cemetery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Old Cambridge |last=Bunting |first=Bainbridge |author2=Robert H. Nylander |year=1973 |publisher=Cambridge Historical Commission |location= Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-262-53014-7 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[cemetery|cemeteries]] created since are distinctive for their [[rural cemetery|park-like setting]]. Rows of [[grave (burial)|grave]]s are covered by [[lawn]]s and are interspersed with trees and flowers. [[Headstone]]s, [[mausoleum]]s, statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves. [[Cremation]] is another common practice in the United States, though it is frowned upon by various religions. The ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an [[urn]], which may be kept in a private house, or they are interred. Sometimes the ashes are released into the atmosphere. The "sprinkling" or "scattering" of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony, often taking place at a scenic natural feature (a cliff, lake or mountain) that was favored by the deceased.

A so-called [[death industry]] has developed in the United States that has replaced earlier, more informal traditions. Before the popularity of funeral homes, people usually held wakes in the [[parlour]] rooms of private houses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Sociological issues==

===Marriage and divorce===
{{Main|Marriage in the United States|Divorce in the United States}}
{{See also|Cohabitation in the United States}}
[[File:Marilyn Monroe and Jerry Giesler 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marilyn Monroe]] signing divorce papers with celebrity attorney [[Jerry Giesler]]]]
Marriage laws are established by individual states. The typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends, often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister, priest, or rabbi, depending upon the faith of the couple. In traditional Christian ceremonies, the bride's father will "give away" (hand off) the bride to the groom. Secular weddings are also common, often presided over by a judge, [[Justice of the Peace]], or other municipal official. [[Same-sex marriage]] is legal in all states. [[Polygamy]] is universally banned.

[[Divorce]] is the province of state governments, so divorce law varies from state to state. Prior to the 1970s, divorcing spouses had to allege that the other spouse was guilty of a crime or [[sin]] like abandonment or adultery; when spouses simply could not get along, lawyers were forced to manufacture "uncontested" divorces. The [[no-fault divorce]] revolution began in 1969 in California; New York and South Dakota were the [[No-fault divorce#The adoption of no-fault divorce laws by the other states|last states to begin allowing no-fault divorce]]. No-fault divorce on the grounds of "irreconcilable differences" is now available in all states. However, many states have recently required separation periods prior to a formal divorce decree.

State law provides for [[child support]] where children are involved, and sometimes for [[alimony]]. "Married adults now divorce two-and-a-half times as often as adults did 20 years ago and four times as often as they did 50 years ago... between 40% and 60% of ''new'' marriages will eventually end in divorce. The probability within... the first five years is 20%, and the probability of its ending within the first 10 years is 33%... Perhaps 25% of children ages 16 and under live with a stepparent."&lt;ref&gt;Brian K. Williams, Stacy C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom, ''Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The median length for a marriage in the U.S. today is 11 years with 90% of all divorces being settled out of court.

Throughout most of the country's history following independence from Great Britain, the majority race in the United States has been Caucasian, and the largest racial minority has been African-Americans. This relationship has historically been the most important one since the founding of the United States. Currently, most African-Americans are descendants of African slaves imported to the United States, though some are more recent immigrants or their descendants. Slavery existed in the United States at the time of the country's formation in the 1770s. The U.S. banned importation of slaves in 1808. Slavery was partially abolished by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] issued by president [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1862 for slaves in the Southeastern United States during the Civil War. Slavery was rendered illegal by the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. [[Jim Crow Laws]] prevented full use of African American citizenship until the 20th century. The [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] outlawed official or legal segregation in public places or limited access to minorities.

Relations between white Americans and other racial or ethnic groups have been a source of tension at various times in U.S. history. With the advent of European colonization, and continuing into the early years of the republic, relations between whites and Native American was a significant issue. In 1882, in response to Chinese immigration due to the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] and the labor needed for the Transcontinental Railroad, the U.S. signed into law the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] which banned immigration by Chinese people into the U.S. In the late 19th century, the growth of the Hispanic population in the U.S., fueled largely by Mexican immigration, generated debate over policies such as English as the official language and reform to immigration policies.

A huge majority of Americans of all races disapprove of racism. Nevertheless, some Americans continue to hold negative racial/ethnic [[Stereotypes of groups within the United States|stereotypes]] about various racial and ethnic groups. Professor Imani Perry, of [[Princeton University]], has argued that contemporary [[racism]] in the United States "is frequently unintentional or unacknowledged on the part of the actor",&lt;ref&gt;Imani Perry, More Beautiful More Terrible: The Embrace and Transcendence of Racial Inequality in the United States, New York University Press: 2011, p7&lt;/ref&gt; believing that racism mostly stems unconsciously from below the level of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs and alcohol===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
{{Further|History of United States drug prohibition}}
[[File:Just Say No.jpg|thumb|"Just Say No" paraphernalia at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|Reagan Library]] display]]

American attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the country's history. In the 19th century, alcohol was readily available and consumed, and no laws restricted the use of other drugs. Attitudes on drug addiction started to change, resulting in the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act|Harrison Act]], which eventually became proscriptive.

A movement to ban alcoholic beverages, called the [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] movement, emerged in the late 19th century. Several American Protestant religious groups and women's groups, such as the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], supported the movement. In 1919, Prohibitionists succeeded in [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|amending the Constitution]] to prohibit the sale of alcohol. Although the Prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall,{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable, as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs that trafficked in alcohol. Prohibition [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|was repealed]] in 1933. States and localities retained the right to remain "dry", and to this day, [[dry county|a handful]] still do.

During the [[Vietnam War]] era, attitudes swung well away from prohibition. Commentators noted that an 18-year-old could be [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] to war but could not buy a beer.

Since 1980, the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New York was the first state to enact tough [[drunk-driving]] laws in 1980; since then all other states have followed suit. All states have also banned the purchase of alcoholic beverages by individuals under 21.

A "[[Just Say No]] to Drugs" movement replaced the more liberal ethos of the 1960s. This led to stricter drug laws and greater police latitude in drug cases. Drugs are, however, widely available, and 16% of Americans 12 and older used an illicit drug in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Survey of Drug Use and Health|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/national-survey-drug-use-health|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, [[marijuana]] use has become increasingly tolerated in America, and a number of states allow the [[Medical cannabis in the United States|use of marijuana for medical purposes]]. In most states marijuana is still illegal without medical prescription. Since the 2012 general election, voters in the District of Columbia and the states of [[Alaska]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] approved the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. Marijuana is classified as illegal under federal law.

==Volunteerism==
[[Alexis de Tocqueville|De Tocqueville]] first noted, in 1835, the American attitude towards helping others in need. A 2011 [[Charities Aid Foundation]] study found that Americans were the first most willing to help a stranger and donate time and money in the world at 60%. Many low-level crimes are punished by assigning hours of "[[community service]]", a requirement that the offender perform volunteer work;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=David | last=Crary | title=Study finds Americans in generous mood | url=http://silentrebellion.newsvine.com/_news/2010/09/09/5079433-11-most-generous-countries-of-2010| publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 1A | date=September 9, 2010 | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---note that location of soft copy and hard copy differ.

From the time of its inception the military played a decisive role in the [[history of the United States]]. A sense of national unity and identity was forged out of the victorious [[First Barbary War]], [[Second Barbary War]], and the [[War of 1812]]. Even so, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] were suspicious of a permanent military force and not until the outbreak of [[World War II]] did a large standing army become officially established. The [[National Security Act of 1947]], adopted following World War II and during the onset of the Cold War, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] into the [[United States Department of Defense|National Military Establishment]] (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] and National Security Council.

The U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel. It draws its manpower from a large pool of paid [[Volunteer military|volunteers]]; although [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972. As of 2011, the United States spends about $550&amp;nbsp;billion annually to fund its military forces,&lt;ref name="Budget FY2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-BUD-7.pdf |title=Federal Government Outlays by Function and Subfunction: 1962–2015 Fiscal Year 2011 (Table 3.2) |authorlink=[[United States Department of Defense]] |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]] |accessdate=21 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330224158/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-BUD-7.pdf |archivedate=March 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appropriates approximately $160&amp;nbsp;billion to fund [[War on Terrorism|Overseas Contingency Operations]]. Put together, the United States constitutes roughly [[List of countries by military expenditures|43 percent of the world's military expenditures]]. The U.S. armed forces as a whole possess large quantities of advanced and powerful equipment, along with widespread placement of forces around the world, giving them significant capabilities in both defense and [[power projection]].

There is and has been a strong military culture among those on active duty, those in the Reserve and National Guard, those retired from the military, and honorably discharged veterans who never served long enough on active duty and/or in the Reserve or National Guard to qualify for military retirement pay and benefits.

==Gun culture==
{{Main|Gun culture in the United States}}

In sharp contrast to most other [[developed nations]], [[Gun law in the United States|firearms laws in the United States]] are permissive and private gun ownership is common; almost half of American households contain at least one firearm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/150353/self-reported-gun-ownership-highest-1993.aspx| title=Self-Reported Gun Ownership in U.S. Is Highest Since 1993| website=Gallup.com | date=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there are more privately owned firearms in the United States than in any other country, both ''per capita'' and in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2834893820070828| title=U.S. most armed country with 90 guns per 100 people| publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=August 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as freedom of religion is considered to be guaranteed by the First Amendment, considerable freedom to possess firearms is often considered by the people and the courts to be guaranteed by the Second Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf| title=US District of Columbia et al v Heller | publisher=US Supreme Court| date=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilians in the United States possess about 42% of the global inventory of privately owned firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-9.pdf |title=Research Notes:Estimating Civilian Owned Firearms | publisher=Small Arms Survey |access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of gun ownership vary significantly by region and by state; gun ownership is most common in [[Alaska]], the [[Mountain States]], and [[Southern United States|the South]], and least prevalent in Hawaii, the [[Territories of the United States|island territories]], [[California]], and the [[Northeast megalopolis]]. Gun ownership tends to be more common in rural than in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/health/interactives/guns/ownership.html| title=Gun Ownership by State|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting, [[plinking]] and [[target shooting]] are popular pastimes, although ownership of firearms for purely utilitarian purposes such as personal protection is common as well. In fact, personal protection was the most common reason given for gun ownership in a 2013 Gallup poll of gun owners, at 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/165605/personal-safety-top-reason-americans-own-guns-today.aspx| title=Personal Safety Top Reason Americans Own Guns Today| website=Gallup.com | date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of [[handguns]], while not uncommon, is less common than ownership of [[long guns]]. Gun ownership is considerably more prevalent among men than among women; men are approximately four times more likely than women to report owning guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/13/1/15.full| title=The U.S. gun stock: results from the 2004 national firearms survey |work=Injury Prevention Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governmental role==
In the [[federal government of the United States]], responsibilities that are usually in a [[Ministry of Culture|cultural minister]]'s portfolio elsewhere are divided among the [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]], the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]], the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]], the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts|U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]], the [[Library of Congress]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]]. However, many state and city governments have a department dedicated to cultural affairs.

==Influence==
&lt;!---probably ought to merge next two paragraphs--&gt;
The Hollywood cinema industry has been very influential on American culture, and to some extent in global culture through transmission of American movies overseas and as other film cultures like [[Bollywood]] have striven to emulate the American model.

The United States has influenced the cultures of many other countries, but as countries around the world become more inter-connected and inter-dependent, the general cultural trends (of the US and other countries) head towards [[multiculturalism]] and sociocultural [[globalization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1899">'''DFMA''' stands for Design for Manufacture and Assembly.  DFMA is the combination of two methodologies; [[Design for manufacturability|Design for Manufacture]], which means the design for ease of manufacture of the parts that will form a product, and [[Design for assembly|Design for Assembly]], which means the design of the product for ease of assembly.

==Usage==
DFMA is used as the basis for [[concurrent engineering]] studies to provide guidance to the design team in simplifying the product structure, to reduce manufacturing and assembly costs, and to quantify improvements. The practice of applying DFMA is to identify, quantify and eliminate waste or inefficiency in a product design. DFMA is therefore a component of [[Lean Manufacturing]]
DFMA is also used as a benchmarking tool to study competitors’ products, and as a should cost tool to assist in supplier negotiations.&lt;ref&gt; Boothroyd, G., Dewhurst, P. and Knight, W., “Product Design for Manufacture and Assembly, 2nd Edition”, Marcel Dekker, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
DFMA is the name of the integrated set of software products from Boothroyd Dewhurst, Inc. that are used by companies to implement the DFMA methodology.  DFMA is a registered trademark of Boothroyd Dewhurst, Inc.

'''Dora Gordine''' (8th June 1895 – 29 December 1991) was an Estonian Jewish [[Modernism|Modernist]] figurative and portraitist sculptor. Her early career was influenced by the [[Young Estonia|Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’)]] group of artists who favoured [[Art Nouveau]]. She moved to Paris and on her second marriage to Hon.Richard Hare (1907–66), her career expanded to the extent that some critics regarded her as amongst the finest sculptors of her generation.&lt;ref name=EJA&gt;In May 1925 Dora exhibited a Bronze (503) at the Salon Nationale (closed at the end of August 1925). She gave her birthplace as 'Libau', her nationality as 'Esthoniene'..." [http://eja.pri.ee/Culture/Gordin%20Dora_en.html Dora Gordine] Estonian Jewish Museum&lt;/ref&gt;She specialized 
in Portrait sculptures attracting international admirers from the: political, social, artistic, literary and theatrical worlds. Her legacy also includes a number of public space pieces. Her latter career was not as prolific or as fated with praise and Gordine was relatively unknown at the time of her death. Major exhibitions in London in 2006 and 2009 have revived her standing and her former home is now a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|publisher=Dorich House Museum|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122005604/http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Early life==
Dora Gordine's childhood has not been well documented. There is confusion over her date of birth with various dates 1895 (likely), 1898 and 1906 mentioned. She was the youngest of four children born to '''Morduch ("Mark") Gordin''' and '''Emma Ester Schepshelewitch''', both Russian Jews, in [[Liepāja|Liepāja, Latvia]], at a time when it was still part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Two of her siblings, Nikolai and Anna, died at the hands of the Nazis in [[Tallinn|Tallinn, Estonia]] in 1941. Another brother, Leopold, escaped and lived in London until his death. The Gordin family evidently belonged to a comfortable middle class. There was money available to pay Gordine’s elder brother, Leopold, to study engineering at [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]]. Later, it seems that Gordine’s father was also prepared to pay for Gordine’s elder sister, Anna, to study at one of Tallinn’s leading art schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Encyclopedia'', 6th edition Gordin Family Document Archive 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Gordin, application to the Home Secretary for British citizenship, 18 February 1930, HO 144/12019, NAKG&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912 the Gordin family had moved to [[Tallinn|Tallinn, Estonia]]. It is clear that Gordine’s approach to sculpture was considerably shaped by the example of the pre-First World War Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’) a group of artists who championed [[Art Nouveau]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Estonia|last=Lauer|first=M.|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=186-187}}&lt;/ref&gt; She exhibited bronze sculptures in Tallinn in 1917, 1920 and 1921. In the autumn of 1924 she came to [[Paris]] to study a course in [[French civilisation]], improving her knowledge of contemporary French sculptural practice. Then, surrounded by galleries and salons, she "instinctively felt a correlation between the rhythms of music and sculpture" and developed her sculptural vision. Gordin gallicised her surname by adding an “e" perhaps in an effort to make it sound more Russian and always denied or deflected suggestions that she was [[Jews|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;In November 1928 printmaker Diana White asked Esther Pissarro (wife of the painter Lucien), who was Jewish by birth, 'Dora Gordine...is she Jewess? Some of her work...made me think she was...' D. White to E. Pissarro, 2 November 1928, Pissarro Papers, Department of Western Art, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford University [AMO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Mackenzie to F. Pearson, 14 February 1994, Archives, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 she worked as a painter on a mural for the [[British Pavilion]] at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, in Paris. It provided the means to cast a bronze for exhibition at the Beaux Arts Society. The following year she was invited to exhibit at the [[Salon des Tuileries]] where her design of the head &amp; torso of a Chinese philosopher earned enthusiastic reviews; The Straits Times (1932) wrote: "Like Byron, one morning Dora Gordine woke up famous". Between 1929 and 1935 she sculpted bronzes for the [[City Hall, Singapore]]. [[Leicester Galleries]] in [[London]] presented Gordine's sculpture in a solo show in 1928. It was a huge success and all her work was sold, amongst which Javanese Head was bought by [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]] for the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;Kwok Kian Chow.

==Marriage==
In 1930 she married her first husband, Englishman Dr [[George Herbert Garlick]] in [[Singapore]]. In 1936 she married her second husband, the Hon. [[Richard Gilbert Hare]] (5 September 1907 – 1966), son of [[Richard Granville Hare, 4th Earl of Listowel]] and Freda Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone on 21 November 1936. Through her marriage she became part of a liberal aristocratic cultural elite, a member of the top ten percent in Britain when three quarters of the nation belonged to the working class.&lt;ref&gt;In 1931 the working class comprised 78% of the British population. Twenty years later this had fallen to 72% though this still constituted of 36 million people. Hennessy P. Having It So Good: Britain in the Fifties (London: Penguin, 2006) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The independent income from Hare allowed Dora to build Dorich House in [[Kingston Vale]], her studio and a showcase for her work. As well as, a showcase for their collections of Indian, Chinese and nineteenth century Russian art and furniture.

==Career==
[[File:Male Torso by Dora Gordine, Senate House, University of London 01.jpg|thumb|''Male Torso'', Dora Gordine, Senate House, University of London.]]
Her husband introduced her to London society figures, many of whom sat for her, Dame [[Edith Evans]], Dame [[Beryl Grey]], [[Dorothy Tutin]], [[Siân Phillips]], [[Emlyn Williams]], Sir [[Kenneth Clark]], [[John Pope-Hennessy]] and Professor F. Brown, Head of the Slade School of Art. There were also overseas commissions including the Philosopher [[Kuu Nim]], whose head sculpture Gordine called 'the Chinese Lady of Peace' and a low-relief at [[Gray's Inn]] to [[Sun Yat-Sen]], the former leader of China.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Jonathan Black,Sculptor, artist, Designer: Sculptor, Designer and Artist, Classical serenity in a Troubled Age: Dora Gordine's Commissions During The 1940's, Philip Wilson (London 2009), {{ISBN|0-85667-644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each portrait head had its own patina according to Gordine's vision of her sitter. When interviewed by the [[BBC]] in 1972 Gordine commented that, ''"when you do portrait busts of somebody you do their noses and mouth – but it is nothing. You have to imagine what they are like inside and bring out their inner feeling and then put it in a form"''.&lt;ref&gt;1972 BBC interview subsequently partly repeated in February 2009 on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Woman's Hour]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Gordine’s career was brought to a halt. She no longer had access to Valsuani’s in Paris, her favourite foundry, and bronze quickly became rationed. All foundries in Britain were ordered stop all non-essential activity and concentrate on war production. It was not until late 1943 or early 1944 that she found a new foundry and was able to have some of her latest bronze work exhibited in the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;D. Gordine to Sir S. Cockerell, 7 October 1945, Cockerell Papers, BL, London.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s/50s Gordine's work was exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the Society of Portrait Sculptors and elsewhere. In October 1945 she had a solo exhibition at the [[Leicester Galleries]], in which [[The Times]] described her as having ‘much ability, though she is eclectic in her inspiration, being influenced by works from many schools and periods - Indian and Egyptian among others. Her best works are her portrait heads in bronze which are convincing and straightforward.’&lt;ref&gt;Times, 6 November 1945, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Bronzes from this time have ironic or humorous titles, relating to the pose, such as 'Great Expectations' or 'Mischief' and, of an RAF Officer, 'Above Cloud'. She was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]] in 1949. She occasionally did exotic or erotic pieces (e.g. for Elizabeth Choy). She travelled and lectured in [[United States|America]], working in Hollywood, art lecturing and designing film sets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Alicia|title=Tate Women Artists|year=2004|publisher=Tate Publishing|location=London|isbn=1-85437-311-0|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947 and revisited the USA in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Jonathan Black, sculptor, artist, Designer: Sculptor, Designer and Artist, Philip Wilson (London 2009), {{ISBN|0-85667-644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 she was commissioned to produce a sculpture to stand in the new mother and baby unit at [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]] in north London. 'Happy Baby' was largely forgotten by 2009 languishing in an administration block at the prison for many years. Now regarded as an important piece in 'La Gordine's' professional history it formed the centre piece of an exhibition of her work at [[Kingston University]] in February–March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Kingston University Press Office: Jailbreak Baby Goes On the Run from Holloway&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 [[Esso]] commissioned a 7' x 5' low-relief  'Power' for their new [[Milford Haven Refinery]], which was unveiled by the Duke of Edinburgh. Gordine's last public commission, the 8' long 'Mother and Child' was made for the entrance hall of the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]], Surrey, in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Professor R.Y. Goodden to J. Samson, 5 May 1960, Archives, DHM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Widowhood and Death==
Her husband's sudden death in 1966 from a heart attack left Gordine to live out her life alone in Dorich House. She had no children. As Gordine’s client base became smaller and health problems undermined her ability to work to the standard she had during the 1920s, her eyesight deteriorated and she had arthritis in her shoulders and arms causing her career to end in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Balfour, 'Dora Gordine', Independent, 7 January 1992, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; She had a great interest in her garden and, in particular, herbs and plants used for medicinal purposes, such as Tansy. [[Adrian Howells|Adrian Howes]] and [[Robert Ruthven]] were her part-time gardeners for nearly two years in the mid-seventies. She often invited the members of the [[Royal Ballet School]] to Dorich house to pose for her. She died in Dorich House in December 1991, aged around 96.

In subsequent years her work was to be revived by major exhibitions in London in 2006 at the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] in the [[London Jewish Museum of Art]], and in 2009 at Dorich House and [[Kingston University]].

==Dorich House==
Dorich House was designed by Gordine and completed in 1936. The name chosen for the house was a [[portmanteau]] of Dora and Richard's names. The house is spread across three floors; the ground and first floors devoted to the production and display of Gordine's work, with the upper floor forming the couple's private apartment. In 1994, it was acquired by Kingston University and was refurbished and formally opened as a museum in 1996, housing Gordine's collection of bronze and plaster sculptures and many of her paintings and drawings. There are also items from Hare's Imperial Russian art collection, which includes icons, paintings, ceramics, glassware, metalwork, folk art and furniture dating from the early 18th century to the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|publisher=Dorich House Museum|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122005604/http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Early Netherlandish Painting''', Its Origins and Character'', is a 1953 book on [[art history]] by [[Erwin Panofsky]], derived from the 1947–48 [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]. The book had a wide impact&lt;ref&gt;Shone, Richard and Stonard, John-Paul, eds. ''The Books That Shaped Art History: From Gombrich and Greenberg to Alpers and Krauss'', chapter 7. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; on studies of [[Renaissance art]] and [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in particular, but also studies in [[iconography]], art history, and [[intellectual history]] in general. The book is particularly well-known for its iconographic treatment of [[Jan Van Eyck|Van Eyck's]] ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' as a kind of marriage contract, a hypothesis advanced by Panofsky as early as 1934. The book remains influential despite its reliance on black-and-white reproductions of paintings, which led to some errors of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;''The Books That Shaped Art History'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

''Early Netherlandish Painting'' shares its title with the [[Early Netherlandish Painting (Friedländer)|comprehensive, 14-volume survey]] by [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max J. Friedländer]], a fact obliquely acknowledged at the beginning of the preface.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Netherlandish Painting'', p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Seuministerio.JPG|thumb|right|The front door of the abandoned Palace of the Duchess of Sueca in [[Madrid]], featured in the series as the façade of the headquarters of the Ministry.]]
The Ministry of Time is the best kept secret of the state of Spain: an autonomous government institution that reports directly to the [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]. Its patrols have to watch the [[Time travel|doors of time]] so that no intruder from other eras can [[Alternate history|change history]] for their own benefit.

The series follows the assignments of the Ministry's newest patrol: the one formed by [[Army of Flanders]] soldier Alonso de Entrerríos, 19th century student Amelia Folch and 21st century [[S.A.M.U.R.|Samur]] paramedic Julián Martínez.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
* [[Rodolfo Sancho]] as Julián Martínez, one of three members of the protagonist patrol. He is a trained [[S.A.M.U.R.|SAMUR]] paramedic from 21st century Madrid. Present as a member of the patrol through season 1 and second half of season 2. Sancho left the series at the end of the second season after failing to reach an agreement with the  show producers.&lt;ref name=Sancho&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=13 December 2016 |title=Por qué no vamos a echar de menos a Rodolfo Sancho en "El Ministerio del Tiempo" |trans-title=Why we will not miss Rodolfo Sancho in ''The Ministry of Time'' |url= http://www.abc.es/play/series/noticias/abci-no-vamos-echar-menos-rodolfo-sancho-ministerio-tiempo-201612122349_noticia.html|language= Spanish|newspaper=ABC |location=Madrid |access-date=15 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His absence during the first half of season 2 was due to his shooting for ''[[Mar de plástico]]''.&lt;ref name=Sancho/&gt;
* [[Aura Garrido]] as Amelia Folch, the leader of the protagonist patrol. She is a late 19th century pioneering university student and an only child from an upper-class [[Barcelona]] family, still living with her parents. Garrido left the series halfway through the third season citing scheduling conflicts after she, like Sancho, signed on to other projects due to renewal uncertainty. She left on good terms and is open to returning in the future.
* [[Nacho Fresneda]] as Alonso de Entrerríos, one of three members of the protagonist patrol. A highly experienced 16th-century soldier from [[Seville]], he is portrayed as an expert in fields of combat. Recruited just prior to being executed, he lives in the 21st century.
* [[Cayetana Guillén Cuervo]] as Irene Larra Girón, Head of Logistics inside the Ministry. A lesbian from the repressed 1960s, her character is used to express a less rigid viewpoint within the Ministry.
* Juan Gea as Ernesto Jiménez, Chief Operating Officer inside the Ministry. Recruited from the 15th century, he is fiercely incorruptible and a perfectionist.
* [[Jaime Blanch]] as Undersecretary Salvador Martí, Head of the Ministry. His (and the Ministry's) overriding priority is to protect and repair history.
* Francesca Piñón as Angustias Vázquez, personal secretary to Salvador and a widow.
* [[Hugo Silva (actor)|Hugo Silva]] as Jesús Méndez Pontón, AKA "Pacino", a replacement member for Julián in the second and third seasons. He is a handsome police officer from 1981 Madrid, nicknamed "Pacino" due to a resemblance with actor [[Al Pacino]], whom he admires.
* [[Macarena García]] as (young) Lola Mendieta, the younger self of a former Ministry agent believed to have been KIA. After being recruited to the Ministry, she eventually joins the protagonist patrol. She is the first and only agent to ever be recruited twice. García joins the principal cast in the third season.

===Recurring characters===

* Blanca (Susana Córdoba): Alonso's wife, who believes him to be dead since she does not know his [[death penalty|execution]] was avoided by the Ministry.
* Elena Castillo (Susana Córdoba): Alonso's love interest in the present day and Blanca's doppelgänger.
* Susana Torres ([[Mar Saura]]): The [[Liaison officer|liaison]] of the Ministry with the Prime Minister. Her visits usually mean bad news for Salvador.

* [[Enriqueta Martí]] (María Rodríguez): A serial murderer who worked as Amelia's maid for a short time.
* Marisa (Nieve de Medina): An old love interest of Ernesto's who has returned to work in the Ministry.
* Armando Leiva (José Antonio Lobato): A former agent who rebelled against the Ministry when Salvador refused to allow him to bring his 10-year-old son, diagnosed with [[leukemia]], to the present so that doctors from the 21st century could tend to him.

* Paul Walcott (Jimmy Shaw): An [[United States|American]] time traveller who worked for mysterious corporation Darrow Ltd.

But that goal becomes essential when that someone who wants to change history is nothing less than the Nazi regime.

By travelling to Montserrat, Amelia, Julián and Alonso are tasked with avoiding this, whilst Ernesto and Irene go to Hendaye, where Hitler and Franco negotiate the participation of Spain in the second world war.

Against the rules of the Ministry, Julián, Amelia and Alonso are sent to 1491 to save Levi, but the door to that year is in a [[time loop]] and they only have one day to accomplish their mission.

That could mean that Don Quixote cannot see the light in 1605 or worse: never. It's something that Miguel does not seem to worry about.

In that same abbey, the Napoleonic troops got three men arrested: Tordesillas' priest, and two Spanish men accused of [[spy]]ing the French movements on the zone. According to the history, the intervention of the abbess convinced Napoleon to pardon the life of the three men. But the Ministry has been warned that the abbess died before what history says. The death of these three men would not be so important, if it was not because one of them is an ancestor of [[Adolfo Suárez]], [[President of the Government of Spain]] during [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition]]. If the history changes and Napoleon executes them, Adolfo Suárez will not be born. The thing is they need to search someone that can act as the abbess... And the chosen one is Angustias, the secretary.

| ShortSummary    = Julián is still trapped in the [[Siege of Baler]]. Located at random by the Ministry, Salvador sends Alonso de Entrerríos to release him on a secret mission that even Amelia and Pacino know nothing. Alonso and Julián will witness the heroism of men defending a place without weapons, without food and consumed by disease. They are fighting for what they believe to be Spanish territory without knowing that that had ceased to be: Spain had already [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|renounced its rights]] over Cuba and the Philippines. Given the prolonged absence of Alonso, Amelia and Pacino suspect that behind it all there is something fishy.

This would be normal if not because it is one of the paintings destroyed by fire at the [[Royal Alcazar of Madrid|Alcázar de Madrid]] in 1734. In the absence of patrols due to a labor agreement, Velázquez, himself, and Irene travel there to investigate what is happening. It is large-scale art theft by Darrow in collaboration with Lola Mendieta. They are replacing originals with copies in order to do business with them.

There is a school group with their teacher, who faints upon seeing a woman like her in a photo from 1930 of the Sinsombrero, a group of avant-garde women who have fallen into oblivion. As an investigation into the case begins, an alarm in the Ministry arises: the [[Enriqueta Martí|Vampire of Raval]] has not been arrested when history says and walks free.

| ShortSummary    = They say that one wedding brings another, a theory noted by Irene; but for Salvador and Julián attending a wedding involves reliving their own and better times will not return. They will soon have to stop thinking about it, because it is held in a castle converted into a wedding hall. The castle in which the wedding is celebrated hides a legend which returns to the present though an uncatalogued portal. The legend is that of the young Constanza who could not marry her beloved (a humble shepherd) because of Fadrique, lord of the castle, in 1212. The problem arises as it is discovered that the legend is real. And in the castle there is a time portal not catalogued by the Ministry.

Following the refusal of the Ministry in 1588 to collaborate, Philip takes hold of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], enters the Ministry and discovers that not only can he travel into the past but also the future. He plants himself in 2016 so that he can not only be king of the world, but also king of time. When the patrol returns from a mission where they saved one of the fathers of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of 1812]], they find history has changed. And not just for the better.

'''Florence Meyer Blumenthal''' (1875–1930) was an American philanthropist who founded the ''Fondation franco-américaine Florence Blumenthal (Franco-American Florence Blumenthal Foundation),'' which awarded the [[Prix Blumenthal]] from 1919-1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians — to promote Franco- American relations.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;

For their altruism, Florence Blumenthal and her husband [[George Blumenthal (banker)|George Blumenthal]] received the [[Légion d'honneur|French Legion of Honor]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;  Both [[:fr:Rue Florence-Blumenthal|a street]] as well as [[:fr:Square Florence-Blumenthal|a public square]] in Paris are named in her honor.

==Biography==
Florence Meyer was born in Los Angeles in 1875, the third of eight children&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; of [[Marc Eugene Meyer]], dry goods merchant from [[Strasbourg, France]], and Harriet Newmark Meyer, daughter of [[Joseph Newmark]], who founded New York’s Elm Street Synagogue.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;  Florence's younger brother [[Eugene Isaac Meyer|Eugene Meyer Jr.]] was president and publisher of ''[[The Washington Post]].''&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paris residence"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Florence married international financier George Blumenthal.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; In 1919, she  organized the ''La Fondation américaine Blumenthal pour la pensée et l’art français (American Foundation for French Art and Thought)'' in Paris to discover young French artists, aid them financially, and in the process draw the United States and France closer together through art, thought, and literature.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;

In 1925, Blumenthal moved to Paris with her husband, later donating to the [[Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital|Children’s Hospital in Paris]] the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris.  She and her husband received the [[French Legion of Honor]] in 1929,&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;  and Blumenthal died of bronchial pneumonia at her home in Paris on September 21, 1930, at age fifty-five.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"&gt;{{Cite web

''Washington Post'' publisher [[Katharine Graham]] described her aunt, known within the family as Florie, as having a perfect figure and for "bringing home massive amounts of clothing from Paris."&lt;ref name="catal"/&gt; Blumenthal was also related to the [[Levi Strauss]] family through her older sisters, Rosalie and Elise, each of whom had married a nephew of Strauss'.&lt;ref name="catal"&gt;{{Cite web

  | quote = By today's standards, George and Florence Blumenthal would definitely be considered a power couple. With palatial homes in New York and Paris, and Mediterranean yachting vacations, the Blumenthals lived vibrantly in a vibrant time. In her autobiography, retired Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham described her aunt, Florence Blumenthal, as her father's much-loved sister with the perfect figure. Known as Florie to the family, she was known for bringing home massive amounts of clothing from Paris. She was also related to the powerful Levi Strauss family through her older sisters, Rosalie and Elise, each of whom had married a nephew of Strauss'. Eccentric and generous, Mrs. Blumenthal endowed the Franco-American Foundation's Florence Blumenthal Prize, and had a street named for her in Paris.

The Blumenthals summered in France or on yachts in the Mediterranean&lt;ref name="paris residence"/&gt; and were noted for their residences, [[Knollwood Club]] in the Adirondacks, their [[George Blumenthal House|mansion in New York]] (half a city block and had an indoor tiled swimming pool)&lt;ref name="catal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exerpt"&gt;{{cite news

In 2010 (May 14-June 5), the [[Médiathèque]] of [[Haguenau]] hosted an exhibit of the Florence Blumenthal archives.&lt;ref name="mediatheque"&gt;{{Cite web

Recognizing the quality of care provided to their son by Professor Le Mee at the Necker Children's Hospital in Paris, the Blumenthals make a significant donation for the construction of a new building, the Blumenthal Pavilion, built in 1926 as an innovative Ear Nose &amp; Throat (ENT) center operating around the clock, similar to the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]].

==Prix Blumenthal==
{{Main|Prix Blumenthal}}
The [[Prix Blumenthal]] (or ''Blumenthal Prize'') was a grant or [[stipend]] awarded through the ''Fondation franco-américaine Florence Blumenthal (Franco-American Florence Blumenthal Foundation)'', which Florence Blumenthal had founded.  Grants were given from 1919-1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

Juries including [[Paul Signac]] and [[Aristide Maillol]],&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; awarded a [[Prix Blumenthal]] [[prize money|purse]] of six thousand francs per year for two years.  This was increased from 1926 until her death in 1930 to ten thousand francs a year.

From 1919 to 1954 nearly two hundred artists received grants,&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; including in 1921 [[Georges Migot]] (1891–1976), composer, painter, and a carver; in 1926 [[Paul Belmondo (sculptor)|Paul Belmondo]], sculptor; also in 1926  [[Paule Marrot]], textile artist;&lt;ref name="dauphinomaniac2"&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = D'une nécéssité aux prototypes "109"...

===Impact of the Prix===
As an example of the impact of the Prix Blumenthal, textile artist [[Paule Marrot]] received the stipend in 1928, which allowed Marrot to open her workshop in [[Batignolles]] on rue Truffaut — where she became widely known for furniture textiles.&lt;ref name="legion"&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = About Paule Marrot
  | publisher = Hayden Harnett, Haydenharnett.com
  | url = http://haydenharnett.com/?action=about_paule_marrot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marrot went on to experience strong popularity and commercial success in the U.S. after World War II, made [[Renault Dauphine#Paule Marrot|a strong impact at Renault]] in pioneering the company's textile and color division, and redefined furnishing fabrics in [[France]]. In 1952 Marrot won in 1952, the French [[Légion d'honneur|Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honor)]], (''Chevalier'') — and her textiles continue under license to diverse companies including  [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Urban Outfitters|Anthropologie]] and the handbag maker, [[Hayden-Harnett]].&lt;ref name="legion"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591">The '''Fundred Dollar Bill Project''' is an art project implemented by [[Mel Chin]], and is aimed to connect and represent the voices of children across the United States, with the end goal to propose a funding solution for the [[lead poisoning|lead contamination]] in the soil of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].  People in the United States and around the globe are invited to draw their own 100 dollar bills and send to collection centers, or schools, for safekeeping. During a nationwide road-trip in an armored truck, the Fundred Dollar Bills will be collected.

The completed Fundred Dollar Bills will be presented to Congress for an even exchange of U.S. dollars to help the remediation of lead in the soil of New Orleans. This funding supports [[Operation Paydirt]], which is the program that, once implemented, will make the lead content in the soil safe for inhabitants of New Orleans and cities affected by lead poisoning-across the United States.

So far nearly half a million people have created and sent in their unique Fundreds. 

'''Armored Truck Tour'''

Throughout 2010, students at hundreds of schools across the country created Fundred Dollar Bills that were picked up in a specially designed armored truck. 
As students and educators handed their Fundreds over to truck guards for safekeeping, schools held events that raised awareness of the gravity and persistence of the lead in our environment. 

These events gave local elected officials and community organizations a chance to show their support for lead cleanup while giving local press brought the issue to larger audiences.

At every stop the armored truck tour connected the national campaign for lead awareness. Each event around the country not only provided public and impassioned demonstrations against lead poisoning, but brought people together to make connections around this public health health issue.

Grand Rapids

In the fall of 2014, the ArtPrize competition in Grand Rapids, Michigan featuring the Fundred Dollar Bill Project, offered an opportunity to raise visibility of local lead issues and invite participation from the tends of thousands of expected visitors. 

Visitors to the exhibit sat at bank teller tables and drew their unique Fundreds. Once drawn, their Fundreds were added to hundreds of others on a wall in the exhibit, making their artful demonstrations part of the exhibit for its duration. In addition to creating a public display of action-oriented art, the Grand Rapids initiative brought together local public health specialists, educators, and scientists to talk about the challenges and solutions to lead poisoning in Grand Rapids.

Art Academy in Cincinnati

In 2015, the Art Academy of Cincinnati partnered with the Fundred Dollar Bill Project and the Cincinnati Health Department Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program to create a course that used art and design to address and impact issues of lead contamination in Cincinnati. 

With the Fundred Dollar Bill Project as a common starting point and inspiration, students launched group projects to increase awareness of childhood lead poisoning and our ability to put an end to it. Students exhibited their projects at a publicly accessible end of semester block party. Students explored lead poisoning through dance performance and graphic design and created a learning-through-play area. The Health Department shared information about lead, and a public Fundred drawing table provided opportunity for attendees to sit together for conversation and to creatively put their values in action.

'''Initiatives'''

Fundred Reserve Open Lab at H-Space, located in DC, is a space to expand the Fundred program by continuing to amplify personal stories, having fact based dialogue about problems in DC, and engaging more people to take purposeful action. 

Open Lab continues the presence after the 2017 Fundred Reserve exhibition at The Corcoran.  Open Lab programming runs from October through April 2018, with space provided by Hamiltonian Artists, and support from The Kresge Foundation through our partnership with MIT CoLab. 

As an extension of Mel Chin’s multi-venue exhibition, All Over the Place (April 8 - September 5, 2018), the Fundred Project is on view at the Queens Museum as part of the exhibition.

The so-called '''''{{lang|de|Gunthertuch}}''''' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} ‘Gunther's shroud’) is a [[Byzantine silk]] [[tapestry]] which represents the [[Roman triumph|triumphal]] return of a [[Byzantine Emperor]] from a victorious campaign. The piece was purchased, or possibly received as a gift, by [[Gunther von Bamberg]], [[Bishop]] of [[Bamberg]], during his 1064–65 pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. Gunther died on his return journey, and was buried with it in the [[Bamberg Cathedral]]. The fabric was rediscovered in 1830, and is now exhibited in the Bamberg Diocesan Museum.

== History ==
In November 1064, Gunther took part in the so-called "[[Great German Pilgrimage of 1064–1065|Great German Pilgrimage]]" to [[Jerusalem]], under the leadership of the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] [[Siegfried I (Archbishop of Mainz)|Siegfried I]], the [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|Bishop of Utrecht]] [[William I (Bishop of Utrecht)|William I]], and the [[Bishop of Regensburg]], [[Otto von Riedenburg]]. The pilgrims, numbering some 7,000 people, journeyed through [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and then through the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last= Holder-Egger | editor-first=Oswald | title = Lamperti monachi Hersfeldensis Opera.

At [[Constantinople]], the Byzantine capital, Gunther's imposing stature and his elegant clothes led to the belief that he was the emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], travelling incognito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schmugge | first = Ludwig | title = Über "nationale" Vorurteile im Mittelalter | journal = Deutsches Archiv für Erforschung des Mittelalters | volume = 38 | year = 1982 | pages = 439–459 | url = http://www.digizeitschriften.de/main/dms/gcs-wrapper/?gcsurl=http%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A8086%252Fgcs%252Fgcs%253F%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526action%253Dpdf%2526metsFile%253DPPN345858735_0038%2526divID%253Dlog32%2526pdftitlepage%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.digizeitschriften.de%25252Fmain%25252Fdms%25252Fpdf-titlepage%25252F%25253FmetsFile%25253DPPN345858735_0038%252526divID%25253Dlog32%2526targetFileName%253D_log32.pdf | language = de }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how Gunther came by the silk.

== Description ==
The cloth is a woven using the [[tapestry]] technique.&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;Muthesius, Anna, "Silk in the Medieval World". In Jenkins, David, ed., ''The Cambridge History of Western Textiles'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-34107-8}}, pp. 350-351.&lt;/ref&gt; It is 218 cm high and 211 cm wide, showing a Byzantine emperor on a patterned background. He is riding on a white horse, wears a Byzantine-style imperial crown, and carries a miniature ''[[labarum]]'' on his right hand. The emperor is flanked by two ''[[Tyche]]'' figures, female personifications of a city's fortune. They are crowned with [[mural crown]]s and dressed in ankle-long yellow undergarments and coloured transparent over-tunics. The ''Tyche'' on the right, with a green over-tunic, presents the emperor probably with a crown, while the left one, dressed in blue, holds the ''[[toupha]]'', a headgear reserved exclusively for triumphs. Both figures are represented barefoot, a symbolic convention typical of slaves, signifying their submission to the emperor, or to represent their divinity as the goddess of fortune.

== Interpretation ==
[[File:Tzimiskes returns.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The triumphal return of John Tzimiskes to Constantinople in 971, as depicted in the ''[[Madrid Skylitzes]]''. A carriage with the icon of the Virgin Mary precedes the emperor, who is followed by the captive Bulgarian tsar [[Boris II of Bulgaria|Boris II]].]]
The emperor was initially identified, by the French Byzantinist [[André Grabar]], with [[Basil II]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 976–1025), and his triumphal return from his [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|wars]] against the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]].&lt;ref name="Grabar"&gt;{{cite journal | first = André | last = Grabar | title = La soie byzantine de l'eveque Gunther a la Cathedrale de Bamberg | journal = Münchener Jahrbuch | volume = 7 | year = 1956 | page = 227|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern research however has concluded that the cloth represents [[John I Tzimiskes]] (r. 969–976) and his return in 971 from his [[Siege of Dorostolon|campaign]] against the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']], who had [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|invaded and occupied]] Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="prig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steph"/&gt;

According to the contemporary historian [[Leo the Deacon]], during his triumphal procession Tzimiskes rode on a white horse behind a wagon carrying an icon of the [[Virgin Mary]] as well as the Bulgarian regalia, with the captive [[Boris II of Bulgaria]] and his family following behind Tzimiskes.&lt;ref name="steph2"&gt;{{citation | last=Stephenson | first=Paul| title=Byzantium's Balkan Frontier: A Political Study of the Northern Balkans, 900–1204  | publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 | isbn=0-521-77017-3  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ILiOI0UgxHoC | pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later account of [[John Skylitzes]] differs in some details in the description of the procession, but both sources agree that on this occasion, Tzimiskes rode a white horse, and that two Bulgarian crowns played an important role in the proceedings. Both authors also agree that one of these crowns was a ''[[tiara]]'' (i.e. the ''toupha''), in accordance with the ''{{lang|de|Gunthertuch}}''’s depiction.&lt;ref name="steph"/&gt;

Older sources interpreted the two ''Tychae'' as representing [[Rome]] and Constantinople ("New Rome"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Percy Ernst | last = Schramm | title = Das Herrscherbild in der Kunst des frühen Mittelalters | journal = Vorträge der Bibliothek Warburg, 2 (1922–23) | pages = 159–161|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Josef | last = Deér | title = Die heilige Krone Ungarns | publisher = Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften | location = Vienna | year = 1966 | page = 59|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[Athens]] and Constantinople, the two cities where Basil II celebrated his victory over the Bulgarians.&lt;ref name="Grabar"/&gt; A different proposal suggested, based on the colour of their clothes, that they represented the Blues and the Greens, the two traditional ''demoi'' ([[Chariot racing|circus parties]]) of Constantinople.&lt;ref name="prig"/&gt; Modern scholarship on the other hand suggests that they may represent the two major cities captured during Tzimiskes' campaign, [[Preslav]] and [[Dorostolon]]. It is significant in this context that these two cities were renamed into ''Ioannoupolis'' (after the emperor) and ''Theodoroupolis'' (after [[Theodore Stratelates|St. Theodore the Stratelate]], who was believed to have intervened in the final battle against the Rus' before Dorostolon).&lt;ref name="steph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steph2"/&gt;

'''''Il dio serpente''''' (The snake god) is a [[List of Italian films of 1970|1970]] [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] [[erotic film|erotic]] [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Piero Vivarelli]] and featuring Italian-based American actress [[Nadia Cassini]] in her first lead role. The film is an earlier example of [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] (and later [[zombie]]) themed [[sexploitation film]]s shot in the [[Dominican Republic]] by Italian directors. The theme song of the film, "Djamballà" by [[Augusto Martelli]], reached the first position in the Italian hit parade.&lt;ref name=hitparade&gt;{{cite book|last=Dario Salvatori|title=Storia dell'Hit Parade|publisher=Gramese, 1989|isbn=8876054391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Paola (Cassini) is in a deteriorating marriage with Bernard ([[Galeazzo Bentivoglio]]). After the couple move to an island in the [[Caribbean]], Paola befriends a local woman named Stella ([[Beryl Cunningham]]) who introduces her to the cult of the serpent god Djamballà. Paola, first despising the rituals of the cult, soon realises that they represent the passion and lust lacking in her married life. At a ritual where reality is interspersed within fantasy, Paola has sex with a strong black man ([[Evaristo Márquez]]) she identifies with the serpent god himself. After her husband's sudden death, she invites her former lover Tony ([[Sergio Tramonti]]) to the island to start a new life but understands that Djamballà has become her sole obsession.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35548">The following '''is a list of unproduced [[Kamal Haasan]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, Indian film actor-director [[Kamal Haasan]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his acting commitments or direction. Some of these projects fell into [[development hell]] or were officially cancelled.

== 1980s ==
=== ''Khabardar'' ===
Telugu director [[Tatineni Rama Rao]] started working on the film in 1984, which was a social drama centred upon a terminally ill patient and a doctor. [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]] worked on the film which revolved around the notion of euthanasia. However, after shooting a substantial portion of the film, it was shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mid-day.com/photos/sunday-rewind-bollywood-films-that-never-released/4737/41951|title=Sunday rewind: Bollywood films that never released|website=mid-day}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Untitled adaptation of ''The Godfather'' ===
In the mid-1980s, [[Muktha Srinivasan]] planned to direct a film based on the American film ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) with [[Sivaji Ganesan]], Kamal Haasan and [[Amala Akkineni|Amala]]. He paid them an [[Advance payment|advance]] and confirmed their dates; however the project was dropped after Kamal Haasan's then associate Ananthu felt that it would be a Ganesan-focused film and not a Kamal film.&lt;ref name="GLORY"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/living-in-past-glory/article4034360.ece |title=Living in past glory |last=Srinivasan |first=Muktha V. |date=28 October 2012 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=22 February 2018 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6NtT7DnHh?url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/living-in-past-glory/article4034360.ece |archive-date=7 March 2014 |dead-url=no |author-link=Muktha Srinivasan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1990s ==
=== ''Athi Veerapandiyan'' ===
In the early 1990s, [[Gangai Amaran]] agreed terms to direct a film titled ''Athi Veerapandiyan'' starring Kamal Haasan in the lead role. The film was based on [[jallikattu]] and [[Aishwarya (actress)|Aishwarya]] was signed to portray the leading female role. However Kamal Haasan later opted out of the film and instead began work on another rural drama, ''[[Thevar Magan]]'' (1992), directed by [[Bharathan]]. He later credited Gangai Amaran for the idea of the song "Sandhu Pottu" from the film, which was initially meant for ''Athi Veerapandiyan''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayyam.com/talk/archive/index.php/t-9820-p-10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Gangai Amaran alleged that his brother [[Ilaiyaraaja]] had effectively told Kamal Haasan to stop working on the project, during an ego clash between the two brothers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiaglitz.com/gangai-amaran-says-illayaraja-and-kamal-haasan-cheated-him-tamil-news-161513&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Kanden Seethaiyai'' ===
{{see|Kanden Seethaiyai (unreleased film)}}
[[Balachandra Menon]] wanted to remake his Malayalam film ''[[Ammayane Sathyam]]'' (1993) into Tamil, and turned down remake offers from other directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/soc.culture.tamil/sbJZSuIwTZs|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Raveendran signed on Kamal Haasan to do the film and recruited [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]] to take another role.&lt;ref name=KSeethayae&gt;{{cite journal|title=Commentry - Bhagyathinte Marukara|journal=[[Vellinakshatram (magazine)|Vellinakshatram]]|date=7 January 1996 |pages= 28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team initially approached [[Annie (actress)|Annie]], who starred in the original to reprise her role as the lead female character, though her reluctance meant that the team picked newcomer Ruchita Prasad, who adopted a stage name of Jayasandhya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/soc.culture.tamil/sandya$20sitaraman/soc.culture.tamil/1EPmpEGDWEg/8xqXWn0UH2YJ|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The makers abandoned the project due to creative differences. It was later alleged that Kamal Haasan had wanted his role to be more prominent than the character from the original version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=13 Movies that were shot, but got shelved|url=http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies/slideshow/13-movies-that-were-shot-but-got-shelved/chinnamani-kuyile-1987.html|publisher=Behindwoods.com|accessdate=1 October 2016|date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=News - Kamal joins ''Indian''|journal=[[Vellinakshatram (magazine)|Vellinakshatram]]|date=21 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamal Haasan subsequently moved on to begin work on ''[[Avvai Shanmughi]]'' (1996), and recruited several members of the cast of ''Kanden Seethaiyai'' to work on his next project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayyam.com/talk/archive/index.php/t-9820-p-10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Ladies Only'' ===
{{see|Ladies Only}}
A remake of the Tamil film ''[[Magalir Mattum]]'' (1994), the film is yet to have a theatrical release for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No day, no show-30 Bollywood movies that never were released|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/30-bollywood-movies-that-never-were-released/1/181061.html|publisher=India Today|date=2006-07-03|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood films that never released|url=http://www.mid-day.com/photos/bollywood-films-that-never-released/4737/41950|publisher=Mid Day|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by Kamal Haasan, ''Ladies Only'' is the story of three women, Seema Biswas, Shilpa Shirodkar and Heera Rajagopal working in the same office. They are constantly harassed by their lecherous boss Randhir Kapoor. The three decide to gang up against him to teach a lesson, but a strange accident complicates things when the boss lands in a hospital and the three women end up with the dead body of a terrorist, played by Kamal Haasan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindi remake of "Magalir Mattum"|url=http://members.tripod.com/s_jagadish/kamal/ladies.html|publisher=tripod.com|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ladies Only-A Preview|url=http://www.asiangigs.com/ladies.htm|publisher=asiangigs.com|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Marudhanayagam'' ===
{{see|Marudhanayagam}}
Kamal Haasan had been pondering directing a historical film for a period of four to five years, when writer [[Sujatha Rangarajan|Sujatha]] suggested that Kamal Haasan looked at a [[Folk music|folk]] ballad edited by Tamil scholar Vanamamalai, which introduced them to the historical figure of [[Muhammed Yusuf Khan]], an 18th-century warrior.&lt;ref name="sujatha"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sudhakar |url=http://www.oocities.org/sujathapage/english/einterview1.html |title=Interview with Sujatha |publisher=Oocities.org |date=1998-05-17 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamal Haasan immediately agreed at the prospect and felt that the story had all the potential of a good historical film, being appealed to by the elevation from the nadir to the top of Khan's life. Sujatha revealed that nearly 80% of the film would faithfully adapt Samuel Charles Hill's biography of Khan, also known as Marudhanayagam, and to only use imagination where no solid or substantial information is available.&lt;ref name="sujatha"/&gt;

The producers and Kamal Haasan managed to rope in Queen [[Elizabeth II]] to appear as the chief guest at the launch of the project which took place in the MGR Film City on 16 October 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/99CA44DC65DFBC7465256941001E4BCD |title=Dose of Indian culture leaves Queen shoeless, speechless - The Times of India |publisher=Cscsarchive.org:8081 |date=1997-10-17 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch also saw the inaugural shot canned with Kamal Haasan, in the persona of Marudhanayagam, hearing and reacting to an imperial announcement read out by the character played by [[Nassar]], with [[Om Puri]]'s character looking on.&lt;ref name="redlaunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/oct/16queen.htm |title=Rediff On The NeT: Queen Elizabeth visits Kamal Hassan set |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official filming began several months later in [[Kottaiyur|Velangudi]] on 10 August 1998 with a scene of where a companion of the lead character, played by Kamal Haasan, is hanged prompting a brief altercation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/News/98/October/pnews_11159.html |title=Marudhanayagam Update! |publisher=Indolink.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works on ''Marudhanayagam'' suddenly ceased after a British company that had planned to co-produce the film backed out and the film has been indefinitely postponed since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200811121860.htm |title=The Hindu News Update Service |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103121643/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200811121860.htm |archivedate=3 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/jan-10-01/kamal-marudhanayagam-05-01-10.html |title=Kamal on Marudanayagam release - Tamil Movie News - Kamal Haasan &amp;#124; Marudanayagam &amp;#124; Udayanidhi Stalin &amp;#124; KS Ravikumar |publisher=Behindwoods.com |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haasan had invested {{Indian Rupee}} 8 crores of his own wealth into the project through and has since revealed that the film would be revived at a future date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/09/13/stories/2004091301120100.htm |title=Kamal, a phenomenon |publisher=The Hindu |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999, Kamal Haasan has consistently spoken of plans to revive the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-16/lyca-productions-to-collaborate-with-kamal-haasan.html|title=Lyca Productions to collaborate with Kamal Haasan|author=D Meera Chithirappaavai|work=Behindwoods|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151218/entertainment-kollywood/article/kamal%E2%80%99s-marudhanayagam-revived|title=Kamal’s Marudhanayagam revived?|work=deccanchronicle.com/|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamal Haasan had written the script of ''Londonil Kameshwaran'' and wanted to play the lead role in the late 1990s, but never got down to making it because he felt it would not have been cost-effective.&lt;ref name="rediff2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/entertai/2003/jun/21sand.htm |title='Someone has taken a political ride on my vehicle' - Rediff.com India News |publisher=Inhome.rediff.com |date=2003-06-21 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the project, he had aimed to reprise his character of the [[Palakkad]] [[Brahmin]] cook Kameshwaran from ''[[Michael Madana Kama Rajan]]'' (1990) and place him in funny situations when he visits [[London]]. He had briefly considered making the film in early 1999 after ''[[Marudhanayagam]]'' had run into production troubles, but instead chose to prioritise his commitments for ''[[Hey Ram]]'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.rediff.com/movies/1999/mar/10ss.htm|title=Rediff On The NeT, Movies: Gossip from the southern film industry|website=m.rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the profitable ''[[Pammal K. Sambandam]]'' (2002), Mouli asked Haasan to re-collaborate with this particular script but Haasan was uninterested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://election.rediff.com/movies/2003/feb/15mouli.htm |title=Director Mouli on Nala Damayanthi&amp;nbsp;— Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Election.rediff.com |date=2003-02-15 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]] was selected by Haasan to replace him, after the pair had shot for ''[[Anbe Sivam]]'' together in the period, and the project was made under Haasan's production house with the title of ''[[Nala Damayanthi]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mypage.rediff.com/movies/2003/jan/09kamal.htm |title=Kamal Haasan and Madhavan on their film Anbesivam |publisher=Mypage.rediff.com |date=2003-01-09 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Robot'' ===
{{see|Enthiran}}
Following the completion of his first directorial venture in Hindi, ''[[Nayak (2001 Hindi film)|Nayak]]'' (2001), [[S. Shankar]] announced his next project, ''Robot'', which was to feature Kamal Haasan and [[Preity Zinta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/others/news-interviews/Shankars-Endhiran-to-become-a-reality-soon/articleshow/6215072.cms? |title=Shankar's Endhiran to become a reality soon |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=26 July 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118101009/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/others/news-interviews/Shankars-Endhiran-to-become-a-reality-soon/articleshow/6215072.cms |archivedate=18 January 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BZ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2002/jan/02south.htm | title=Boys Zone | publisher=[[Rediff.com]] | date=2 January 2002 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118101218/http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2002/jan/02south.htm | archivedate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was to be produced by the now-defunct company Media Dreams, a division of [[Pentamedia Graphics]].&lt;ref name = "BZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Govardan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-01-05/news/28413738_1_rajinikanth-lulla-owned-eros-multimedia | title=Rajinikanth replaces Shah Rukh Khan in India's costliest movie | work=The Economic Times | date=5 January 2008 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | last=Govardan | first=D. | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126124918/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-01-05/news/28413738_1_rajinikanth-lulla-owned-eros-multimedia | archivedate=26 January 2013 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was reported to be a futuristic [[techno-thriller]] set in Chennai in around 2200 or 3000&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2004/08/16/stories/2004081600740200.htm | title=Man vs. machine | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=16 August 2004 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118100919/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2004/08/16/stories/2004081600740200.htm | archivedate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/movies/nirav-and-sabu-sign-up-for-robot-news-tamil-kkfuh8aidcdsi.html | title=Nirav and Sabu sign up for Robot! | publisher=[[Sify]] | date=9 January 2008 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118162759/http://www.sify.com/movies/nirav-and-sabu-sign-up-for-robot-news-tamil-kkfuh8aidcdsi.html | archivedate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the completion of a photoshoot featuring Haasan and Zinta,&lt;ref name="RFR"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/article566585.ece | title=Ready for Robot? | work=The Hindu | date=12 August 2010 | accessdate=18 September 2010 | last=Rangarajan | first=Malathi | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118103719/http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/article566585.ece | archivedate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project was shelved as a result of scheduling conflicts with Haasan.&lt;ref name="Fate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/script-decides-the-fate-of-the-movie/article982047.ece | title=Script decides the fate of the movie | work=The Hindu | date=27 December 2010 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | last=Tankha | first=Madhur | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118101504/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/script-decides-the-fate-of-the-movie/article982047.ece | archivedate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shankar consequently started work on ''[[Boys (2003 film)|Boys]]'' (2003). The film was eventually revived and released in 2010 as ''[[Enthiran]]'' starring [[Rajinikanth]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]].&lt;ref name = "BZ"/&gt;

=== ''Krishna Leela'' ===
In February 2004, Kamal Haasan and [[Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao]] began pre-production works on a project titled ''Krishna Leela''. The film was set to narrate the story of an individual called Krishna Das, played by Kamal Haasan, and the women in his life. The project was described as a comedy entertainer, much like the actor and director's previous collaborations in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://lazygeek.net/2004/02/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gautami]] was reported to feature alongside him in a leading role, in a proposed comeback, while actresses [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] and [[Vinodhini]] were also cast in roles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cooljilax.com/cinenews.html&lt;/ref&gt; Comedians including [[Goundamani]], [[Vadivelu]], [[Senthil (actor)|Senthil]], [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] and [[Chitti Babu (Tamil actor)|Chitti Babu]] were also added to the supporting cast. Seeking to cast two new actresses, Kamal Haasan scouted for talent in [[London]]. The film was later dropped, and Kamal Haasan and Rao considered working together for a different project.&lt;ref&gt;http://tfmpage.com/forum/5623.03.44.05.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== ''Kumar Sambhavam'' ===
In May 2004,  Kamal Haasan and [[Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao]] were keen to make a Hindi and Tamil bilingual film titled ''Kumar Sambhavam'' with [[Madhuri Dixit]] as the lead actress. Kamal Haasan stated he needed a "woman of substance who would look convincing as a wife and mother" and stated there was "no second choice" for the role. Bharat Shah was set to finance the project and negotiated terms with Dixit to work on the project, having earlier worked with her during the making of ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;http://tfmpage.com/forum/19880.05.19.18.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was dropped after Dixit quoted a salary, which was more than the whole cost of the film itself.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiaglitz.com/kamalhassan-madhuri-dixit-film-dropped-tamil-news-10002&lt;/ref&gt; Kamal Haasan later expressed his disappointment at the film not materialising as a result of Dixit's refusal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraphindia.com/1041231/asp/etc/story_4123302.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''KG'' ===
Kamal Haasan, [[Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao]] and [[Ramesh Aravind]] discussed the script of a film titled ''KG'' in early 2004, usually during Kamal Haasan's visits to Bangalore. Described as a "cop thriller" to be shot in Tamil and Kannada around Bangalore, Kamal Haasan revealed that there would be no female lead and that it would be "quite a change" from his other films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/home/madhuri-too-pricey-for-kamal-the-times-of-india_169487.html|title=Madhuri too pricey for Kamal: The Times of India|date=23 July 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tfmpage.com/forum/21712.00.12.57.html&lt;/ref&gt; In a turn of events, Kamal Haasan accepted an offer to star in [[Saran (director)|Saran]]'s ''[[Vasool Raja MBBS]]'' (2004), and put ''KG'' on hold. He later continued to work on ''KG'', which marked Ramesh Aravind's directorial debut, and Mumbai-based financier Bharat Shah agreed to fund the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiaglitz.com/kamals-magic-tamil-news-10633|title=Kamal's magic - Tamil Movie News - IndiaGlitz.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio later decided to indefinitely postpone work on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/tamil/interview.php?id=13606546&amp;cid=2408|title=Welcome to Sify.com|website=www.sify.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/mar/22ramesh.htm|title=Ramesh Arvind likes the director's cap|website=www.rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Marmayogi'' ===
''Marmayogi'' was first pondered by Kamal Haasan after the release of ''[[Aalavandhan]]'' (2001), however nothing proceeded.&lt;ref name="alavandhan"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shah, Kunal|year=2007|title=A New Tam-Table|publisher=[[Mumbai Mirror]]|accessdate=2007-12-18|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/net/mmpaper.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=30&amp;contentid=200712182007121802322346148350ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a four-year sabbatical from directing films since ''[[Virumaandi]]'' (2004), Kamal Haasan announced ''Marmayogi'' as his next project after the completion of ''[[Dasavathaaram]]'' (2008). The film was planned as a bilingual Hindi-Tamil [[Historical period drama|period film]], set in the [[7th century]]. Production house [[Pyramid Saimira]] along with Haasan's company [[Raaj Kamal Films International]] were set to produce the venture, and work began in late 2007.&lt;ref name="production"&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2008|title=PS signs Marmayogi!|publisher=Sify|accessdate=2008-08-19|url=http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14742930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early media reports suggested a box-office battle between ''Marmayogi'' and Shankar's ''[[Enthiran]]'' (2010), which was rebooted from the shelved ''Robot''.

Pre-production on the film continued throughout 2008, with technicians such as [[Rajesh Selva]] and [[Sanu Varghese]] actively involved for close to a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cinematographer-sanu-john-varghese-talks-about-working-in-take-off/article17839705.ece|title=A long visual journey|first=Aswin|last=Vn|date=6 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-39105920090417|title=Just A Minute With: actor Kamal Hassan|first=Shilpa|last=Jamkhandikar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Kamal Haasan grew a long, thick beard for the film. He also cast actors [[Mohanlal]] and [[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]], as well as, actresses including [[Hema Malini]], [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] and [[Shriya Saran]] in pivotal roles. Along with Trisha, Kamal Haasan held a photoshoot at the AVM Studios in August 2008. Following the failure of [[Rajinikanth]]'s ''[[Kuselan]]'' (2008), Pyramid Saimira opted out of the project in November 2008, effectively shelving the film. Kamal Haasan subsequently moved on to begin work on ''[[Unnaipol Oruvan (2009 film)|Unnaipol Oruvan]]'' (2009), and later filed a legal complaint against Pyramid Saimira for loss of earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Marmayogi-on-hold/articleshow/3691213.cms|title=Marmayogi on hold? - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/sep-09-02/kamal-haasan-10-09-09.html|title=Kamal's action against Pyramid Saimira - Kamal Haasan - Raj Kamal International - Unnai Pol Oruvan - Marmayogi - Pyramid Saimira - Behindwoods.com|website=www.behindwoods.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Thalaivan Irukkiraan'' ===
The project was first reported in the media in November 2008 as Kamal Haasan's next project, after his historical drama ''Marmayogi'' was shelved as a result of [[Pyramid Saimira]]'s financial problems. Titled ''Thalaivan Irukkiraan'' and described by the [[Times of India]] as an "action adventure" film, it was said to be directed by Kamal Haasan and co-produced by [[Gemini Film Circuit]] and [[Sun Pictures]], with [[A. R. Rahman]] working as the music composer. Pre-production works continued throughout late 2008, with actors such as [[Rishi Kapoor]], [[Mohanlal]] and [[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]] approached for leading roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Marmayogi-on-hold/articleshow/3691213.cms|title=Marmayogi on hold? - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/kamal-mohanlal-in-thalaivan-irukindran-tamil-news-42953.html|title=Kamal, Mohanlal in 'Thalaivan Irukindran' - Tamil Movie News - IndiaGlitz.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actresses [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] and [[Shriya Saran]], who were originally a part of ''Marmayogi'', were expected to be retained for the film in order to use the dates they had allotted for the shelved film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/nov-08-02/kamal-12-11-08.html|title=Kamal's plans for Thalaivan Irukkiran - Behindwoods.com - Trisha Shriya Marma Yogi Mohanlal Rishi Kapoor Venkatesh A R Rahman Gemini Film Circuit tamil movie news images picture gallery images|website=www.behindwoods.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamal Haasan's [[Raaj Kamal Films International]] registered the film's title but production was postponed after a deal could not be agreed with the proposed co-producers. During the period, Kamal Haasan also pitched the idea of financing the film to [[Udhayanidhi Stalin]] of [[Red Giant Movies]], who did not take up the offer citing that he felt the script was too political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/was-thalaivan-irrukiran-story-first-narrated-to-udhayanidhi-stalin/articleshow/59952204.cms|title=Was Thalaivan Irrukiran story first narrated to Udhayanidhi Stalin? - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later used the dates offered by Mohanlal and Venkatesh for another of his productions, ''[[Unnaipol Oruvan (2009 film)|Unnaipol Oruvan]]'' (2009), which was incorrectly reported in the media as being the same project as ''Thalaivan Irukkiraan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/kamalmohan-lal-team-up-in-unnai-pol-oruvan/484038/|title=Kamal-Mohan Lal team up in 'Unnai Pol Oruvan' - Indian Express|website=archive.indianexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-articles/movies-08/kamal-21-01-09.html|title=Kamal's next: the lull before the storm - Behindwoods.com - Tamil Movie Artical - Kamal Haasan Marmayogi Thalaivan Irukkiran|website=www.behindwoods.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Kamal Haasan revealed that he was busy writing the final draft of the film and would look to start production by March 2011 with American producers. Actress [[Anushka Shetty]] was also reported to have accepted to star in the film during the period, but the film was again stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kollyinsider.com/2010/12/kamal-and-anushka-in-thalaivan-irukiran.html|title=Kamal and Anushka in 'Thalaivan Irukiran' for Hollywood production|website=www.kollyinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the film resurfaced with Kamal Haasan confirming that the film would be simultaneously made in Hindi under the title of ''Amar Hain''. The media reported that the film would be produced by [[Aascar Ravichandran]], with actors Mohanlal, [[Ajith Kumar]], [[Ravi Teja]] and [[Katrina Kaif]] also in the cast, though this later proved to be untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/katrina-kaif-to-romance-kamal-hassan-/906059/|title=Katrina Kaif to romance Kamal Hassan? - Indian Express|website=archive.indianexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kollyinsider.com/2012/01/ajith-and-kamal-to-act-together-in.html|title=Ajith and Kamal to act together in 'Thalaivan Irukiran'|website=www.kollyinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports later in February 2012, suggested that Kamal Haasan had asked [[S.

Associating with Hindi producers Virender K. Arora and Arjun N. Kapoor, Kamal Haasan revealed that the project would be a "contemporary story, touching on politics, finance and the underworld" and "an action film with lots of emotion", while comparing the film to [[Brian De Palma]]'s English film, ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Kamal-Haasan-Even-six-years-ago-I-was-only-thinking-of-Saif/articleshow/47538581.cms|title=Kamal Haasan: Even six years ago, I was only thinking of Saif - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the film would be shot in Mumbai and Delhi in India, with schedules also planned in [[Jordan]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], while also that he would finish scripting the film after he finished work on the production of ''[[Thoongaa Vanam]]'' (2015). Despite the announcements, the producers backed out of the project and the film was again stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/kamal-haasan-to-make-thalaivan-irukiran-in-hindi-news-tamil-pgepGyjcejbjg.html|title=Kamal Haasan to make 'Thalaivan Irukiran' in Hindi?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two more years of inactivity, in July 2017, Kamal Haasan suggested that he would revive the project after the release of his ongoing projects ''[[Vishwaroopam II|Vishwaroopam 2]]'' (2018) and ''[[Sabaash Naidu]]'' (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/kamal-haasan-confirms-reviving-thalaivan-irukiran-news-tamil-rh1je5gfhhahe.html|title=Kamal Haasan confirms reviving 'Thalaivan Irukiran'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/after-sabaash-naidu-and-vishwaroopam-2-it-thalaivan-irukkiran-for-kamal-haasan-4769312/|title=After Sabaash Naidu and Vishwaroopam 2, it’s Thalaivan Irukkiran for Kamal Haasan|date=27 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''19 Steps'' ===
In mid-2008, Kamal Haasan agreed terms to be a part of an Indo-Japanese production titled ''19 Steps'' to be directed by [[Bharat Bala]]. The film was written by Malayalam scriptwriter, [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]] and was set to tell the tale of a Samurai warrior trying to conquer the ancient Indian martial art of [[Kalaripayattu]]. Starring alongside [[Asin]] and [[Tadanobu Asano]], Kamal Haasan was set to play the role of an Indian martial arts guru. The film was being produced by [[Walt Disney]] and pre-production work had begun with large portions set to be shot in Kerala.&lt;ref name="hindustantimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/19-steps-is-my-next-big-film-says-asin/story-kF9Dh0dYyP9UyhqGG17ipK.html|title=19 Steps is my next big film, says Asin|date=9 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty days before the film began shoot, Kamal Haasan dropped out and the film was subsequently reported to be shelved indefinitely.&lt;ref name="hindustantimes.com"/&gt; As recently as 2016, Bharat Bala and producer Phillip Lee have expressed their desire to continue the film with a different cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/revenant-executive-producer-talks-assassins-creed-india-china-film-ties-949914|title='The Revenant' Executive Producer Talks 'Assassin's Creed,' India-China Film Ties|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Tooth of Buddha'' ===
In mid-2009, Kamal Haasan agreed terms to work with [[Mysskin]] on a film about [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Following the cancellation of ''Marmayogi'' and ''19 Steps'', Kamal Haasan was keen to work on a historical film with a similar theme, with the project also referred to in the media as ''500 BC''. He travelled to the [[United States]] to seek out production companies who were willing to fund the film, but no studio eventually agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/others/news-interviews/Kamals-tooth-fairy/articleshow/5163626.cms|title=Kamal's tooth fairy - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mysskin was then forced to drop the project and revealed it took him six months to get over the disappointment of the project's sudden end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/His-own-path/article15699643.ece|title=His own path|first=Subha J.|last=Rao|date=20 November 2010|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010s ==
=== ''Moo'' ===
In late 2012, Hollywood producer [[Barrie M. Osborne|Barrie Osborne]] expressed his interest in making an English film in association with Kamal Haasan, who would direct the project and feature in the lead role. The actor subsequently announced a project titled ''Moo'' in February 2013, which was said to be about three lives. A potential English title of ''Triple Impact'' was speculated, while other sources titled the film as ''Yaavarum Kelir'', with an English title of ''All Are Kin''. The project later failed to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Kamal-Haasans-next-is-titled-Moo/articleshow/18344858.cms|title=Kamal Haasan's next is titled Moo - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kollytalk.com/cinenews/kamal-haasans-hollywood-venture-named-as-all-are-kin-82689.html|title=Kamal Haasan’s Hollywood venture named as All Are Kin - KOLLY TALK|date=14 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, sources suggested that the film was still under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/celebrities/story/kamal-haasan-hollywood-film-barry-osborne-vishwaroopam-2-970026-2017-04-07|title=Kamal Haasan's Hollywood flick with Barry Osborne is very much on the cards|date=7 April 2017|website=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Amma Appa Vilayattu'' ===
In November 2015, Kamal Haasan and [[T. K. Rajeev Kumar]] agreed to collaborate on a project and announced that they were working on a family drama script to be titled ''Amma Appa Vilayattu'' in Tamil and ''Amma Naana Aata'' in Telugu. After initial discussions with [[Sridevi]] failed to materialise, Rajeev Kumar cast [[Amala Akkineni]] and [[Zarina Wahab]] in pivotal roles and announced that the film would be shot entirely across the [[United States]], with schedules in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kamal-and-tk-rajeev-kumar-get-together-after-26-years/article7879692.ece|title=A long wait, but worth it|first=G.|last=Krishnakumar|date=15 November 2015|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Kamal-Haasans-next-titled-Appa-Amma-Vilayattu/articleshow/49893302.cms|title=Kamal Haasan's next titled Appa Amma Vilayattu - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later postponed and by early 2016, Kamal Haasan chose to collaborate with Rajeev Kumar on a different project that he had written himself, ''[[Sabaash Naidu]]'' (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/entertainment/exclusive-kamal-haasan-shruti-to-play-father-daughter-on-screen|title=Exclusive: Kamal Haasan, Shruti to Play Father-Daughter On-screen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Landscape with a Windmill Near a Town Moat''''' (c. 1650s) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in a private collection.

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "174. LANDSCAPE WITH A WIND-MILL. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. 135.]] A town-moat stretches from the distance to the foreground, which it almost fills. In the immediate right foreground is the reedy bank with a wooden bridge. Farther back are brick walls, the remains of a sluice, which are connected by planks. A man with a dog crosses to the left bank which is thickly planted with trees. Near the bank is a boat on the water. In the middle distance is a man in a flat-bottomed boat on the sunlit water. Farther back is a wooden drawbridge over the moat to the town, above whose wall rise house-roofs and a great wooden mill. A fine summer day with clouds in the sky. More or less in the style of Hobbema. The figures are by Ruisdael himself. An attractive picture. Canvas, 25 inches by 30 1/2 inches. Engraved by J. H. Wright in the Stafford Gallery. In the collection of Lord Francis Egerton, London, 1835 (Sm.). In the collection of the Earl of Ellesmere, Bridgewater House, London, 1892 catalogue, No. 197."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/60/mode/1up  Entry 174 for ''''Landscape with a Wind-Mill''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting was documented in earlier estate sale catalogs of Pieter Locquet and [[Jan Gildemeester]] and Hofstede de Groot therefore listed it also as #16, though at the time he didn't know it was the same painting as his #174.

A '''mosaic''' is a piece of [[art]] or image made from the assembling of small pieces of colored [[glass]], stone, or other materials. It is often used in [[Decorative arts|decorative art]] or as [[interior decoration]]. Most mosaics are made of small, flat, roughly [[square]], pieces of stone or glass of different colors, known as ''[[tesserae]]''. Some, especially floor mosaics, are made of small rounded pieces of stone, and called "pebble mosaics".

Mosaics have a long history, starting in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 3rd millennium BC. Pebble mosaics were made in [[Tiryns]] in [[Mycenean civilisation|Mycenean]] Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Early Christian [[basilica]]s from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in the 12th century, by the eastern-influenced [[Republic of Venice]], and among the [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the [[Renaissance]], though artists like [[Raphael]] continued to practise the old technique. Roman and Byzantine influence led Jewish artists to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the [[Middle East]] with floor mosaics.

Mosaic was widely used on religious buildings and palaces in early [[Islamic art]], including Islam's first great religious building, the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], and the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]]. Mosaic went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century.

Modern mosaics are made by professional artists, street artists, and as a popular craft. Many materials other than traditional stone and ceramic tesserae may be employed, including shells, glass and beads.

The earliest known examples of mosaics made of different materials were found at a temple building in Abra, [[Mesopotamia]], and are dated to the second half of 3rd millennium BC. They consist of pieces of colored stones, shells and ivory. Excavations at [[Susa]] and [[Chogha Zanbil]] show evidence of the first glazed tiles, dating from around 1500 BC.&lt;ref name="HistoryOfIranianTile"&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/art/articles/tile_history1.php Iran: Visual Arts: history of Iranian Tile], Iran Chamber Society&lt;/ref&gt; However, mosaic patterns were not used until the times of [[Sassanid Empire]] and Roman influence.

Greek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings, a far more prestigious artform, and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of [[Hellenistic]] [[villa]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] dwellings from Britain to [[Dura-Europos]]. Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek, suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves.  Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across [[North Africa]], in places such as [[Carthage]], and can still be seen in the extensive collection in [[Bardo Museum]] in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]].

There were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic: ''[[opus vermiculatum]]'' used tiny ''[[tesserae]]'', typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less, and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support. The tiny ''tesserae'' allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting.  Often small panels called ''emblemata'' were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work.  The normal technique was ''[[opus tessellatum]]'', using larger tesserae, which was laid on site.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=116–119}}  There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=121–123}}

In Rome, Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', built 64 AD, and wall mosaics are also found at [[Pompeii]] and neighbouring sites.  However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression. The Roman church of [[Santa Costanza]], which served as a [[mausoleum]] for one or more of the Imperial family, has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault, which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration.

The mosaics of the [[Villa Romana del Casale]] near [[Piazza Armerina]] in [[Sicily]] are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics ''in situ'' in the world, and are protected as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The large ''villa rustica'', which was probably owned by Emperor [[Maximian]], was built largely in the early 4th century. The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century. The most important pieces are the ''Circus Scene'', the 64m long ''Great Hunting Scene'', the ''Little Hunt'', the ''Labours of Hercules'' and the famous ''Bikini Girls'', showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century [[bikinis]]. The [[peristyle]], the imperial apartments and the [[thermae]] were also decorated with ornamental and [[mythological]] mosaics.&lt;ref name="UNESCO casale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/832 |title=Villa Romana del Casale |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in [[Palermo]] where two houses were discovered. The most important scenes there depicted are an [[Orpheus mosaic]], ''Alexander the Great's Hunt'' and the ''Four Seasons''.

In 1913 the [[Zliten mosaic]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests, hunting and everyday life, was discovered in the [[Libyan]] town of [[Zliten]].  In 2000 archaeologists working in [[Leptis Magna]], [[Libya]], uncovered a 30&amp;nbsp;ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD. The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue, staring at his slain opponent. The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen — a "masterpiece comparable in quality with the [[Alexander Mosaic]] in [[Pompeii]]."

A specific genre of Roman mosaic was called ''asaroton'' (Greek for "unswept floor"). It depicted in [[trompe l'oeil]] style the feast leftovers on the floors of wealthy houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/pdf/uploads/hesperia/147437.pdf | title=A mosaic floor from a Roman villa at Anaploga | accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian mosaics===

====Early Christian art====
{{Main article|Late Antique and medieval mosaics in Italy}}
[[File:Mosaico di cristo in trono tra gli apostoli e le ss. prudenziana e prassede, 410 dc ca. 06.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Detail of a [[Paleochristian]] mosaic from the basilica of [[Santa Pudenziana]] in Rome, c. 410 AD, depicting Saint [[Pudentiana]]]]
With the building of Christian [[basilica]]s in the late 4th century, wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses. The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived, but the mosaics of [[Santa Constanza]] and [[Santa Pudenziana]], both from the 4th century, still exist. The winemaking putti in the [[ambulatory]] of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of [[Bacchus]], which symbolizes transformation or change, and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum, the original function of this building. In another great Constantinian basilica, the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]] the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved. The so-called [[Tomb of the Julii]], near the crypt beneath [[St Peter's Basilica]], is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations. The [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotunda of Galerius]] in [[Thessaloniki]], converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century, was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics. Only fragments survive of the original decoration, especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.

In the following century [[Ravenna]], the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]], became the center of late Roman mosaic art (see details in Ravenna section). [[Milan]] also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the [[St Aquilinus]] Chapel of the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Milan|Basilica of San Lorenzo]], mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of [[Elijah]]; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]], which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later. The baptistery of the basilica, which was demolished in the 15th century, had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae, large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated. In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro, now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio, every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century. Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome, while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background. The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists.

[[Albenga|Albingaunum]] was the main Roman port of [[Liguria]]. The octagonal baptistery of the town was decorated in the 5th century with high quality blue and white mosaics representing the Apostles. The surviving remains are somewhat fragmented. [[Massilia]] remained a thriving port and a Christian spiritual center in Southern Gaul where favourable societal and economic conditions ensured the survival of mosaic art in the 5th and 6th centuries. The large baptistery, once the grandest building of its kind in Western Europe, had a geometric floor mosaic which is only known from 19th century descriptions. Other parts of the episcopal complex were also decorated with mosaics as new finds, that were unearthed in the 2000s, attest. The funerary [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille|basilica of Saint Victor]], built in a quarry outside the walls, was decorated with mosaics but only a small fragment with blue and green scrolls survived on the intrados of an arch (the basilica was later buried under a medieval abbey).

A mosaic pavement depicting humans, animals and plants from the original 4th-century cathedral of [[Aquileia]] has survived in the later medieval church. This mosaic adopts pagan motifs such as the Nilotic scene, but behind the traditional naturalistic content is Christian symbolism such as the [[ichthys]]. The 6th-century early Christian basilicas of Sant' Eufemia [[:it:Basilica di Sant'Eufemia (Grado)]]  and Santa Maria delle Grazie in [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] also have mosaic floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Efthalia|last=Rentetzi |title=stylistic relationships between the mosaic flooring of s.

====Ravenna====
[[File:"The good Shepherd" mosaic - Mausoleum of Galla Placidia.jpg|thumb|[[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|The Good Shepherd]] mosaic in the [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]], [[Ravenna]]]]
[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|Mosaic of [[Justinianus I]] in [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]]]]
In the 5th-century [[Ravenna]], the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]], became the center of late Roman mosaic art. The [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430. The vaults of the small, cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background. The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky. Another great building established by [[Galla Placidia]] was the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]]. She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna. The mosaics depicted the storm, portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna, [[Peter Chrysologus]]. They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ravenna|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12662b.htm|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ostrogoths]] kept alive the tradition in the 6th century, as the mosaics of the [[Arian Baptistry]], [[Baptistry of Neon]], [[Archbishop's Chapel, Ravenna|Archbishop's Chapel]], and the earlier phase mosaics in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] and [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] testify.

After 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire) and became the seat of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century. Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo. The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint [[Justinian I]] and [[Theodora (6th century)|Empress Theodora]] in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest. The mosaics of the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]] were made around 549. The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of [[San Michele in Affricisco]], executed in 545–547 (largely destroyed; the remains in [[Berlin]]).

The last example of Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna was commissioned by bishop Reparatus between 673–79 in the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe. The mosaic panel in the apse showing the bishop with Emperor [[Constantine IV]] is obviously an imitation of the Justinian panel in San Vitale.

====Butrint====
The mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of [[Butrint]], [[Albania]] appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation, dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century. The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures, birds, terrestrial beasts, fruits, flowers, trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God’s creation. Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets, tabulae ansatae, carrying inscriptions. A variety of fish, a crab, a lobster, shrimps, mushrooms, flowers, a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions, which reads: In fulfilment of the vow (prayer) of those whose names God knows. This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors’ humility and an acknowledgement of God’s omniscience.

The abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God’s creation; some elements also have specific connotations. The [[kantharos]] vase and vine refer to the [[eucharist]], the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation. Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life. Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ: "As a heart desireth the water brook, so my souls longs for thee, O God." Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened.

====Late Antique and Early Medieval Rome====

[[File:RomaSantaMariaMaggioreArcoTrionfaleDxRegistro4.jpg|thumb|5th century mosaic in the triumphal arch of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome]]

Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome, gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period. Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings. In the apse mosaic of [[Sant'Agata dei Goti]] (462–472, destroyed in 1589) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him, six on either side. At [[Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara]] (468–483, destroyed in 1686) Christ appeared in the center, flanked on either side by three Apostles. Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ. The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the [[Santa Sabina]] was replaced by a very similar fresco by [[Taddeo Zuccari]] in 1559. The composition probably remained unchanged: Christ flanked by male and female saints, seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet. All three mosaics had a similar iconography.

6th-century pieces are rare in Rome but the mosaics inside the triumphal arch of the basilica of [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] belong to this era. The ''Chapel of Ss. Primo e Feliciano'' in [[Santo Stefano Rotondo]] has very interesting and rare mosaics from the 7th century. This chapel was built by [[Pope Theodore I]] as a family burial place.

In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art, noticeable on the mosaics of [[Santa Prassede]], [[Santa Maria in Domnica]], [[Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura]], [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], [[Santi Nereo e Achilleo]] and the San Venanzio chapel of [[San Giovanni in Laterano]]. The great dining hall of [[Pope Leo III]] in the [[Lateran Palace]] was also decorated with mosaics. They were all destroyed later except for one example, the so-called [[Triclinio Leoniano]] of which a copy was made in the 18th century. Another great work of Pope Leo, the apse mosaic of [[Santa Susanna]], depicted Christ with the Pope and [[Charlemagne]] on one side, and SS. Susanna and Felicity on the other. It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585. Pope [[Paschal I]] (817–824) embellished the church of [[Santo Stefano del Cacco]] with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church (destroyed in 1607).

The fragment of an 8th-century mosaic, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] is one of the very rare remaining pieces of the medieval decoration of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], demolished in the late 16th century. The precious fragment is kept in the sacristy of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]]. It proves the high artistic quality of the destroyed St. Peter's mosaics.

====Byzantine mosaics====

Mosaics were more central to Byzantine culture than to that of Western Europe. Byzantine church interiors were generally covered with golden mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the 6th to the 15th centuries. The majority of Byzantine mosaics were destroyed without trace during wars and conquests, but the surviving remains still form a fine collection.{{sfn|Lowden|1997|pp=whole book}}

The great buildings of [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] like the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], the [[Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos|Nea Church]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the rebuilt [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]] were certainly embellished with mosaics but none of these survived.

Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] which was commissioned during [[Justinian]]'s reign. The figures, animals, plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background. The portrait of a moustached man, probably a Gothic chieftain, is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age. The so-called ''small sekreton'' of the palace was built during [[Justin II]]'s reign around 565–577. Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room. The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition. There are remains of floral decoration in the [[Church of the Acheiropoietos]] in [[Thessaloniki]] (5th–6th centuries).

[[File:St George as patron of two children. Mosaic, church of St Demetrios in Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A pre-[[Iconoclastic]] depiction of St. Demetrios at the Hagios Demetrios Basilica in Thessaloniki.]]
In the 6th century, [[Ravenna]], the capital of Byzantine Italy, became the center of mosaic making. [[Istria]] also boasts some important examples from this era. The [[Euphrasian Basilica]] in [[Poreč|Parentium]] was built in the middle of the 6th century and decorated with mosaics depicting the [[Theotokos]] flanked by angels and saints.

Fragments remain from the mosaics of the [[Church of Santa Maria Formosa]] in [[Pula|Pola]]. These pieces were made during the 6th century by artists from Constantinople. Their pure Byzantine style is different from the contemporary Ravennate mosaics.

Very few early Byzantine mosaics survived the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic]] destruction of the 8th century. Among the rare examples are the 6th-century ''Christ in majesty'' (or ''Ezekiel's Vision'') mosaic in the apse of the [[Church of Hosios David]] in [[Thessaloniki]] that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times. Nine mosaic panels in the [[Hagios Demetrios|Hagios Demetrios Church]], which were made between 634 and 730, also escaped destruction. Unusually almost all represent [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]], often with suppliants before him.

In the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic era]], figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry. The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the [[Hagia Irene]] in Constantinople (after 740). There were similar crosses in the apses of the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia Church]] in Thessaloniki and in the [[Church of the Dormition, Nicaea|Church of the Dormition]] in [[Iznik|Nicaea]]. The crosses were substituted with the image of the [[Theotokos]] in both churches after the victory of the [[Iconodules]] (787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively,  the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922).

A similar Theotokos image flanked by two archangels were made for the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople in 867. The dedication inscription says: "The images which the impostors had cast down here pious emperors have again set up." In the 870s the so-called ''large sekreton'' of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] was decorated with the images of the four great iconodule patriarchs.

The post-Iconoclastic era was the heyday of Byzantine art with the most beautiful mosaics executed. The mosaics of the [[Macedonian Renaissance]] (867–1056) carefully mingled traditionalism with innovation. Constantinopolitan mosaics of this age followed the decoration scheme first used in Emperor [[Basil I]]'s [[Nea Ekklesia]]. Not only this prototype was later totally destroyed but each surviving composition is battered so it is necessary to move from church to church to reconstruct the system.

An interesting set of Macedonian-era mosaics make up the decoration of the [[Hosios Loukas]] Monastery. In the narthex there is the Crucifixion, the Pantokrator and the Anastasis above the doors, while in the church the Theotokos (apse), Pentecost, scenes from Christ's life and ermit St Loukas (all executed before 1048). The scenes are treated with a minimum of detail and the panels are dominated with the gold setting.
[[File:Meister der Nea-Moni-Kirche in Chios 002.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Detail of mosaic from [[Nea Moni]] Monastery]]
The [[Nea Moni]] Monastery on [[Chios]] was established by [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]] in 1043–1056. The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived (Theotokos with raised hands, four evangelists with seraphim, scenes from Christ's life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos). In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures, detail, landscape and setting.

Another great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] between 1042 and 1048. Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel, who visited Jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description: "Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling, over the tribune. The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ. In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exaltation of Adam. In the apse the Ascension of Christ. The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.com/www1/jhs/TSspdest.html The Holy Sepulchre – The great destruction of 1009&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Daphni Monastery]] houses the best preserved complex of mosaics from the early Comnenan period (ca. 1100) when the austere and hieratic manner typical for the [[Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian epoch]] and represented by the awesome [[Christ Pantocrator]] image inside the dome, was metamorphosing into a more intimate and delicate style, of which ''The Angel before St Joachim'' — with its pastoral backdrop, harmonious gestures and pensive lyricism — is considered a superb example.

The 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks. The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets, saints and patriarchs. Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an ''Emperor kneeling before Christ'' (late 9th or early 10th century). Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the ''Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine''. [[Justinian I]] is offering the model of the church to Mary while [[Constantine I|Constantine]] is holding a model of the city in his hand. Both emperors are beardless – this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded. A mosaic panel on the gallery shows ''Christ with [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]] and [[Zoe (empress)|Empress Zoe]]'' (1042–1055). The emperor gives a bulging [[money sack]] to Christ as a donation for the church.

The dome of the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia Church]] in Thessaloniki is decorated with an ''Ascension'' mosaic (c. 885). The composition resembles the great baptistries in [[Ravenna]], with apostles standing between palms and Christ in the middle. The scheme is somewhat unusual as the standard post-Iconoclastic formula for domes contained only the image of the [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]].

[[File:Santa Sofia - Mosaic de Joan II Comnè i la seva esposa, Irene.JPG|thumb|A mosaic from the [[Hagia Sophia]] of [[Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul), depicting [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Jesus]], flanked by [[John II Komnenos]] (left) and his wife [[Irene of Hungary]] (right), c. 1118 AD]]
There are very few existing mosaics from the [[Komnenos|Komnenian period]] but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression. The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in [[Constantinople]] is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor [[John II Komnenos|John II]] and Empress [[Piroska of Hungary|Eirene]] with the [[Theotokos]] (1122–34). The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing. It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name, ''Piroska'' shows. The adjacent portrait of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] on a pier (from 1122) is similarly personal. The imperial mausoleum of the [[Komnenos]] dynasty, the [[Zeyrek Camii|Pantokrator Monastery]] was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed. The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent. There is only a "Communion of the Apostles" in the apse of the cathedral of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]].

A striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious, miniature mosaic icons. In these icons the small tesserae (with sides of 1&amp;nbsp;mm or less) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel. These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion. The [[Louvre Transfiguration]] is a very fine example from the late 12th century. The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at [[Florence]] illustrates the more gentle, humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century.

The sack of Constantinople in 1204 caused the decline of mosaic art for the next five decades. After the reconquest of the city by [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1261 the Hagia Sophia was restored and a beautiful new ''[[Deesis]]'' was made on the south gallery. This huge mosaic panel with figures two and a half times lifesize is really overwhelming due to its grand scale and superlative craftsmanship. The Hagia Sophia ''Deesis'' is probably the most famous Byzantine mosaic in Constantinople.

The [[Pammakaristos Church|Pammakaristos Monastery]] was restored by [[Michael Doukas Glabas Tarchaneiotes|Michael Glabas]], an imperial official, in the late 13th century. Only the mosaic decoration of the small burial chapel ([[parekklesion]]) of Glabas survived. This domed chapel was built by his widow, Martha around 1304–08. In the miniature dome the traditional Pantokrator can be seen with twelve prophets beneath. Unusually the apse is decorated with a ''[[Deesis]]'', probably due to the funerary function of the chapel.

The [[Church of the Holy Apostles (Thessaloniki)|Church of the Holy Apostles]] in [[Thessaloniki]] was built in 1310–14. Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern. Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings. Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the [[Theotokos Paregoritissa Church]] in [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. The church was established by the Despot of [[Epirus]] in 1294–96. In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator, with prophets and cherubim below.

[[File:Chora Church interior March 2008.JPG|thumb|left|Mosaic of Theodore Metochites offering the Chora Church to Christ]]
The greatest mosaic work of the [[Palaeologan renaissance in art]] is the decoration of the [[Chora Church]] in Constantinople. Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels, the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia. They were executed around 1320 by the command of [[Theodore Metochites]]. The esonarthex has two fluted domes, specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ. The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos. The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge [[turban]], offering the model of the church to Christ. The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ. These panels show the influence of the Italian [[trecento]] on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings, landscapes, figures.

The last Byzantine mosaic work was created for the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople in the middle of the 14th century. The great eastern arch of the cathedral collapsed in 1346, bringing down the third of the main dome. By 1355 not only the big Pantokrator image was restored but new mosaics were set on the eastern arch depicting the Theotokos, the Baptist and Emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] (discovered only in 1989).

In addition to the large-scale monuments several miniature mosaic icons of outstanding quality was produced for the Palaiologos court and nobles. The loveliest examples from the 14th century are ''Annunciation'' in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and a mosaic diptych in the Cathedral Treasury of [[Florence]] representing the ''Twelve Feasts of the Church''.

In the troubled years of the 15th century the fatally weakened empire could not afford luxurious mosaics. Churches were decorated with wall-paintings in this era and after the [[Fall of Constantinople|Turkish conquest]].

====Rome in the High Middle Ages====
[[File:Apse mosaic SM Maggiore.jpg|thumb|Apse mosaic in the [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]]]
The last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when [[Rome]] developed its own distinctive artistic style, free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space. Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], the façade of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and [[San Paolo fuori le Mura]]. The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1140) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne, the first example of this iconographic scheme. A similar mosaic, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], decorates the apse of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. It is a work of [[Jacopo Torriti]] from 1295. The mosaics of Torriti and [[Jacopo da Camerino]] in the apse of [[San Giovanni in Laterano]] from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884. The apse mosaic of [[San Crisogono]] is attributed to [[Pietro Cavallini]], the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century. Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290. These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts at perspective. There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of [[San Tommaso in Formis]] showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave. The church belonged to the Order of the [[Trinitarians]] which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves.

The great [[Navicella (mosaic)|''Navicella'' mosaic]] (1305–1313) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter's is attributed to [[Giotto di Bondone]]. The giant mosaic, commissioned by Cardinal [[Jacopo Stefaneschi]], was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard. It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters. This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter's in the 17th century. Navicella means "little ship" referring to the large boat which dominated the scene, and whose sail, filled by the storm, loomed over the horizon. Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art.

====Sicily====
[[File:Chapelle Palatine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arabic]] arches and Byzantine mosaics in the [[Cappella Palatina]] of [[Roger II of Sicily]]]]

The heyday of mosaic making in [[Sicily]] was the age of the independent [[Normans|Norman]] kingdom in the 12th century. The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule. Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style, that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies. Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the [[Cappella Palatina]] of [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]],&lt;ref&gt;''Some Palatine Aspects of the Cappella Palatina in Palermo'', Slobodan Ćurčić, '''Dumbarton Oaks Papers''', Vol. 41, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Martorana]] church in [[Palermo]] and the cathedrals of [[cathedral of Cefalù|Cefalù]] and [[Monreale]].

The Cappella Palatina clearly shows evidence for blending the eastern and western styles. The dome (1142–42) and the eastern end of the church (1143–1154) were decorated with typical Byzantine mosaics i.e. Pantokrator, angels, scenes from the life of Christ. Even the inscriptions are written in Greek. The narrative scenes of the nave (Old Testament, life of Sts Peter and Paul) are resembling to the mosaics of the Old St. Peter's and St. Paul's Basilica in [[Rome]] (Latin inscriptions, 1154–66).

The Martorana church (decorated around 1143) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished. The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina, with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed, elongated angels. The Greek inscriptions, decorative patterns, and evangelists in the [[squinches]] are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina. The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily, dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ, was originally in the demolished [[narthex]] together with another panel, the [[Theotokos]] with Georgios of Antiochia, the founder of the church.

In [[Cefalù]] (1148) only the high, French Gothic presbytery was covered with mosaics: the [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]] on the semidome of the apse and [[cherubim]] on the vault. On the walls are Latin and Greek saints, with Greek inscriptions.

[[File:Dedication mosaic - Cathedral of Monreale - Italy 2015 (crop).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Monreale]] mosaics: William II offering the [[Monreale Cathedral]] to the [[Virgin Mary]]]]
The [[Monreale]] mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy, covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae. This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King [[William II of Sicily]]. The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina. The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor. Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos.

The [[Cathedral of Palermo]], rebuilt by Archbishop Walter in the same time (1172–85), was also decorated with mosaics but none of these survived except the 12th-century image of ''Madonna del Tocco'' above the western portal.

The cathedral of [[Messina]], consecrated in 1197, was also decorated with a great mosaic cycle, originally on par with Cefalù and Monreale, but heavily damaged and restored many times later. In the left apse of the same cathedral 14th-century mosaics survived, representing the Madonna and Child between Saints Agata and Lucy, the Archangels Gabriel and Michael and Queens Eleonora and Elisabetta.

Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the [[Otranto Cathedral]] from 1166, with mosaics tied into a tree of life, mostly still preserved. The scenes depict biblical characters, warrior kings, medieval beasts, allegories of the months and working activity. Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of [[Amalfi]]'s Norman Cathedral. The mosaic ambos in the churches of [[Ravello]] prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries.

The palaces of the Norman kings were decorated with mosaics depicting animals and landscapes. The secular mosaics are seemingly more Eastern in character than the great religious cycles and show a strong Persian influence. The most notable examples are the ''Sala di Ruggero'' in the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]], [[Palermo]] and the ''Sala della Fontana'' in the [[Zisa, Palermo|Zisa]] summer palace, both from the 12th century.

====Venice====

In parts of [[Italy]], which were under eastern artistic influences, like [[Sicily]] and [[Venice]], mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages. The whole interior of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice is clad with elaborate, golden mosaics. The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th–13th centuries. The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century. One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark's were based directly on the miniatures of the [[Cotton Genesis]], a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople (1204). The mosaics were executed in the 1220s.

Other important Venetian mosaics can be found in the [[Torcello Cathedral|Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta]] in [[Torcello]] from the 12th century, and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in [[Murano]] with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement (1140). The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary, St John and the two patron saints, Cipriano and Cipriana. When the church was demolished in the 19th century, the mosaic was bought by [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]]. It was reassembled in the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Friedenskirche]] of [[Potsdam]] in the 1840s.

[[Trieste]] was also an important center of mosaic art. The mosaics in the apse of the [[Cathedral of San Giusto, Trieste|Cathedral of San Giusto]] were laid by master craftsmen from [[Veneto]] in the 12th–13th centuries.

====Medieval Italy====
The monastery of [[Grottaferrata]] founded by Greek [[Basilian monks]] and consecrated by the Pope in 1024 was decorated with Italo-Byzantine mosaics, some of which survived in the narthex and the interior. The mosaics on the triumphal arch portray the Twelve Apostles sitting beside an empty throne, evoking Christ's ascent to Heaven. It is a Byzantine work of the 12th century. There is a beautiful 11th-century Deesis above the main portal.

The Abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], [[Pope Victor III|Desiderius]] sent envoys to [[Constantinople]] some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church. According to chronicler [[Leo of Ostia]] the Greek artists decorated the apse, the arch and the vestibule of the basilica. Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds (now in the Monte Cassino Museum). "The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts" – says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy.

[[File:Florenca133b.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Baptistry]]]]
In [[Florence]] a magnificiant mosaic of the [[Last Judgement]] decorates the dome of the [[Florence Baptistery|Baptistery]]. The earliest mosaics, works of art of many unknown Venetian craftsmen (including probably [[Cimabue]]), date from 1225. The covering of the ceiling was probably not completed until the 14th century.

The impressive mosaic of Christ in Majesty, flanked by the Blessed Virgin and St. John the Evangelist in the apse of the [[Piazza dei Miracoli|cathedral of Pisa]] was designed by [[Cimabue]] in 1302. It evokes the Monreale mosaics in style. It survived the great fire of 1595 which destroyed most of the mediveval interior decoration.

Sometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice (mainly from the 17th–19th centuries, but the oldest one from 1270–75, "The burial of St Mark in the first basilica"), the [[Duomo di Orvieto|Cathedral of Orvieto]] (golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century, many times redone) and the [[Basilica di San Frediano]] in [[Lucca]] (huge, striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below, designed by [[Berlinghiero Berlinghieri]] in the 13th century). The [[Cathedral of Spoleto]] is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the ''Blessing Christ'' (signed by one Solsternus from 1207).

====Western and Central Europe====
[[File:st.peters.basilica.tesserae.arp.jpg|thumb|left|A “painting” made from tesserae in [[St Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican State]], Italy]]

Beyond the [[Alps]] the first important example of mosaic art was the decoration of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]], commissioned by [[Charlemagne]]. It was completely destroyed in a fire in 1650. A rare example of surviving Carolingian mosaics is the [[apse]] [[semi-dome]] decoration of the oratory of [[Germigny-des-Prés]] built in 805–806 by [[Theodulf]], [[bishop of Orléans]], a leading figure of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This unique work of art, rediscovered only in the 19th century, had no followers.

Only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages. The Abbey of Saint-Martial in [[Limoges]], originally an important place of pilgrimage, was totally demolished during the [[French Revolution]] except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s. A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century. It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble, probably taken from antique pavements. This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the [[Basilica of Saint-Quentin]] in [[Picardy]], where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors. The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at [[Lyon]] have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors. More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at [[Poitiers]] which might be from the 6th or 9th century.

[[File:st.peters.basilica.tesserae.closeup.arp.jpg|thumb|left|Close up of the bottom left corner of the picture above. Click the picture to see the individual [[tessera]]e]]

Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe, although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals. The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in [[Székesfehérvár]] (Alba Regia) had a mosaic decoration in the apse. It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen, executed in the first decades of the 11th century. The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century. The Golden Gate of the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in [[Prague]] got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the [[Last Judgement]] above the portal. It was executed by Venetian craftsmen.

[[File:Germigny Jplm.jpg|thumb|right|Carolingian mosaic in [[Germigny-des-Prés]]]]
The [[Crusaders]] in the [[Holy Land]] also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence. During their 12th-century reconstruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones. Almost nothing of them survived except the "Ascension of Christ" in the Latin Chapel (now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics). More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]]. The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ, Councils of the Church and angels. In the apses the Annunciation, the Nativity, Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen. The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor, the [[king of Jerusalem]] and the Latin Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Art and Colonialism: The mosaics of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (1169) and the problem of the ''crusader'' art |author=Lucy-Anne Hunt |date= |work= |publisher=  |jstor=1291693 |pages=69–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the [[Frumuşeni Mosaics|Bizere Monastery]] near the River [[Mureș River|Mureş]] in present-day [[Romania]]. The panels depict real or fantastic animal, floral, solar and geometric representations. Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church, built some time between the 10th and 11th century. Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence. The monastery was situated that time in the territory of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

====Renaissance and Baroque====
Although mosaics went out of fashion and were substituted by frescoes, some of the great Renaissance artists also worked with the old technique. [[Raphael]]'s [[Creation of the World (Raphael)|Creation of the World]] in the dome of the [[Chigi Chapel]] in [[Santa Maria del Popolo]] is a notable example that was executed by a Venetian craftsman, Luigi di Pace.

During the papacy of [[Clement VIII]] (1592–1605), the “Congregazione della Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro" was established, providing an independent organisation charged with completing the decorations in the newly built [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Instead of frescoes the cavernous Basilica was mainly decorated with mosaics. Among the explanations are:
# The old St. Peter's Basilica had been decorated with mosaic, as was common in churches built during the early Christian era; the 17th century followed the tradition to enhance continuity.
# In a church like this with high walls and few windows, mosaics were brighter and reflected more light.
# Mosaics had greater intrinsic longevity than either frescoes or canvases.
# Mosaics had an association with bejeweled decoration, flaunting richness.

The mosaics of St. Peter's often show lively [[Baroque]] compositions based on designs or canvases from like [[Ciro Ferri]], [[Guido Reni]], [[Domenichino]], [[Carlo Maratta]], and many others. [[Raphael]] is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting, the [[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]. Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter's, including [[Giovanni Battista Calandra]], [[Fabio Cristofari]] (died 1689), and [[Pietro Paolo Cristofari]] (died 1743).&lt;ref&gt;DiFederico, F. R. (1983), ''The mosaics of Saint Peter's Decorating the New Basilica'', University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, pp. 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts.

====The Christian East====
{{Main article|Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East}}

[[File:Madaba map.jpg|thumb|[[Jerusalem]] on the [[Madaba Map]]]]
The eastern provinces of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] and later the [[Byzantine Empire]]s inherited a strong artistic tradition from the [[Late Antiquity]]. Similarly to [[Italy]] and [[Constantinople]] churches and important secular buildings in the [[region of Syria]] and [[Egypt]] were decorated with elaborate mosaic panels between the 5th and 8th centuries. The great majority of these works of art were later destroyed but archeological excavations unearthed many surviving examples.

The single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the [[Madaba Map]], made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at [[Madaba]], [[Jordan]]. It was rediscovered in 1894. The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the [[Holy Land]]. It depicts an area from [[Lebanon]] in the north to the [[Nile Delta]] in the south, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west to the [[Arabian Desert|Eastern Desert]]. The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is [[Jerusalem]], at the center of the map. The map is enriched with many naturalistic features, like animals, fishing boats, bridges and palm trees

One of the earliest examples of [[Dionysus mosaic, Samatya|Byzantine mosaic art]] in the region can be found on [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]], an important place of pilgrimage in the Byzantine era where [[Moses]] died. Among the many 6th-century mosaics in the church complex (discovered after 1933) the most interesting one is located in the baptistery. The intact floor mosaic covers an area of 9 x 3 m and was laid down in 530. It depicts hunting and pastoral scenes with rich Middle Eastern flora and fauna.
[[File:Nebo05(js).jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic floor from the church on [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]] (baptistery, 530)]]
The Church of Sts. Lot and Procopius was founded in 567 in Nebo village under Mount Nebo (now [[Khirbet Mukhayyat]]). Its floor mosaic depicts everyday activities like grape harvest. Another two spectacular mosaics were discovered in the ruined Church of Preacher John nearby. One of the mosaics was placed above the other one which was completely covered and unknown until the modern restoration. The figures on the older mosaic have thus escaped the iconoclasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanjubilee.com/visitjor/sites2.htm|title=Khirbet al Mukhayat|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512160152/http://www.jordanjubilee.com/visitjor/sites2.htm|archivedate=12 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Madaba]] remained an important center of mosaic making during the 5th–8th centuries. In the Church of the Apostles the middle of the main panel Thalassa, goddess of the sea, can be seen surrounded by fishes and other sea creatures. Native Middle Eastern birds, mammals, plants and fruits were also added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordanjubilee.com/history/mosaics.htm The mosaics of Jordan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103213852/http://www.jordanjubilee.com/history/mosaics.htm |date=3 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Catherine's Transfiguration.jpg|thumb|The Transfiguration of Jesus in the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]]]
Important Justinian era mosaics decorated the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]]. Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine's Monastery is exceptional. On the upper wall [[Moses]] is shown in two panels on a landscape background. In the apse we can see the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] on a golden background. The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets, and two contemporary figure, "Abbot Longinos" and "John the Deacon". The mosaic was probably created in 565/6.

[[Jerusalem]] with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions. The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city. The most important is the so-called "Armenian Mosaic" which was discovered in 1894 on the [[Street of the Prophets]] near [[Damascus Gate]]. It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters, which springs from a vase. Populating the vine's branches are peacocks, ducks, storks, pigeons, an eagle, a partridge, and a parrot in a cage. The inscription reads: "For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows." Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small, natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries. The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a [[mortuary]] chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-armenian-mosaic.htm |title=Armenian Mosaic, Jerusalem |year=2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exceptionally well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in [[al-Eizariya|Bethany]], the early Byzantine church of the [[Tomb of Lazarus (al-Eizariya)|Lazarium]] which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/san/BET04byz.html Bethany in Byzantine times I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor.

[[File:Masada Byzantine Church floor mosaic by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from the mosaic floor of the Byzantine church of in [[Masada]]. The monastic community lived here in the 5th–7th centuries.]]
The [[monastic]] communities of the [[Judean Desert]] also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors. The [[Monastery of Martyrius]] was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85. The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/The%20Monastery%20of%20Martyrius The Monastery of Martyrius&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaics in the church of the nearby [[Monastery of Euthymius]] are of later date (discovered in 1930). They were laid down in the Umayyad era, after a devastating earthquake in 659. Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features.

[[File:Petra-Mosaic-2-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail from the mosaic floor of the [[Petra|Petra Church]]]]
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian [[Petra]] where three Byzantine churches were discovered. The most important one was uncovered in 1990. It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual. The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century. In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed. They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals, and personifications of the Seasons, Ocean, Earth and Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mosaicartsource.wordpress.com/2007/01/21/petra-church-mosaic-floors-petra-jordan/ Petra Church – Mosaic Floors – Petra, Jordan « Mosaic Art Source&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab conquest of the [[Middle East]] in the 7th century did not break off the art of mosaic making. Arabs learned and accepted the craft as their own and carried on the classical tradition. During the Umayyad era Christianity retained its importance, churches were built and repaired and some of the most important mosaics of the Christian East were made during the 8th century when the region was under Islamic rule.

The mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now [[Umm ar-Rasas]]) were made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region. The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus and Abdela. It overlays another, damaged, mosaic floor of the earlier (587) "Church of Bishop Sergius." Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration.

The last great mosaics in Madaba were made in 767 in the Church of the Virgin Mary (discovered in 1887). It is a masterpiece of the geometric style with a Greek inscription in the central medallion.

With the fall of the [[Umayyad dynasty]] in 750 the Middle East went through deep cultural changes. No great mosaics were made after the end of the 8th century and the majority of churches gradually fell into disrepair and were eventually destroyed. The tradition of mosaic making died out among the Christians and also in the Islamic community.

====Orthodox countries====

The craft has also been popular in early medieval [[Rus' (people)|Rus]], inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition. [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav]], the Grand Prince of the [[Kievan Rus']] built a large cathedral in his capital, [[Kiev]]. The model of the church was the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], and it was also called [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]]. It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen, sent by [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]], between 1037 and 1046. Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics. In the dome we can see the traditional stern [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]] supported by angels. Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives. The apse is dominated by an orant [[Theotokos]] with a [[Deesis]] in three medallions above. Below is a Communion of the Apostles.
[[File:Gelati conch mosaic.JPG|thumb|left|Apse mosaic "Glory of the Theotokos" in [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. c. 1125–1130.]]
Prince [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II]] built [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] in [[Kiev]] in 1108. The mosaics of the church are undoubtedly works of Byzantine artists. Although the church was destroyed by Soviet authorities, majority of the panels were preserved. Small parts of ornamental mosaic decoration from the 12th century survived in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] in [[Novgorod]] but this church was largely decorated with frescoes.

Using mosaics and frescoes in the same building was a unique practice in Ukraine. Harmony was achieved by using the same dominant colors in mosaic and fresco. Both Saint Sophia Cathedral and Saint Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kiev use this technique.&lt;ref name="Internet encyclopedia of Ukraine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/Art.asp|title=The art of fresco painting in Ukraine|work=Internet encyclopedia of Ukraine|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosaics stopped being used for church decoration as early as the 12th century in the eastern Slavic countries. Later Russian churches were decorated with frescoes, similarly then orthodox churches in the Balkan.

The apse mosaic of the [[Gelati Monastery]] is a rare example of mosaic use in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Began by king [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] and completed by his son [[Demetrius I of Georgia]], the fragmentary panel depicts Theotokos flanked by two archangels. The use of mosaic in Gelati attests to some Byzantine influence in the country and was a demonstration of the imperial ambition of the Bagrationids. The mosaic covered church could compete in magnificence with the churches of Constantinople. Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other, lesser known sites. The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the [[Pitsunda Cathedral]] have been inspired by Roman prototypes. In [[Tsromi]] the tesserae are still visible on the walls of the 7th-century church but only faint lines hint at the original scheme. Its central figure was Christ standing and displaying a scroll with Georgian text.

===Jewish mosaics===
[[File:ZodiacMosaicTzippori.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zodiac]] wheel on the floor of the [[synagogue]] in [[Sepphoris]]]]
Under Roman and Byzantine influence the Jews also decorated their [[synagogue]]s with classical floor mosaics. Many interesting examples were discovered in [[Galilee]] and the [[Judean Desert]].

The remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in [[Sepphoris]], which was an important centre of Jewish culture between the 3rd–7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by Jews, Christians and pagans. The mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs. In the center of the floor the [[zodiac]] wheel was depicted. [[Helios]] sits in the middle, in his sun chariot, and each [[zodiac]] is matched with a [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish month]]. Along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting Biblical scenes, such as the binding of [[Isaac]], as well as traditional rituals, including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains.

Another zodiac mosaic decorated the floor of the [[Beit Alfa]] synagogue which was built during the reign of [[Justin I]] (518–27). It is regarded one of the most important mosaics discovered in Israel. Each of its three panels depicts a scene – the Holy Ark, the zodiac, and the story of the sacrifice of Isaac. In the center of the zodiac is [[Helios]], the sun god, in his chariot. The four women in the corners of the mosaic represent the four seasons.

A third superbly preserved zodiac mosaic was discovered in the [[Severus synagogue]] in the ancient resort town of [[Tiberias|Hammat Tiberias]]. In the center of the 4th-century mosaic the Sun god, Helios sits in his chariot holding the celestial sphere and a whip. Nine of the 12 signs of the zodiac survived intact. Another panel shows the Ark of Covenant and Jewish cultic objects used in the Temple at Jerusalem.

In 1936, a synagogue was excavated in [[Jericho]] which was named [[Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue]] after an inscription on its mosaic floor ("Peace on Israel"). It appears to have been in use from the 5th to 8th centuries and contained a big mosaic on the floor with drawings of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], a [[Shofar]] and a [[Lulav]]. Nearby in [[Naaran]], there is another synagogue (discovered in 1918) from the 6th century that also has a mosaic floor.

The synagogue in [[Eshtemoa synagogue|Eshtemoa]] ([[As-Samu]]) was built around the 4th century. The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns. The synagogue in [[Khirbet Susiya]] (excavated in 1971–72, founded in the end of the 4th century) has three mosaic panels, the eastern one depicting a [[Torah]] shrine, two [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]s, a [[lulav]] and an [[Etrog (ritual)|etrog]] with columns, deer and rams. The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lion’s den. The Roman synagogue in [[Ein Gedi]] was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels. The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center. It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community.

The ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area. Its mosaic floor depicts [[King David]] as [[Orpheus]], identified by his name in Hebrew letters. Near him were lion cubs, a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre. A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves, each of which contains an animal: a lioness suckling her cub, a giraffe, peacocks, panthers, bears, a zebra and so on. The floor was paved in 508/509. It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon (Menois) and the Christian church at [[Shellal (Palestine)|Shellal]], suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places.

The House of Leontius in [[Bet She'an]] (excavated in 1964–72) is a rare example of a synagogue which was part of an inn. It was built in the Byzantine period. The colorful mosaic floor of the synagogue room had an outer stripe decorated with flowers and birds, around medallions with animals, created by [[vine trellises]] emerging from an amphora. The central medallion enclosed a menorah (candelabrum) beneath the word shalom (peace).
[[File:Mosaic of Menorah.05.27.jpg|thumb|right|Mosaic of Menorah from Hammam Lif synagogue, Tunisia, 6th c. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
A 5th-century building in [[Huldah]] may be a [[Samaritan]] synagogue. Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols (menorah, lulav, etrog) but the inscriptions are Greek. Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an (excavated in 1960). The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule (shrine) with cultic symbols. The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town (see above). The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue. One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script.

In 2003, a synagogue of the 5th or 6th century was uncovered in the coastal Ionian town of [[Saranda]], [[Albania]]. It had exceptional mosaics depicting items associated with Jewish holidays, including a menorah, ram's horn, and lemon tree. Mosaics in the basilica of the synagogue show the facade of what resembles a [[Torah]], animals, trees, and other biblical symbols. The structure measures 20 by 24 m. and was probably last used in the 6th century as a church.

=== Middle Eastern and Western Asian art ===

====Pre-Islamic Arabia====
In South Arabia two mosaic works were excavated in a Qatabanian from the late 3rd century, those two plates formed geometric and grapevines formation reflecting the traditions of that culture. In the [[Ghassanid]] era religious mosaic art flourished in their territory, so far five churches with mosaic were recorded from that era, two built by Ghassanid rulers and the other three by the Christian Arab community who wrote their names and dedications.

[[File:Bishapur zan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor pavement representing female dancers, Shapur palace, [[Bishapur]]]]

====Pre-Islamic Persia====
Tilework had been known there for about two thousand years when cultural exchange between [[Sassanid Empire]] and Romans influenced [[Persian people|Persian]] artists to create mosaic patterns. [[Shapur I]] decorated his palace with tile compositions depicting dancers, musicians, courtesans, etc. This was the only significant example of [[figurative art|figurative]] Persian mosaic, which became prohibited after [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab conquest]] and arrival of [[Islam]].

====Islamic art====

=====Arab=====
[[File:Arabischer Maler um 690 002.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Islamic mosaics inside the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (c. 690)]]

[[Islamic architecture]] used mosaic technique to decorate religious buildings and palaces after the [[Muslim conquests]] of the eastern provinces of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art. During the [[Umayyad Dynasty]] mosaic making remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the art of [[zellige]] and [[azulejo]] in various parts of the Arab world, although [[tile]] was to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration.

The first great religious building of [[Islam]], the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], which was built between 688–692, was decorated with glass mosaics both inside and outside, by craftsmen of the Byzantine tradition. Only parts of the original interior decoration survive. The rich floral motifs follow Byzantine traditions, and are "Islamic only in the sense that the vocabulary is syncretic and does not include representation of men or animals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacredsites.com/middle_east/israel/jerusalem.html Jerusalem, Israel]. sacredsites.com. Retrieved on 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arabischer Mosaizist um 735 001.jpg|thumb|The Umayyad mosaics of [[Hisham's Palace]] closely followed classical traditions]]
The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], then capital of the [[Arab Caliphate]]. The mosque was built between 706 and 715. The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building. This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration. The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees, flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background. The mosaics include no human figures, which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works. The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard, called the "Barada Panel" after the river [[Barada]]. It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world, at over 4 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively, and many mosaics were lost, although some have been restored since.

The mosaics of the Umayyad Mosque gave inspiration to later Damascene mosaic works. The Dome of the Treasury, which stands in the mosque courtyard, is covered with fine mosaics, probably dating from 13th- or 14th-century restoration work. The style of them are strikingly similar to the Barada Panel. The mausoleum of Sultan [[Baibars]], [[Az-Zahiriyah library|Madrassa Zahiriyah]], which was built after 1277, is also decorated with a band of golden floral and architectural mosaics, running around inside the main prayer hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 Zahiriyya Madrasa and Mausoleum of Sultan al-Zahir Baybars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108224216/http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 |date=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials. They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas, once common in the Eastern Mediterranean. The most superb example can be found in the bath house of [[Hisham's Palace]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] which was made around 744. The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer (right side) and two deers peacefully grazing (left side). The panel probably represents good and bad governance. Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]], [[Lebanon]]. The luxurious desert residence of [[Al-Walid II]] in [[Qasr al-Hallabat]] (in present-day [[Jordan]]) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill. The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by "good" animals on one side and "bad" animals on the other. Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls, grapes, pomegranates, oryx, wolves, hares, a leopard, pairs of partridges, fish, bulls, ostriches, rabbits, rams, goats, lions and a snake. At [[Qastal, Jordan|Qastal]], near [[Amman]], excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day [[Jordan]], dating probably from the caliphate of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (685–705). They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor. The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns, trees, animals, fruits and rosettes. Except for the open courtyard, entrance and staircases, the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198701/mosaic.country.htm Saudi Aramco World : Mosaic Country]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cordoba moschee innen5 dome.jpg|thumb|right|Golden mosaics in the dome of the [[Mezquita de Córdoba|Great Mosque]] in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Corduba]], Moorish Spain (965–970)]]

Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in [[Moorish]] [[Spain]]. The golden mosaics in the [[mihrab]] and the central dome of the [[Mezquita de Córdoba|Great Mosque]] in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Corduba]] have a decidedly Byzantine character. They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen, supervised by a master mosaicist from [[Constantinople]], who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain. The decoration is composed of colorful floral [[arabesques]] and wide bands of Arab [[calligraphy]]. The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus, which was lost for the Umayyad family.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Barrucand – Achim Bednorz: Moorish Architecture in Andalusia, Taschen, 2002, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosaics generally went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century. Similar effects were achieved by the use of painted tilework, either geometric with small tiles, sometimes called mosaic, like the [[zillij]] of [[North Africa]], or larger tiles painted with parts of a large decorative scheme ([[Qashani]]) in Persia, Turkey and further east.

==Modern mosaics==

Another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the [[rest area]]s along some Texas interstate highways.

Some modern mosaics are the work of ''[[modernisme]]'' style architects [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Josep Maria Jujol]], for example the mosaics in the [[Park Güell]] in [[Barcelona]]. Today, among the leading figures of the mosaic world are [[Emma Biggs]] (UK), [[Marcelo de Melo]] (Brazil), [[Sonia King]] (USA) and [[Saimir Strati]] (Albania).

===Mosaics as a popular craft===
[[File:Bottlecap mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright|A detail of mosaic mural made of modern bottle screw tops. A high school in Jerusalem, Israel]]
Mosaics have developed into a popular craft and art, and are not limited to professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to... Mosaic |url=http://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/supplyimages/wf1002/how-to-mosaic-tiles.pdf |publisher=Hobbycraft |accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's artisans and crafters work with stone, ceramics, shells, art glass, mirror, beads, and even odd items like doll parts, pearls, or photographs. While ancient mosaics tended to be architectural, modern mosaics are found covering everything from park benches and flowerpots to guitars and bicycles. Items can be as small as an earring or as large as a house.

===Mosaics in street art===
[[File:Space Invader - 2007 - Shoreditch - 1.jpg|thumb|left|A work by [[Invader (artist)|Invader]] in [[Emaux de Briare]].]]
In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic, street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork. The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French [[Invader (artist)|Invader]]. He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles, the first of which are small "traditional" tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character, installed in cities across the globe, and the second of which are a style he refers to as "Rubikcubism", which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik's Cubes. Although he is the most prominent, other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well.

===Calçada Portuguesa===
{{Main article|Portuguese pavement}}
[[File:CopacabanaPavement.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)]]]]
Portuguese pavement (in [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]], ''Calçada Portuguesa'') is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal, and common throughout the [[Lusosphere]]. Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex, it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design. In Portuguese-speaking countries, many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even, though far more occasionally, streets done in this mosaic form. [[Lisbon]] in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Portuguese Pavements A Calçada Portuguesa |url=http://www.lisbonlux.com/culture/calcada-portuguesa.html |publisher=Lisbon Lux |accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosaic art at Bonifacio High Street.jpg|thumb|Mosaic art at [[Bonifacio High Street]] in [[Bonifacio Global City]], [[Philippines]]]]
Despite its prevalence and popularity throughout Portugal and its former colonies, and its relation to older art and architectural styles like [[Azulejo]], Portuguese and Spanish painted tilework, it is a relatively young mosaic artform, its first definitive appearance in a modernly recognizable form being in the mid-1800s. Among the most commonly used stones in this style are [[basalt]] and [[limestone]].

==Terminology==
[[File:Fernand Léger - Grand parade with red background (mosaic) 1958 made.jpg|thumb|[[:en:Fernand Léger|Fernand Léger]] – Grand parade with red background, mosaic 1958 (designed 1953). [[:en:National Gallery of Victoria|National Gallery of Victoria]] (NGV), [[:en:Australia|Australia]]]]
Mosaic is an art form which uses small pieces of materials placed together to create a unified whole. The materials commonly used are marble or other stone, glass, [[pottery]], mirror or foil-backed glass, or shells.

The word ''mosaic'' is from the Italian ''mosaico'' deriving from the Latin ''mosaicus'' and ultimately from the Greek ''mouseios'' meaning ''belonging to the [[Muses]]'', hence artistic. Each piece of material is a [[Tessera]] (plural: ''tesserae''). The space in between where the grout goes is an interstice. [[Andamento]] is the word used to describe the movement and flow of [[Tesserae]]. The 'opus', the Latin for ‘work’, is the way in which the pieces are cut and placed.

Common techniques include:
* [[Opus regulatum]]: A grid; all tesserae align both vertically and horizontally.
* [[Opus tessellatum]]: Tesserae form vertical or horizontal rows, but not both.
* [[Opus vermiculatum]]: One or more lines of tesserae follow the edge of a special shape (letters or a major central graphic).
* [[Opus musivum]]: Vermiculatum extends throughout the entire background.
* [[Opus palladianum]]: Instead of forming rows, tesserae are irregularly shaped.  Also known as "crazy paving".
* [[Opus sectile]]: A major shape (e.g. heart, letter, cat) is formed by a single tessera, as later in [[pietra dura]].
* [[Opus classicum]]: When vermiculatum is combined with tessellatum or regulatum.
* [[Opus circumactum]]: Tesserae are laid in overlapping semicircles or fan shapes.
* [[Micromosaic]]: using very small tesserae, in [[Byzantine]] [[icon]]s and Italian panels for jewellery from the Renaissance on.

==Three techniques==
[[File:Ancient Roman Mosaics Villa Romana La Olmeda 021 Pedrosa De La Vega - Saldaña (Palencia).JPG|thumb|upright|Tool table for ancient Roman mosaics at Roman villa of [[La Olmeda]] in [[Pedrosa de la Vega]], [[Province of Palencia]] ([[Castile and León]], [[Spain]]).]][[File:Hammer and hardie.jpg|thumb|These are the hammer and hardie, mosaic tools used for cutting stone by Italian mosaic artists]]
There are three main methods: the direct method, the indirect method and the double indirect method.

===Direct method===
[[File:Li Jiang Guesthouse.jpg|right|thumb|A 'Direct Method' mosaic courtyard made from irregular pebbles and stone strips, [[Lijiang City|Li Jiang]], [[Yunnan]], [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] (China)]]

The direct method of mosaic construction involves directly placing (gluing) the individual [[tessera]]e onto the supporting surface. This method is well suited to surfaces that have a three-dimensional quality, such as vases.  This was used for the historic European wall and ceiling mosaics, following [[underdrawing]]s of the main outlines on the wall below, which are often revealed again when the mosaic falls away.

The direct method suits small projects that are transportable. Another advantage of the direct method is that the resulting mosaic is progressively visible, allowing for any adjustments to tile color or placement.

The disadvantage of the direct method is that the artist must work directly at the chosen surface, which is often not practical for long periods of time, especially for large-scale projects. Also, it is difficult to control the evenness of the finished surface. This is of particular importance when creating a functional surface such as a floor or a table top.

A modern version of the direct method, sometimes called "double direct," is to work directly onto fiberglass mesh. The mosaic can then be constructed with the design visible on the surface and transported to its final location. Large work can be done in this way, with the mosaic being cut up for shipping and then reassembled for installation. It enables the artist to work in comfort in a studio rather than at the site of installation.

===Indirect method===
The indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects, projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes. Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive, and later transferred onto walls, floors or craft projects. This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas, allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front, even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses. Mosaic murals, benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method, as it results in a smoother and more even surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mosaiclegs.com/ |title=Indirect Method Mosaic studio |year=1999 |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double indirect method===
{{Disputed section|date=October 2017}}
The double indirect method can be used when it is important to see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed. The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium (often adhesive-backed paper, sticky plastic or soft lime or putty) as it will appear when installed. When the mosaic is complete, a similar medium is placed atop it. The piece is then turned over, the original underlying material is carefully removed, and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above. In comparison to the indirect method, this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator, to avoid damaging the work. Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work, which is important e.g. when the human figure is involved.
This method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use (patent n. [http://www.uibm.gov.it/uibm/dati/Codice.aspx?load=info_list_uno&amp;id=127474&amp;table=UtilityModel 0000222556]) under the name of his company, Sicis International Srl, now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl.

==Mathematics==
{{further information|tessellation|mathematics and art}}

The best way to arrange variously shaped tiles on a surface leads to the mathematical field of [[tessellation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | ref=harv | authorlink=H.S.M.

The artist [[M. C. Escher]] was influenced by Moorish mosaics to begin his investigations into tessellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roza |first=Greg |title=An Optical Artist: Exploring Patterns and Symmetry |year=2005 |publisher=Rosen Classroom |isbn=978-1-4042-5117-5 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--should also discuss [[Girih tiles]] here--&gt;

==Digital imaging==
A mosaic in [[digital imaging]] is a plurality of non-overlapping images, arranged in some [[tessellation]]. A [[photomosaic]] is a picture made up of various other pictures (pioneered by Joseph Francis), in which each "[[pixel]]" is another picture, when examined closely. This form has been adopted in many modern media and digital [[image search]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thudit.com/|title=Search Pictures In Mosaic Format|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613180134/http://www.thudit.com/|archivedate=13 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tile mosaic is a [[digital image]] made up of individual [[tile]]s, arranged in a non-overlapping fashion, e.g. to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor, by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles (a typical size is {{convert|1|x|1|in|mm|abbr=on}}, as for example, on the floor of the [[University of Toronto]] pool, though sometimes larger tiles such as {{convert|2|x|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} are used). These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text, such as the depth of the pool in various places, but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme.

Recent developments in digital image processing have led to the ability to design physical tile mosaics using [[computer aided design]] (CAD) software. The software typically takes as inputs a source [[bitmap]] and a [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of colored tiles.  The software makes a [[best-fit]] match of the tiles to the source image.

==Robotic manufacturing==
With high cost of labor in developed countries, production [[automation]] has become increasingly popular. Rather than being assembled by hand, mosaics designed using [[computer aided design]] (CAD) software can be assembled by a robot. Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy.  But these "computer" mosaics have a different look than hand-made "artisanal" mosaics.  With robotic production, colored tiles are loaded into [[wikt:buffer|buffers]], and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artaic.com/ |title=Automated Custom Mosaics |year=2011 |accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Udstillingen 1888 by Vilhelm Tillge.jpg|thumb|250px|The great hall of the Nordic Exhibition of 1888, photographed by [[Vilhelm Tillge]] ]]

The '''Nordic exhibition of Industry, Agriculture, and Art of 1888''' was an [[World's fair|exhibition]] that aimed to feature the best of art, industry, and agriculture from the five [[Nordic countries]]. It was a joint-venture between 29 organisations and institutions, with the weight on the private side, represented foremost by the Association of Copenhagen Industrialists. The exhibition was located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] and was visited by 1.3 million people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Influence of national responsibility ==

Organizers contributed with his or her picture of "what the fuss was all about." Pictures which were added to the event as a whole. In the spring of 1883, however, all these views on the exhibition were part of the future. At that point the completeness of the exhibition was narrowed down to be an idea fostered by Mr. [[Philip Schou]]. The latter was a successful [[shareholder]] and daily manager of the [[ceramic]] factory [[Royal Copenhagen]].

Like the foregoing generations of influential men - say, in the years from democracy was being introduced to the state of Denmark - Philip Schou took a great length of time to involve himself in national issues. In short, the idea to the exhibition was fostered in a period when the nation was being built. Built by men who recognized they were in that process, even though they surely could only guess on the collective outcome of their actions.

The emphasis of this specific cultural thread was, of cause, especially influential to the capital milieus of Copenhagen. And as such, fertilized both the forthcoming (as well as the realization) of the exhibition concept. Thus it was pointed out time and again by Philip Schou; the expo took place to create a platform foremost for the Danish citizens. So they would recognize the completeness of the national splendours; the products, lifestyles, and arts from all of Denmark. 
Likewise it was exactly the national aspects that knitted the different interests together in the organising assembly of the exhibition. Surely conflicts could not be avoided. Nevertheless, the corporation was fueled with the knowledge that the buzzing combatants in the end belonged to the same hive.

==Industrial art==

=== Industrial art and responsibility ===

An everlasting cause to conflicts in the exhibition committee was the question of how [[industrial art]] should be part of the scenario. To Philip Schou and those who had supported his idea from the beginning it was exactly the innermost mission of the exhibition to advocate that concept.

Simply put industrial art consisted of reminiscences of romantic thoughts, combined with a critic attitude towards the modern times. The concept included a belief in a certain ‘spirit’ of the ethnic, which in short meant that individual groups upheld certain characteristics. And that these characteristic was somehow manifest in the products created by the people.

It is no wonder that followers of this idea comprehended the introduction of machinery in the latter half of 1800 highly negatively. The machineries tended to exclude the human touch to the products. Which therefore did not become impregnated with the ‘folkgeist’ but became utterly ‘soulless.’ In that respect, the primary challenge of the modern age consisted in finding a method to keep the human touch attached to the products.

The solution was Industrial art. Defined as middle sized [[factory|factories]] that kept on using manpower in as many areas as possible, only reserving the hardest work to the machine. Surely this line of reasoning was not attractive to all branches, but primary to those that already included an aspect of ‘artful expression’ to the final product. Needless to mention, almost all the eight originators belonged to such branches.

=== Prevention of national disaster ===

The concept of industrial art had ability to reach further, than to those already in the branch. This was due to developments in economic thinking. From that direction it was stated that to be successful in the world marked that emerged in the second half of the 1800, every country would have to specialise in a range of products.

The outcome of this consideration combined with the idea of industrial art was clear cut. For a small state like Denmark the way to survive on the world marked, was to specialise in areas where the folkgeist could shine through. In fact this was not as a situation of choice, but as a necessity!

In the age of the exhibition the high-pitched voices than announced the last sentence, belonged to a minority. However, due to special circumstances that emerged in Denmark after 1864, there was a widespread fear that the nation was on its way to ruin. This fear was pregnant even in places like the [[Administration (government)|administration]]. And it made many ears and minds perceptible to voices (no matter how high-pinched) which brought forward solutions to prevent the end.

Nevertheless, there was a continuous fight in the exhibition committee on the subject of industrial art. The majority of the committee members outright disagreed that this line of thoughts should be placed at the front of the exhibition, and thereby state that the organizing body as a whole supported the idea. This battle of expositional ideology was won by the originators. The Copenhagen Exhibition was first and foremost a tribute to the concept of industrial art.

== Nordic brotherhood ==

The life source in [[Scandinavia]] has been drawn from the same well since the dawn of days, one of the more originators wrote dreamingly some years before the exhibition. The kinfolks of Denmark, [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] are thus distinguishable from the others, and yet inevitable entangled. The poetic claim was not utterly out of reason, at least not seen from the second half of the 1800. The centuries that could be looked back upon then, were in many ways defined by regional Nordic unity or at least highly intermingled developing patterns.

One of the step stones towards the realization of the expo was therefore to call upon the neighbours and invite them to party. This would make it possible to get a survey of the standpoint of the Nordic countries in the areas of industry, agriculture, and art. And it would also be a reminder to the crowds of modern age of their common heritage.

From a strategic position the talk of brotherhood was a further [[avocation]] of the subject of industrial art. A Nordic home marked -secured by trade walls- would ensure a nice stable growth of the many small and middle sized factory units in the region.

However, at this point in the chain of reasoning the originator was oddly silent. The reason to this was most probably that talk of Nordic unity could cause implications to the Danish foreign policies. The policy towards Europe’s strongest power was in short to ensure that absolutely no steps were taken that could be comprehended ‘negative.’ Talk of a protected Scandinavian marked that would exclude Germany, but include Finland (satellite of Russia) did not fit into that line of policy.

The motives to arrange an exhibition where a good many – Surely not all of them where outspoken right away.

== Exhibition support ==

The way towards the expo was first and foremost a stony road of hard work. As mentioned the idea was fostered by Philip Schou in 1883, the very same year he became chairman of the Association of Copenhagen Industrialist. Since its foundation in the 1840s the association was meant to act as a dynamic forefront of modern age. This by introducing newly developed wonders (machineries, mostly) that with success could be implemented by society. But in the span of years that proceeded Philip Schou’s entry as chairman this work had had bad conditions. Primary because the membership profile of the association had changed. Reports suggest that a majority of members in the late 1870s comprehended the membership as a club membership, with the weight on relaxation facilities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

When Philip Schou introduced a range of measures to promote industrial art, he faced negative response from a majority of the members. However, a minority was able to commit the association in the aforementioned direction, likely a result of the status they held. This minority was influential due to their significant representation in different boards of the association. And also several were sons of the association’s founding fathers. In short, the group of originators looked like a coherent minority.

The reality of the proposal was that the exposition did not require much funding in terms of money. The heavy workload that would be involve would be purely voluntary. So even though the idea may not have been what the majority distinctly wanted, it could not really be seen harmful to other interests in the association. In a far from unanimous state of mind, the Association of Copenhagen Industrialist therefore in 1884, undertook the enormous responsibility to organize the exhibition of 1888.

== Exposition committee==

Institutions as such did not always correspond to the originators view on which connections was needed to fulfill the project. This was reflected in a schedule made in the beginning of 1885 consisting of those who were to participate. Some of the men on the list did not belong to any organisation. Rather they represented what must be recognized as political, royal, and economic spheres of society.

It is hardly a surprise that a broad basis of interest was desirable to secure the project. Which indicate that membership of the committee was not limited to institutions. In general this point towards a scrutiny of the role individuals was to have in the committee of organisations. For example, most of the institutions that were permitted to join the committee did so by invitation. These typical contained not only the number of seats available for the specific institution, but furthermore the names of those individuals who were designated to the seats.

Actually the originators sometimes comprehended the institutions as trade able cards. This was apparent as the Royal Agrarian Society joined the committee. As the society’s members arrived they stated that they also represented 3 other organisations, which thereby joined the committee. Due the fact that admission to the committee for these new organisations had corresponded closely to the individuals’ admittance by the committee’s invitation, it was shown that individuals was recognised on a level just as important as the institutions.

Sometimes the importance of institutions was even overruled by persons, as seen in the case of the Royal academy of Art. The head of the academy did not particularly wanted the academy to participate, whereas the committee was interested in its participation, but wanted to avoid the director. This situation was at a deadlock for more than a year, until members at the academy finally decided to take matter into hands and inform committee, as well as director, that they would represent the academy.

== Epilogue ==

By the 1880s the romantic thoughts of Industrial art was anachronistic. The idea consisted both of a belief in qualities of the ethnic bloodline which was reflected in the handiwork. As well as it required extraordinary political will, to impose the implications hereof into the realms of real life. To turn ordinary and educated men on that kind of scheme was uphill all the way.

Nevertheless, this was what the group of originators aimed at by arranging the Expo. It must be concluded they failed. Rather it seems like a majority of the involved went along for the roller coaster ride. This is not to say that the expo did not cause any or long lasting results. On the contrary it did; in almost infinite numbers. But the flourishing of Industrial art was not one of them. Rather the concept was placed in a museum, where it is still to be enjoyed today.

'''Openness''' is an overarching concept or philosophy that is characterized by an emphasis on [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and free, unrestricted access to knowledge and [[freedom of information|information]], as well as collaborative or cooperative management and [[decentralized decision-making|decision-making]] rather than a central [[authority]].&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Michael|title=The Idea of Openness: Open Education and Education for Openness|url=http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=open_education_and_education_for_openness|work=The Encyclopaedia of Educational Philosophy and Theory|accessdate=1 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20140501132743/http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=open_education_and_education_for_openness|archivedate=1 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Openness can be said to be the opposite of [[secrecy]].&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt;

== In government ==
{{Main article|Open government}}
'''Open government''' is the governing [[doctrine]] which holds that citizens have the right to access the documents and proceedings of the government to allow for effective public [[Regulation|oversight]].&lt;ref name="ruma"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Lathrop |editor2-first=Laurel |editor2-last=Ruma |title= Open Government: Transparency, Collaboration and Participation in Practice |publisher= O'Reilly Media |date=February 2010  |url = https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24435672M/Open_Government |isbn= 978-0-596-80435-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Openness in government applies the idea of [[freedom of information]] to information held by authorities and holds that citizens should have the right to see the operations and activities of government at work.&lt;ref name = "Birkinshaw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birkinshaw|first=Patrick|title=FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND OPENNESS: FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS?|journal=Administrative Law Review|volume=58|issue=1|pages=177–218|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=ac4899af-cdac-4b67-8b67-d0f7951e70b3%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=124&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=bth&amp;AN=20477744&amp;anchor=AN0020477744-10|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since reliable information is requisite for accountability, freedom of access to information about the government supports government accountability and helps protect other necessary rights.&lt;ref name = "Birkinshaw"/&gt;

== In education ==
{{Main article|Open education}}
Open education refers to institutional practices and programmatic initiatives that broaden access to the learning and training traditionally offered through formal education systems.  By eliminating [[barriers to entry]], [[open education]] aids freedom of information by increasing accessibility.

Open Education advocates state people from all social classes worldwide have open access to high-quality education and resources. They help eliminate obstacles like high costs, outmoded materials, and legal instruments. These barriers impede collaboration among stakeholders. Cooperation is crucial to open education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-education|title=What is open education?|work=Opensource.com|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== In information technology ==
{{Main article|Code of Openness}}
Openness is a capability provided by an IT system, and it is characterized by interoperability, portability and extensibility. These capabilities are implemented using IT interfaces, standards and the [[Information technology architecture|IT architecture]]. All these are technical aspects of openness. Openness is also based on non-technical aspects, which are related to the partnership between the involved partners (IT customers, IT vendors and/or IT service providers).&lt;ref name="CPO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Vettermann|title=Code of Openness|url=http://www.prostep.org/en/cpo.html|website=CPO|publisher=ProSTEP iViP|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In psychology == 
In psychology, [[openness to experience]] is one of the domains which are used to describe human personality in the [[Five Factor Model]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10417">[[File:Amore e Psiche,Canova (1757-1822), Retro.JPG|thumb|right|Rear view of the [[Louvre]]'s prime version of [[Antonio Canova]]'s ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'', 1793]]
In the [[art world]], if an artwork exists in several versions, the one known or believed to be the earliest is called the '''prime version'''.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 21&lt;/ref&gt;   Many artworks produced in media such as [[painting]] or carved [[sculpture]] which create unique objects are in fact repeated by their artists, often several times.  It is regarded as a matter of some importance both by [[art historian]]s and the art market to establish which version has "priority", that is to say was the original work.  The presumption usually is that the prime version is the finest, and perhaps the most carefully done, though some later versions can be argued to improve on the originals.  

In many periods the later "repetitions" were often produced by the workshop of the master, with varying degrees of supervision and direct attention from him.  This was especially the case with official portraits of monarchs and politicians, which in the Early Modern period were often ordered in large numbers of versions from the court artist as [[diplomatic gift]]s.  Sometimes "reduced versions" that are considerably smaller than the prime one are made. 

==Contexts==
[[File:Pope Julius II.jpg|thumb|left|The London version of ''[[Portrait of Pope Julius II (Raphael)|Portrait of Pope Julius II]]'' by [[Raphael]], 1511–12, recognized since 1970 as the prime version]]

In the case of official portraits the later creation of replica versions was likely to have been anticipated from the start, as in other types of art such as [[printmaking]], but in other types of painting, especially [[history painting]], the normal presumption, in the past as today, was that each work was a unique creation.  This was a matter of some importance to the owner, and there was evidently in some periods a general understanding that a work should not be replicated or copied without the permission of the owner of the prime version, which needed to be asked for carefully and was not always given.  In many periods "replicas were the direct product of collecting, as collectors have always preferred recognizable masterpieces to what is offbeat".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 21&lt;/ref&gt;  

This was true of 17th century Rome, where artists such as [[Orazio Gentileschi]] and [[Bernardo Strozzi]] routinely made replicas, and others such as [[Guercino]] and [[Guido Reni]] sometimes did,&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; as of Victorian London, where artists such as [[William Powell Frith]] often painted one or more replica versions of their successes.  In Frith's case the replicas were painted many years after his first versions, when his newer work was achieving less success.  The French painter {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles Landelle|fr}} recorded no fewer than 32 versions of his ''Femme Fellah'', an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] hit at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Pieces of sculpture made by [[casting]] processes that allow the original model to be reproduced several times are rather different; though the first in an edition (today often kept by the artist) has some added prestige, it is expected that a number of versions will be made.

[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|''Aeneas' Flight from Troy by [[Federico Barocci]]'', image of the replica version in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/47.100.1023|title=Agostino Carracci after Federico Barocci: Aeneas and His Family Fleeing Troy (47.100.1023) - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An example of a work now only known from a replica (in the [[Galleria Borghese]] in Rome) and studies is ''[[Aeneas]] and his Family Fleeing Troy'', the only secular [[history painting]] by [[Federico Barocci]]. The prime version was given in 1586 by [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino|Francesco Maria II]], the last [[Duke of Urbino]], to [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in Prague, and was later looted by the Swedes. It was taken to Rome by Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], passed to the [[Orleans collection]] in Paris, and finally sold at auction in London for 14 guineas in 1800 (the price probably reflecting the poor condition some sources mention), since when its whereabouts are unknown.  The Rome version was painted in 1598, presumably for Cardinal [[Scipio Borghese]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Nicholas, ''Federico Barocci'', 2000, Vilo (109)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judging the prime version==
In some cases it is evident which version of a work is prime, especially if there is a full [[provenance]] including a contract or other documentation of the original commission; a contract for a copy will normally make that clear.  Otherwise experts will look both at the overall quality of the work, and also technical elements such as detailed [[underdrawing]] and [[pentimenti]] (changes of mind) that indicate that the artist was finalizing his idea of the work as he proceeded. [[Infrared]] and [[X-ray]] photography are among the scientific techniques that may help in discovering these technical issues.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1986), 436-438, and 432, provide examples of such discussions, relating to various paintings by Caravaggio&lt;/ref&gt;  Close comparison with the evolving style of other works by the artist and the comparison, ideally physically side by side, between two rival versions will often lead to a clear conclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Millar&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes arguments between experts may take decades to reach a conclusion, as with other issues of attribution.  

One of the most dramatic reassessments in recent decades, of a very important work, came  in 1970 when a new assessment of a version of the ''[[Portrait of Pope Julius II (Raphael)|Portrait of Pope Julius II]]'' by [[Raphael]] drew on a combination of new scientific research and archival knowledge, as x-rays revealed an inventory number from 1693, as well as a background that Raphael had repainted.  The version in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]], previously considered prime, was replaced by the version in the [[National Gallery, London]], previously considered a replica.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton and Roy, 757-759, which reports further testing modifying the earlier conclusions of Gould, 208-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]], ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]''; prime [[Louvre]], second version [[National Gallery, London]]
*[[Antonio Canova]], ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]''; prime Louvre (completed 1793), other versions [[Hermitage Museum]] (1796) and elsewhere. An example of a relatively recent work where documentary evidence means that the prime version has never been in dispute. 
*[[William Powell Frith]], ''[[The Derby Day]]''; prime (1858) [[Tate Britain]], second version (1893–94) [[Manchester City Art Gallery]], plus a much smaller but highly finished "original study", sold at [[Christie's]] for £505,250 in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16216133 Re-discovered William Powell Frith sells at auction], BBC News, 16 December 2011; [http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5521063 Sale of study], Christie's, lot details 15 December 2011, Frith ''Derby Day''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ary Scheffer]], ''[[Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta Appraised by Dante and Virgil]]'' (and variant titles).  Probably his best-known work; over 15 years after the original he produced several smaller versions.  The prime version, from 1835, measures {{convert|166.5|by|234|cm}}; now [[Wallace Collection]] in London. The second version (1854), measuring {{convert|51.7|by|81.3|cm}}, is in the [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]]. The third version (1855) is now in the [[Louvre]]. Another version from 1851 measuring {{convert|24.7|by|33.2|cm}} is in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1980.40 |publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art |accessdate=11 September 2015 |title=Dante and Virgil Meeting the Shades of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Carnegie Museum of Art]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has another version.&lt;ref&gt;[https://museumnetwork.sothebys.com/museum/carnegie-museum-of-art/exhibition/visions-of-order-and-chaos-the-enlightened-eye Ary Scheffer, ''Dante and Virgil Encountering the Shades of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta in the Underworld'', (detail) 1851, oil on canvas, Heinz Family Fund and Anonymous gift, CMOA]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The famous [[Ancient Egyptian art|Ancient Egyptian]] [[Nefertiti Bust]] in Berlin is thought to be a finished [[modello]], largely in plaster, for studio use in making other official portraits.

'''Renaissance architecture''' was that style of architecture which evolved firstly in [[Florence]] and then Rome and other parts of Italy as the result of [[Humanism]] and a revived interest in Classical architecture. It was part of the general movement known as the [[Renaissance]] which spread outwards from Italy and effected many aspects of scholarship and the arts. When the Renaissance spirit was exported into '''Eastern Europe''', it had to compromise with local traditions and climates. The Renaissance style differs from place to place throughout the region with many local characteristics making themselves apparent. {{main|Renaissance architecture}}

==Renaissance architecture in the Kingdom of Poland==

{{Main|Renaissance in Poland}}
[[File:Wawel dziedziniec1 2010.jpg|thumb|The courtyard of the castle [[Wawel]] in [[Kraków]]]]
[[Polish Renaissance]] architecture is divided into three periods: The First period (1500–1550), is the so-called "Italian". Most of Renaissance buildings built at this time were by Italian architects, mainly from [[Florence]] including [[Francesco Fiorentino]] and [[Bartolomeo Berrecci]].

In the Second period (1550–1600), Renaissance architecture became more common, with the beginnings of [[Mannerist]] and under the influence of the Netherlands, particularly in [[Pomerania]]. Buildings include the New [[Sukiennice|Cloth Hall]] in [[Kraków]] and city halls in [[Tarnów]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Chełm]] (demolished) and most famously in [[Poznań]]. [[Zamość]] is a unique example of a Renaissance town in Central Europe. &lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/564 |title=Old City of Zamość |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Third period (1600–1650), the rising power of [[Jesuits]] and [[Counter Reformation]] gave impetus to the development of Mannerist architecture and Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Busch, Bernd Lohse, Hans Weigert, ''Baukunst der Renaissance in Europa. Von Spätgotik bis zum Manierismus'', Frankfurt af Main, 1960&lt;br&gt;Wilfried Koch, ''Style w architekturze'', Warsaw 1996&lt;br&gt;Tadeusz Broniewski, ''Historia architektury dla wszystkich'' Wydawnictwo Ossolineum, 1990&lt;br&gt;Mieczysław Gębarowicz, ''Studia nad dziejami kultury artystycznej późnego renesansu w Polsce'', Toruń 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance architecture in Lithuania==
{{Category|Renaissance architecture in Lithuania}}

==Renaissance architecture in the Kingdom of Hungary==

[[File:Buda 1493.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Buda Castle]] in the late 15th century ([[Budapest]])]]

One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was [[Hungary]] – in fact the Apostolic Kingdom was the first to embrace the Renaissance north of the Alps. The style appeared following the marriage of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] and Beatrix of Naples in 1476. Matthias was 15 when he was elected King of Hungary. He was educated in Italian, and his fascination with the achievements of the Italian Renaissance led to the promotion of Mediterranean cultural influences in Hungary. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and [[masonry|masons]] arrived at [[Buda]] with the new queen. One of whom, [[Aristotile Fioravanti]], travelled from Hungary to Moscow where he built the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]]. The most important work of Hungarian Renaissance ecclesiastical architecture is the Bakócz Chapel in [[Esztergom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hung-art.hu/kep/zmisc/faragvan/162_sz/bakocz01.jpg Image of Bakócz Chapel] (1506–08)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first centrally conceived chapel outside of Italy. In 1823 the medieval church was rebuilt and the chapel, to incorporate it into the new Neo-Classical [[Esztergom Basilica|Esztergom Cathedral]], was moved stone by stone to a different position.

[[Buda Castle]] was enlarged and modernized in Renaissance style. King Matthias also built a sumptuous summer palace in [[Visegrád]]. His successor, King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Ulászló II]] built an Italianate hunting lodge in Budanyék. These monuments were largely destroyed in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] wars but the remains of the Visegrád Palace were partially reconstructed around 2000 and 69 years ago
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.permea07.mke.org.hu/images/visegrad2.jpg image of reconstructed Visegrád Palace]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman conquest of Hungary in 1526 put an abrupt end to the short-lived Hungarian Renaissance. The royal court ceased to exist but Hungarian landowner families in the [[Royal Hungary]] built a lot of provincial Renaissance castles in the 16–17th centuries. The most important of them was the [[Rákóczi]] Castle in [[Sárospatak]].

Many significant Renaissance castles were built in [[Transylvania]], that time an independent principality. The palace of [[Gabriel Bethlen]] in [[Gyulafehérvár]] (now Alba Iulia, Romania) was designed by Italian architects. The Transylvanian Renaissance lasted well until the first half of the 18th century because of the aesthetical conservatism of the country. The vernacular architecture of Transylvania preserved Renaissance details especially long.

==Renaissance architecture in the Crown of Bohemia==
{{Main|Czech Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:057 Zámek červená Lhota.Okres JIndřichův Hradec.Česko..jpg|thumb|[[Červená Lhota Castle]] in south Bohemia]]
The Renaissance style first appeared in the [[lands of the Bohemian Crown]] in the 1490s. Bohemia together with its incorporated lands, especially Moravia, thus ranked among the areas of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with the earliest known examples of the Renaissance architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamlin|first1=Alfred D.|title=History of architecture|date=2010|publisher=Salzwasser-Verlag|location=Bremen|isbn=9783861952503|page=338|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=g89phgpRZOEC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As well as in other Central European countries the Gothic style kept its position especially in the church architecture. The traditional [[Gothic architecture]] was considered timeless and therefore able to express the sacredness. The Renaissance architecture coexisted with the Gothic style in Bohemia and Moravia until the late 16th century.

During the reign of Holy Roman Emperor and Bohemian King [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], the city of Prague became one of the most important European centers of the late Renaissance art (so-called [[Northern Mannerism|Mannerism]]). Nevertheless, not many architecturally significant buildings have been preserved from that time.

==Renaissance architecture in Russia==
[[File:Palais à facettes.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Palace of Facets]] on the [[Cathedral Square, Moscow|Cathedral Square]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]].]]
Prince [[Ivan III]] introduced Renaissance architecture to [[Russia]] by inviting a number of architects from [[Italy]], who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of the [[Russian architecture]]. In 1475 the Bolognese architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] came to rebuild the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Vladimir Cathedral]] as a model, and produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.

[[File:Kolomenskoe Ascension Church only.jpg|right|thumb|Ascension Church in [[Kolomenskoye]], Moscow.]]
In 1485 Ivan III commissioned the building of a royal [[Terem Palace]] within the Kremlin, with [[Aloisio da Milano]] being the architect of the first three floors. Aloisio da Milano, as well as the other Italian architects, also greatly contributed to the construction of the Kremlin walls and towers. The small banqueting hall of billybob the [[Russian Tsar]]s, called the [[Palace of Facets]] because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, [[Marco Ruffo]] and [[Pietro Solario]], and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as [[Aleviz Novyi]] or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow. He may have been the Venetian sculptor, Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne. He built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]], a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style. It is believed that the Cathedral of the [[Metropolitan Peter]] in [[Vysokopetrovsky Monastery]], another work of Aleviz Novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called ''octagon-on-tetragon'' architectural form in the [[Moscow Baroque]] of the late 17th century.

Between the early 16th and the late 17th centuries, however, an original tradition of stone [[tented roof]] architecture had been developed in Russia. It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some researches call that style 'Russian Gothic' and compare it with the European [[Gothic architecture]] of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced the appearance of the stone [[tented roof]] in Russia (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called [[Petrok Maly]] may have been an author of the Ascension Church in [[Kolomenskoye]], one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">In philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ''[[Either/Or]]'', the '''rotation method''' is the mechanism used by higher level aesthetes in order to avoid [[boredom]]. The method is an essential [[hedonism|hedonistic]] aspect of the aesthetic way of life.

==Overview==
Kierkegaard likens the rotation method to the [[crop rotation]] used in [[agriculture]], in which the soil is constantly rotated in order to maximize the use of nutrients for the crops. For the aesthete, one constantly changes what one is doing in order to maximize the enjoyment and pleasure derived from each activity.

A consequence of the rotation method would be the aesthete's lack of commitment to any one thing. Commitment requires one to constantly repeat an activity; however, for the aesthetic, repeating an activity leads to boredom, as this activity is no longer novel.

The rotation method, Kierkegaard argues, would eventually lead aesthetes to a state of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], because all activities, no matter how unique or new, will eventually become boring:

:''I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding – the motion is too powerful; I don't feel like walking – it is too tiring; I don't feel like lying down, for either I have to stay down, and I don't feel like doing that or I would have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that, either. ''Summa Summarum'': I don't feel like doing anything.'' – ''Either/Or'', p. 4&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Either/Or''. Princeton, 1985. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthete, Kierkegaard predicts, realizing and responding to the futility of one's hedonistic finite aims, will yearn to experience a more meaningful life.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard''. Oneworld, 2003. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:San Serapio, por Francisco de Zurbarán.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Francisco de Zurbarán]], ''The Martyrdom of Saint Serapion'' 1628, 120 × 103 cm, [[Oil on canvas]], [[Wadsworth Atheneum]], [[Hartford, Connecticut]]]]
'''''Saint Serapion ''''' or '''''The Martyrdom of Saint Serapion''''' is a 1628 oil on canvas painting by the Spanish artist [[Francisco Zurbarán]] (1598–1664). The work was commissioned by the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarian Order]] to hang in the ''De Profundis'' (funerary chapel) hall of their monastery in [[Seville]] (now [[Museum of Fine Arts of Seville]]).&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Alison. "[http://living.scotsman.com/features/Beyond-the-pale.2424217.jp Beyond the pale]". ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 3 May 2003. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brenson"&gt;Brenson, Michael. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/25/arts/monastic-masterpieces-from-zurbaran-at-met.html?pagewanted=all Monastic Masterpieces from Zurbaran at Met]". ''[[New York Times]]'', 25 September 1987. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Zurbarán is noted for his portrayals of penitent or martyred monks and saints.  Critic Tom Lubbock used this painting to illustrate a difference in the way the martyrdom of two different saints were depicted.  He contrasted the understated and calm depiction of St. Serapion's violent death, with the equally or more violent death of the [[Jesuit]] priest and martyr Saint [[Edmund Campion]] (1540–1581) who was publicly [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in London in December 1581.&lt;ref name="Lubbock"&gt;Lubbock, Tom. "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/de-zurbaran-francisco-saint-serapion-1628-904905.html de Zurbaran, Francisco: Saint Serapion (1628)]". ''[[The Independent]]'', 22 August 2008. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The art critic draws a comparison in the manner of depiction of Campion's death and that of [[Serapion of Algiers|Saint Serapion of Algiers]] (1179–1240), a [[Mercedarian]] [[friar]] who fought in the [[Third Crusade]] of 1196 and was later martyred.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Matthew; Bunson, Margaret; Bunson,  Stephen. ''Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints''. Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2003. 743&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Serapion is depicted by Zurbarán in a quasi-crucified pose,&lt;ref name="Lubbock" /&gt; standing with each hand bound by ropes and chain to an overhead horizontal pole. According to Michael Brenson of the ''[[New York Times]]'', his head "has shifted from the realm of the robe to the realm of the cape, which supports the head and seems to have the potential to lift it to the sky".&lt;ref name="Brenson" /&gt; The painting stops at the figure's knee level, while the strain placed on his arms is indicated by the heavy hanging folds of the drapes of the cloth hanging from left shoulder and right outstretched arm.&lt;ref name="Lubbock" /&gt; The saint is identified by text on a small note placed to the left of his chest area.&lt;ref name="Kleiner"&gt;Kleiner, 667&lt;/ref&gt;

The work makes strong use of [[chiaroscuro]] in the Spanish [[Tenebrist]] tradition of [[Jusepe de Ribera]]. The dominance of the white paint used to render the cloth creates a sense of tranquility, while the tension of the painting is derived from the dark shade created from the deep folds of the robes. In 2003, Scottish painter [[Alison Watt (Scottish painter)|Alison Watt]] wrote, "Each fold has been pared down to the basic elements of light and shade. As a viewer you are seduced by this simplicity, only to realise you have been duped. Zurbarán has elevated the humble fabric of the robes of Saint Serapion to a divine level with pure, magnificent white."&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt;

There is an allusion to Zurburán's depiction of Saint Serapion in the poem [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/15741%20Meditations%20in%20an%20Emergency "Meditations in an Emergency"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by the mid-twentieth century American poet [[Frank O'Hara]]:

A '''set dresser''' in drama (theater, film etc.) prepares the [[Theatrical scenery|set]] with [[Theatrical property|prop]]s and furniture to give it correct appearance and make sure each item is in correct position for each performance.

==In film==
Set dressers arrange objects on a [[film set]] before shooting. They work under the direction of a leadman and the Set Decorator.  Set dressers place furniture, hang pictures, and put out decorative items.  They are also responsible for some light construction and assembly of small items, such as air-conditioning ducts.  They also move items as necessary to make room for the filming equipment. During the shoot, the prop department works with an on-set dresser to ensure that the props and [[furnishing]] are in the proper location for the script and to maintain [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], as scenes are often shot out of order.

==In theater==
Set dressers "dress" the set of a play. Set dressers specifically deal with items on stage that are not interacted with by actors. Often set dressers are in charge of finding and installing curtains, wallpaper, photos, bedspreads, rugs and other items onto the set.
Set dressers are sometimes a part of the props department, [[set construction|construction]] department or their own department. Whether set dressing is its own department is often dependent on how much money a theater has. Set dressers also often have a lot of cross over work with the props department or construction department.
The set dressing department works under the director, producer and [[scenic designer]].

'''Sidney H. Riesenberg''' (1885 – 1971) was an illustrator and artist who lived in [[Yonkers, NY]] and commuted to his studio in NYC by train. He is known, as a professional illustrator, for his posters for the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[Liberty bond]] programs, for his illustrations for book covers, magazines, and for oil paintings of diverse subjects. He retired from his professional work and dedicated his full-time energy to painting fine arts and teaching. He began, in 1937, spending summers in Rockport, MA, where he painted scenes of the small fishing town. He was active in the Rockport Art Association, teaching oil painting and participating in water color figure painting classes.

==Biography==
Riesenberg was born in 1885 in [[Chicago]]. He was educated at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], where he was recognized for his compositions in oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliver|first=Maude I. G.|title=Recent Work at the Art Institute of Chicago|journal=The International Studio|year=1906|volume=29|page=cv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HXpAAAAMAAJ|publisher=John Lane Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He moved to [[Yonkers]] in 1905 where he began his career as a professional illustrator, after a sojourn in the American west pursuing what became a lifelong interest in depicting the frontier west as was being popularized then by Zane Grey and other writers.&lt;ref name=Spanierman&gt;{{cite book|last=Spanierman|first=Ira|title=Art for the new collector III: re-emerging American artists|year=2004|publisher=Spanierman Gallery|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=094593663X|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=QKZ2UsOXAcTiyAGwjYG4DQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the early 1930s, he began doing illustration work for magazines.&lt;ref name=Spanierman /&gt;  In the 1930s and 1940s, his work was often featured at venues such as the [[National Academy of Design]] and in organizations such as the [[Allied Artists of America]].&lt;ref name=AskArt&gt;{{cite web|title=Sidney Harry Riesenberg|url=http://www.askart.com/askart/r/sidney_h_riesenberg/sidney_h_riesenberg.aspx|work=AskArt|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Riesenberg was also the vice president of the [[Yonkers Art Association]].&lt;ref name=Yonkers&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yonkers Art Association|year=1940|publisher=Hudson River Museum|location=Yonkers, New York|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OytffPPXNUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Riensenberg died in 1971 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Riesenberg had a brother six years older, [[Felix Riesenberg|Felix]], with whom he was extremely close. They shared a love of creating art and adventure. In their youth, both wrote short stories in journals they kept.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

He produced many posters for the Marines in addition to posters advertising the [[Liberty Loan]] campaign during [[World War I]]. One of Riesenberg's most well known works is his 1918 World War I-era poster, ''Over the Top for You'', which illustrates a young [[doughboy]] clutching the [[American flag]]. With its bold illustration and concise text, like many war posters of the time, ''Over the Top for You'' encouraged the public to support its military by purchasing [[liberty loans]].&lt;ref name=Smithsonian2&gt;{{cite web|title=Over the Top: American Posters from World War I|url=http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2007/posters_wwI/|work=Smithsonian American Art Museum|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other posters, it was selected to display in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] under the exhibit, ''Over the Top: American Posters from World War I.''&lt;ref name=Smithsonian2 /&gt;  Riesenberg also created several posters for the [[United States Navy]], one of which, titled ''Democracy's Vanguard'', illustrates Marines landing from a boat to initiate an offensive.

The '''Sir John Sulman Medal''' is an [[architectural]] prize presented by the [[New South Wales]] chapter of the [[Australian Institute of Architects]] since 1932.&lt;ref name="Sulman80"&gt;[http://www.architecture.com.au/docs/default-source/nsw-notable-buildings/80th-anniversary-of-the-sulman-medal.pdf?sfvrsn=0 80th anniversary of the Sulman Medal]&lt;/ref&gt; The medal is sometimes referred to as the [[Sulman Award]] and now recognises excellence in public and commercial buildings in either New South Wales or in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Before the advent of the [[Wilkinson Award]] it was on occasions presented to domestic projects.

The medal is presented in memory of the Australian architect [[John Sulman|Sir John Sulman]] (29 August 1849 – 18 August 1934).&lt;ref name="Sulman80"/&gt; Sulman was born in [[Greenwich]], [[England]], and emigrated to [[Sydney]] in 1885. From 1921 to 1924 he was chairman of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee and influenced the development of [[Canberra]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''Symphony No. 2, the "Copernican," Op. 31''' ''('''II Symfonia "Kopernikowska'''")'' ({{audio|Henryk Górecki 2nd symph 2nd Movement.ogg|sample}}) is a [[choral symphony]] composed by [[Henryk Górecki]] in 1972 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of &lt;!-- do not enter nationality claims here--&gt; astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Composed in a monumental style for [[soprano|solo soprano]], [[baritone]], [[choir]] and [[orchestra]], it features text from [[Psalms]] no. 145, 6 and 135, along with an excerpt from Copernicus' book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''.

The symphony was commissioned by the [[Kosciuszko Foundation]] in New York and presented to Górecki as an opportunity to reach an audience outside his native Poland. Typically, he undertook extensive research on the subject, and was particularly taken by the philosophical implications of Copernicus' discovery, not all of which he viewed as positive.&lt;ref name="th74"&gt;Thomas (1997), 74&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Davies commented: "His discovery, of the earth's motion round the sun, caused the most fundamental revolutions possible in the prevailing concepts of the human predicament."&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Norman. ''God's Playground: A history of Poland''. Oxford, 1981. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Its world premiere took place on June 22, 1973 in Warsaw, featuring soprano [[Stefania Woytowicz]] and baritone Andrzej Hiolski.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Henryk-G-recki-Symphony-No-2-Copernican/2924|title=Henryk Górecki - Symphony No.2 `Copernican'|website=www.boosey.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;Adrian Thomas writes in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition]]'', "The second movement marks an important stage in Górecki's conversion to a more consonant language since the late 1960s, a process which was clarified in several choral pieces and the [[Symphony No. 3 (Górecki)|Third Symphony]]."&lt;ref name="thomas"/&gt; The symphony is written in two movements, following a binary design Górecki had followed in several previous works, "where the fortissimo dynamic, long silent pauses and rapid, [[chromaticism|chromatic]] motifs of the first movement are counterbalanced by a comparatively calm second movement.... The thunderous cosmic vision of the mostly orchestal first movement is answered by a second movement whose proportions are considerably expanded in order to release the earlier tensions."&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;Thomas, ''New Grove (2001)'', 10:160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second symphony has been performed and recorded less than some of his other work (certainly less than his [[Symphony No. 3 (Górecki)|Symphony No. 3]]), in part because it demands a particularly large orchestra, soprano and baritone soloists, and a large choir.&lt;ref name="Perlez"&gt;Perlez, Jane. "Henryk Gorecki". ''New York Times'', 27 February 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, more than one interpretation of Symphony No. 2 is available on compact disc. The most readily available is the [[Naxos Records]] CD of the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra of Katowice, the Polish Radio Choir and the Silesian Philharmonic Choir with soloists [[Zofia Kilanowicz]] and [[Andrzej Dobber]], conducted by [[Antoni Wit]], which includes ''[[Beatus Vir (Górecki)|Beatus Vir]]''.

'''Symphony No. 4 ''Los Angeles''''' (''The Angels'' and [[Los Angeles|the city]]) is the fourth symphony by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo Pärt]]. It is the first of his symphonies to be written post-1976 and is in his signature [[tintinnabuli]] style. It is the first of his pieces that focuses on larger scale, instrumental tintinnabulation. Previous pieces, such as [[Summa]] and [[Für Alina]], were typically written for [[SATB]] choir or a smaller number of instruments. Composed in 2008, and premiered 10 January 2009, Symphony No. 4 has been nominated for a 2010 [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition]], although he did not receive the award.

The work was a joint commission from the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic|Los Angeles Philharmonic Association]], its conductor [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], the [[Canberra International Music Festival]], and the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]].

==History==

===Development===
Symphony No. 4 was written 37 years after his third symphony. In the previous decade, he had written mostly mystical works for chorus and small vocal ensembles. The piece earns its nickname, ''Los Angeles'', from its commission. Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association had long desired to commission a new work by Pӓrt, and the commission came at an opportune moment. At the time, Pӓrt was working on Kanon Pokajanen, a choral piece based on an ancient [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[Canon (hymnography)|canon]] containing a prayer to a guardian angel. He decided to make “The Canon of the Guardian Angel” the foundation for this piece, as it was to be written for the flagship orchestra of a city whose name literally means "The Angels".

A note in the score indicates: "Pӓrt was further inspired to take the commission by the idea of seeing this work performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, one of the best orchestras in the world, under its music director Esa-Pekka Salonen, and in Walt Disney Concert Hall, one of the most exciting concert buildings of our time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/symphony-no-4-los-angeles-world-premiere-lapa-commission-arvo-part|title=Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles"|website=www.laphil.com|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premiere===
Symphony No. 4 was premiered January 10, 2009, at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] in Los Angeles, by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, under Esa-Pekka Salonen. It was the second piece of the program, placed in between the ''[[Serenade No. 12 (Mozart)|Mozart Serenade No. 12 for Winds]]'' and the ''[[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Brahms)|Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1]]'', performed by [[Emanuel Ax]]. The performance is reprised on disc, released by [[ECM Records]]. The album also contains his piece ''Fragments of [[Kanon Pokajanen]]'', as a supplement to the fourth symphony.

The Los Angeles Philharmonic also played its East Coast premier on May 8, 2010 at the Society for Ethical Culture Concert Hall in New York City, as well as its UK premier on August 20, 2010 at the [[The Proms|BBC Proms]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].

===Dedication===
A distinguishing feature of Pӓrt’s music is the way he has used it throughout his career in protest against different Russian governments. He composed [[serialism|serialist]] works when it was an aesthetic criticized by soviets, and composed religious music when the [[Soviet Union]] suppressed and persecuted [[Christianity]].

The symphony is dedicated to [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], a Russian oil executive and Russia's most politically active oligarch who was accused of and currently imprisoned for fraud. The piece is a protest against [[Vladimir Putin]] in its dedication. It is debated that Khodorkovsky's arrest is politically motivated, as he had ambitions to become prime minister and president. This angered Putin, who struck an implicit deal with the oligarchs of Russia to stay clear of politics. Convinced that Russia would be a better country with Khodorkovsky as its leader, Pärt explained in a program insert, “The tragic tone of the symphony is not a lament for Khodorkovsky, but a bow to the great power of the human spirit and human dignity.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecmreviews.com/2010/12/28/symphony-no-4/|title=Arvo Pärt: Symphony No. 4 (ECM New Series 2160)|last=Grillo|first=Tyran|date=2010-12-28|website=between sound and space: ECM Records and Beyond|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also says, “With my composition, I would like to reach out my hand, extending it to the prisoner, and in his person to all those imprisoned without rights in Russia.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/01/review-a-mystic.html|title=Review: A mystic in La La Land -- Arvo Pärt's "Los Angeles" Symphony|date=2009-01-11|website=LA Times Blogs - Culture Monster|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
As the Grammy nomination would suggest, ''Symphony No. 4'' met great success with the public audience. Critics and bloggers have described Pärt's work as "hauntingly beautiful",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "other-worldly", and "a rare achievement".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/08/21/composer-arvo-part-debuts-fourth-symphony-los-angeles-in-the-united-kingdom/|title=Composer Arvo Part Debuts Fourth Symphony ‘Los Angeles’ in the United Kingdom|last=Sharma|first=Paul|newspaper=WSJ|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pärt's remarkable comeback as the mystical, ecclesiastical composer seems to have made this symphony highly anticipated, after a period of musical repose and nearly four decades in between his last symphony and this new one. Some would describe this work as Pärt coming full circle in his composition, tying the loose ends created through serialism in his last symphony.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Negative reviews are few, but not nonexistent. In some reviews, Pärt is critiqued for not deviating enough from his usual quiet style, resulting in predictability. Critics also believe that in adhering to this style, ''Symphony No. 4'' is quite subdued and unable to demonstrate Pärt's full creative potential as a composer. 5:4 blog remarks, "it's a peculiar &amp; frustrating work, burning with earnest desires but seemingly incapable (unwilling?) to act on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://5-against-4.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/proms-2010-arvo-part-symphony-no-4-los.html|title=5 against 4: Proms 2010: Arvo Pärt - Symphony No. 4 'Los Angeles' (UK Première) plus Mosolov|website=5-against-4.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Day from Limelight Magazine compares the symphony to Pärt's previous symphonies, tintinnabuli works, and pre-1976 works. Underwhelmed by the piece's effectiveness, Day writes "By its nature Pärt’s music is sparse; however, this piece seems in search of a core. It has all of his trademarks...Yet its greater purpose eludes me."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Review/244413,arvo-p196rt-symphony-no-4.aspx|title=ARVO PÄRT Symphony No 4|website=www.limelightmagazine.com.au|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
Pärt's previous symphonies are scored for full orchestra, but this one is only scored for [[string orchestra]], [[harp]], [[timpani]], and [[percussion]], with the following percussion instruments:
*[[Marimba]]
*[[Crotales]]
*[[Tubular bells]]
*[[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]]
*[[Suspended cymbal]]
*[[Sizzle cymbal]]
*[[Tamtam]]
*[[Bass drum]]

==Form==
The symphony is in three slow [[Movement (music)|movements]]. A performance of the work typically lasts 37 minutes. In general, it is slow-moving and solemn, keeping to the mystical mood of his works from recent decades, and has been described as "a mournful, introspective lament".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/arts/music/10arvo.html|title=Arvo Pärt’s Fourth Symphony|last=Review|first=Cd|date=2010-10-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece blends tolling bells, sustained chords, and lengthy pauses as an observance of silence and the resonance created by bell-like sounds. Strings often play in high registers, a technique Pärt often uses to evoke the sound and sonority of bells.
Although the [[key (music)|key]] of the piece is [[A minor]], tonal centers are present, but often blurred. Also notable about the piece is the repetition of intervals, particularly 3rds, 6ths, and 4ths, which are used like [[Motif (music)|motifs]] and frequently come up throughout the piece during lyrical, [[Melody|melodic]] sections.

===First Movement: ''Con sublimità'' (With Sublimity)===
This movement moves through three different sections, each in a different character. The first section begins with an E Major chord, the dominant of the key of the piece.

The high pitched [[tremolo]] in the strings evoke a shimmering haze, introducing the [[Tintinnabuli|M-voice]]. This is later juxtaposed by harp and percussion-the T-voice, which serves to outline the changes in harmony of the strings as the M-voice, while also serving as breaks and a release of tension in the seemingly eternal lines.

At only 76 [[Tempo|BPM]] per quarter note, the duration of each bar is long and the voices are slow moving. A different voice moves approximately every two and a half bars, setting an ethereal mood and a feeling of eternity. A gradual addition of voices appear above and below the ranges of the M voice. First, crotales are added to the T-voice, above the harp. The crotales then always enter 2 bars before each harp entrance in this entire section. Bass pizzicato is then added to the T voice below, so that the T voices frame the M voices.

The section consists of a series of suspensions, where the T voices provide the resolutions, and as a whole, is a gradual descent of five octaves, beginning on an E Major chord that seems almost too high for the human ear, and ending on one that’s almost too low to be audible.
The second section is where the piece really seems to begin, while the first section acts more as an introduction. Although it has strong a strong rhythm, the sense of a downbeat is indistinct due to the mix of 3, 4, and 5 beats per [[Bar (music)|measure]].

The melody of this section is played out in [[quarter note]]s, and from quarter notes, the melody becomes [[eighth note]]s, then [[Tuplet|triplets]], then [[sixteenth note]]s, implying urgency, and finally giving the music direction.

The final section returns to a more meditative state, but keeps both the urgency of the second section and the etherealness of the first section. It once again uses the T-voices to punctuate phrases and harmonies, and give the music a sense of rhythm.

===Second Movement: ''Affannoso'' (Breathless, labored)===
The second movement is a more vigorous movement, which briefly shatters the ethereal mood. It mainly consists of two alternating ideas: sections made up of triplets that are heavily rhythmic and percussive, and sections that are slow, rich, and lyrical. There is notable homophony throughout the first half of the movement, which creates and observes silence and space. Each instance of silence is different depending on the ring of the last notes played.
Movement II begins in the tonic this time, but key areas and tonality are more difficult to distinguish due to added dissonances. The music is mostly composed of standard [[seventh chord]]s and the dissonances are created by adding [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of major and minor seconds to the chords.

The climax point of the movement resolves to what sounds like a recapitulation, an altered version of the main melody in the first movement, during which Pӓrt’s "motifs" are heard throughout, where the melody is outlined by ascending and descending intervals of sixths, fifths, and tri-tones.
The second movement also includes quotations from Pӓrt's own work, ''These Words'', a piece also for strings and percussion. There is very little information available to the public regarding the piece, except that it was composed between 2007 and 2008 for a commission by [[Léonie Sonning Music Prize|Léonie Sonnings Musikfond]], [[Denmark]]. It was premiered May 22, 2008 in [[Copenhagen]], by the Danmarks RSO, under the direction of [[Tõnu Kaljuste]].

===Third Movement: ''Deciso'' (Decided)===
The final movement begins in G minor, with a motif of a root position minor chord that resolves to the vi₆, which sets up the melancholy, melodic introduction. The introduction contains a delicate texture and a melody made up of sequences. The accompanying T voice is rhythmic and delicate as well, making the music dance-like. The movement does not begin until the coda, which officially takes the designated marking the movement was named after, ''Deciso''.

''Deciso'' begins with a swift, but grave march, and it is where the music is in a literal [[Canon (music)|canon]] style. With the addition of each voice, the mood quickly transitions. Some enter in a minor and some in A Major, so that the piece ends with the orchestra playing simultaneously in both keys. The low registered, somber and grounded march turns twisted and desperate as it climbs higher in pitch. Each round of the cannon adds one additional bar to the melody of the canon for every voice of the M voice that enters (begins 9 bars, ends with 12 bars by the time the first violins have joined). The voices enter in order from lowest instrument to highest. This is also where tonal centers become the most strategically blurred in the music. Each instrument group always begin on a minor, then switches to A Major during their second round, then back to a minor, and so on. By the time all voices have entered into the canon, the orchestra is simultaneously playing in A Major and A minor. The number of bars for each round of the melody then decreases by increments of two, and settles on a four bar ending. Like a traditional canon, the instruments in the M voice also finish in the order they started, leaving the first violins to end the canon.

The piece ends with a very decided bell toll in A minor, as if to remind us of the sound that inspired the entire work.

==Influences==
Aside from drawing inspiration from ''These Words'', ''Symphony No. 4'' is a musical setting of [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] poetry. The elements of the prayer—number of syllables, inflection, and punctuation—are used to shape the structure of the piece, just as they were used for his piece ''Kanon Pokajanen''. The symphony can be seen as Pӓrt's way of taking the textual structure of ''Kanon Pokajanen'' and setting it to word-less music, rather than setting the text directly to melody and accompaniment. Of this, Pӓrt explains, “To my mind, the two works form a stylistic unity and they belong together in a way...I wanted to give the words an opportunity to choose their own sound. The result, which even caught me by surprise was a piece wholly pervaded by this special Slavonic diction found only in church texts. It was the canon that clearly showed me how strongly choice of language preordains a work’s character.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The symphony is filled with the characteristics of chant, in its modality, phrasing, repetitions and alternations, the responses of voices to one another, and the use of percussion as the sounds of bells and clangs, which are associated with the ritual signals of the Orthodox Church.

The '''Ashland Academy of Art''' was an [[art school]] located in [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]]. The Ashland Academy of Art was a classically based, independent school. The Academy's program was mainly based on the [[Russian Academic System]]. This system followed the artistic achievements of the [[Renaissance]], developed and practiced by European academies until the end of 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;The St. Petersburg State Academic Institute of

This analytical method emphasizes a sculptural approach to form, by studying comparative measurements, structure, planes, function, and [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]].

==History==

Preserving the unique academic system of the classical European academies, [[Semyon Bilmes]], founded the Bilmes Art School in 1990 in [[Medford, Oregon]].  In 2003, Semyon Bilmes founded The Ashland Academy of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Art School Takes Shape in Ashland|first= Chris|last= Abbey|publisher= ''[[Mail Tribune]]'' |date= November 21, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A Standard for Art|first= Greg|last= Stiles|publisher= ''[[Mail Tribune]]'' |date= March 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Ashland Academy was listed as one of [[Art Renewal Center]] Approved Ateliers.&lt;ref&gt;The Art Renewal Center, [http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/atelier.asp?atelierID=88], 2008-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was located in the former Temple Emek Shalom synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailytidings.com/2003/news1009/100903n3.shtml |title= Academy goes back to basics |first= Tim |last= Bousquet |publisher= ''[[Ashland Daily Tidings]]'' |year= 2006 |accessdate= 2008-10-14 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20031126194440/http://www.dailytidings.com/2003/news1009/100903n3.shtml |archivedate= 2003-11-26 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, the Bilmes Family announced that the Ashland Academy of Art would close its doors in October 2010, with the faculty and some of the students relocating immediately to a then unspecified facility in Portland, Oregon, where the school's classes would continue, uninterrupted.

In February 2010, Semyon Bilmes announced that instead of moving to Portland, Oregon, he would relocate to Hawaii and take only ten students with him.  According to the Ashland Academy of art website, "With a new name and a new location, Atelier Maui will bring superior classical European instruction in painting and drawing to a lush tropical paradise."

'''''The Country Bunny and the Little Gold Shoes''''' is a 1939 children's [[picture book]] written by [[DuBose Heyward]] and illustrated by [[Marjorie Flack]].

The book, which has never been out of print, has come to be regarded as a [[feminist]] and [[anti-racist]] statement.&lt;ref name="TheNewYorker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bare|first1=Kelly|title=Read This Book If: You Like Finding Easter Eggs|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/read-this-book-if-you-like-finding-easter-eggs|accessdate=7 April 2016|publisher=The New Yorker|date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheWashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devoark|first1=Petula|title=A brown feminist Easter Bunny’s inspiring triumph|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-brown-feminist-easter-bunnys-inspiring-triumph/2015/04/02/3fbfced6-d941-11e4-b3f2-607bd612aeac_story.html|accessdate=7 April 2016|publisher=Washington Post|date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to James Hutchisson, professor of English at [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], the book is probably based on a story made up by his mother, Jane Screven DuBose, and told to Heyward when he was a child.  Before turning it into a book, Heyward used to tell the story to his own children.&lt;ref name="TheWashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devoark|first1=Petula|title=A brown feminist Easter Bunny’s inspiring triumph|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-brown-feminist-easter-bunnys-inspiring-triumph/2015/04/02/3fbfced6-d941-11e4-b3f2-607bd612aeac_story.html|accessdate=7 April 2016|publisher=Washington Post|date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

It is the story of Cottontail, a small, brown female bunny who aspires to be an [[Easter Bunny]] which, in this telling, is a highly competitive position for which only 5 bunnies are selected each year.  She applies only to be scorned by the elite Easter bunnies, “big white bunnies who lived in fine houses” who tell her to “go back to the country and eat a carrot.”

She returns to the country where “by and by she had a husband and then one day, much to her surprise there were twenty-one Cottontail babies to take care of.”  She brings them up exceedingly well, teaching them to be responsible, self-reliant and cooperative by requiring them to help in the vegetable garden and with the housework.

Then, she returns to the big city where she not only aces the Easter-bunny job interview, but becomes one of the most celebrated Easter bunnies of all time, admired for her heroism and the skills she learned rearing 21 little bunnies.

==Feminist statement==
[[Caroline Kennedy]] calls the heroine of Country Bunny, "My all-time favorite character," form a childhood book, "I see her now as a woman who re-enters the work force after raising a family — “leans in,” and does it all — much better than the big Jack Rabbits."&lt;ref name="TheNewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Caroline|title=Caroline Kennedy: By the Book|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/books/review/caroline-kennedy-by-the-book.html?_r=0|accessdate=7 April 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Francis Itani]] also remembers it as a childhood favorite in which the Country Bunny, "goes on a quest to prove that she (as much as the male bunnies) can be wisest, swiftest and kindest."&lt;ref name="TheOttawaCitizen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robb|first1=Peter|title=Frances Itani finds satisfaction in children's literature|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/books/frances-itani-finds-satisfaction-in-childrens-literature|accessdate=7 April 2016|publisher=Ottawa Citizen|date=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Study For The Distribution Of The Eagle Standards.jpg|thumb|A study for ''The Distribution of the Eagle Standards'', by David]]
'''''The Distribution of the Eagle Standards''''' is an 1810 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]] depicting a ceremony arranged by [[Napoleon]] after his assumption of power as emperor. In it he sought to revive the military ethos of the [[Roman empire]]. 

The event took place on December 5, 1804, three days after his coronation. Napoleon distributed "[[French Imperial Eagle|eagles]]" based on the [[aquila (Roman)|Roman aquila]] of the legions of Rome. The standards represented the regiments raised by the various [[Département in France|Departments]] of France, and were intended to institute feelings of pride and loyalty among the troops who would be the backbone of Napoleon's new regime. Napoleon gave an emotional speech in which he insisted that troops should defend the standards with their lives. In early sketches of the painting David included a winged figure of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the goddess of victory, floating over the troops, but Napoleon objected to such an unrealistic feature. He also insisted that his wife [[Josephine Beauharnais|Josephine]] be removed from the composition. He was preparing to divorce her, since she had failed to produce his heir.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T3noLir82usC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=the+distribution+of+the+eagle+standards&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4o4bMdSCX9&amp;sig=FaJg7q6D_hj-p2z7iwn9u0mrFxI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE3reWsujbAhWEXsAKHfePCWQ4MhDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20distribution%20of%20the%20eagle%20standards&amp;f=false|title=Jacques-Louis David: New Perspectives|first=Dorothy|last=Johnson|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1611492835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final painting depicted the moment when Napoleon blessed the standards being held out towards him. Napoleon has his arm raised in imitation of ancient "[[adlocutio]]" scenes, which depict Classical heroes addressing troops. David's composition was heavily influenced by the friezes on [[Trajan's column]].&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

'''Tudric''' is a brand name for [[pewter]]ware made by W.H. Haseler's of Birmingham for [[Liberty &amp; Co]] of London, the chief (possibly only) designer being [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]].  The gold and silver ranges were known as Cymric (pro: Koomric).  Liberty &amp; Co began producing Tudric in 1899, and continued to the 1930s.  The designs use [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Celtic Revival]] styles, and remain popular with collectors.

The Tudric Pewter became known as poor man's silver due to its shine, which was achieved by removing the lead content and adding a small percentage of silver.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4288">'''Villem Raam''' (30 May 1910 – 21 May 1996) was an [[Estonian people|Estonian]] [[art history|art historian]], [[art critic]] and [[conservator-restorer]]. His work in documenting and preserving the cultural heritage of [[Estonia]], not least during the [[Estonian SSR|Soviet occupation of Estonia]], contributed significantly to the understanding of art history and cultural heritage in Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Randla|first1= Anneli|last2= |first2= |year= 2010|title= Villem Raam 100|journal= Baltic Journal of Art History|volume= |issue= 2010.

Villem Raam was born in [[Pärnu]] and studied art history at [[Tartu University]]. In 1938 he produced his first scholarly work on medieval Estonian architecture. Following the occupation of Estonia, in July 1940 Raam became the director of the State Art Museum of Soviet Estonia; however, in June 1941 he was arrested by Soviet authorities and deported to Siberia. He would remain in [[Gulag|labour camp]] for fifteen years. He was allowed to return to Estonia in 1956 and was able to continue working in his academic field, first as an employee at an institution with the purpose of registering architectural monuments. In 1957 he was admitted and eventually made a member of the board of the Estonian SSR Artists' Union. Subsequently he dedicated the rest of his life to art history, conservation issues and art criticism. Among his tangible contributions are the restoration of [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn|St. Nicholas' church]] in [[Tallinn]], which he managed to convince the authorities to transform into a museum of ecclesiastical art rather than an initially planned "museum of atheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Randla|first1= Anneli|last2= |first2= |year= 2010|title= Villem Raam 100|journal= Baltic Journal of Art History|volume= |issue= 2010.

'''World Intellectual Property Day''' is observed annually on 26 April.&lt;ref name="WIPO"&gt; WIPO web site, [http://www.wipo.int/ip-outreach/en/ipday/ ''World Intellectual Property Day – 26 April'']. Consulted on 20 April 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; The event was established by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in 2000 to "raise awareness of how [[patent]]s, [[copyright]], [[trademark]]s and [[Industrial design right|design]]s impact on daily life" and "to celebrate creativity, and the contribution made by creators and [[innovator]]s to the development of societies across the globe".&lt;ref name="WIPO"/&gt; 26 April was chosen as the date for World Intellectual Property Day because it coincides with the date on which the [[Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization]] entered into force in 1970. [[File:WIPO Celebrates Visionary Innovators.jpg|thumb|An exhibition showing the [[intellectual property]] (IP) behind [[Steve Jobs]]’ innovations opened to the public at [[WIPO]] on 30 March 2012 and ran through to ''World Intellectual Property Day'' on 26 April 2012.

== History ==
Following a statement made at the Assembly of the Member States of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in September 1998, the Director General of the National [[Algeria]]n Institute for Industrial Property (INAPI) proposed on 7 April 1999 the [[institutionalisation]] of an [[international observance|international day]] for intellectual property, with the aim of 
:"[setting up] a framework for broader mobilization and awareness, [opening up] access to the promotional aspect of innovation and [recognizing] the achievements of promoters of [[intellectual property]] throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt; Letter of 7 April 1999 from Amor Bouhnik, Director General of the National Algerian Institute for Industrial Property, to the Director General of WIPO (Ref: 027 DG/MS/99) in World Intellectual Property Organization web site, ''{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/ga24_7.htm |title=WIPO General Assembly, Twenty-Fourth (14th Ordinary) Session, Geneva, 20 to 29 September 1999, Institutionalization of an International Day for Intellectual Property.

On 9 August 1999, the Chinese delegation to the WIPO proposed the adoption of the "World Intellectual Property Day"
:"in order to further promote the awareness of intellectual property protection, expand the influence of intellectual property protection across the world, urge countries to publicize and popularize intellectual property protection laws and regulations, enhance the public [[legal awareness]] of intellectual property rights, encourage invention-innovation activities in various countries and strengthen international exchange in the intellectual property field".&lt;ref&gt; Letter dated 9 August 1999 from Jiang Ying, Commissioner of the [[State Intellectual Property Office|State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China]], to Dr. [[Kamil Idris]], Director General of World Intellectual Property Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, in World Intellectual Property Organization web site, ''{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/ga24_8.htm |title=WIPO General Assembly, Twenty-Fourth (14th Ordinary) Session, Geneva, 20 to 29 September 1999, Institutionalization of a World Intellectual Property Day.

In October 1999, the General Assembly of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) approved the idea of declaring a particular day as a World Intellectual Property Day.&lt;ref&gt; World Intellectual Property Organization, [http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/doc/ga26_2.doc ''WIPO General Assembly, Twenty-Sixth (12th Extraordinary) Session, Geneva, 25 September to 3 October 2000, Memorandum of the Director General''], WO/GA/26/2, 26 July 2000. &lt;/ref&gt;
