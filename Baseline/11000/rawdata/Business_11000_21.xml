      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8699">'''Academic Health Science Networks''' (AHSNs) are membership organisations within the [[National Health Service|NHS in England]]. They were created in May 2013 with the aim of bringing together health services, and academic and industry members. Their stated purpose is to improve patient outcomes and generate economic benefits for the UK by promoting and encouraging the adoption of innovation in healthcare.  It is too early to judge the extent to which they are effective in performing their role.

== Background and history ==

A report in 2008 by Lord [[Ara Darzi]]&lt;ref name ="NextStage"&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm74/7432/7432.pdf High Quality Care for All: NHS Next Stage Review, Department of Health, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the NHS was poor at innovating, and suggested wider collaboration between industry, education and all aspects of healthcare.  The NHS is one of the world's largest employers&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17429786 | title= Which is the world's largest employer? | date = 20 March 2012 | publisher=BBC | accessdate = 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the UK's spending on healthcare at over £140b in 2010 or 9.6% of national GDP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/expenditure-on-healthcare-in-the-uk/2011/art-expenditure-on-healthcare-in-the-uk-2011.html#tab-Key-points | title = Expenditure on Healthcare in the UK: 2011 | publisher = Office for National Statistics | accessdate = 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a key component of the national economy.  There is a generally recognised need to improve the NHS's ability to identify and adopt innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Academic Health Sciences Networks in England, David Fish, The Lancet, Volume 381, Issue 9882, Pages e18 - e19, 8 June 2013, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60866-6&lt;/ref&gt;

AHSNs were first proposed by name in the report Innovation Health and Wealth &lt;ref name="Innovation"&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_134597.pdf Innovation Health and Wealth: Accelerating Adoption and Diffusion in the NHS, Department of Health, 5 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Sir David Nicholson]], Chief Executive of [[NHS England]], and launched by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Cameron]]. A request for expressions of interest was issued in June 2012&lt;ref name ="Expressions"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/126785/Academic-Health-Science-Networks-21062012-gw-17626-PDF-229K.pdf.pdf Academic Health Science Networks: expressions of interest, Department of Health, 20 June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and, on 23 May 2013, the 15 designated AHSNs were formally announced.&lt;ref name="HSJdesig"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/technology/nhs-england-gives-green-light-on-70m-innovation-networks-project/5059011.article| title= NHS England Gives Green Light on £70m Innovation Networks Project | publisher = Health Service Journal | accessdate = 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Designation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/2013/05/23/acc-health-sci-ntwrk/ | title = AHSN Designation Announcement| publisher = NHS England | accessdate = 11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are regional, with non-overlapping territories covering the whole of England.  &lt;!--The 15 AHSNs are:

* [http://www.yhahsn.org.uk/ Yorkshire and Humber]
--&gt;

AHSNs take their place in the "fragmented cluttered and confusing"&lt;ref name="Innovation" /&gt; landscape of NHS innovation. As part of the "Sunset Review&lt;ref name="Innovation" /&gt;" a number of initiatives closed in 2013 including the NHS National Innovation Centre, NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement, and Health Innovation and Education Clusters (HIECs).  There is still a range of currently active initiatives including NHS Innovation Hubs, NHS Supply Chain Innovation and NHS Improvement.

== Funding ==

Core funding will come from NHS England and work was "in hand to identify the funding" when expressions of interest were invited.&lt;ref name="Expressions" /&gt; A briefing paper&lt;ref name="Briefing"&gt;[http://www.nhsconfed.org/Publications/Documents/hsrn_briefing_246.pdf Academic Health Science Networks: Engaging with Improvement, NHS Confederation, June 2012]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; assumed funding to be in the region of £2 per head of population served.  With a population averaging 3m people, a typical AHSN might have expected roughly £6m per AHSN per year.  These figures reflect early expectations but were neither clarified nor confirmed with the designation announcement.

When contracts were signed with NHS England in November 2013, the 15 AHSNs shared around £60 million of funding.

== Operation and activity ==

Although their purpose is clear, the structure and approach of individual AHSNs is a matter for local decision.  This is apparent in the contrasting approaches taken and the variety of opinions expressed by network founders.&lt;ref name="conversations"&gt;{{cite news   |url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/apr/26/academic-health-science-networks-role |title= Academic Health Science Networks: their role and development |publisher =The Guardian, 26 April 2013| accessdate= 21 June 2013 |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Johnson |date=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As membership organisations, AHSNs do not have any direct authority over their members, but Innovation Health and Wealth&lt;ref name="Innovation" /&gt; states: "all NHS organisations will aspire to be affiliated to their local AHSN where the AHSN will operate as a gateway for the NHS on innovation and working with the life sciences industry on the evaluation, commercialisation and rapid adoption of health technologies". They will be seen to be successful if and only if they can demonstrably improve the rate of adoption of medical technologies and [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/jul/01/2013-watershed-year-telehealth | title= Why 2013 Could Turn Out to be a Watershed Year for Telehealth | publisher=The Guardian, 1 July 2013 | accessdate= 2 July 2013 | location=London | first=Claire | last=Medd | date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014 it emerged that NHS England’s 2014-15 business plan, showed that AHSNs would receive £53.6m this financial year, a 5 per cent cut on last year’s budget. However, it represents a larger 23 per cent cut on the £70m NHS England announced in May 2013. A senior AHSN figure told the [[Health Service Journal]] that NHS England risked “castrating” the programme by cutting the budget and by a perceived lack of promotion in the networks. “They are trying to save a comparatively small amount of money [by cutting the budget] but in doing so they risk castrating the AHSNs.Commissioners are not going to sign up to us if they are thinking that we are not going to be around in two years’ time.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Innovation network could slip into ‘self-defeating spiral’|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/innovation/innovation-network-could-slip-into-self-defeating-spiral/5069|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Legal initial situation ===
Until introduction of ADHGB German commercial law reflected the political splintering of Germany.

==== Preußisches Allgemeines Landrecht ====
The [[General state laws for the Prussian states|Preußisches Allgemeines Landrecht]] (ALR) of 1794 (English ''Prussian General Land Law'') applied to Prussian state territory.
Legal provisions for burgher classes („Bürgerstände“) could be found in Eighth Title (''Achter Titel''). This comprised rules for craftsmen (''Handwerker'') (§§&amp;nbsp;179 to 400) in addition to these for artists and fabricants (''Künstler und Fabrikanten'') (§§&amp;nbsp;401 to 423) and for merchants (§§&amp;nbsp;475 to 712).
Here §§&amp;nbsp;475 bis 496 ALR defined characteristics of a merchant. §§&amp;nbsp;497 bis 545 ALR affected factors and [[dispatcher]]s (''Faktoren und Disponenten'') whereby [[procuration]] (''Prokura),'' a special power of attorney, could be found in §§&amp;nbsp;498 et seq. ALR.

§§&amp;nbsp;546 to 553 ALR dealt with merchant assistant and apprentices (''Handlungsdienern und Lehrlingen''), §§&amp;nbsp;562 to 613 ALR with trading books (''Handelsbücher'') and §§&amp;nbsp;614 to 683 ALR with companies (''Handlungsgesellschaften'').

==== Code de commerce ====
In areas west of the Rhine and in [[Baden]] (as an annex to Badisches Landrecht (engl. ''Baden Land Law'') of 1810&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Hartmut Oetker, in:  Claus-Wilhelm Canaris, Mathias Habersack, Carsten Schäfer (Hrsg.) ''Staub HGB'', Bd. 1, 5. Aufl., 2009, Einleitung Rz. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;) French Code de commerce of 1808 ruled.

==== Particular law und Common law ====
Apart from that Particular law (''Patrikularrecht'') or subsidiary Common law, here [[Jus commune|ius commune]], (''Gemeines Recht'') were applied.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Thomas Henne: Handelsgesetzbuch, in: Albrecht Cordes, Heiner Lück, Dieter Werkmüller (Hrsg.), ''Handwörterbuch zur deutschen Rechtsgeschichte'', www.HRGdigital.de/HRG.handelsgesetzbuch.igital (21. November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Draft of 1849 ===
Preliminary works for ADHGB can be traced back to 1848/49. 
Already [[Paulskirche Constitution]] of 28 March 1849 provided in § 64 inter alia establishing a General Commercial Code. On 2 December 1848 a commission had started preparations previously.

In March 1849 finally the „Entwurf eines allgemeinen Handelsgesetzbuches für Deutschland“ (Draft of a general commercial code for Germany)&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Theodor Baums: ''Entwurf eines allgemeinen Handelsgesetzbuches für Deutschland (1848/1849)'', Heidelberg 1982, p. 59 ff.; [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10290733_00007.html Entwurf eines allgemeinen Handelsgesetzbuches für Deutschland, Frankfurt a.M. 1849.]&lt;/ref&gt; was presented. 
After the Prussian King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm IV]] had rejected the imperial crown, that he was offered on 4 April 1849, the constitutional project miscarried. In the same year Commission dissolved.

=== The ADHGB===

==== Nuremberg HGB-Commission ====
On a proposal from the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] the [[Federal Convention (German Confederation)|Federal Convention]] (''Bundesversammlung'' also ''Bundestag'') of the [[German Confederation]] establish a commission, that should elaborate a commercial code. That was 21 February 1856. [[Maximilian II of Bavaria|King Maximilian II Joseph of Bavaria]] is said to have motivated the project in person.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Christoph Bergfeld: ''Preußen und das Allgemeine Deutsche Handelsgesetzbuch'', in: Ius Commune, Bd. XIV (1987), . 101 (107) Fn. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Prussian deputy for the [[Federal Convention (German Confederation)|Federal Convention]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] thereby voted not against the application against, what contravene with the instruction form the Prussian Prime Minister [[Otto Theodor von Manteuffel]] &lt;ref&gt;('''German''') ibid., p. 101 (108).&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the suggestion of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] not Frankfurt am Main, Federal Assembly's official seat, but the ancient trading town Nuremberg was chosen as conference venue.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') ibid. p. 101 (109).&lt;/ref&gt; So the working group should go down in history as Nuremberg HGB-Commission (''Nürnberger HGB-Kommission'').&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Cf. only Karsten Schmidt, in: Karsten Schmdit, ''Münchener Kommentar zum HGB'', 3. Auflage, München 2010, Vorbemerkungen zu §&amp;nbsp;1 Rz. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission presided by the Bavarian Ministry of Justice Friedrich von Ringelmann was in session as of January 1857. Also numerous merchants belonged to the commission.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Christoph Bergfeld: ''Preußen und das Allgemeine Deutsche Handelsgesetzbuch'', in: Ius Commune, Bd. XIV (1987), p. 101 (110).&lt;/ref&gt; 
German mercantile community and jurists thereby pronounced against Code de commerce as a model for ADHGB, because it was pre-industrial characterized and thus been overtaken by circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Ibid., p. 101 (108 et seq.).&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead a Prussian draft war favoured as a working basis.

==== Resolution on ADHGB ====
On 31 May 1861 this "Nuremberg Draft" (''„Nürnberger Entwurf“'')&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Gerhard Köbler: ''Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte – Ein systematischer Grundriss'', 6. Aufl., München 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; of an Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch (ADHGB) was recommended to be introduced in the individual states by the General Assembly of the German Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Hartmut Oetker, in:  Claus-Wilhelm Canaris, Mathias Habersack, Carsten Schäfer (Hrsg.) ''Staub HGB'', Bd. 1, 5. Aufl., 2009, Einleitung Rz. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1861 ADHGB apllied in German Confederation´s member states as inentical right. Some federal states, like the Free City of [[Hamburg]], even declared ADHGB applicable for legal transactions (''Rechtsgeschäfte'') without merchant participation.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Christoph Bergfeld: ''Preußen und das Allgemeine Deutsche Handelsgesetzbuch'', in: Ius Commune, Bd. XIV (1987), p. 101 (113).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development after 1866 ===
[[German Confederation]] was dissolved in Augsburg on 23 August 1866. ADHGB persisted in the former federal states.

==== Germany ====
[[File:Norddeutsches Bundesgesetzblatt 1869 032 379.jpg|thumbnail|right|Announcement for the North German Confederation (1869)]]
[[North German Confederation]] took over ADHGB by federal act (''Bundesgesetz'') on 5 June 1869.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''')[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesetz,_betreffend_die_Einf%C3%BChrung_der_Allgemeinen_Deutschen_Wechsel-Ordnung,_der_N%C3%BCrnberger_Wechsel-Novellen_und_des_Allgemeinen_Deutschen_Handelsgesetzbuches_als_Bundesgesetze Bundesgesetzblatt of North German Confederation 1869 p. 379 - 381.]&lt;/ref&gt; ADHGB remained in force in [[German Empire]] in accordance with Imperial Act (Reichsgesetz) of 16 April 1871.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Reichsgesetzblatt 1871, p. 63; The Act of 22 April 1871 ordered that for the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], Reichsgesetzblatt 1871, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme court for the interpretation of ADHGB was Reichoberhandelsgericht (ROHG, English ''Imperial Higher Commercial Court'', until 1871 Bundesoberhandelsgericht, English ''Federal Higher Commercial Court"), that later was merged in [[Reichsgericht]] (english ''Imperial Court of Justice'').
ADHGB was replaced in German Empire by the [[Handelsgesetzbuch]] (HGB, english ''Commercial Code''), that was legislated on 10 May 1897. The HGB came into force together with the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)]] on 1 January 1900.

==== Austria ====
The ADHGB was introduced as Allgemeines Handelsgesetzbuch (AHGB) (english General Commercial Code) in the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] on 1863(österreichisches Reichsgesetzblatt 1/1863). After establishment of the [[Austria|Republic of Austria]] it was applied until the annexation to the German Realm on 13 Märch 1938. Then it was gradually replaced by the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB).

==== Liechtenstein ====
The Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch (ADHGB) was assumed by the [[Liechtenstein|Principality of Liechtenstein]] by the act of 16 Septembre 1865. To the present day its binding law.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Kundmachung vom 21. Oktober 1997 des Allgemeinen deutschen Handelsgesetzbuches, [https://www.gesetze.li/lilexprod/ifshowpdf.jsp?lgblid=1997193000&amp;version=2&amp;signed=n&amp;tablesel=0 LGBl. 1997 Nr. 193]. The ADHGB was originally announced by the act of 16 Septembre 1865, Landesgesetzblatt 10/1865&lt;/ref&gt;
Large parts however were replaced by the Personen- und Gesellschaftsrecht (PGR, english ''Personal and Corporation Law'') on 19 February 1926. The ADHGB has still practical significance for the sectors procurators (''Prokuristen''), authorized representative (''Handlungsbevollmächtigte''), commercial brokers (''Handelsmäkler'') and trading activities (''Handelsgeschäfte'').&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Elisabeth Berger: ''Rezeption im liechtensteinischen Privatrecht unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des ABGB'', 2. Aufl., Wien 2011, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
With its basic concept&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Thomas Henne: Handelsgesetzbuch, in: Albrecht Cordes, Heiner Lück, Dieter Werkmüller (Hrsg.), ''Handwörterbuch zur deutschen Rechtsgeschichte'', www.HRGdigital.de/HRG.handelsgesetzbuch.igital (21. November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; ADHGB pursues preponderantly an objektive system represented by [[Levin Goldschmidt]], that defines merchant (Kaufmann) objektive by means of  legally standardized trading activities (Handelsgeschäfte). Orientation on professional conduct according to [[Johann Heinrich Thöl]] was clearly rejected.

== Reception ==

=== Germany ===
In the absence of a "Allgemeines Deutsches Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch" (english ''General German Civil Code'') ADHGB included also general rules for representation (''Stellvertretung'') (Art. 52-56 ADHGB), fulfilling (''Erfüllung'') (Art. 324-336 ADHGB) and [[Bill of sale|purchase agreement]] (''Kaufvertrag'') (Art. 337-359 ADHGB), that should be "a landmark template" (''„richtungweisende Vorlage“'') for future [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)]].&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') ''Oetker, Hartmut'', in:  Canaris, Claus-Wilhelm /Habersack, Mathias /Schäfer, Carsten (Hrsg.) Staub HGB, Bd. 1, 5. Aufl., 2009, Rz. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
The German jurist Hermann Rösler authored a draft of a commercial code for Japan in 1884, that was influenced by the ADHGB.&lt;ref&gt;Kon Sik Kim: Codification in East Asia. Commercial Law, in Wen-Yeu Wang: ''Codification in East Asia. Selected Papers from the 2nd IACL Thematic Conference,'' Cham 2014, p. 64; Wilhelm Röhl: ''History Of Law In Japan Since 1868'', Leiden 2005, p. 355 seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===
Turkish law also was shaped by the ADHGB.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Thomas Henne: Handelsgesetzbuch, in: Albrecht Cordes, Heiner Lück, Dieter Werkmüller (Hrsg.), ''Handwörterbuch zur deutschen Rechtsgeschichte'', www.HRGdigital.de/HRG.handelsgesetzbuch.igital (21. November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluations and comments ==
For [[Levin Goldschmidt]]&lt;ref&gt;Levin Goldschmidt quoted from ('''German''') Karl-Otto Scherner: Handelsrecht, in: Albrecht Cordes, Heiner Lück, Dieter Werkmüller (Hrsg.), ''Handwörterbuch zur deutschen Rechtsgeschichte'', www.HRGdigital.de/HRG.handelsrecht (21. November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; ADHGB was "the most thoroughly and best of existing European Commercial Codes" (''„gründlichste und beste unter den vorhandenen Europäischen Handelsgesetzbüchern“'').

'''Annual leave''' is [[paid time off]] work granted by [[employer]]s to [[employee]]s to be used for whatever the employee wishes. Depending on the employer's policies, differing number of days may be offered, and the employee may be required to give a certain amount of advance notice, may have to coordinate with the employer to be sure that staffing is adequately covered during the employee's absence, and other requirements may have to be met. The vast majority of countries today mandate a minimum amount of paid annual leave by law, though the United States is a notable exception in mandating no minimum paid leave and treating it as a perk rather than a right.

Most countries around the world have [[labour law]]s that mandate employers give a certain number of paid time-off days per year to workers. Canada requires at least two weeks (and at least three weeks for most workers in [[Saskatchewan]]);{{sfn|Ray|Sanes|Schmitt|2013|p=10}} in the European Union the countries can set freely the minimum, but it has to be at least equivalent to 4 working weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/104/EC |journal=Official Journal of the European Communities |date=23 November 1993 |volume=L 307 |page=20 |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31993L0104&amp;from=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-time employment in Australia requires twenty annual leave days a year.{{sfn|Ray|Schmitt|2007|pp=1–3, 8}} US law does not require employers to grant any vacation or holidays, and about 25 per cent of all employees receive no paid vacation time or paid holidays.{{sfn|Ray|Schmitt|2007|p=1}}

According to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the United States, the average paid holidays for full-time employees in small private establishments in 1996 was 7.6 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=15 June 1998 |title=Employee Benefits in Small Private Industry Establishments, 1996 |url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ebs.nws.htm |location=Washington |publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the US Armed Forces earn 30 vacation days a year, not including national holidays.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Although the law does not mandate vacation time, many employers nonetheless offer paid vacation, typically around 10 work days in the private sector,{{sfn|Ray|Sanes|Schmitt|2013|p=1}} to attract employees. Under US federal law, employers usually must compensate terminated employees for accrued but unused vacation time. Additionally, many American employers provide paid days off for national holidays, such as [[Christmas]], [[New Year's Day]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], [[Memorial Day]], [[Labor Day]], and [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].

Some countries, such as [[Denmark]] and [[Italy]], or particular companies may mandate summer holidays in specific periods.

[[Argentina]] has different labour laws, for public employment and private employment. Public employees, have between a minimum of 21 days paid to 45 days paid for vacations (including holidays and weekends). Private employees have since 14 paid days to 28 paid days (including holidays and weekends). In both cases is always relying on the years of service. The more years the worker has the more days of paid vacation they will have.

===Consecutive holidays===
Consecutive holidays refers to holidays that occur in a group without [[working day]]s in between. In the late 1990s, the [[Japan]]ese government passed a law that increased the likelihood of consecutive holidays by moving holidays from fixed days to a relative position in a month, such as the second Monday.

'''Bachem''' is a  contract manufacturing organization headquartered in [[Bubendorf]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Bachem Holding AG|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=760034|publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachem specializes in the manufacturing of [[peptides]] and complex organic molecules such as [[active pharmaceutical ingredients]].  In addition, biochemicals for research purposes and manufacturing processes are developed.  The firm provides a number of products and services to the pharmaceutical and [[biology|life science]] industries, including [[organic chemistry|organic]], [[fine chemicals|fine]] and performance chemicals, custom manufacturing of [[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[chemical synthesis]] capabilities and new chemical entities, and services for the [[bioscience]] sector.&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt;

==History&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bachem - History|url=http://www.bachem.com/company/history/|publisher=Bachem}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
In 1971, Peter Grogg founded Bachem Feinchemikalien AG with two employees in Liestal near Basel with the focus on peptide synthesis.  In 1977, Bachem moved with eight employees to nearby Bubendorf, and, in 1978, it manufactured, for the first time, peptides for use in medicine under cGMP guidelines.  Between 1981 and 1991 Bachem tripled its production capacity and built an administration building, and in 1995, facilities were further expanded including the quality control department to a total of 168'000 sq. ft. (15'600 m2).

Expansion into markets outside Europe began with the establishment of Bachem Bioscience, Inc. in Philadelphia, USA in 1987.  To strengthen its presence in Europe, Bachem opened sales and marketing centers in Germany in 1988 and in France in 1993.  In 1996 it acquired its largest competitor, Bachem, Inc., together with its subsidiaries in Germany and the United Kingdom. In June 1998, following a very successful IPO, Bachem's shares began to be publicly traded on the Swiss Stock Exchange.  In 1999 and 2000, a new administration building and a further production facility were respectively opened at the Bubendorf site.

With the acquisition of the San Carlos, California based Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. and its affiliate Peninsula Laboratories Ltd., United Kingdom in December 1999, Bachem extended its strong position in therapeutically active peptides into immunology, a domain with strong future promise.  In August 2000, Peninsula Laboratories Europe Ltd. and Bachem (UK) Ltd. merged to a single Bachem group affiliated company in the United Kingdom.
The acquisition of Sochinaz SA, a Swiss-based specialized manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients in 2001, strengthened Bachem's expertise and once again expanded its manufacturing capabilities.

Reorganization of distribution was carried out in Germany and France as a result of the positive experiences gained with the realignment of the sales and marketing organization in the USA.  As a result the subsidiary in France was closed at the end of 2002.  The subsidiary in Germany was relocated from Heidelberg to Weil am Rhein, was renamed Bachem Distribution Services GmbH and is now responsible for all customers in the European Union.
In 2003, a holding structure was introduced to align the factual organization of the company with an appropriate legal structure and to support management structure adjustments, given by continued company growth requirements.  In 2007, Bachem acquired the Clinalfa® brand for Bachem's ready-to-use clinical trial materials and related services.  In 2010, Bachem commenced the partnership with Atheris laboratories offering the Melusine® range of research products for lead generation of new pharmaceutical candidates.  In 2011, Bachem celebrated its 40th year as a producer of research ingredients and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for the pharmaceutical industry.

In 2013, Bachem and GlyTech Inc. teamed up to offer [[glycosylated]] peptides in their product pipelines. Bachem and affiliate were conducting groundbreaking work on [[interferon beta-1a]] and to manufacture glycosylated [[somatostatin]] analogues by chemical synthesis.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.glytech.jp/en/ Glytech Inc. News &amp; Topics]. Retrieved 19 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015, Bachem acquired American Peptide Company, a mid-sized biotech establishment in [[Sunnyvale]] CA, not far from Bachem's US facility in Torrance, expanding the firm's GMP manufacturing and R&amp;D capabilities for the US and international markets.&lt;ref&gt; R.Mullin (2015).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9786">The '''braking test track''' is a fundamental element of the vehicle industry proving grounds, designed for conducting vehicle braking system operability and efficiency tests under various braking circumstances. Such types of tests are highly significant in regard to [[road safety]]. Testing is an indispensable step prior to manufacturing newly developed braking systems and enabling their utilization under real traffic circumstances. The effects of all factors other than human factors influencing the process of braking can be thoroughly tested in a testing environment designed to this end, i.e. on a braking test track.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/products-and-services/mobility-services/proving-grounds/proving-ground-boxberg/|title=Proving ground Boxberg|website=www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://atppbg.de/en/downloads/category/1-brochure-printed-materials|title=ATP Automotive Testing Papenburg GmbH - Downloads - Brochure / Printed materials|website=atppbg.de|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atc-aldenhoven.de/en/tracks.html|title=Overview|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.applusidiada.com/images/1340230149835-image.jpg?blobheader=application%2Fpdf|title=Applus Idiada|last=|first=|date=|website=applusidiada.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=06-02-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and characteristics ==
Several lanes enabling braking under different material characteristic conditions are necessary for testing as many of the circumstances that directly influence the braking effect as possible. Consequently, most of the traditional or so-called classic test tracks have several (5 to 8) differently paved braking lanes. Most test tracks attempt to provide surfaces with both higher and lower grip coefficients for the testing and developing companies. Asphalt (with a higher and lower coefficient), basalt, ceramic and concrete are frequently used materials for surface paving. Certain test tracks even have chequer surfaces with alternative tiles of higher and lower coefficients, increasing the challenge for intelligent braking systems.

The number of settings provided by the available surfaces may be doubled by wetting them, for which mostly a 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm thick water coating is used. So-called [[aquaplaning]] lanes are also frequently provided for testers. The triggering of the phenomenon of [[aquaplaning]], however, requires the provision of higher water levels. It is also important to provide for the collecting of the water spilled onto the wettable braking surfaces, which is in most cases managed by using ditches.

In order to enable the testing of extreme braking situations, e.g. emergency braking from high speed, it is necessary for the lanes to be designed with a length of typically 150–250 m. Additionally acceleration lanes with the appropriate length are also required for reaching high speed, which enable even [[heavy-duty vehicle]]s to reach 100&amp;nbsp;km/h. This way it becomes possible to test the braking systems of [[truck]]s and [[bus]]es.

An adequate amount of data and test results are necessary to draw the conclusions, which can be achieved by repeated tests. In order to perform repeated tests fluently and safely it is necessary to design a route separated from the test (braking) zone that allows the test vehicle to return to the beginning of the acceleration lane quickly and safely.

== Goal and utilization ==

=== The significance of braking system testing ===
The braking systems of vehicles, especially those of motorised vehicles play a highly important role in [[road safety]]. The activation of the braking systems decelerates and stops the vehicle (or keeps it in an immobile standing position, e.g. with the [[Hand brake|handbrake]]). Depending on the country, different national or occasionally international regulations apply to braking systems. The braking effect of an installed system depends on several factors, e.g. on the human factors (routine, health condition and mental state of the driver), technical factors (structure of the system, technical condition of the individual components), weather (e.g. wet, icy surfaces), and the condition and quality of the pavement. Braking test tracks enable the testing of such technical, meteorological and pavement factors.

=== Traditional tests ===
Most traditional test tracks are equipped with surfaces suitable for testing [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], ATC, [[Electronic stability program|ESP]] systems as well as brakeforce intervention systems connected to all braking systems. At the same time such surfaces are also suitable for the testing of other active systems.

=== Automatic Emergency Braking System tests ===
The number of necessary vehicle industry tests has multiplied with the implementation of [[Advanced driver-assistance systems|ADAS]] (advanced driver-assistance systems). The combining of several functions has made the planned tests more complex too. Recently an increasing number of cars are equipped with emergency braking systems. Such systems need to be capable of sensing an obstacle which triggers the command that initiates the braking; at the same time, however, the appropriate intervention (braking) is also indispensable. Protocols for such tests, which all developers strive to comply with ([[Euro NCAP]] active safety system tests), already exist; these tests are conducted, however, under highly limited, well predefined circumstances. It is practical to carry out such tests on several different surfaces.

=== Platooning tests ===
[[Platoon (automobile)|Platooning]] tests, i.e. testing vehicles advancing in convoy pose a further challenge. A typical situation to be tested is when the first vehicle produces a signal for intervention (which could even be an intervention based on sensing), and then transmits it to the following vehicles, which need to receive and process the signal with the least possible latency, and initiate the necessary intervention.

=== Other tests ===
It is not unusual to use a braking test track for testing the efficiency of the braking system of a vehicle crossing several different lanes angularly.

== Braking test tracks on existing proving grounds ==
Most proving grounds in Europe have braking test tracks. The most well-known examples are the Boxberg Proving Ground constructed by Bosch (Germany), Automotive Testing Papenburg GmbH constructed by [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] (Germany), Applus Idiada (Spain), Aldenhoven Testing Center (Germany). The Zalaegerszeg Test Track currently under construction in Hungary will also feature a braking test track.

=== Boxberg Proving Ground, Boxberg, Germany ===
The braking test track of the Boxberg Proving Ground provides testing opportunities under various grip conditions on its seven lanes differing in quality and grip and its track sections equipped with track wetting functions. The surface of the braking test track is partially shared with one of the acceleration lanes of the dynamic platform.

Available lanes: chequered lane, asphalt, ceramic, basalt (polished), concrete, aquaplaning lane, basalt concrete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Automotive Testing Papenburg GmbH, Papenburg, Germany ===
The 300 m long braking test track of the Papenburg Test Ground provides testing opportunities on eight lanes differing in quality and grip, which can be wetted as preferred; furthermore which are connected through a 280 long and 30 m wide acceleration lane to the oval platform, thus enabling acceleration to higher speeds. The braking test track is closed with a 150 m long asphalt safety surface.

Available lanes: chequered lane, asphalt (100 m aquaplaning lane), mixed basalt &amp; asphalt, basalt (polished), asphalt, concrete, “blue asphalt”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Aldenhoven Testing Center, Aldenhoven, Germany ===
The length of the braking test track at the Aldenhoven Testing Center is 150 m, which contains an asphalt and a ceramic pavement lane. Both lanes are 4 m wide and may be wetted as preferred. The braking test lane is surrounded on both sides by a safety zone. A 200 m access acceleration lane is also part of the braking test track.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Applus Idiada, Spain, Tarragona ===
The braking test track at Applus Idiada is divided into two separate zones.

Zone 1 may be used only by one a vehicle at a time. The surface used for the braking tests is 250 m long and has five lanes with different kinds of pavement. The lanes may be wetted as preferred. The braking test track is closed with a safety area.

Lanes: concrete, basalt, asphalt, ceramic, aquaplaning lane

Zone 2 may be used by two vehicles simultaneously, as there is a dividing area between the two lanes used for braking tests. Both lanes are 250 m long and 5 m wide and are paved with asphalt; one of them, however, is not wettable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Zala ZONE Vehicle Industry Test Track, Zalaegerszeg, Hungary ===
The braking test track under construction at the Zala ZONE Vehicle Industry Test Track is designed for testing ABS, ATC and ESP systems; it has six special, differently paved and lanes, which can be wetted separately by the inbuilt wetting and draining system. Its 700 m acceleration lane and 200 m long braking surface enables the testing of longer combination vehicles as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zalazone.hu/en/|title=Home - ZalaZone|website=ZalaZone|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6245">'''Car of the Year''' (COTY) is a common abbreviation for numerous awards.

The "Car of the Year" phrase is considered to have been introduced by ''Motor Trend'' magazine in 1949 when the new publication named Cadillac as [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automoblog.net/2012/11/14/tesla-model-s-named-car-of-the-year-by-motor-trend/ |title=Powered Up: Tesla Model S Named ‘Car of the Year’ By Motor Trend |first=Chris |last=Nagy |date=14 November 2012 |publisher=automoblog.net |accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine continues its COTY award and has also expanded to separate trophies for [[pickup truck]]s and [[sport utility vehicle]]s (SUVs). 

Other publications and various organizations also have COTY recognitions. These may focus on regional markets, vehicle types, or market segments. An example is the "tow car of the year" in the UK (for pulling [[travel trailer]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.caravanclub.co.uk/news-and-events/awards |title=Awards |publisher=Caravan Club |accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COTY also refers to the [[European Car of the Year]] award selected by a jury of European automotive journalists. Other COTY awards exist across numerous markets such as in [[Australia]] from the automobile magazine ''[[Wheels magazine|Wheels]]'' and the AJAC in [[Canada]].

'''Chin Sophonpanich''' ({{lang-th|ชิน โสภณพนิช}}; {{zh|t=陳弼臣|p=Chén Bìchén}}; 10 November 1908 – 4 January 1988) was a Thai entrepreneur who founded [[Bangkok Bank]] and [[Bangkok Insurance]].

== Biography ==
Chin was born to a [[Thai Chinese|Chinese immigrant]] father from [[Chaoyang, Shantou|Chaoyang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Thailand|pages=282|author=[[Chris Baker (writer)|Chris Baker]], [[Pasuk Phongpaichit]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-81615-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who worked at a sawmill, and a local-born [[Thai Chinese]] mother in [[Thon Buri (district)|Thonburi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bamboo Network: How Expatriate Chinese Entrepreneurs Are Creating a New Economic Superpower in Asia|author=[[Murray Weidenbaum]], Samuel Hughes|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|isbn=0-684-82289-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.wbn.cn/climemodel/news1.asp?id=5492 陈弼臣父子两代 情倾家乡教育] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107004520/http://www.wbn.cn/climemodel/news1.asp?id=5492 |date=2005-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangkok]]. At the age of five years, Chin was sent back to China for education, and upon returning to Thailand at 17, he took up his first job as a manual labourer.

In 1944, Chin founded the Bangkok Bank, which started with only two shophouses. The bank later expanded and diversified its branches into [[Hong Kong]], and Chin lived in Hong Kong from 1957 onwards when Thailand came under the rule of [[Sarit Thanarat]], after he fell out of favour with the former dictator. 

By 1972, the bank was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Chin died at the age of 80 in 1988. He had two wives. With his first wife, Lau Kwei Ying, he had two sons, [[Rabin Sophonpanich]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queengallery.org/en/special.php Founder Donors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317233539/http://www.queengallery.org/en/special.php |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chatri Sophonpanich]]. With his second wife, Boonsri, he had seven children, including Chote Sophonpanich and the [[Khunying]] Chodchoi Sophonpanich ({{zh|c=陳鳳翎}}).

Chatri Sophonpanich served as president of the Bangkok Bank from 1980 to 1992, and his son, Chartsiri Sophonpanich, has been president since 1994.

Rabin Sophonpanich (also known as Robin Chan) has since relocated to [[Hong Kong]] with his family, and his son, [[Bernard Charnwut Chan|Bernard Chan]] later became a local legislator and its Executive Council member.

Chin's daughter-in-law, the [[Khunying]] [[Kalaya Sophonpanich]], wife of Chote Sophonpanich, was the Thai [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]]'s Minister of Science and Technology. On 23 February 2009, she presided over the opening ceremony of the 2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics, ROBIO 2008, held in [[Bangkok, Thailand]].

'''Christina Onassis''' ({{lang-el|Χριστίνα Ωνάση}}; 11 December 1950&amp;nbsp;– 19 November 1988) was an American-born [[Greece|Greek]] businesswoman, socialite, and heiress to the Onassis fortune. She was the only daughter of [[Aristotle Onassis]] and [[Tina Onassis Niarchos]].

==Early life and family==
Christina Onassis, the only daughter of the Greek Argentine shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]] and his first wife, [[Tina Onassis Niarchos]], was born in [[New York City]] at [[LeRoy Sanitarium]]. Her maternal grandfather was [[Stavros G. Livanos]], founder of the Livanos shipping empire. Onassis had an older brother, [[Alexander Onassis|Alexander]]. She and Alexander were raised and educated in [[France]], [[Greece]], and [[England]].&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20100665,00.html|first=Michelle|last=Green|title=Fate's Captive: Dead at 37, Christina Onassis Leaves An Empire and Burdens She Could Never Escape to Her Daughter, Athina|work=People Magazine|volume=30|issue=23|date=5 December 1988|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[Headington School, Oxford|Headington School]] in [[Oxford]] and [[Queen's College, London]] from 1968 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=William|title=All the Pain Money Can Buy: The Life of Christina Onassis|year=2000|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-743-21163-4|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Poor Little Rich Girl – Christina Onassis |journal=Newsweek|year=1975|volume=86|page=349|publisher=Newsweek, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christina's parents divorced in 1960, precipitated by her father's affair with opera singer [[Maria Callas]]. He later married former [[First Lady]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]], widow of President [[John F. Kennedy]], in 1968. Christina and Alexander reportedly distrusted Kennedy and never warmed to her. Christina's mother married [[Stavros Niarchos]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;

Within a 29-month period, Christina lost her entire immediate family. Her brother, Alexander, died in a plane crash in [[Athens]] in 1973 at the age of 24, which devastated the family. Her mother died of a suspected drug overdose in 1974, leaving Christina her $77 million estate. Following Alexander's death, her father's health began to deteriorate, and he died in March 1975. After losing her father, Christina [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounced her U.S. citizenship]] and donated the American portion of her holdings in her father's company to the [[American Hospital of Paris]] (she held dual citizenship in [[Greece]] and [[Argentina]] throughout her life).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Destiny Prevails: My life with Aristotle, Alexander, Christina Onassis and her daughter, Athina'', Paul J. Ioannidis, Livani Publishing, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=saxon&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/20/obituaries/christina-onassis-shipping-magnate-dies-at-37.html|first=Wolfgang|last=Saxon|title=Christina Onassis, Shipping Magnate, Dies at 37|work=The New York Times|date=20 November 1988|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0j00AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nOsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=778,3368363|first=Marlyn|last=Bender|title=Christina gives up U.S. citizenship|date=9 June 1975|work=The Miami News|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Upon Alexander's death, Aristotle Onassis began grooming his daughter to take over the family business. She was sent to New York City to work in his office. After Aristotle's death, she inherited 55% of his fortune, then estimated to be worth $500 million. The remaining 45% funded a foundation established in Alexander's memory, the [[Alexander S. Onassis Foundation]]. After a legal settlement, Jacqueline Onassis received $26 million from the estate. Christina was the focus of her father's attention until his death; he considered her his successor and trained her in the business operations of the Onassis business empire. She carried the mantle of the Onassis shipping empire, successfully running the business after her father's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gage|first=Nicholas|title=The Last Onassis|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/05/athina200505#|publisher=vanityfair.com|page=2|date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christina received considerable media attention for her lavish lifestyle, spending habits, and turbulent personal life. Despite her wealth, she was often unhappy with her frequent weight battles and inability to find lasting love. She went on frequent [[Dieting|crash diets]] and would lose large amounts of weight, but gained it back when she became depressed. Diagnosed with [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] at the age of 30, she was prescribed [[barbiturate]]s, [[amphetamine]]s, and sleeping pills.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; Onassis became addicted and was reportedly hospitalized for overdosing on sleeping pills in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|title=Christina Onassis Dies; Investigation Ordered|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-20/news/mn-495_1_christina-onassis|publisher=latimes.com|date=20 November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Christina Onassis and Sergei Kauzov 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Marriage of Christina Onassis and Sergei Kauzov on 2 August 1978]]
Onassis had four marriages, each ending in divorce. She wed her first husband, real estate developer Joseph Bolker, at age 20 in 1971. Bolker was a divorced father of four, 27 years her senior. Onassis's father reportedly disapproved and pressured her to divorce him. The marriage ended after nine months.&lt;ref name=saxon/&gt;

Her second husband was Greek shipping and banking heir Alexander Andreadis, whom she married shortly after her father's death in 1975. They divorced after 14 months.

Onassis's third husband was Russian shipping agent Sergei Kauzov, whom she married in 1978. They divorced the following year.

Her fourth and final marriage was to French businessman [[Thierry Roussel]] in 1984. Onassis and Roussel had a daughter, [[Athina Onassis|Athina]] (named after Onassis' mother), in 1985.&lt;ref name=saxon/&gt; They divorced after Onassis discovered that Roussel had fathered a child with his long-time mistress, Swedish model Marianne "Gaby" Landhage, during the marriage.&lt;ref name=gage&gt;{{cite web|last=Gage|first=Nicholas|title=The Last Onassis|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/05/athina200505|publisher=vanityfair.com|page=1|date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 19 November 1988, Christina's body was found by her maid in the bathtub of a mansion in [[Buenos Aires]], where she had been staying.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An autopsy found no evidence of suicide, drug overdose or foul play, but found that Onassis had died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] caused by acute [[pulmonary edema]].&lt;ref name=saxon/&gt;&lt;ref name=gage/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT19881121&gt;{{cite news

'''Credit counseling''' (known in the [[United Kingdom]] as '''Debt counselling''') is commonly a process that is used to help individual [[debtor]]s with [[debt settlement]] through education, [[Personal budget|budgeting]] and the use of a variety of tools with the goal to reduce and ultimately eliminate debt.&lt;ref name=FTC&gt;{{cite web|last1=FTC (Federal Trade Commission)|title=For People on Debt Management Plans: A Must-Do List|url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0045-debt-management-plans.pdf|website=FTC.gov|publisher=Federal Trade Commission (United States Government)|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credit counseling is most often done by ''Credit counseling agencies'' that are empowered by contract to act on behalf of the debtor to negotiate with creditors to resolve debt that is beyond a debtor's ability to pay. Some of the agencies are non-profits that charge at no or non-fee rates, while others can be for-profit and include high fees. Regulations on credit counseling and Credit counseling agencies varies by country and sometimes within regions of the countries themselves.&lt;ref name=FTC /&gt; In the United States, individuals filing [[Chapter 13 bankruptcy]] are required to receive counseling.

==Overview==
In the United States, the [[National Foundation for Credit Counseling]] was established in 1951. The modern practice known as ‘‘credit counseling’’ was initiated by creditor banks and credit card companies during the mid-1960s to address the growing volume of personal bankruptcies.&lt;ref name=Subcommittee&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[United States Senate]]|title="Profiteering in a Non-Profit Industry: Abusive Practices in Credit Counseling" a report by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs United States Senate.|url=https://active.nfcc.org/newsroom/presskit/files/PSI_Excerpts.pdf|publisher=United States Government|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=April 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is variation from country to country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of [[home loans]], [[credit card debt]] and [[car finance|car loans]].&lt;ref name=Inc.&gt;{{cite news|last1=Albert-Deitch|first1=Cameron|title=Hey Big Spenders, Where the Biggest Debtors in America Call Home (Interactive)|url=http://www.inc.com/cameron-albert-deitch/state-by-state-consumer-debt-interactive.html|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=Inc.|agency=Interactive by debtconsolidation.com|date=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credit counseling includes an array of services to address consumer debt that is not within the debtor's ability to pay. In addition to education, a popular credit counseling option is the ‘‘[[Debt management plan]]’’ (‘‘DMP’’, known in the United Kingdom as the [[Individual voluntary arrangement]] or "IVA"). In order to initiate a DMP, a consumer would authorize the credit counselor to contact each of the consumer’s unsecured creditors and negotiate with each creditor to lower the consumer’s monthly payment amount, to lower the interest rate, and to waive any outstanding late fees. The debt was then ‘‘consolidated’’ into a single payment.&lt;ref name=FTC /&gt;

Credit counselors can sometimes negotiate [[debt relief]], where part or whole of an individual debt is forgiven. Another option is [[Debt consolidation]], in which one new loan replaces multiple [[unsecured credit]] debts. The [[Debt-snowball method]] is a budgeting approach that addresses debt systematically.

==Criticism==
Global criticism of credit counseling comes primarily from [[Predatory lending|predatory]] practices that take advantage of debtors that are already struggling.&lt;ref name=NYBar /&gt; These practices include failing to meet required standards, charging unlawful or unreasonable fees, failing to provide affordable solutions for consumers, and neglecting to make customers aware of free debt services available elsewhere.&lt;ref name=UKDebt /&gt;

==Regulations by country==
===United States===
In the United States, Credit counseling agencies are loosely regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission (FTC)]], the nation’s consumer protection agency, which can [[Lawsuit|sue]] companies that have deceived consumers about the cost, nature, or benefits of their services.&lt;ref name=FTC /&gt; Different states may regulate DMPs individually and [[State attorney general|Attorneys General]] are empowered to protect state citizens from fraud.&lt;ref name=NYBar&gt;{{cite web|last1=Civil Court Committee, Consumer Affairs COmmittee|first1=([[New York State Bar Association]])|title=Profiteering from Financial Distress: An Examination of the Debt Settlement Industry|url=http://www2.nycbar.org/pdf/report/uploads/DebtSettlementWhitePaperCivilCtConsumerAffairsReportFINAL5.11.12.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two professional associations represent Credit counselors: the [[National Foundation for Credit Counseling]] and the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Find a Good Credit Counseling Service|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/finance/good_credit_counselor.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] is responsible for the regulation of consumer credit and has established a Debt Management Plan Protocol. It can impose fines for improper conduct.&lt;ref name=UKDebt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Judith|title=UK debt management company Harrington Brooks to pay compensation|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0a2643dc-86bb-11e4-8a51-00144feabdc0|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=FT.com Financials|date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
Elsewhere in the European Union, regulation and non-regulation of Credit counseling agencies and their approaches, including DMPs, are widely varied. In [[Sweden]], guidelines for credit counseling are loosely provided by the [[Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees|Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (TCO)]] and creditors are encouraged to use them in lieu of the court system. In [[Ireland]], the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions|Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU)]] provides debt resolution information directly to debtors. In [[Latvia]], a debt advisory company called LAKRA works with employers to assist indebted employees.&lt;ref name=Eurofound&gt;{{cite web|last1=DuBois|first1=Hans|title=Household debt advisory services in the European Union|url=http://eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_files/pubdocs/2011/89/en/1/EF1189EN.pdf|publisher=[[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions|EUROFOUND]]|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing Debt|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/debt.html|website=Financial Consumer Agency of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; advises Canadians to do their research and find a trustworthy organization and a qualified counsellor. They suggest making sure an agency is in good standing with a provincial or national association. They recommend looking carefully at the agency's advertising to see if it sounds too good to be true. Claims or misrepresentations to look out for can include repaying only a fraction of your debt, quickly fixing your credit score, or claiming to be part of a government program. They also suggest consumers inquire about an agency's services, costs, and counsellor qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/debt/debt-help.html|title=Getting help from a credit counsellor|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCAC has also warns Canadians to be careful of companies offering to help them pay off their debt or repair their credit. Things to watch out for include guarantees to solve debt problems and using high interest loans to pay off debt. Some of these companies also claim that they can file a consumer proposal on behalf of a consumer. However, the FCAC points out that only a qualified licensed insolvency trustee can help someone with a consumer proposal or bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/debt/debt-help/alert-debt-credit-repair.html|title=Consumer Alert: What you need to know when getting help to pay off debt or repair your credit|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The [[National Credit Regulator]] (NCR) was established as the regulator under the National Credit Act No. 34 of 2005 (The Act) and is responsible for the regulation of the South African credit industry. It is tasked with carrying out education, research, policy development, registration of industry participants, investigation of complaints, and ensuring the enforcement of the Act. The NCR is also tasked with the registration of credit providers, credit bureau and debt counsellors; and with the enforcement of compliance with the Act. Debt Counselling was introduced and enforced in 2007. This enabled over-indebted consumers to seek relief in accordance to the National Credit Act.

== Frontier Ventures ==

Frontier Ventures is an investment fund that invests in early-stage Internet businesses globally with a particular focus on businesses with strong network effects.

The fund was officially launched in March, 2012.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fv_about"&gt;[http://www.frontier.ru/en/index.html About Frontier Ventures] - Official web-site of Frontier Ventures&lt;/ref&gt; Frontier Ventures' investment team is based in Cupertino, California (Silicon Valley).

== Dispute with Jim Rogers ==

In 2003, his widely circulated e-mail exchange with the famous global investor [[Jim Rogers]] made Alimov, then a student at Harvard Business School, a prominent figure among businessmen and government officials.&lt;ref name="bne" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autopenhosting.org/futuresoptions/Jim-Rogers-Russia.html E-mail exchange between Jim Rogers and Dmitry Alimov] - Autopen Hosting (Autopenhosting.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute started after Rogers’ lecture at HBS when the co-founder of the [[Quantum Fund]] described Russia as a hopeless place for investors. Alimov wrote an e-mail to Rogers claiming that his statements and facts on Russia were not well-grounded. A long-lasting e-mail exchange that followed was eventually read by Alimov’s fellow-students as well as businessmen and the public around the world. The story was covered by [[The New Yorker]], [[The New York Post]] and other international media.&lt;ref name="ny" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/bull_eye_6JPDyf2mKsvotkGJri8ePJ Bull's Eye] - The New York Post, September 28, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Forbes]] and [[Financial Times]] declared Alimov the winner of this debate after Rogers changed his stance on Russia and became an advisor to the agricultural fund run by Russian state-owned bank [[VTB Capital]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2012/09/20/jim-rogers-newfound-love-for-russia-and-the-gradual-improvement-in-its-image-among-investors/ Jim Rogers' Newfound Love For Russia And The Gradual Improvement In Its Image Among Investors] - Forbes.com, 20.09.2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/09/19/russia-bear-jim-rogers-takes-moscow-bank-job/#axzz26v9h5gAK Veteran Russia bear Jim Rogers takes Moscow job] - FT.com, 19.09.2012&lt;/ref&gt; and an investor in Russian companies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2017/04/07/jim-rogers-invests-in-russias-return-to-agricultural-power-joined-company-board/#445490d43a98 Jim Rogers Invests In Russia's Return To Agricultural Power, Joined Company Board] - Forbes.com, 07.04.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14306">'''Dragomir Janićije Karić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Драгомир Карић; born October 21, 1949}}) is an entrepreneur and politician in [[Serbia]]. A close ally of his younger brother [[Bogoljub Karić]] in both business and politics, he has been a prominent figure in Serbia's business community since the 1980s. He has served in the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] since 2012 as a member of the [[Strength of Serbia Movement]].

==Early life and career==
Karić was born in [[Peć]], [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo and Mehotija]], in what was then the [[People's Republic of Serbia]] in the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]]. He graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]] Faculty of Organizational Sciences in 1972. Karić received a [[Ph.D.]] from the Institute of Agrarian Economics at the Ukrainian Academy of Agronomy Sciences in 1994, was a founder of the International University of Business and Management in Moscow, and holds a number of academic positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otvoreniparlament.rs/poslanik/7879 DRAGOMIR KARIĆ], Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 25 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneur==
The Karić family was one of the richest in Serbia during the 1990s. More recent reports suggest that their wealth and influence, though reduced, remain significant.&lt;ref&gt;"Serb businessman proposes Kosovo conference in Belgrade," ''Associated Press Newswires'', 17 May 1999; "Businessman reportedly wants to return to Serbia to "clear his name" in court," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 18 April 2014 (Source: Vecernje novosti website, Belgrade, in Serbian 14 Apr 14).&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent member of the ''Braća Karić'' (Brothers Karić) group and its affiliated companies, Karić has overseen several business initiatives in [[Russia]], [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;"Yugoslav firm plans participation in Kyrgyzstan dam construction," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European - Economic, 9 March 1999 (Source: Beta news agency, Belgrade, in English 0649 gmt 4 Mar 99); "Serbian firms' building plans in Belarus worth 'several billion euros'," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 30 May 2009 (Source: Politika website, Belgrade, in Serbian 27 May 09); "Young Bosnians find jobs as construction workers in Russia, Azerbaijan," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 4 July 2008 (Source: Slobodna Bosna, Sarajevo, in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian 26 Jun 08 pp 34-37); "Businessman reportedly wants to return to Serbia to "clear his name" in court," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 18 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014, he has played a leading role in the Minsk-Mir project in [[Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;"Construction of Minsk-Mir project to begin in September or October, says head of Minsk city government," ''BelaPAN'', 7 September 2015; "Civil engineering projects Minsk Mir, Mayak Minsk with Serbian investments stay on schedule," ''Belarus: Daily News'', 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International diplomacy==
===NATO bombing of Yugoslavia===
During the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO)'s [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|1999 bombing of Yugoslavia]], Karić attended meetings of [[Russia]]n and [[United States of America|American]] legislators in [[Vienna]] in an effort to bring about a peace deal. American [[United States House of Representatives|representatives]] [[Curt Weldon]] and [[Bernie Sanders]] both described Karić as having played an important role in the discussions, with Sanders noting that he "spoke with [Yugoslav president] [[Slobodan Milošević|Milošević]] repeatedly during the discussions, urging him to take the first step by releasing [three American] [[Prisoner of War|POWs]]." Members of the American team have, in fact, credited him with bringing about the soldiers' release.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. official says Belgrade favorably views outline for Kosovo peace deal," ''Associated Press Newswire'', 2 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Three US Servicemen Freed, Serbs Claim F-16 Shot Down," ''Business Day'', 4 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Serb businessman proposes Kosovo conference in Belgrade," ''Associated Press Newswires'', 17 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiating teams reached an arrangement that would have seen a stop to NATO's bombing campaign, the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from [[Kosovo]], and the introduction of a [[United Nations]] peacekeeping force in the province.&lt;ref&gt;James Ridgeway, "Mondo Washington," ''Village Voice'', 11 May 1999, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the initiative was vetoed by the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarence J. Robinson Jr., "Fusion center concept takes root as Congressional interest waxes," ''Signal'', 1 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Karić also took part in confidential peace talks with [[Germany|German]] [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|foreign affairs minister]] [[Joschka Fischer]] during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Campbell and Stephen Grey, "Papering over the cracks - War in Europe," ''Sunday Times'', 23 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the conclusion of the conflict, Karić negotiated with various authorities in [[Russia]] for the reconstruction of Serbian infrastructure that had been destroyed by NATO bombing.&lt;ref&gt;"Moscow mayor vows to replace bridge in Serbia's Novi Sad," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring Newsfile, 11 June 1999 (Source: ITAR-TASS news agency, Moscow, in English 11 Jun 99).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"NIZHNY NOVGOROD EXPERTS TO HELP REBUILD YUGOSLAV REFINERY," ''Petroleum Report'', 22 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Curt Weldon later sought to bring Karić to the 2003 [[National Prayer Breakfast]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], but the State Department and [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] officials refused him entry on the grounds that he was prohibited from travelling to [[Europe]]an countries.&lt;ref&gt;Al Kamen, "Knees Under the Desk, or the Dash," ''Washington Post'', 10 February 2003, A19.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Weldon has acknowledged receiving unflattering information about the Karić family from American intelligence sources, he later stated that the brothers had been pressured into providing support for the Milošević regime, for which they were unfairly maligned.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fazlollah and John Shiffman, "Karen Weldon's ties to Serbs detailed," ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Representative of Belarus===
Karić was appointed as an envoy of the Belarusian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Serbia in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"Belarus appoints Serbian businessman as trade envoy to Belgrade," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 19 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[President of Belarus|Belarusian president]] [[Alexander Lukashenko]] credited him for "significant personal contribution to the development of trade and economic ties and the strengthening of friendly relations between Belarus and Serbia."&lt;ref&gt;"Lukashenka extends official presidential thanks to representative of Belarusian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Serbia," ''BelaPAN'', 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jovan Vraniškovski===
In August 2005, Karić met with [[Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow]] in a bid to secure the release of [[Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric|Archbishop of Ohrid]] [[Jovan Vraniškovski]] from a prison in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Patriarch Alexy gave his support to Karić's effort.&lt;ref&gt;"Russian patriarch upset by "attempt to deepen split" between Serbia, Macedonia," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 13 August 2005 (Source: BKTV, Belgrade, in Serbian 1355 gmt 13 Aug 05).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Karić joined his brother Bogoljub's Strength of Serbia Movement upon its formation in 2004. The party fielded its own [[electoral list]] for the National Assembly of Serbia in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2007|2007]] and [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2008|2008]] parliamentary elections, and Karić appeared on the party's list both times.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2007.php Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 21. јануара и 8. фебрауара 2007. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (Покрет снага Србије - Богољуб Карић)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 25 August 2017; and [http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2008.php Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 11. маја 2008. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (Покрет СНАГА СРБИЈЕ - Богољуб Карић)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 25 August 2017. Karić received the last (250th) position on the list in 2007 and the first position in 2008. His numerical position on the list was, in any event, irrelevant to his chances of election. From 2000 to 2011, parliamentary mandates were awarded to lists rather than to individual candidates, and it was a common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. See Law on the Election of Representatives, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 35/2000, made available via [http://www.legislationline.org/topics/country/5/topic/6 LegislationOnline], accessed 28 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In each instance, the list failed to cross the [[electoral threshold]] to win representation in the assembly.

The Strength of Serbia Movement contested the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]] as part of the [[Serbian Progressive Party]]'s [[Let's Get Serbia Moving]] list. Karić received the thirty-seventh position and was elected when the alliance won seventy-three mandates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2012.php Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине, 6. мај 2012. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (POKRENIMO SRBIJU - TOMISLAV NIKOLIĆ)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 26 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Progressive Party emerged as the head of a [[coalition government]] after this election, and Karić served as part of its parliamentary majority. The Strength of Serbia Movement's alliance with the Progressive Party continued into the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2014|2014]] and [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2016|2016]] elections; Karić was included on its list both times and was re-elected when the Progressive-led alliance won landslide victories.&lt;ref&gt;Karić received the fifty-ninth position on the list in 2015 and the 104th position in 2016. See [http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2014.php Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 16. и 23. марта 2014. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (ALEKSANDAR VUČIĆ - BUDUĆNOST U KOJU VERUJEMO)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 26 January 2017; and [http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2016-izborne-liste.php Избори за народне посланике 2016. године » Изборне листе (АЛЕКСАНДАР ВУЧИЋ - СРБИЈА ПОБЕЂУЈЕ)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 17 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karić was an observer for the [[Kazakhstani presidential election, 2015|2015 Kazakhstani presidential election]], which he described as having "high democratic standards."&lt;ref&gt;"Nazarbayev announces five "important" measures if reelected," ''EFE News Service'', 26 April 2015. Karić was also an observer for the [[Kazakhstani legislative election, 2016|2016 Kazakhstani legislative election]], which he described as being fair and "like a holiday" for voters. See "Kazakhstanis treat elections like holiday - Serbian observer," Kazinform International News Agency, 20 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He also observed the [[Belarusian presidential election, 2015|2015 Belarusian presidential election]] and the [[Belarusian parliamentary election, 2016|2016 Belarusian parliamentary election]] and reached the same conclusion; on the former occasion, he was quoted as saying that in Belarus, "there is freedom, there is democracy and there is no disorder, which is the most important thing."&lt;ref&gt;"Serbian observer: Belarusians should take pride in this election," ''Belarus: Daily News'', 12 October 2015; "Observer from Serbia expects high turnout in Belarus parliamentary elections," ''Belarus: Daily News'', 9 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karić is a member of the parliamentary committee on the economy, regional development, trade, tourism, and energy; a deputy member of the committee on Kosovo-Metohija; the leader of Serbia's parliamentary friendship groups with [[Belarus]] and [[Tunisia]]; and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with [[Algeria]], [[Argentina]], [[Armenia]], [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[China]], [[Croatia]], [[Cuba]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Egypt]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Mexico]], [[Montenegro]], [[Morocco]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], the countries of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Venezuela]]. Though still a member of the Strength of Serbia Movement, he serves in the Progressive Party's parliamentary group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlament.gov.rs/DRAGOMIR_KARIC+.609.488.html DRAGOMIR KARIC], National Assembly of Serbia, accessed 25 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Financial News Network (FNN)''' is a defunct [[United States|American]] financial and business news [[television network]] that was founded by Rodney Buchser and Dr. Glen H. Taylor, in conjunction with financial management firm [[Merrill Lynch]]. Launched on November 30, 1981, the channel was bought by NBC Inc. in February 1991, and had its operations integrated with rival cable finanical news network, the Consumer News and Business Channel ([[CNBC]]), on May 21, 1991.

==Early history==
===Founding===
Financial News Network (FNN) was co-founded in 1981 by Rodney Buchser (who had been general manager of [[independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[KWHY-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]]) and Dr. Glen H. Taylor. The concept originated in 1975 via [[Newark, New Jersey]]-based WBTB-TV (channel 68, now [[UniMás]] owned-and-operated station [[WFUT-DT]]), an independent station – owned at the time by Blonder-Tongue Broadcasting – which served the New York City market. Registered investment adviser Eugene Inger started hosting a daily [[Wall Street]] programming block on WBTB (then titled ''Wall Street Perspective'') in the fall of 1975. Keith Houser, the station's general manager, negotiated with the New York [[Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] office to get the ticker tape to crawl across the bottom of the screen with a two-hour delay, due to the SEC worrying that it might destabilize the market. The ticker ran across the [[lower thirds|lower third]] of the screen, with stock prices on the top (white) band and index prices on the bottom (blue) band. After the first year of programming the SEC permitted just a twenty-minute delay.&lt;ref&gt;October, 1975 "TV Guide" article &amp; 1976 FCC WBTB-TV Blonder-Tongue Broadcasting "Specialty Programming" Filings&lt;/ref&gt;

KWHY was the first television station on the West Coast to offer daily market news accompanied by a digital [[ticker tape|stock ticker]] "crawl" at the bottom of the screen. This allowed Los Angeles-area stock traders and investors to be able to stay on top of market action without subscribing to an expensive stock quotation service. Computers at that time could not keep up with the full stock feed and as such, the ticker could only show pre-selected stocks, making the system highly manual and clumsy. (The first fully automated stock ticker to appear on television would not be developed until 1996, for now-defunct upstart [[CNNfn]].)

With the earlier launch of [[CNN]] by [[Ted Turner]] blazing the trail, and subsequent to a 1975 ''[[TV Guide]]'' article about Inger's programming success in New York, Taylor and Buchser realized that newly available technology made possible the marriage of KWHY's live market reporting with on-screen quotes and the concept of national news via satellite. The early history of FNN was not highly profitable and, within a few years, Buchser severed his relationship with the fledgling network to launch a financial marketing services firm called FMS Direct. In its early years, FMS Direct produced [[infomercials]] and [[direct response]] television spots which more often than not, ran on FNN, the network he had helped to found. Harvey "Scott" Ellsworth, who was the creator and on-air host of the popular radio program ''Scott's Place'', which aired on Los Angeles radio station [[KFI]] from 1967 until 1974 [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0255315/bio IMDB Bio], was one of FNN's initial anchors.

===Private financing===
FNN received its early private financing from Biotech Capital Corporation, which later changed its name to Infotechnology, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/19/business/biotech-capital-corporation-reports-earnings-for-as-of-june-30.html|title=Biotech Capital Corporation Reports Earnings as of June 30, 1987|work=[[NY Times]]|date=September 19, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotech Capital was also one of the few publicly held "Business Development Companies" - governed by the Business Company Development Act of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(92)90026-N|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/088390269290026N|title=The risk-return attributes of publicly traded venture capital: Implications for investors and public policy|last=Kleiman|first=Robert|journal=Journal of Business Venturings|volume=7 |issue=3 |date=May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, shortly before its Initial Public Offering, led by the Paulson Investment Company, Mr. Taylor, then the Chairman, resigned due to previous legal difficulties.  Mr. Jeremy Wiesen, a professor of business accounting and entrepreneurship at the Stern School of Business, New York University, and formerly with the Securities and Exchange Commission, became Chairman.  The network's principal audience were small investors.

FNN's principal studio was in Santa Monica, California, but it then established operations in New York, on the ground floor of [[Merrill Lynch]]'s headquarters in [[Manhattan]], where passersby could view its broadcast operations.  Merrill Lynch was one of the initial private investors in FNN.

===SCORE===
In 1985, FNN severed ties with its broadcast stations and established a 24-hour [[cable television|cable-exclusive]] feed. At night, it began offering the Cable Sports Network, a venture between the [[Mizlou Television Network]] and Tom Ficara; this was subsequently replaced by [[SCORE (television)|SCORE]], a mini-network that aired sports events and news. Also airing in the overnight hours was Venture, a series of long-form speeches by business leaders, and TelShop, a shop-at-home service.

In the late 1980s, Infotechnology Inc., the New York-based information technology and venture capital company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downhold.org/lowry/bizplan88.html|title=UPI Announces Business Plan - 1988|last=Vesey|first=David|date=1988-03-30
|accessdate=2008-10-21|publisher=''Downholders'' aka: downhold.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (chaired by [[Earl Brian]]) which also owned [[United Press International]], increased its position to 47 percent, and remained one of FNN's largest shareholders until Earl Brian, the CEO of UPI and FNN, was later convicted on fraud charges specific to UPI and FNN.  At its height, FNN was available on 3,500 cable systems, reaching a potential audience of 35 million homes across the country.  FNN moved into newly built modern TV studios and production facilities in the Wang building in Los Angeles and in New York's [[Rockefeller Center]].

==Later history==

===Financial scandals and accounting disputes===
In 1990—only months after beginning its biggest advertising campaign ever—FNN fell prey to two of the main topics of its broadcasts, a financial scandal and an [[accounting]] dispute.  During that year's audit, the network's auditor, [[Deloitte &amp; Touche]], discovered irregularities on the part of its [[chief financial officer]], C. Steven Bolen.  The irregularities were serious enough that Deloitte said its 1989 audit couldn't be relied upon.  FNN launched an internal investigation and discovered what it called evidence of unauthorized payments that Bolen made to himself.  Bolen was fired in October.  In addition, Deloitte wanted FNN to report a $28 million investment into a data system for brokers as an expense.  FNN claimed that this would push its balance sheet so far into the red that it would violate some covenants with its banks, as well as force a default on its [[line of credit]].  FNN replaced Deloitte with [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]], and reported a $72.5 million loss for fiscal 1990.  Needing a major cash infusion to stay in business, FNN put itself up for sale in November.

===Proposed merger with CNBC===
In February 1991, FNN reached a [[handshake agreement]] with a partnership of [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] (Group W) for $90 million. However, just a few days later, FNN agreed to an unexpected $105 million offer from [[NBC]], owner of FNN's then two-year-old rival, [[CNBC]]. NBC had encountered problems getting cable systems to carry CNBC, and intended to merge CNBC with FNN (at the time, CNBC was only in 17 million homes). However, matters were complicated in March when FNN filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]], triggering a lively bidding war for the network.

Group W and Dow Jones raised their offer to $115 million, only to be turned down on a technicality by Bankruptcy Court Judge Francis Conrad; Dow Jones and Group W refused to keep the bidding open until May 31, 1991. NBC then raised its offer to $115 million, which was accepted by Conrad.  That decision, however, was overturned on appeal.

Group W/Dow Jones and CNBC both significantly raised their bids. Group W/Dow Jones offered $167 million, while CNBC offered $154 million.  However, the CNBC bid included more cash, and the Dow Jones/Group W bid included payments that were tied to revenue targets over three years.  Conrad awarded FNN to CNBC, feeling its deal was more realistic.

===Closure===
FNN ceased operations at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on May 21, 1991. CNBC immediately took over FNN's satellite transponder space, more than doubling its audience at one stroke, and branded its business day programming as "CNBC/FNN Daytime" until 1992; CNBC also effectively adopted the "look", news style of FNN as well as incorporated features of FNN's ticker into its own on-screen [[CNBC Ticker|stock ticker]]. While most of FNN's employees were laid off as a consequence of the merger, a select number of FNN anchors and reporters (including [[Bill Griffeth]], [[Ron Insana]], [[Allan Chernoff]] and [[Joe Kernen]]) were retained by CNBC. ([[Sue Herera]], who joined FNN at age 21 and very soon became an anchor, moved to NBC and the brand-new CNBC prior to the demise of FNN; Griffeth and Herera were later reunited at CNBC and co-anchored ''[[Power Lunch]]'' until 2011.)

'''Frédéric Chatillon''' (born 15 February 1968) is a French businessman, and communications adviser to [[Front National]] leader [[Marine Le Pen]].&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/france-right-wing-front-national-party-under-investigation-over-illegal-campaign-financing-1495747 |title=France: Right-wing Front National party under investigation over illegal campaign financing |website=Ibtimes.co.uk |date=2015-04-10 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatillon has been a "friend and confidant" of Le Pen since they were at law school together.&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"/&gt; As a student, he was president of [[Groupe Union Défense]], a far-right student group.

Juges Renaud Van Ruymbeke and Aude Buresi are investigating Chatillon for alleged "illegal financing" of the Front National.&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"/&gt;

French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', as part of the [[Panama Papers]] investigation reported that Chatillon had used his company to set up an international network of shell companies and false invoices.&lt;ref name="euronews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2016/04/05/french-front-national-denies-implication-in-panama-papers/ |title=French Front National denies implication in Panama Papers &amp;#124; euronews, world news |website=Euronews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his Facebook page, Chatillon wrote,  "obviously, the Front National has nothing to do with this private affair, neither directly or indirectly".&lt;ref name="euronews1"/&gt; The complex scheme is alleged to involve companies in complex system involving companies in Hong Kong, Singapore, Panama and the British Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://sputniknews.com/europe/20160405/1037504395/panama-papers-marine-le-pen-close-circle-offshore-schemes.html |title=Marine Le Pen’s Close Circle Could Be Involved in Offshore Schemes |website=Sputniknews.com |date=2015-09-06 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The press allegations have been dismissed by the online news portal Atlantico &lt;ref name="atlantico"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/fn-et-panama-papers-pourauoi-affaire-chatillon-est-petard-mouille-gilles-gaetner-2666563.html|publisher=atlantico.fr|title=FN et Panama papers : pourquoi l'affaire Frédéric Chatillon n'est qu'un pétard mouillé &amp;#124; Atlantico.fr|accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as mere libels and politically oriented news.

'''GRC Envelop''' is a [[risk management]] and [[audit]] management software tool. It enables process control managers, [[auditors]] and risk managers to document and manage their work. The entire tool is web based and is built using the [[Python (programming language) |Python]]/[[Django (web framework) |Django]].  The idea behind GRC Envelop is to help risk managers and auditors with a standard work flow and framework to help capture the process details within an organisation.  This tool is mainly used for internal and external audits focused on financial, IT, HR and sales processes within firms.

Since, this tool has an open source license, it has been listed on a few sites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.crowdreviews.com/grc-envelop | title = GRC Envelop Reviews | accessdate = 5 May 2017 | publisher = Crowd reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://cloudsmallbusinessservice.com/small-business/best-audit-software-for-small-business.html | title = Best Audit Software | accessdate = 2 June 2017 | publisher = Cloud small business service | work = Small Business Software Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.imritechsearch.com/risk-man-capt | title = Risk Man.

Throughout GRC Envelop, the fundamental data structure is as follows:

Processes → Objectives → Risks → Controls → Tests → Findings → Actions

Processes are the basic starting point for the entire tool. Objectives, risks and controls are the most important part that this tool intends to handle. Sometimes this part is also referred to as the risk control matrix in some organisations.

== Features ==
* '''Audit management''': There are three basic areas for the audit management
** Creating audits - Title, description, start and end dates are of some of the features that are available while creating an audit. You can also attached work papers to an Audit. While creating an audit, you can create the processes, the objectives, the risks, the controls and the tests. At each of these levels you can attach work papers too.
** Managing and executing audits - to manage or execute an Audit, the GRC Envelop tool provides a separate workflow to ensure that  auditors can only enter test results and test descriptions. While executing the audit you can create findings and actions. The ability to make control and test assessment is only available in the enterprise version.
** Report generation - the main use of this tool  is to provide easy report generation at the end of an auditing exercise. report generation template can be modified according to your needs. The community version has only one default report generation template. The enterprise version has the ability to have multiple templates.
* '''Risk Management''': The risk management module looks at providing the basic structure for capturing the risk assessment process and documentation. The module is generally based around [[ISO/IEC 27001:2013]].
** Risk register: A register is a collection of risks. Registers may be used to group risks in any manner that is convenient to the firm. A Register report can be generated to show risk register details and an overview of all the risks and stakeholder opinions.
** Risk: A risk is a clear definition of some kind of uncertainty that will affect the firm in future. An uncertainty can occur on many different dimensions, for example, financial risk or reputation risk. There are two aspects to consider when modeling risk, likelihood and impact. Likelihood and Impact are presented as scales in the risk management module.
** The risk owner: any user on the system
** Risk Opinion: The most powerful feature of this module is to generate a survey link which can be sent to all the stakeholders associated with the risk (or risk register). GRC Envelop with capture all the responses on the survey and present the report based on a template. 
** Risk Summary: The risk summary provides an overview of all the responses from the stakeholders to the Risk Manager. There is a table that provides the detailed view of each stakeholder and their responses. The last row of the table has the average values of the likelihood and impacts across all the stakeholders.
** Report generation: reports can be generated based on a changeable template. The template can be designed to aggregate the responses in numerous ways.
** Scales: Scales are to be defined for likelihood and impact of a risk. Each scale has numeric range (minimum and maximum values), the units that the scale deals with and the type of scale (whether Likelihood or Impact scale). Each scale has a title and description too.
* '''Repository''': The repository module is a store or library of processes, objectives, risks, controls and tests. The structure under a process group is the same as that in the audit module. However, there are no findings or actions in the repository module.
* '''Planning''': Planning module helps managers to see on a calendar format the different audits and resources that are planned for a time period. For example, conflicts of assignment of auditors can be quickly recognised

== Users and Roles ==
Restricting users to their areas is an important task  for a tool.  The community version has only one user type ( auditor) whereas the enterprise version has the following seven user types:
* auditor
* audit manager
* risk manager
* repository manager
* internal business user
* external viewer
* system administrator

== Licenses ==
There are two types of licenses that with which GRC Envelop is available:
* Open source [[MIT License | MIT]] license (limited features)&lt;ref name="releases"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.grcenvelop.com/download |title=Downloads |publisher= GRC Envelop |accessdate= 10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enterprise license

== Releases ==
* 17 April 2018 - Release version 0.4.1 (community version)
* 24 October 2017 - Windows installers are made available (community version)
* 1 October 2017 - Release version 1.2.1 (enterprise version)
* 15 January 2017 - Release version 1.1.4 (enterprise version)
* 27 September 2016 - Release version 1.1.4 (enterprise version)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1826">'''Hans Jürgen Teuteberg''' (18 December 1929–14 February 2015) was a German historian, who worked as a professor of social and economic history at the [[University of Münster]] from 1974 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wn-trauer.de/Traueranzeige/Hans-Juergen-Teuteberg-2015-02-14-Hiltrup-15844753|title=Traueranzeige: Hans Jürgen Teuteberg|date=19 February 2015|publisher=[[Westfälische Nachrichten]]|language=German|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teuteberg's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' was his ''History of Industrial Codetermination in Germany'' (1961) or ''Geschichte der Industriellen Mitbestimmung in Deutschland''. This exhaustively examined the legal origins of [[codetermination]] laws, which are found in a majority of EU countries today, that give workers a right to participate in the management of their companies or organisations. Teuteberg traces the roots of codetermination back to [[Carl Degenkolb]]'s proposals at the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] during the [[1848 Revolutions]].

'''Harry Lewiston''' (April 2, 1900 – June 1, 1965; legal name '''Israel Harry Jaffe''') was an American [[showman]], [[freak show]] director, and [[Barker (occupation)|barker]]. He wrote his memoirs under his stage name, published posthumously in 1968 as ''Freak Show Man: the Autobiography of Harry Lewiston, as told to Jerry Holtman''.

__TOC__

==Early life and name change==
Harry Lewiston was born Israel Harry Jaffe in [[Lithuania]] on April 2, 1900, and emigrated to the United States with his family in 1906. The eldest of four siblings, he was raised in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in a strict [[Orthodox Jewish]] household. In 1914, he ran away from home and joined the combined [[Sells Floto Circus]] / [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show]]. He claimed that he was seventeen years old in order to be allowed to stay with the circus, and was renamed "Lewiston," reportedly assigned based on the first major city he worked in, [[Lewiston, Maine]]. While the circus toured the United States, Lewiston worked as a pony groomer and led the animals in the parade, wearing what he called an "Arab costume" as part of that year's "East Meets West" theme.

==World War I==
After [[World War I]] broke out, Lewiston left the circus to enlist. After briefly being attached for training with the [[Canadian Army]] (serial number S-4147), he proceeded to the United Kingdom and was posted to the 40th Battalion of Britain's [[Royal Fusiliers]] in the [[Jewish Legion]] in 1918, serving as a camp cook (regimental number J5873).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Rev. Michael Adler | title = British Jewry Book of Honour | publisher = Caxton Publishing Company, Ltd. | year = 1922 | page = 270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, he mentions serving with [[David Ben-Gurion]], who was in the 38th; those units were stationed together in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and other sites. Throughout the war, he was stationed in [[Taranto, Italy]]; [[Port Said, Egypt]]; [[Al Qantarah El Sharqiyya|Kantara]], [[Egypt]]; [[Lod]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]; and [[Damascus, Syria]]. He noted that while in Damascus he was promoted to lance corporal; his actual service records show him being discharged at the rank of private. After the war ended, he traveled to South Africa to see relatives, as well as [[Rhodesia]], [[India]], and [[Burma]], and eventually shipped back to England. In December 1919, he was officially discharged from military service, sailed from [[Liverpool]] to New York City aboard the ''S.S. Cedric'', and from there returned to Massachusetts.

==Return to the United States==
Lewiston stayed with his family in Worcester for a short period of time, working as a shophand in a [[machine shop]]. Subsequently, he worked various jobs in New York City, then rode the rails to a few towns. In his autobiography, he mentions being arrested for vagrancy in eastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and working on a [[chain gang]] for six days. He then went to [[Cleveland]] and briefly worked in a restaurant.

==Return to circus life==
In 1920, Lewiston went to [[Peru, Indiana]], the winter quarters of five railroad circuses. He was hired by the [[John Robinson Shows]], where he first worked as an [[Usher (occupation)|usher]], then as a "candy butcher," selling [[Concession stand|concessions]] during the show as well as during the concert after the show. After the circus season ended for the winter, he worked as a candy butcher for the [[Union News Company]] on their train the West Point Railroad, which traveled back and forth from [[Atlanta]] to [[Jacksonville]].

In 1921 and 1922, Lewiston worked as a candy butcher and concessions buyer for [[Howes Great London Circus]]. In his autobiography, he mentions that this is when he learned [[Confidence trick|conning]], [[Political corruption#Graft|grafting]], and short-changing techniques. He then wintered with [[Christy Brothers Circus]] in [[Houston]] and worked in their ticket booth the following season, where he began to practice his short-changing technique. Over the next few years, he worked as assistant manager of concessions and as the purchasing agent with [[Gollmar Bros. Circus]], then as a ticket seller for [[Gentry Brothers]] circus, where he dated a [[hoochie coochie]] dancer. Subsequently, he switched to [[Golden Brothers Circus]], where he ran the hamburger stand, sold balloons and novelties, and also served as the substitute announcer. This was his first experience as a [[Barker (occupation)|barker]], referred to as a "talker" in the circus community (though "barker" will be used throughout this entry for ease of understanding).

In early 1925, he worked with the newly formed [[Carolina Minstrels]], an all-[[Black people|black]] troupe based in [[Shelbyville, Kentucky]]. He "strutted downtown at the head of the band to make announcements," and also sold reserved tickets, supervised equipment unloading and setup, and sold prize candy. Later that year, he switched to [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch]] show, where he worked as a ticket seller and sideshow announcer. He worked for Miller Brothers again the following year, but was fired by Joe Miller for short-changing patrons. Lewiston was hired by the [[Boyd and Linderman Shows]] to organize and hire performers and musicians for a [[hoochie coochie]] show. After the touring season ended, he ran a ([[Match fixing|fixed]]) [[roulette|betting wheel]] for [[Pollack's 20 Big Shows]]. In early 1927, he worked as a candy butcher and a fill-in performer for Pat Whale's Traveling Burlesque Show, and then briefly ran a [[brothel]]/[[speakeasy]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] before the police shut it down.

==Marriage and continued circus career==
In fall 1927, Lewiston was hired as the assistant to Arthur Hoffman of the [[Morris and Castle carnival]]. He prepared the opening of [[Singer's Midgets]] show at the [[Mississippi Valley Fair]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]], where he also talked up the show on the [[Midway (fair)|midway]] and sold tickets. It was at this time that he met his future wife Rose Adelstein, who was working with Morris and Castle as a mentalist/fortuneteller under the name "Lady Zindra." Lewiston stayed on with Morris and Castle the following year, and was named the manager of the "Broadway review" show. He began dating Rose, who was also raised as an [[Orthodox Jew]], and they married on November 26, 1928 in [[Cook County, Illinois]]. She took his legal last name and became Rose Jaffe, but continued to perform as a fortune teller under her stage name and was known socially as Rose Lewiston.

In 1929, they both worked for the [[Al G. Barnes Circus]] sideshow. Lewiston worked again as an assistant to Arthur Hoffman, and Rose was a fortune teller. In 1930, they initially worked for the [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus]]. Lewiston managed the sideshow, and Rose was a fortune teller, but the show closed in late August from poor sales due to the [[Great Depression]]. Subsequently, they returned to Morris and Castle, and Lewiston brought several [[circus freaks]] with him. They stayed with Morris and Castel in 1931, and Lewiston and Rose also added a duo mindreading act to their performance at several state fairs. In 1932, he switched to the [[John T. Wortham Carnival]], where he ran the privilege car and managed a fortune telling booth, while Rose returned to fortunetelling for the Al. G. Barnes Circus that season.

==Chicago World's Fair==
In late 1932, Lewiston was hired by sideshow impresario [[Duke Mills]] to organize a freak show for the upcoming "[[Century of Progress]]" [[World's Fair]] in Chicago, and to serve as the barker and managing director. The freak show opened in 1933, but competed poorly with [[Ripley’s Odditorium#Museums|Ripley's Believe It Or Not]] located just down the midway, and closed early after approximately six weeks. Lewiston was soon hired by showmen Lew Dufour and Joe Rogers to design the "Darkest Africa" show on the [[Midway (fair)|Midway]] at the World's Fair, featuring Africans from [[Nigeria]], [[Uganda]], [[Belgian Congo]], and [[French Congo]], and representing the Ubangi, Karamojo, and [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] ethnic groups. Sometimes calling himself "Major Lewiston" or "Captain Lewiston," ranks above what he had earned, he worked as a barker for this show as well:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Another of the lecturers, Capt. Harry Lewiston, formerly of the British army, also spoke of the blacks with genuine respect, adding, apropos of the Nigerians, "You know, those men have eyesight about 300 per cent better than ours. Brave and strong! Look at the play of muscles on those backs! Give me a hundred thousand such men, trained in the use of modern arms, and I'll conquer the moon -- as the German officers used to say." "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Africa Speaks at Fair with Jungle Drums | journal = [[Chicago Daily Tribune]] | author = James O'Donnell Bennett | page = 9 | date = September 18, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That winter, Lewiston and Rose did their duo mindreading act for [[Morris Miller's Traveling Museum]].

==Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus==
While working at the World's Fair in 1933, Lewiston was approached by [[Clyde Ingalls]] and hired to work at [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] the following year. He started in the sideshow ticket booth and the bally stand next to it in 1934, but was promoted as Ingalls' chief assistant on his second day. Lewiston also served as the sideshow pay master, and did special announcements. In his autobiography, he proudly notes that he adapted the circus [[slogan]], coining the phrase "The Greatest Side Show On Earth." While the circus was closed that winter, Lewiston and Rose did their duo mindreading act for the [[Gus Sun]] Circuit.

In 1935, Lewiston started at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus opening at [[Madison Square Garden]], where he directed the "Parade of the Freaks" from the center ring / [[hippodrome]]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' noted that he was "assistant manager of Clyde Ingalls' Side Show" and "has been alternating with latter on big show announcements," meaning that Lewiston was the chief announcer for the main circus acts, not just the sideshow. The magazine also noted that Lewiston would "also present a mental act on road tour," which was a first for that circus; Ringling Bros. had previously distanced itself from acts traditionally associated with defrauding the public. Rose was hired to perform as "Madam Zindra," the circus' first-ever [[mentalist]]. The couple continued to work with this circus for the next two years.

==Harry Lewiston's Traveling Museum==
[[Image:HarryLewiston-freaks.jpg|thumb|400px|Rose Lewiston (far left), Eli Lewiston (child on left), Harry Lewiston (far right), and several of their performing "freaks." Identified performers include Grace McDaniels the "Mule-Faced Woman" (just left of center in the back row; most of her face is hidden) and Tony Marino the sword swallower (in suit and tie).]]
In late 1937, Lewiston and Rose left Ringling Bros. to form their own organization, and brought several circus freaks with them, including [[Grace McDaniels]] the "Mule-Faced Woman," tattooed girl Stella Grassman, Clico the African pygmy, "Human Balloon" Art Hubbell, Disco the magician, Lady Johanna the mentalist, sword swallowers John and Vivian Dunning, and Mel Burkhart the "Anatomical Wonder," who subsequently developed his "Human Blockhead" act while working in this show. Harry Lewiston's Traveling Museum (also known as "Lewiston's Big Circus Sideshow," "World's Fair Freaks," and "Palace of Oddities") featured a variety of sideshow and freak performers, a "girlie show," and [[snakes]]. Additionally, Rose managed several fortune tellers and served as the entire organization's treasurer. They initially paired up with the [[Conklin and Garret Shows]] and performed at venues throughout the United States and Canada, including the [[Canadian National Exhibition]]. Their son Eli was born in Illinois in February 1938, and later became part of the act. He was billed as the baby of two [[Dwarfism|dwarfs]], with advertisements featuring teasers including "Midget Couple and Normal Baby, 10-mo. old son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | journal = [[Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle]] | page = 9D | date = December 11, 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewiston's [[Pythonidae|python]] display, which included a wrestling act, was featured in a full-column article with two more columns of photos in ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Big Python Fed Like Bad Child: 30-Foot Reptile Pumped Full of Eggs and Meat Like Boy Taking Castor Oil | journal = [[The Charlotte Observer]] | date = March 26, 1939 | page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an excerpt of the story even received national attention:
[[Image:HarryLewiston ad.jpg|thumb|left|A typical newspaper ad placed by Harry Lewiston to solicit customers]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[[Charlotte]], N.C., March 25 (AP) - Pete, a thirty-foot python, had a late luncheon today - six months late. Pythons, Harry Lewiston, keeper of the reptile, explained, eat only about once every three months. Pete hurt his throat nine months ago and had to pass up two meals. Today, with an eight-foot rubber hose, he was fed a snack of thirty pounds of chopped meat, fifteen dozen eggs and fifteen pounds of crushed bone. It took eighteen men to hold Pete while they fed him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Python Eats, Six Months Late | journal = [[New York Times]] | date = March 26, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
While Rose ran her "Palace of Knowledge" at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] in 1939 and 1940, Lewiston continued to bring his museum on tour, traveling with organizations including truck carnival [[William Glick Shows]] and [[Johnny J. Jones Carnival]]. He ran an enlarged side show, including his snakes, plus a freak animal show. While traveling with Jones in [[Warren, Pennsylvania]] during the summer of 1940, Lewiston's sword swallower Lady Vivian Dunning was profiled in the local paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jones Carnival Attracts Many On First Night | journal = Warren Times-Mirror ([[Warren, PA]]) | date = July 2, 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewiston also claims to have been the first showman to buy and repurpose the "headless girl" display, transforming it from a simple illusion act to fooling audiences by pretending she was real. He rigged the exhibit with flowing liquids and medical equipment, and created the story of "Olga Hess," who had been decapitated on a train but was kept alive by a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = A.W. Stencell | title = Seeing Is Believing: America's Sideshows | publisher = [[ECW Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn= 1-55022-529-4 | pages = 145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:LewistonEnterprises.jpg|thumb|250px|One of the "Lewiston Enterprises" trucks used to transport the Traveling Museum]]
Throughout the early to mid-1940s, the Museum continued to perform successfully, typically contracting with amusement parks and state fairs during the summers and touring during the winters. In 1941, Harry Lewiston's Traveling Museum joined the Happy Land Shows for summer events in [[Michigan]]. Later that season, they performed at the [[Cambria County]] Fair in [[Ebensburg, Pennsylvania]]. He notes in his autobiography that due to the lewd nature of part of the show, he was sentenced to nine months jail in [[Eastern State Penitentiary]], as were several [[hoochie coochie]] girls, though they were all released after six days. In 1942, while the Museum was in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], Harry Lewiston's performing "stone man" Charles Porter visited a famous local resident also suffering from the disease (likely ''[[Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]]''), and they were profiled in the local paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bedfast By Rare Malady, Pair Hold Short Visit | journal = [[Erie Times-News|Erie Daily Times]] | date = March 10, 1942 | page = 13 &amp; 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HarryLewiston advertisement.jpg|thumb|600px|Harry Lewiston placed this ad in the May 27, 1944 issue of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' to solicit new acts]]
In 1944, while the Museum was installed for a month in [[Pittsburgh]], the two legal guardians of Bobo and Kiki, the show's "[[Microcephaly|pinheads]]," arrived to take the pair back home to Texas. After Rose objected that their contract had not yet expired, a fight broke out, and a local patrolman arrested all five of them. Charges were later dismissed, and the pinheads stayed on with the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Pinheads' Labors Cut, Peace Reigns at 635 | journal = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date = December 13, 1944 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1945, he formed a partnership called Gayer &amp; Lewiston Enterprises with Archie Gayer, operator of Archie's Playland Arcade in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Lewiston and Gayer Form Amusement Partnership | journal = [[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]] | date = October 13, 1945 | page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; They co-ran the Monroe Theatre, and a new annex was added to the back of the arcade, where Lewiston managed a variety of attractions for several years, including an exhibit titled "Crime Does Not Pay," bazaars, and sideshow acts.

[[Image:HarryLewiston-TonyMarino.jpg|thumb|150px|Harry Lewiston and sword swallower Tony Marino]]
In 1947, while working for Lewiston over July 4 weekend, sword swallower Tony Marino "gulped a two-foot length of lighted neon tube, glowed at his appreciative audience, bowed, thereupon went out like a light, [and] was hustled to a hospital for removal of the shattered tube."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Miscellany: Something He Ate | journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = July 7, 1947 | page = 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two weeks of recuperation, including treatment with a [[stomach pump]], [[milk of magnesia]], and [[oatmeal]], Marino continued performing with Lewiston's Museum. In 1950, Lewiston ran sideshows at Edgewater Park, Eastwood Park, and Jefferson Beach in Detroit, the first time that any single show operator had attractions at all three parks at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Edgewater Bows To Upped Gross Despite Strike | journal = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = May 13, 1950 | page = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he leased sideshow and concert operation rights from Mills Bros. for their 32-week season. He noted in his autobiography that he was bitten in the face by a [[South American]] [[boa constrictor]] during this time.

==Post-performance life==
[[Image:Freak Show Man.jpg|thumb|Harry Lewiston's autobiography]]
In the early 1950s, Harry (now calling himself "Jaffe" again) and Rose retired from performance and management life, and moved to Florida, where they invested in several hotel properties. Rose died from cancer in April 1954, and was buried in [[Cook County, Illinois]]. In December 1955, he married a woman named Leona Decker in [[Monroe County, Florida]].

In 1957, the couple moved to the Los Angeles area. Harry's health, especially his eyesight, had deteriorated badly. In his autobiography, he speculates that this might have been due to his heavy drinking. They invested in several properties, and a local daily newspaper ran a profile article of the famous circus man who had bought a hotel. He began writing a weekly column for a paper in [[Fontana, California]]. Concurrently, he started an employment agency, and also worked to help recent [[parole]]es reintegrate into society. His service was lauded by the state board of corrections at a testimonial dinner.

As his health waned, he began working on his memoirs. ''Freak Show Man: the Autobiography of Harry Lewiston, as told to Jerry Holtman'', was published posthumously in 1968 by [[Holloway House]] Publishing Co.

Harry Jaffe died on June 1, 1965 in [[San Bernardino County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = In the Shadows (obituaries) | journal = The Daily Sun (San Bernardino) | page = E-10 | date = June 3, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italy]] the Senior [[Civil Service]] or "la dirigenza"{{Specify|date=January 2017}} is the set of high-ranking executives (“Dirigenti”) who are in charge of the top and middle management of national or local governmental offices.

==Structure==

Senior executives come in two echelons:
*First level: Directors Generals and Chief of Departments (about 400 executives)
*Second level: Directors of Division and heads of peripheral units (about 3,500 executives)
First and second level positions are identified in each ministry. Management responsibilities (supervision of one or more bureaux) determine whether or not someone is an executive, not qualifications. This objective approach shows the exact number of first level executives and permits the development of a database with up-to-date information about age, seniority, gender, level and ministry.
In each ministry, second level positions are further classified accordingly to the responsibilities attached to their offices position, corresponding to the classification adopted by the ministry.

Until October 2002, the Senior Civil Service was meant to be an inter-ministerial homogeneous body, managed by a pool known as the "Ruolo Unico dei Dirigenti" (Uniform Register). The creation of this structure, under the supervision of the Prime Minister, was the backbone of the reform conducted from 1993 till 2001. It was underpinned by a database of jobs and profiles. This tool allowed the government to publish available positions in real time and to establish a labour market for managers. The new text adopted in 2002 has replaced inter-ministerial management of executives with ministerial management. However, the inter-ministerial database and the labour market for first level executives have been kept.

Other public bodies, at national and local level, have their Senior Civil Services. 
Today senior civil servants are grouped into eight different contractual areas: 
* I (Ministries),
* II (Regions and Territorial Autonomies),
* III (National Health Service - administrative),
* IV (National Health Service - medical),
* V (School),
* VI (Fiscal and economic Agencies),
* VII (University),
* VIII (Prime Minister's Office).

Civil servants below executive level have a different contract with separate grading and pay arrangements.

==Recruitment==

Executives are normally recruited through competitions. There are two types of competition:

*the “Fast Stream Programme” (“Corso-Concorso di Formazione Dirigenziale”) is for people who join the Public Administration School ("Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione") after a highly selective national exam, getting immediately a senior rank position. The curriculum of this school covers 30 months of alternating theoretical training - mostly in organisational sociology - and practical training - with many hands-on problems - and internships, often at the [[European Commission]] or other international bodies. On completion, students have to pass another examination. Depending on their results, graduates select their future ministry. The level required for every applicant is a master's. Applicants may be students, Italian or foreign government executives or private sector managers. The Public Administration School actively encourages the emergence of a team spirit in all basic training programmes. Graduates from the first classes have set up an association whose aim is to disseminate innovation in the public administration. Moreover, courses are not only taught by government executives but also by academic researchers, which leads to training partnerships with the universities;
*the second type is a competition organised by the ministries. The prerequisites and training standards are less strict than as for the first type. Candidates who pass this competition follow a programme of almost one year at the Public Administration School.

The executive group is increasingly targeting people from the private sector, universities and regional entities, which currently account for 10% of first level executives and 8% of second level. External candidates can only be hired for a fixed term.

==Appointment and tenure==

The status of executives has been governed by private law since 1998. A collective bargaining agreement (drafted by ARAN, the agency representing the public employer and the executives' trade union), stipulates the management conditions required in individual contracts. In other words, a senior executive signs two contracts:

*a permanent contract with the ministry where he is employed;
*a fixed-term contract with his or her supervisor (secretary-general of the ministry for first level executives, and first level executives for second level executives).

Fixed-term contracts may not exceed three years for first level executives and five years for executives. These contracts set out the remuneration terms. In 2002, the minister was given the job of setting objectives, which must be very precise, reducing the role of the contract. Achievement of the objectives is  nevertheless verified every year based on management control and strategic-planning results.

First level SEOs must be confirmed by every new government, or they lose their position.

==Performance assessment and pay==

The pay structure emphasizes workload, merit and work performance ("pay for performance"), while it has no regard to seniority and length of service.

Pay is based on:
*a fixed wage (60% of the remuneration);
*a portion (20%) linked to the responsibility attached to the position, corresponding to different [[pay grade]]s adopted by the ministry (three levels at the Civil Service Ministry - A-B-C - and five at the Finance Ministry - A-B-C-D-E). This classification is transparent and published by every ministry;
*a percentage (20%) tied to the achievement of objectives.

Executives are subjected to an annual assessment based on achievement of objectives, the adequacy
of actions implemented in compliance with ministerial directives and the information supplied by the
management-control and strategic-assessment service. Executives whose contract expires are assessed to
determine whether to keep and/or to promote them.

Assessment disputes are reviewed by an appeal committee.

When an executive cannot immediately find a new position on termination of a fixed-term contract, he /she keeps part of his fixed wage (60% of the remuneration).

==Promotion and mobility==

An executive's career does not follow a straight line. On completion of a fixed-term contract, he or she can move from a grade C position to a grade A position if assessment results are highly satisfactory. In order to encourage both internal promotion and competition, 40% of the positions of director generals may  be filled by second level executives and 10% by non-government personalities.

When the "rotation" obligation was formally withdrawn in the decree of October 2002 (probably because of shorter contracts), the principle of mobility was preserved. It is supported by an inter-ministerial database with real-time vacancies at every ministry. 
Five-year stints in the private sector and international organisations are also encouraged. These do not affect the executive's career.

==Training and learning==

Continuing education is covered by a directive from 2001 whose purpose was to galvanise training plans, considered a primary tool for leading change at government services. Today, training must be mentioned in resumes published in the interministerial database. The purpose of this requirement is to give  executives a strong incentive to get trained. In order to promote the use of management methodologies and recognition of international concerns in executive actions, executives are now entitled to work for up to five years in the private sector or in international organisations with the right to return to the executive group without loss of prerogatives.

Lastly, line managers can become researchers. A plan launched by the Public Administration School allows interested executives to research useful government modernisation themes under research teachers.

==History==

===Background of reforms===
In February 1993, a founding legislative decree introduced contracts for officials who are now employed under general labour laws.

*a new agency, ARAN, which represents the public employer in negotiations with unions and is responsible for drafting collective bargaining agreements;
*a separation between political responsibilities (indirizzo politico) and administrative responsibilities (responsabilità dirigenziale );
*a new senior management profile: new values, new responsibilities, new management methods;
*the development of an inter-ministerial pool of executives responsible "for the results of the activity managed by their offices and the execution of programmes and projects entrusted to them in the light of productivity objectives and for financial, technical and administrative management results, including organisational and personnel management decisions."

===Reform initiatives and results===
While the decree of 1993 remains the basis for every senior management reform, three periods can be distinguished, each of which raised contractualisation to a new level:

a) 1993 to 1998: the "privatisation" recommended in the working note did not yet apply to first level executives. Their appointments and performance obligations remained the minister's responsibility. Their pay reflected standard scales. Other managers were governed by collective bargaining agreements.

b) 1998 to 2002: collective bargaining agreements became applicable to first level executives. They signed fixed-term contracts under private law specifying objectives and pay. The reform created an inter-ministerial management structure. In principle, all executives should have been lumped in this pool, which the ministries could have sourced for needed profiles. In fact, the ministries remained in control, trying to keep their best executives. Mobility was boosted by the development of an inter-ministerial database with the resumes of all first level executives and a list of available positions updated in real time. The years ahead can be expected to lead gradually to the creation of a genuine labour market.

c) Since October 2002: the appointment and objectives of first level executives are fixed by decree (unilateral public act). Their pay is negotiated bilaterally and laid down in a private contract signed for the term of their appointment (3 years or less). The "ruolo unico dei dirigenti" has made way for ministerial pools but the inter-ministerial database continues to be used. The objective remains to promote mobility.

===Objectives and new competencies===
The newly organised "dirigenza" became the launch pad for the modernisation of public management. The new management of senior management has made the civil service more politically neutral and, as such, has clarified the respective roles of politics and the civil  service. The main purpose of the newly created dirigenza was to remedy the lack of professionalism and the political bias of the hallowed senior public service by fostering a culture of excellence within the government and promoting close relations based on shared principles combining the founding values of the civil service - integrity, neutrality and impartiality - with the more pragmatic qualities demanded from managers. This ethics of accountability remains the cornerstone of all texts adopted since 1993.

'''Jan Å Berggren''' (born June 12, 1946) is a well known [[Swedish people|Swedish]] Real Estate &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jakri.se/&lt;/ref&gt; developer who co-founded Jakri AB in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://gulasidorna.eniro.se/hitta:jakri+ab&lt;/ref&gt; Berggren is best known for his pioneering &lt;ref&gt;http://www.enotes.com/topic/Jakriborg&lt;/ref&gt; new urban village project, [[Jakriborg]] near Lund in [[South Sweden]] or [[Skåne County]]. Jan Berggren &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jakri.se/omraden.php&lt;/ref&gt; and his younger brother and partner Krister built Jakri AB initially as a [[property]] [[Collective investment scheme|fund]]. In recent years the brothers have diversified their projects across [[Scandinavia]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.planum.net/download/_js-pdf&lt;/ref&gt; creating what is now one of South [[Sweden]]'s most successful family run [[Property]] Funds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.a10.eu/magazine/issues/1/housing_jakriborg.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jakriborg==
Jan Berggren was interviewed by [[Sydsvenskan]] in 2011 in reference to [[Jakriborg]] which was ranked in a book publishing [[Sweden]]'s &lt;ref&gt;http://mudot.org/mudot2/MSW_instant.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 100 most remarkable sights', listing [[Jakriborg]] at number 2. Berggren's project has often been compared to [[Poundbury]] which was built by [[Prince Charles]] in England. Jan Berggren is regarded as one of the pioneers of [[Staffanstorp]] through the realization of his project Jakri together with his brother Krister (Hence '''Ja'''n and '''Kri'''ster ⁓ 'Jakri').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sydsvenskan.se/omkretsen/staffanstorp/article1596402/60-ar-som-kommun.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawyer, Banny served as Minister of Defense for Côte d'Ivoire from its independence in 1960 to 1963.&lt;ref name="jeuneafrique"/&gt; In 1963, he was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death on charges of participating in President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]]'s ''"complot du chat noir"'' (black cat conspiracy).&lt;ref name="jeuneafrique"/&gt; Meanwhile, his office was transferred to [[Kouadio M'Bahia Blé]] whose ministership lasted more than 17 years.&lt;ref name="lcweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7023.html |title=Ivory Coast: Constitutional, Legal, and Administrative Structure|work=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]|accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was discontent in the army, as the generals stirred following his arrest and Houphouët-Boigny had to intervene personally to sedate the army.&lt;ref&gt;Le Vine, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Banny, who personally knew Houphouët-Boigny from childhood, was pardoned and released in 1967.&lt;ref name="jeuneafrique"/&gt; He asked Banny to be the mayor of [[Yamoussoukro]], though Houphouët-Boigny's successor, [[Henri Konan Bédié]], appointed Banny as Resident Minister of the capital.&lt;ref name="jeuneafrique"/&gt; The Resident Minister is a member of the Council of Elders of the PDCI, which includes roughly a hundred elders.&lt;ref name="jeuneafrique"/&gt;

'''Karl Gottlieb von Windisch''' ({{lang-la|Carolus Theophil Windisch}}, {{lang-hu|Windisch (Vindis) Károly}}, January 28, 1725, [[Pressburg]] – March 30, 1793, Pressburg) was a [[Hungarian German]] writer who produced a series of letters that were published as ''"Briefe über den Schachspieler von Kempelen nebst drey Kupferstichen die diese berühmte Maschine vorstellen"'', translated as ''"Inanimate Reason; or a Circumstantial Account of That Astonishing Piece of Mechanism, M. de Kempelen's Chess-Player; Now Exhibiting at No. 9 Savile-Row, [[Burlington Gardens]]"'', following a series of performances of [[The Turk]] that he attended. The letters have been cited often since their publication in attempts to uncover the secret of the machine. Windisch spoke [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and was the first publisher of an academic Journal in Eastern Europe.

The Education Bill sought to regulate appointments and conditions of teachers. Salaries of teachers were to be paid through the treasury. There was a provision of takeover of management of educational institutions, which arguably violated the constitution.&lt;ref name="SCR-Das"&gt;''In the premises, they may, in our opinion, legitimately complain that so far as the grants under Art. 337 are concerned, the provisions of the clauses of the Bill mentioned in question 2 do in substance and effect infringe their fundamental rights under Art. 30(1) and are to that extent void.'' Paragraph 44 ''But no rule to be framed under clause 36(2)(c) can nullify the constitutional infirmity of clause 3(5) read with clause 20 which is calculated to infringe the fundamental rights of minority communities in respect of recognised schools to be established after the commencement of the said Bill.''

The '''Light Aircraft Association''' is the representative body in the [[United Kingdom]] for amateur [[aircraft]] construction, and recreational and sport flying. It oversees the construction and maintenance of [[homebuilt aircraft]], under an approval from the UK [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA).&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lightaircraftassociation.co.uk/AboutUs/aboutUs.html|title = About Us|accessdate = 10 December 2011|last = Light Aircraft Association|date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LAA was  formerly known as the '''Popular Flying Association''' and was originally founded in 1946 as the '''Ultralight Aircraft Association'''.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

==LAA Permit regime==
The regime for approving amateur-built aircraft in the United Kingdom differs from that in many other countries, of which the United States is the prime example. Instead of the FAA's Experimental airworthiness category, under which an amateur may design, build and operate (and is ultimately responsible for) an aircraft 'for experimental purposes', the UK CAA is required to investigate any such aircraft's 'fitness to fly' and to issue a 'Permit to Fly' when satisfied. The LAA is approved by the CAA to make recommendations for and to revalidate such Permits. Aircraft on a LAA Permit may not be operated commercially and are at present limited to Day / [[Visual flight rules|VFR]] operation. There are also nominal limits on the number of seats (four) and on maximum take-off weight (2500&amp;nbsp;lbs), power (260HP) and stalling speed (70&amp;nbsp;mph). The Permit is valid only in UK airspace unless by agreement with another State, which is normally obtainable for countries in the [[European Union]] and many outside it. The Permit has to be renewed annually after the aircraft has been inspected by an inspector appointed by the LAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightaircraftassociation.co.uk/ |title=Welcome to the Light Aircraft Association |publisher=Lightaircraftassociation.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
The LAA's remit extends to homebuilt [[autogyro]]s but not to [[helicopters]].  Factory-built classic and vintage aircraft that are no longer supported by their manufacturer have difficulty obtaining a [[Certificate of Airworthiness]], and in such cases the [[National aviation authority|CAA]] may transfer the type to LAA Permit.&lt;ref&gt; An example being the  [[ARV Super2]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The LAA's remit includes amateur-built [[microlights]] but does not extend to factory-built microlights, which are covered by the [[British Microlight Aircraft Association|BMAA]]. The BMAA's remit substantially overlaps with that of the LAA; but occasional proposals for the merger of the two associations have met with considerable resistance, mainly from the BMAA's majority membership of [[Ultralight trike|2-axis]] microlight pilots.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==History==
Following a letter in the [[Flight International|Flight]] by Risteard Mac Roibin an aircraft engineer who suggested that it should be possible to regulate ultra-light aircraft without the expense of a Certificate of Airworthiness, it would have to be a tested and approved design and be checked by a licensed aircraft engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Flight International|Flight]]|date=22 August 1946|page=190|title=Encouragement for Fools|author=Ristead Mac Roibin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article led to the formation of the Ultra-Light Aircraft Association, with the first meeting being held on 26 October 1946. The first priority of the association was to convince the government that light aircraft did not need a Certificate of Airworthiness. The government agreed that association could issue a Permit to Fly for aircraft not exceeding 1,000lb in weight, maximum engine power of 40 hp and a landing speed of no more than 40mph. The supervision during construction and final inspection would need to be done by ULAA inspectors. 

The association took on the name Popular Flying Association in 1949. Initially, and still primarily, an engineering organisation for approving designs for homebuilding and regulating their construction and maintenance, it is now also active in encouraging sport and recreational flying and campaigning for a regulatory regime that will provide as little restriction as possible, consistent with safety, for the construction and operation of [[homebuilt aircraft]] and Classic and Vintage factory built aircraft that can no longer hold a full Certificate of Airworthiness.  Membership in 2011 was around 8,000.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

It publishes a monthly full-colour member magazine, ''Light Aviation'' (formerly ''Popular Flying'') and holds its annual Rally at [[Sywell Aerodrome]] on the first weekend in September, probably the largest gathering of light aircraft outside the USA.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

It has a network of Member Clubs (known as "Struts") throughout the UK, each providing a geographically centred social focus for LAA members, to which members of the public are warmly welcomed.  There are also a number of Type Clubs, catering to members who are constructing or operating certain aircraft types.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

The Association changed its name to the Light Aircraft Association (LAA) on 1 January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.lightaircraftassociation.co.uk/pdf/AGM%20Booklet%202008.pdf |title = The Annual General Meeting 2008 |access-date = 16 May 2018|author=Light Aircraft Association |work = www.lightaircraftassociation.co.uk|date = 22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the magazine's name being changed to "Light Aviation"

In 2009, at the age of 25, Belviso founded the company [[Blackshape Aircraft]], in [[Monopoli]], with his friend Angelo Petrosillo as co-founder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/economia/italie/puglia/notizie/segantini-imprenditori-senza-paura-volare_de8e3560-feda-11e0-b55a-a662e85c9dff.shtml The birth of company Blackshape Aircraft - "Il Corriere della Sera", October 25, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.fanpage.it/blackshape-la-ferrari-dell-aeronautica-nata-da-una-startup-italiana/ Blackshape: the "Ferrari of skies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early life of the company was initially granted by a regionally funded program for youth entrepreneurship, offering €25,000 grants.&lt;ref name="Rep 16-9-2011"&gt;Piero Ricci, ''[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2011/09/16/noi-signori-degli-aeroplani-con-prestiti-di.html Noi, i signori degli aeroplani con i prestiti di Principi attivi]'', ''[[la Repubblica]]'', 16 settembre 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The company started to re-design a tandem two-seater aircraft (originally the Asso X) for the luxury market.
One year later, the majority of shares were sold to the holding Angelo Investments and Blackshape became a stock company. Thanks to the capital expansion, the company started the certification of the first aircraft, named BS100 (commercial name [[Blackshape Prime]]),&lt;ref name="Rep 16-9-2011"/&gt; and the serial manufacturing, gaining relevant market feedback thanks to its high-technology carbon fiber aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackshapeprime.com/ Prime Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackshapeaircraftownerassociation.com/ The Blackshape Aircraft Owner Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219061231/http://www.blackshapeaircraftownerassociation.com/ |date=2014-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2013 the company launched a new program, the BS115, for a larger two-seater for utility operations and training.
Belviso leads the company as [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and [[Chief technology officer|CTO]].

==Affiliation==
Belviso is member of the [[Space Generation Advisory Council]] in support of the United Nations Space Programme, member of the [[International Institute of Air and Space Law|International Institute of Space Law]].

Brough was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business 2000–01 and Minister for Employment Services from 2001 to 2004. In July 2004 he was moved to the portfolios of Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue. He was Minister for Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs from January 2006 to November 2007. In his Indigenous Affairs portfolio, Brough was the chief architect of the government's [[Northern Territory Emergency Response]], a package of measures designed to combat alleged high rates of [[child neglect]] and [[child abuse|abuse]] in the territory.

Brough was one of a number of government MPs including [[John Howard]] who lost their seats at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]]. Brough suffered a swing of 10.3 points in the [[two-party-preferred vote]] in his seat, to finish with a vote of 46.4 percent. He was succeeded by [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]]'s [[Jon Sullivan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QLD Division Results - Longman|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-13745-302.htm|work=2007 Election Tally Room|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=30 November 2007|date=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tracker.org.au/2012/08/bringing-back-the-brough-10-of-the-worst-things-mad-mal-did-in-office/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904174023/http://tracker.org.au/2012/08/bringing-back-the-brough-10-of-the-worst-things-mad-mal-did-in-office/ |archivedate=4 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brough switched to the seat of Fisher and won it back from Liberal turned independent and the Speaker of the House of Representatives [[Peter Slipper]] at the 2013 federal election.

===State politics===
Brough was elected as the President of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qld conservatives plan fresh merger talks|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/01/2261451.htm|accessdate=13 January 2011|newspaper=ABC News|date=1 June 2008|agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in that position after a vote in July 2008 to merge into the new Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP). He opposed the merger as it had not received final ratification from the federal Liberal Party. On 26 September 2008 he resigned from his post, saying: "You try and do the right thing and, quite frankly, at this point it's all over the shop and it's no wonder voters get so disenchanted with the non-Labor side of politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brough quits Liberal presidency|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/brough-quits-liberal-presidency/2008/09/25/1222217423498.html|accessdate=13 January 2011|newspaper=The Brisbane Times|date=26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was because of his opposition of the merger to the LNP that he was not a candidate for his former seat of Longman at the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]]. That would have meant securing preselection from the LNP in order to have a good chance of reclaiming the seat. He also criticised the party leading up to the 2010 election on its absence of policies, but he did not rule out running for his resident seat of Fisher against [[Peter Slipper]], a National party member who had joined the Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dennehy|first=Kate|title=LNP has no idea, says Brough|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/lnp-has-no-idea-says-brough-20100622-yu0j.html|accessdate=30 September 2012|newspaper=The Brisbane Times|date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal politics and diary allegations===
In 2006, Brough was the Minister for Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Faced with allegations regarding the degradation of Aboriginal communities and frequent cases of child sexual abuse, Brough, combined with the Northern Territory Chief Minister Clare Martin, commissioned a report into child sexual abuse in the Northern Territory. This report received much criticism, beginning with the view that it was a hasty reaction to these allegations. Researchers have suggested that the report was not simply used as an opportunity to resolve these issues, but rather as another way to control these communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A|date=2016-03-01|title=Rhetoric, Aboriginal Australians and the Northern Territory Intervention: A Socio-legal Investigation into Pre-legislative Argumentation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5204/ijcjsd.v5i1.285|journal=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.5204/ijcjsd.v5i1.285|issn=2202-8005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2012, following the defection of Peter Slipper from the Liberals to become an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] MP and [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], Brough announced that he was seeking LNP preselection for the seat of Fisher for the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brough to learn if he'll win preselection|url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/national/brough-to-learn-if-hell-win-preselection/story-e6frfku9-1226437841410|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=News.com.au|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July 2012, it was announced that had won the preselection for the seat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parnell|first=Sean|title=Mal Brough's plan for federal comeback passes a key hurdle, with LNP preselection for Fisher|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/mal-broughs-plan-for-federal-comeback-passes-a-key-hurdle-with-lnp-preselection-for-fisher/story-fn59niix-1226437931331|accessdate=30 September 2012|newspaper=The Australian|date=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite criticism over his contact with James Ashby. Ashby had been an adviser to Slipper who had made accusation of sexual harassment. Justice Steve Rares found that Brough had acted with Ashby and another Slipper staffer, Karen Doane, in abusing the judicial process for the "purpose of causing significant public, reputational and political damage to Mr Slipper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ireland|first=Judith|title=AFP suspends Mal Brough conspiracy prober|url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/afp-suspends-mal-brough-conspiracy-probe-20130228-2f8iw.html#|accessdate=28 April 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=28 February 2013|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October 2012, Slipper resigned as Speaker following revelations of mobile phone text messages he had sent to Ashby. In an early 2014 appeal ruling the full bench of the Federal Court found that Justice Rares had 'no basis to conclude that Brough was part of any combination with anyone in respect to the commencement of these proceedings with the predominant purpose of damaging Slipper in the way alleged or at all,' and that there was 'nothing untoward about those matters'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/Ruling-clears-Brough-in-Ashby-affair/2185393/|title=Ruling clears Brough in Ashby affair|last=Mccutcheon|first=John|date=1 March 2014|work=Sunshine Coast Daily|access-date=22 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The majority judgment of the Full Federal Court stated that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding of Rares J at trial: {{cite AustLII|FCAFC|15|2014|litigants=Ashby v Slipper |pinpoint=[120]-[122] per Mansfield and Gilmour JJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 December 2015 Brough stood down from the Turnbull Ministry and moved to the [[backbench]] pending the completion of an investigation by the Australian Federal Police over the alleged copying of the diary of former speaker Peter Slipper. [[Jamie Briggs]] also resigned on the same day. Questions were raised over the holiday timing of the announcements.&lt;ref name=afr&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.afr.com/news/politics/after-work-drinks-101-lessons-for-jamie-briggs-and-other-bosses-20151230-glwqoc |author=Han, Misa |title=After work drinks 101: lessons for Jamie Briggs (and other bosses) |work=[[The Australian Financial Review]] |date=30 December 2015 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-29/jamie-briggs-standing-down-from-frontbench/7058266 |author=Keany, Francis |title=Mal Brough, Jamie Briggs stand down from front bench roles; reshuffle on the cards for PM Malcolm Turnbull |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=29 December 2015 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-02/timeline:-mal-brough-under-fire/6994748 |title=Timeline: Mal Brough under fire |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=29 December 2015 |accessdate=6 January 2016 |author=Anderson, Stephanie }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/why-is-mal-brough-in-trouble-20151202-gldr8t.html |title=Why is Mal Brough in trouble? |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2 December 2015 |accessdate= |author=Cox, Lisa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manuel Carlos Prado y Ugarteche''' (April 21, 1889 – August 15, 1967) was a banker who served twice as [[President of Peru]]. Son of former president [[Mariano Ignacio Prado]], he was born in Lima and served as the nation's 50th (1939 - 1945) and 54th (1956 - 1962) President. His brother, [[Leoncio Prado Gutiérrez]], was a military hero who died in 1883, six years before Manuel Prado was born.

As a young army officer, Prado was a key player in the coup that overthrew Peruvian President [[Guillermo Billinghurst]] in 1914. He became President of the [[Central Reserve Bank of Peru|Central Reserve Bank]] in 1934.

Manuel Prado, a conservative patriarch of a wealthy and powerful family, reached the Presidency of Peru with the help of the left-wing [[Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana]] party. Prado announced that "one of the first acts of my government will be to declare a general political amnesty and put an end to the proscription of political parties."

During Prado's second presidency (1956–1962), the only significant proscribed party was the APRA ([[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]]), which was thrown out of power and outlawed in 1948 by President Manuel Odría. Prado announced that he would submit to the newly elected Congress a bill to legalize APRA once again. The bill was later passed and the APRA's famed founder, [[Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre]], returned from foreign exile.

In foreign policy, Prado – whose greatest pride was that as President in 1942 he made Peru the first of the South American nations to break off relations with the [[Axis Powers]]– was expected to side firmly with the U.S.

In 5 November 2017, Marcelo Odebrecht, his father and his brother were named in the [[Paradise Papers]], a set of confidential [[electronic document]]s relating to [[offshore investment]], and was revealed that his company used at least one [[offshore company]] as a vehicle for the payment of bribes in the Operation Car Wash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delfino|first1=Emilia|title=Paradise Papers: Salen a la luz 17 offshore de Odebrecht y al menos una se usó para sobornos|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-salen-a-la-luz-17-offshore-de-odebrecht-y-al-menos-una-se-uso-para-sobornos.phtml|accessdate=9 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|date=8 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108203827/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-salen-a-la-luz-17-offshore-de-odebrecht-y-al-menos-una-se-uso-para-sobornos.phtml|archivedate=8 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''milSuite''' is a collection of online applications focused on improving the methods of secure collaboration for the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The effort is produced by the U.S. Army [[Program Executive Office Command Control Communications Tactical|Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Tactical's]] MilTech Solutions office with the online suite consisting of five primary applications: milBook, milWiki, milTube, milUniversity and milSurvey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peoc3t.army.mil/nete/miltech.php U.S. Army PEO C3T MilTech Solution]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The primary applications that make up milSuite were launched as a collection of connected sites in 2009 and focused on open source software to create DoD-audience exclusive versions of popular and successful public websites, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Wikipedia]]. milSuite uses [[Jive SBS]] for its professional networking site, milBook; [[MediaWiki]] for its online encyclopedia, milWiki; and [[WordPress]] for its news aggregator, milWire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcn.com/Articles/2010/05/03/Knowledge-Management-gets-hip.aspx?Page=3 GCN - How Knowledge Management became sexy again]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, milSuite added milTube to its offering. The site was intended to provide a professional alternative to [[YouTube]], with videos focused on military training and education. At the time of its launch, the deputy director for the Army's MilTech Solutions office, which produces milSuite, stated milTube will cater to a “more targeted audience to communicate on official [Defense Department] business.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/11/no-ghostriding-allowed-on-armys-sfw-youtube/ Wired.com Danger Room - No Ghostriding Allowed on Army's SFW YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next piece to join the milSuite brand of social media site imitators was Eureka. Launched in July 2012 as part of the milBook application but designed to feel independent, Eureka uses the concept of [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] to host discussions with the intent to bring about revolutionary solutions; like improved training, better ways to secure mobile devices, or any other problems that plague the military and hamper efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120626/DEFREG02/306260009/U-S-Military-Launch-Website-Mirrors-Reddit?odyssey=nav%7Chead U.S. Military To Launch Website That Mirrors Reddit]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, milSuite executed a major release with updates to its core products and a change in the application lineup, re-purposing its WordPress site as milWire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-02-08/ Army Stand-To! Feb. 8 2013. Today's focus: milSuite 4.0]&lt;/ref&gt; milWire is designed to be an aggregator of news and information from across milSuite and the public web. It allows users to share original short blog posts or content from anywhere across the other milSuite sites into specific user and topic-based feeds, which other users of milSuite can then subscribe to or follow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/article/108354 New 'milWire' tool promotes targetd information sharing']&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 was also the year milSuite added milUniversity as an online training tool.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.mil/article/102777/miluniversity_adds_to_army_online_learning_opportunities MilUniversity adds to Army online learning opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 23, 2018, milSuite executed a major update and migration from the their traditional hosting environment to the DISA milCloud environment. The migration allowed milSuite to be more agile as a service with the ability to scale as necessary to support a growing number of users while simultaneously keeping maintenance costs low. 

==Creation and Usage==
[[File:Milsuite-application-logos.jpg|thumb|right|Individual icons for milSuite and its five major applications.]]
The milSuite product line grew out of a need for new knowledge management solutions for an Army workforce at [[Fort Monmouth]], N.J., which was expected to lose a significant number of personnel due to the announcement of [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005]]. Original use of an internal MediaWiki and internal WordPress site from 2007-08 focused on building and updating living knowledge archives, the expertise of departing leaders and the specialized knowledge of subject matter experts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doncio.navy.mil/chips/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=3901 CHIPS - milSuite Promotes Efficiency Across the Enterprise…]&lt;/ref&gt;

milBook was launched in the fall of 2009 to provide "a centralized location for Army personnel to discuss military topics that were previously done through potentially insecure emails, chats, wikis and blogs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34960797/ns/technology_and_science-science MSNBC.com - U.S. Army launches Facebook-like site]&lt;/ref&gt; The former, stand-alone MediaWiki and WordPress offerings were named milWiki and milBlog and joined with milBook to create milSuite.

The military has leveraged milSuite for several significant collaborative efforts since its launch. The [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] begin using milWiki in 2010 to create online versions of [[United States Army Field Manuals|field manuals]] in a wiki format, that could be contributed to by any soldier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/us-army-uses-wikipedia-like-forum-write-doctrine-4063363.html Yahoo! Voices - US Army Uses Wikipedia-Like Forum to Write Doctrine: All Soldiers Invited] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728184325/http://voices.yahoo.com/us-army-uses-wikipedia-like-forum-write-doctrine-4063363.html |date=2012-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Army Forces Command]] partnered with milSuite in 2011 to develop a customized Virtual Training Portal for Soldiers using milWiki and milTube.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doncio.navy.mil/chips/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=3901 CHIPS - milSuite Promotes Efficiency Across the Enterprise…]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, milBook was a key component in an initiative by the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Air Mobility Command]] to host and conduct conferences and courses virtually as a cost-cutting measure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/30/hagel_german_defense_minister_talk_turkey_afghanistan_62_percent_of_americans_do Don't GoToMeeting: How AMC saves the dough]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2016, the Army Office of Business Transformation launched Army Ideas for Innovation (AI2) as a replacement for the Army Suggestion Program (ASP), which was suspended in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.mil/article/176284/army_needs_innovative_ideas_says_under_secretary Army needs innovative ideas, says under secretary]&lt;/ref&gt; Created at the direction of the [[United States Under Secretary of the Army]], AI2 is a crowd-source innovation program built on the milSuite platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-09-19 Army Ideas for Innovation Program (press release)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Air Force]] launched its own idea submission site for Airmen on milSuite in May 2017. The website, which directly supported Air Force Chief of Staff [[David L. Goldfein|Gen. David L. Goldfein]]’s Focus Area number one – Revitalizing Air Force Squadrons, encouraged Airmen to address specific topics presented in the form of challenges and to help identify the best ideas by voting, commenting and sharing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1182426/af-announces-squadron-revitalization-idea-site/ Air Force announces squadron revitalization idea site]&lt;/ref&gt;

milSuite was featured as a secure alternative to public social media for Department of Defense collaboration at the [[Defense Information School]]'s 2017 Social Media Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dinfos.dma.mil/About/Social-Media-Workshop/ DINFOS 2017 Social Media Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributors==
milSuite is accessible to active military personnel, DoD civilian employees, and contractor employees, representing the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard. The community, which includes participants at all levels of employment and military rank - from government interns to general officers - registered its 350,000th user in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://government.tmcnet.com/topics/government/articles/290706-milsuite-hits-milestone-unique-users-military-social-media.htm Government TMCnet.com - MilSuite Hits Milestone for Unique Users on Military Social Media Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 2009, milWiki received a Category III: Technology Dimension Army Knowledge Management Award, at the Army's annual LandwarNet Conference, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/article/26836/milwiki-receives-armys-top-knowledge-management-honor/ Army.mil milWiki receives Army's top knowledge management honor]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the following year's LandWarNet conference, in 2010, milBook claimed the top Army Knowledge Management award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/article/43817/ milBook scores top knowledge management award]&lt;/ref&gt;

milWiki was the supporting application for the U.S. Training and Doctrine Command's (TRADOC) U.S. Army Field Manual Wiki project, which was recognized by the White House administration in 2010 as an [[Open Government Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/highlights Open Government Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815074021/http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/highlights |date=2010-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Government Computer News]] named milSuite one of its honorable mentions in the program's 24th Annual agency awards for information technology initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1105govinfo.com/articles/2011/05/06/gcn-announces-the-24th-annual-gcn-award-winners.aspx GCN Announces the 24th Annual GCN Award Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6700">'''Negative option billing''' is a [[business]] practice in which customers are given goods or services that were not previously provided, and must either continue to pay for the service or specifically decline it in advance of billing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Orders/1996_TXT/da961237.txt FCC Memorandum opinion and order, 1996] "Negative option billing is the practice of giving customers a service that was not previously provided and then charging them for the service unless they specifically decline it."&lt;/ref&gt;

This is, for example, the model on which [[mail order]] services, such as [[Columbia House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiahouse.com/howitworks |title=Columbia House – How It Works |publisher=Columbiahouse.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-11 | quote = If you want the Director's Selection, just sit back and relax – we'll send it to you automatically }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Book sales club|book clubs]] are structured.

==US law==
According to the [[Federal Trade Commission]], unsolicited goods are considered a gift, and the recipient is not required to pay for or return them.&lt;ref name="ftc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Unordered Merchandise |url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0181-unordered-merchandise |website=Consumer Information |accessdate=9 June 2018 |language=en |date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Service |first1=United States Postal |title=Unsolicited Merchandise |url=http://about.usps.com/publications/pub300a/pub300a_tech_021.htm |website=about.usps.com |accessdate=9 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is different to situations where a customer signs up for a service or club without reading [[fine print]] and agrees to purchase goods through the mail.&lt;ref name=ftc/&gt;&lt;ref name="ftc2"&gt;{{cite web |title=How Buying Plans Work |url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0068-how-buying-plans-work |website=Consumer Information |accessdate=9 June 2018 |language=en |date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable example is the class-action lawsuit against [[Scholastic Corporation]] by consumers who felt "harassed, deceived, intimidated, and threatened" when they tried to cancel membership.&lt;ref name=prnewswire2006&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/01-30-2006/0004270838&amp;EDATE= "Parents Sue Educational Publisher Scholastic Alleging Misleading Billing, Marketing Scheme"], PW Newswire, 2006-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian law==
In [[Canada]], [[Canadian parliament|Parliament]] attempted to outlaw the practice in 1996 after a public outcry the previous year when most [[cable television]] companies added a package of new [[specialty service]]s to their lineups in this manner. This had previously been the standard manner of adding new channels to cable television service, but had not previously attracted the type of controversy that was raised by the 1995 channel launch, in part because the 1995 launch entailed a large number of channels which launched concurrently, whereas previous additions had only involved one or two channels at a time.

MP [[Roger Gallaway]] introduced a private-member's bill in 1996 to ban the practice which passed first reading, but died on the order paper when the House was dissolved for the 1997 elections. It was raised again in 1999, and was passed. Michael Janigan of the [[Public Interest Advocacy Centre]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concern associated with the practice of negative option billing has its origins in the nature of a [[contract]] of purchase and sale, as recognized in [[common law]]. As every first year law student learns, such a contract consists of [[offer and acceptance|an offer and an acceptance]]. The history of consumer protection [[statute]]s is a chronicle of legislators attempting to ensure that the offer is conveyed without misrepresentation by the vendor to a purchaser who has an opportunity to make an informed choice to accept or refuse the offer. This is because a contract that is made with a consumer who is unaware of key elements of the contract such as price, quantity and quality of the goods to be delivered is subversive of the efficiency of the market as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piac.ca/financial/negative_option_marketing/ Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PAIC) notes on Bill C-276]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Ontario government]] also outlawed the practice in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_02c30_e.htm Ontario Consumer Protection Act, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario's regulations prohibiting negative option billing do not protect consumers from owing for goods or services that they have agreed to receive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.on.ca/mgs/en/ConsProt/STEL02_045943.html Ontario Ministry of Government and Consumer Services]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Alberta has outlawed negative billing in 1998.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Trading Act|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/F02.pdf|website=Queens Printers|publisher=Queens Printers|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK law==
In the UK the law which applies is ''The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000'' (2000 No. 2334),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/2334/contents/made |title=The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 |publisher=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ |date=2000 |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically section 24 ''Inertia Selling''. (This effectively replaces the repealed s.1 of the ''Unsolicited Goods and Services Act'' (1971, as amended).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/30/contents |title=Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=1971 |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In summary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(2) The recipient [of unsolicited goods] may, as between himself and the sender, use, deal with or dispose of the goods as if they were an unconditional gift to him.

(3) The rights of the sender to the goods are extinguished.

An '''occupational disease''' is any chronic ailment that occurs as a result of work or occupational activity. It is an aspect of [[occupational safety and health]]. An occupational disease is typically identified when it is shown that it is more prevalent in a given body of workers than in the general population, or in other worker populations. The [[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma|first such disease to be recognised]], [[squamous-cell carcinoma]] of the [[scrotum]], was identified in [[chimney sweep]] boys by [[Percivall Pott|Sir Percival Pott]] in 1775{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.  Occupational hazards that are of a traumatic nature (such as falls by roofers) are not considered to be occupational diseases.

Under the law of [[workers' compensation]] in many jurisdictions, there is a presumption that specific disease are caused by the worker being in the work environment and the burden is on the employer or insurer to show that the disease came about from another cause. Diseases compensated by national workers compensation authorities are often termed occupational diseases. However, many countries do not offer compensations for certain diseases like musculoskeletal disorders caused by work (e.g. in Norway). Therefore, the term work-related diseases is  utilized to describe diseases of occupational origin. This term however would then include both compensable and non-compensable diseases that have occupational origins.

==Examples==
Some well-known occupational diseases include:

===Lung diseases===
{{Main article|Occupational lung disease}}
Occupational lung diseases include [[asbestosis]] among [[asbestos]] miners and those who work with friable asbestos insulation, as well as black lung ([[coalworker's pneumoconiosis]]) among [[coal miner]]s, [[silicosis]] among miners and quarrying and tunnel operators and [[byssinosis]] among workers in parts of the cotton textile industry.

[[Occupational asthma]] has a vast number of [[Occupational asthma#Occupations at risk|occupations at risk]].

Bad [[indoor air quality]] may predispose for diseases in the lungs as well as in other parts of the body.

===Skin diseases===
{{Main article|Occupational skin diseases}}
Occupational skin diseases are ranked among the top five occupational diseases in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kanerva's Occupational Dermatology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-3-642-02035-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupational skin diseases and conditions are generally caused by chemicals and having wet hands for long periods while at work. [[Eczema]] is by far the most common, but [[urticaria]], [[sunburn]] and [[skin cancer]] are also of concern.&lt;ref name=hse&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/skin/ HSE (Health and Safety Executive of Great Britain) Skin at work] Retrieved on June 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contact dermatitis]] due to irritation is [[inflammation]] of the skin which results from a contact with an irritant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Irritant Dematitis|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-3-540-31294-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that this type of [[dermatitis]] does not require prior sensitization of the [[immune system]]. There have been studies to support that past or present [[Atopic dermatitis|atopic]] [[Atopic dermatitis|dermatitis]] is a risk factor for this type of [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coenraads|first=P. J.|last2=Diepgen|first2=T. L.|date=1998-02-01|title=Risk for hand eczema in employees with past or present atopic dermatitis|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|volume=71|issue=1|pages=7–13|issn=0340-0131|pmid=9523243|doi=10.1007/s004200050243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common irritants include detergents, acids, alkalies, oils, organic solvents and reducing agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elsner|first=P.|date=1994-07-01|title=Irritant dermatitis in the workplace|journal=Dermatologic Clinics|volume=12|issue=3|pages=461–467|issn=0733-8635|pmid=7923942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acute form of this dermatitis develops on exposure of the skin to a strong irritant or caustic chemical. This exposure can occur as a result of [[accident]] at a [[workplace]]. The irritant reaction starts to increase in its intensity within minutes to hours of exposure to the irritant and reaches its peak quickly. After the reaction has reached its peak level, it starts to heal. This process is known as decrescendo phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dermatotoxicology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0849397738|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequent potent irritants leading to this type of dermatitis are acids and alkaline solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eichmann|first=A.|last2=Amgwerd|first2=D.|date=1992-05-05|title=[Toxic contact dermatitis]|journal=Schweizerische Rundschau Für Medizin Praxis = Revue Suisse De Médecine Praxis|volume=81|issue=19|pages=615–617|issn=1013-2058|pmid=1589676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms include redness and swelling of the skin along with the formation of blisters.

The chronic form occurs as a result of repeated exposure of the skin to weak irritants over long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=M. V.|date=1988-01-01|title=Chronic, irritant contact dermatitis: mechanisms, variables, and differentiation from other forms of contact dermatitis|journal=Advances in Dermatology|volume=3|pages=261–275|issn=0882-0880|pmid=3152823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical manifestations of the contact dermatitis are also modified by external factors such as environmental factors (mechanical pressure, temperature, and humidity) and predisposing characteristics of the individual (age, sex, ethnic origin, preexisting skin disease, atopic skin diathesis, and anatomic region exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/diseases/dermatitis.html|title=Dermatitis, Irritant Contact : OSH Answers|last=Safety|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|website=www.ccohs.ca|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another occupational skin disease is Glove related hand urticaria. It has been reported as an occupational problem among the health care workers. This type of hand urticaria is believed to be caused by repeated wearing and removal of the gloves. The reaction is caused by the latex or the nitrile present in the gloves.&lt;ref&gt;Glove-related hand urticaria: an increasing occupational problem amongst health care workers. Hawkey S, Abdul Ghaffar S.&lt;/ref&gt;

High-risk occupations include:&lt;ref name=hse/&gt;
* Hairdressing
* Catering
* Healthcare
* Printing
* Metal machining
* Motor vehicle repair
* Construction

===Other diseases of concern===
*[[Overuse syndrome]] among persons who perform repetitive or forceful movements in constrictive postures 
*[[Carpal tunnel syndrome]] among persons who work in the [[poultry]] industry and information technology
*[[Computer vision syndrome]] among persons using information technology for hours
*[[Lead poisoning]] affecting workers in many industries that processed or employed lead or lead compounds

===Historical===
[[Donald Hunter (physician)|Donald Hunter]] in his classic history of occupational diseases discusses many example of occupational diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Hunter |title=Diseases of Occupations |location= |publisher=Hodder Arnold |edition=8th rev. |year=1994 |isbn=0-340-55173-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include:
* [[Phossy jaw]] among the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888|London matchgirls]]
* [[Radiation sickness]] among some persons who had been working in the nuclear industry
* [[Radium jaw]] among the [[Radium Girls]]
* [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] of the skin of the scrotum among chimney sweeps (see [[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma]])

==Prevention==
Prevention measures include avoidance of the irritant through its removal from the workplace or through technical shielding by the use of potent irritants in closed systems or automation, irritant replacement or removal &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Occupational Dermatology|isbn=978-3-662-07679-8 |last= |first= |publisher= |year= |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and personal protection of the workers.

In order to better prevent and control occupational [[disease]], most countries revise and update their related laws, most of them greatly increasing the penalties in case of breaches of the occupational disease laws. Occupational disease prevention, in general legally regulated, is part of good [[supply chain]] management and enables companies to design and ensure supply chain social compliance schemes as well as monitor their implementation to identify and prevent occupational disease hazards.

'''Patrick Joseph Larkin''', ship's captain, businessman, politician, 1 March 1829 – 31 August 1900.

Patrick Joseph Larkin was one of eight children who emigrated with their parents to [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], in 1837. His father died while on the ship, and his mother led the family to [[Toronto]]. By 1842 Larkin had gone to sea, eventually becoming a captain, a ship owener, and was involved in ship construction.

From the 1870s he served as a councillor, becoming Mayor of St. Catherine's 1882-83.

In 1875, he formed the contracting firm, Larkin, Connolly, and Connolly, its first contract being to build a section of the Welland canal. The company owned a dock, a harboru works, and portions of a railway.

Larkin invested in the grocery business and supplied timer. The Dictionary of Canadian Biography says of him

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Larkin was the last of St Catharines’s “Big Four,” the others being James Murray, Sylvester Neelon, and James Norris. Survived by his wife, five daughters, and a son, he left an estate valued at about $245,655, which included a livery stable and hotel in St Catharines, land in Spallumcheen, B.C., and his interest ($57,359) in the Iroquois contract.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4383">'''Patrik Selin''', also known as  "Silent Selin" in the poker world, was the former CEO and president of the [[Ongame Network]] and [[Gnuf.com]], and later [[chief executive officer]] of Bodog UK, an online gaming and entertainment website.

== Career ==
Following a period of senior management in the Internet banking sector in the late 1990s, Selin became president and CEO of the [[Ongame]] network, later selling it to Bwin for [[euro|€]]475 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egrmagazine.com/news/sports-books/9146/betandwin-seals-andpound474m-ongame-deal.thtml |title=BetandWin seals £'474m Ongame deal |accessdate=2005-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124091907/http://www.egrmagazine.com/news/sports-books/9146/betandwin-seals-andpound474m-ongame-deal.thtml |archivedate=January 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2005, Ongame was named IT Company of the Year by Sweden's business magazine ''[[Veckans Affärer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bettingbrain.com/interviews/0522s32_itvinnaren.pdf |title=Poker på nätet har exploderat och Ongame som leverar både spel och system sitter med trumf på handen. |publisher= Veckans Affärer |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Selin helped orchestrate the sale of Ongame to the Austrian publicly traded company [[Bwin]] (then BETandWIN.com Interactive Entertainment AG), a transaction which was completed in early 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeinvestor.com/servlet/ArticleNews/story/PRNEWS/20051216/UKF008 |title=Betandwin.Com to Acquire Ongame e-Solutions AB |publisher=Globeinvestor.com |date=2006-02-04 |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the sale of Ongame in 2006, Selin assumed the position of CEO at Gnuf.com, another online gambling website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realtid.se/ArticlePages/200801/02/20080102161502_Realtid039/20080102161502_Realtid039.dbp.asp Spelkung gör comeback], realtid.se 2008-01-03 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Selin announced that he had acquired the rights to source code of the Bodog poker product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/bodog-network-launched-featuring-former-ongame-executive-4929 |title=Bodog Network Launched Featuring Former Ongame Executive |publisher=Pokernewsdaily.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selin further secured the rights from the BodogBrand.com licensing enterprise to market the new poker network worldwide under the Bodog brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/patrik-selin-reveals-plans-for-bodog-network-5048/ |title=Patrik Selin Reveals Plans for Bodog Network |publisher=Pokernewsdaily.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Selin became the CEO of Bodog UK, the first holder of the newly created UK licence.

'''Sonatrach''' (Arabic:سوناطراك) (Société Nationale pour la Recherche, la Production, le Transport, la Transformation, et la Commercialisation des Hydrocarbures) is an [[Algeria]]n [[Government-owned corporation|government-owned company]] formed to explore the [[hydrocarbon]] resources of the country. It has some [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] in [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]], [[Peru]], [[Yemen]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algerie360.com/algerie/investissements-a-letrangerle-fantome-sonatrach/ |title=Investissements à l’étranger, Le fantôme Sonatrach &amp;#124; Algérie &amp;#124; Algerie360.com &amp;#124; Information et Actualité sur l'Algérie |publisher=Algerie360.com |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its diversified activities cover all aspects of production: exploration, extraction, transport, and refining.  It has diversified into [[petrochemistry]] and the [[water desalination|desalination]] of [[seawater]].

== Overview ==

Sonatrach is the largest Algerian and African company and the 11th largest oil consortium in the world.  Its gross sales (as of 2002) was 1,530 billion [[Algerian dinar]]s for a [[net income]] of 175 billion.  The company, which employs approximately 120,000 workers, produces 30% of the [[Gross National Product|GNP]] of Algeria.  Annually it produces 206 million [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Tonne of Oil equivalent]] (ToE), including 24 million ToE, or 11.7% of total, for the Algerian domestic market.  Sonatrach operates the largest oil field in Algeria, Hassi Messaoud, which produced around {{convert|440000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} of crude in 2006. Sonatrach also operates the Hassi R'Mel field (north of Hassi Messaoud, south of Algiers), which produces around {{convert|180000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} of crude. Other major fields operated by Sonatrach include Tin Fouye Tabankort Ordo, Zarzaitine, Haoud Berkaoui/Ben Kahla, and Ait Kheir.

Sonatrach operates over {{convert|2400|mi|km}} of [[crude oil]] pipelines in the country. The most important pipelines carry crude oil from the Hassi Messaoud field to export terminals. Sonatrach also operates oil condensate and LPG pipeline networks that link Hassi R'mel and other fields to Arzew. Sonatrach is expanding the Hassi Messaoud-Azrew pipeline, the longest in the country. The project entails a second, parallel line that will more than double the capacity of the existing line.

&lt;small&gt;Notes:

== History ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sonatrach.jpg|thumb|right|Sonatrach building {{puic|1=Sonatrach.jpg|log=2009 June 4}}]] --&gt;
Sonatrach was founded on December 31, 1963. At the time, however, the Algerian state held only 4.5% of the exploration perimeters, while [[France|French]] interests were as high as 67.5%.&lt;ref&gt;L. Blin 1990. ''L'Algerie, du Sahara au Sahal''. Paris: L'Harmattan&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Arab-Israeli War]] in June 1967, Algeria decided to nationalize the refining and distribution activities of [[Mobil]] and [[Esso]], and Sonatrach signed an agreement with Getty Oil on October 19, 1968 receiving 51% of Getty Oil's interests. It gained control over all Algerian petrochemical resources following President [[Houari Boumedienne]]'s nationalisation of all French oil and gas holdings beginning on February 24, 1971. The old concession system was replaced by a seizure of a 51% share of French petroleum companies. Only [[Total S.A.|Total]] agreed to continue its activities; the other companies left Algeria. Beginning on December 10, 1979, a conference on the exploitation of petroleum recommended increasing participation in the research efforts by foreign companies and countries. By a decree published in the ''Journal Officiel'' on May 17, 1980, Sonatrach was divided into four enterprises. From 1986, it became possible for foreign hydrocarbon companies to do business in Algeria within a partnership with Sonatrach (this process was simplified in 1991). The Sonatrach-Gaz de France accord, signed on January 12, 1989, allowed the state to set a compromise price of about $2.30 per million BTUs. A total of 9.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas were delivered annually until 1990, and Sonatrach recovered 850 million [[francs]] in arrears, since the accord applied retroactively beginning on November 1, 1987. In March 2005, the Algerian parliament adopted the hydrocarbon reform bill, encouraging international oil company (IOC) investment in the hydrocarbon sector, which Sonatrach previously dominated. However, 2006 amendments to the hydrocarbon bill created a windfall tax on IOC profits when oil prices top $30 per barrel. This tax reached up to 50% on some contracts. In addition, the amendments gave Sonatrach rights to a 51% or higher participation option on each newly discovered project.&lt;ref name="EIA Algeria 2007"&gt;EIA Algeria 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures ==

[[Image:Naftal.jpg|thumb|right|A Naftal gas pump]]

Sonatrach owns 50% of [[Numhyd]], a joint venture with [[Tunisia]]'s [[Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activites Petroliere|ETAP]], and [[ALEPCO]], a joint venture with [[Libya]]'s [[National Oil Corporation]]. In 1998, Sonatrach acquired [[Naftal]], which is the principal company selling petroleum-based fuels for domestic consumption with about 10,000 gas stations (as of 2005.) Naftec, a subsidiary of Sonatrach, operates Algeria's four refineries, which have combined capacity of {{convert|450000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}. The Skikda refinery (300,000 bpd) provides the bulk of Algeria's refined products production. The {{convert|30000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} Hassi Messaoud refinery supplies products to southern Algeria, while the {{convert|60000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} Algiers refinery processes crude from Hassi Messaoud for consumption in the capital. Finally, the coastal {{convert|60000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} Arzew refinery produces products for domestic consumption and export. In July 2006, Sonatrach and the [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] (CNPC) brought online the small-13,000 bpd Adrar refinery, which is located near the village of Sbaa {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Adrar, Algeria|Adrar]].&lt;ref name="EIA Algeria 2007" /&gt;
On July 1, 2018, Sonatrach appointed Youcef Ghazli to head the Foreign Investment Division, which oversees all investments in Europe.

== Algerian Hydrocarbon Sector ==

Hydrocarbons play a crucial role in Algeria's economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues and over 95% of export earnings. The country ranks fourteenth in [[petroleum]] reserves, containing {{convert|11.8|Goilbbl|m3}} of proven oil reserves with estimates suggesting that the actual amount is even more. The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] reported that in 2005, Algeria had 160 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven [[natural gas]] reserves, the eighth largest in the world.&lt;ref name="eia"&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/algeria.html Algeria Country Analysis Brief] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929201451/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/algeria.html |date=2007-09-29 }}, EIA, March 2005. Retrieved 18 Jan 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Sonatrach is very important politically.  Most Energy Ministers of Algeria have come from a Sonatrach background.

== Tassili Airlines ==

A joint venture between [[Air Algérie]] (49%) and Sonatrach (51%) in 1998 established the passenger airline company [[Tassili Airline]]s. Commercial services were launched on 8 April 1999 with a flight from Hassi Messaoud to Algiers. In 2005, Air Algérie withdrew its funds in the airline, which thus became wholly owned by Sonatrach.  In 2006, Sonatrach gave [[Tassili Airlines]] permission to expand its domestic destinations and for the future opening of international routes.

'''''The Go Getter''''' is a 1937 film directed by [[Busby Berkeley]] and starring [[George Brent]], [[Anita Louise]], and [[Charles Winninger]]. A determined discharged US Navy veteran succeeds in the lumber business.

==Plot==
When the US Navy rigid [[airship]] ''Macon'' is damaged in a storm and crashes into the water (as the real {{USS|Macon|ZRS-5|6}} did in 1935), helmsman Bill Austin stays with his commanding officer until the rest of the crew has gotten safely away. Bill loses a leg as a result of the crash and leaves the Navy.

He goes looking for employment, but jobs are scarce in [[San Francisco]]. He tries a lumber company run by Lloyd Skinner, interrupting a meeting between Skinner and his fiancee Margaret Ricks. Skinner orders him to leave his office. Matt Peasely, head of a shipping firm in the same building, is more polite, but the answer is still the same. Undeterred, Bill seeks out Cappy Ricks, the retired founder of both companies.

While waiting in the reception area, he encounters Margaret again. He assumes she is also a job seeker and makes a date with her, unaware she is Cappy's only offspring. She sees her father first, and asks him to give Bill a chance. Cappy, who is frustrated with the way Skinner and Peasely have been running the businesses he built up, is quite willing to countermand them. He and Skinner decide to give Bill the hardest task they can think of: selling a half million feet of unwanted [[Picea glauca|skunk spruce]] Cappy bought years ago as a favor to a friend. Not only does Bill sell all of the spruce, he also generates orders for all of the lumber the company has and more, all in a single business trip across the western United States, forcing Cappy to send him to Seattle to buy the shortfall from a hard-negotiating competitor.

Meanwhile, Bill and Margaret fall in love. With his commission from his trip, he buys an engagement ring. When he tells Cappy of his plans, however, the widowed Cappy is adamantly opposed to losing Margaret's company. He and Skinner go ahead with the "blue vase" test, a test everybody has failed, including Skinner. Cappy telephones Bill and tells him he saw a vase he liked, but could not spare the time to purchase it. He gives Bill instructions to buy it whatever the cost and bring it to him at the railway station by eight o'clock. Cappy and Skinner have pre-arranged all sorts of obstacles to make the task impossible, but Bill overcomes them all, and by hocking Margaret's ring to help pay the $1000 price of the vase and persuading a Navy pilot friend (on his honeymoon night, no less) to fly him ahead of the already departed train, he succeeds. Cappy is so impressed, he offers Bill a promotion to manager of his [[Shanghai]] office.

When Bill insists on marrying Margaret immediately so she can accompany him, Cappy does his best to stop him. He buys up all the staterooms in the ship Bill is to take, but Bill and Margaret get married and manage to sneak aboard the ship anyway. Then Cappy receives word that his men have gone on strike, and they trust and will only negotiate with Bill. Cappy sends him an urgent [[radiogram (message)|radiogram]]. When the captain of the ship refuses Bill's request to turn around, Bill jumps overboard. Margaret follows him, and the captain drops a lifeboat. Cappy finds them rowing back to land.

Bill negotiates an end to the strike, and Cappy decides to send Skinner to Shanghai instead. For Cappy's sake, the couple agree to live in his mansion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3601">'''Valuation using the Market Penetration Model''' ('''MPM''') or the growth potential of a company&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hughes | first = David | authorlink =  | title = The Business Value Myth | publisher = Canopy Law Books | series = | year = 2012  | doi =   | url = https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Business-Value-Myth-ebook/dp/B009XB91CU  | asin = B009XB91CU }}
&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of estimating the value of a company by calculating the depth of its [[market penetration]] as evidenced by its [[customer base]] and industry niche.

The process consists of:

* profiling a company's type of customer and analysing which complementary companies share these customers.&lt;ref&gt;How to sell your business for maximum value: Part 1 http://www.canopylaw.com/about.php?pg=12&lt;/ref&gt;
* valuing the barriers to entry into the industry niche that the company operates in.

== Valuation overview ==

The Market Penetration Model focuses on the synergy and opportunities for fast growth between the target company and the acquiring company. It prioritises ability to exploit future customer opportunities over previous financial performance.&lt;ref name="amazon" /&gt;

Many of the [[web 2.0]] start up successes are valued using this method, due to the perceived value of customer attention over past profit.&lt;ref&gt;How the sale of Instagram shows that the value of a business is not based on profit http://www.canopylaw.com/about.php?pg=2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages/disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===

MPM has some advantages over other valuation methods:

* Values intangible factors: such as customer attention, which are not otherwise reflected in financial data.
* Modern: MPM is relevant to web based businesses whose value is not accurately portrayed in financial figures and hard assets.

=== Disadvantages ===

The main criticisms can be summarised as:

* Intangible: the assessment of the value of particular customer segmentation and industry niches is highly subjective.
* Reliance on competition between buyers: a buyer will not need to pay a premium for future growth potential if there is no competitive bidding process.

== Examples ==

[[Facebook]]'s purchase of [[Instagram]] was based on MPM.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/04/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/ |title=Facebook Buys Instagram for $1 Billion |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |first=Joanna |last=Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Instagram]] was a relatively small company, employing 13 programmers and was just two years old at the time of the sale. It had no revenue, but was initially valued at $1 billion on account of it highly desirable customer base ([[social media]] fanatics, [[smart phone]] users) and its attractive industry niche (smart phone space).

Several other high-profile tech companies have had a valuation based on MPM including: [[Google]]'s purchase of Snapseed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/17/3346182/google-acquires-snapseed-nik-software|title=Google takes on Instagram and Facebook by acquiring top iOS photo app Snapseed|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Money Supermarket's purchase of MoneySavingExpert.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/site/2012/06/moneysavingexpertcom-to-join-the-moneysupermarketcom-group|title=MoneySavingExpert.com to join the MoneySupermarket.com group|publisher=MoneySavingExpert.com|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ($120million).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2192">'''Venture management''' is a [[business management]] discipline that focuses on being both innovative and challenging in the realm of introducing what could be a completely new product or entering a promising newly emerging market.&lt;ref name="VentureSkiesDawnWhatIsVM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=What is Venture Management?|url=http://www.ventureskies.com/blog/what-is-venture-management|website=www.VentureSkies.com|publisher=VentureSkies|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline is focused on the skills, practices and technology required to manage the rapid growth of new business in highly dynamic environments.&lt;ref name="ScholtenComparinVSandTradVM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scholten|first1=Ulrich|title=Comparing Venture Management and Traditional Management Methods|url=http://www.ventureskies.com/blog/comparing-venture-management-and-traditional-management-methods|publisher=VentureSkies|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These environments are often characterized by rapid technology change.

Reacting on more volatile and basically unknown or immature markets, Venture management is by design opportunity driven and reactive on generated [[business intelligence|market data]] and [[consumer behaviour]]. In contrast to [[business plan]]-driven traditional management concepts, venture marketing is iterative and experimental, operating on short recurring cycles of implementation and adaptation.&lt;ref name="ScholtenComparinVSandTradVM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1000Ventures"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kotelnikov|first1=Vadim|title=Venture Management vs Traditional Corporate Management|url=http://www.1000ventures.com/business_guide/mgmt_corporate_v_venture.html|publisher=Business Coach}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Venture management techniques apply equally well to [[venture capital]]-funded firms, self-financed firms, and [[business entities]] that are managed with a large degree of independence within a large established firm.
