[[File:National Museum - Parsvanatha 9C (2).jpg|thumb|[[Parsvanatha]], [[National Museum, New Delhi]], 9th century.]]
The '''Akota Bronzes''' represent a rare and important set of 68 [[Jain]] images, dating to between the 6th and 12th centuries CE, which were found in the vicinity of [[Akota]] near [[Baroda]] in the Indian state of [[Gujarat]]. It includes rare [[Gupta period]] bronzes that have been widely used for comparison of Gupta period art.&lt;ref&gt;Monolithic Jinas, Jose Pereira, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., Jan 1, 1977 p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jais/hd_jais.htm Guy, John. "Jain Sculpture". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000.(January 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Akota (formerly Ankottaka) was a major centre of [[Jainism]] in the 5th century AD and is mentioned in texts.&lt;ref&gt;Akota Bronzes, Bombay State Board for Historical Records and Ancient Monuments, Archaeological Series. no. 1.  Umakant Premanand SHAH, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The hoard provides information on metallic art and development of metal technology during [[Gupta]], post-Gupta and medieval period.

==Discovery==
The images were dug out sometime before June 1951. A University of Baroda professor brought five of them to archaeologist U.P. Shah for examination. U.P. Shat eventually  purchased most of the images from local individuals and presented them to M.S. University, which are now in the Baroda Museum.
[[File:Tirthankara, India, Akota, Gujarat, 7th century, bronze, HAA.JPG|thumb|7th-century [[Tirthankar]] image, Akota, at [[Honolulu Academy of Arts]]]]

Only two of the images are dated. U.P. Shah dated the rest of them on palaeographic basis. They range from the 5th to 12th centuries. They may have belonged to the Vasatika of Arya Rath established in Kshatrapa era. None of the images date after 1100 CE, suggesting that they were buried for safeguarding broke the invasion of Gujarat by Alap Khan, a general of Alauddin Khalji.&lt;ref&gt;Akota Bronzes, Bombay State Board for Historical Records and Ancient Monuments, Archaeological Series. no. 1. Umakant Premanand SHAH, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major images ==
Two images of [[Jivantasvami]], (representation of [[Mahavira]] who was still a prince), are widely mentioned examples of the early western Indian school of art. One of them is specifically inscribed as jivantsvami installed by Nagisvari, which represents early phase of the Gupta style.

Two images of [[Tirthankara]] (one of [[Parsvanatha]]) are from the post-Gupta period. An image inscribed as donated by Sadhu Sarvadeva include eight standing figures representing the eight planets, on both sides of the [[dharmachakra]]. Notable  images of [[Ambika (Jainism)|Ambika]] on lion and standing [[Sarasvati]] are from the same period.

A Chamardharini stands in [[tribhanga]] pose on a carefully carved [[List of plants known as lotus|lotus]] pedestal. It represents a western India school during the [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]] period between the 11th and 12th centuries.

==Inscriptions==
{{Jainism}}
The inscriptions mention these monastic lineages

* Nivrati Kula
* Chandra Kula
* Vidyadhara Kula
* Nagendra Kula
* Gohadra Kula

Modern Jnatis of shravakas are not mentioned, with the exception of a late image of about AD 1000 which mentions [[Modh]] Gachchha. However an earlier image datable to AD 600-650 refers to a sadhu (shravaka) from (nirgata) Kaserahadra. Two of the images refer to goshthikas (guild members) of weavers (salapati).

==Significance==
The Akota bronzes are of considerable artistic and historical significance.
* The inscriptions attest the earliest use of title "Sadhu" (shahu or Shah) by the lay Jains. 
* The tradition of legendary wooden [[Jivantasvami]] image is attested by the  image of about 550 CE.  specifically inscribed as Jivantasvami.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Jaina Art, Umakant Premanand Shah, Jaina Cultural Research Society, 1955, p. 4, 28&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded to be the first clothed Jain image,.&lt;ref&gt;Evolution and Appraisal, Maruti Nandan Prasad Tiwari, in Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U.P. Shah
 edited by R. T. Vyas, Umakant Premanand Shah. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; It was installed shortly after the [[Vallabhi council|Valabhi]] vachana presided by Devardhi Gani Kshamashramana in AD 453.&lt;ref&gt;An Epitome of Jainism : Being a Critical Study of Its Metaphysics, Ethics, and History and Culture in Relation to Modern Thought

* Jinabhadra Gani Kshamashramana, is mentioned in the installer of the Rishbhanath image, who wrote the Visheshavashyaka Bhashya.

==Museums==
Most of the Akota bronzes are in the [[Baroda Museum &amp; Picture Gallery]]. There are examples in the  [[National Museum, New Delhi]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York), and [[Honolulu Academy of Arts]].

'''Arthur Paunzen''' (4 February 1890 &amp;ndash; 9 August 1940?) was a [[Jewish]] [[Austria]]n artist.

==Biography==

Paunzen was born on 4 February in [[fin de siecle]], [[Vienna]], to Leopold Paunzen and Hermine née Kuhn. His parents were [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Vienna index of Jewish records&lt;/ref&gt; He studied with [[Ludwig Koch (painter)|Ludwig Koch]] in Vienna. He also studied in [[France]] at [[Académie Julian]] under [[Jean Pierre Laurens]] and traveled [[Italy]] studying art and architecture, which was very common for his time. In 1918 Paunzen married the [[Jewish]] Cornelia Westreich in Vienna.
Paunzen created a number of works that make bold symbolic attempts to convey music as images. For instance, depicting [[Beethoven]]’s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]] (Third) Symphony as nude horse backed trumpeters in the sky surrounded by clouds, flanked by a "stony faced" trumpeter who might very well be death. Also, his series based on [[Gustav Mahler]]'s song cycle, the "[[Song of the Earth]]" or the etchings he created for [[Raskolnikov]].

Many of his pieces were collected by the [[British Museum]], the [[Stockholm Engraving Collection]] and the [[Albertina Museum]] in Vienna.

In 1938, as [[Hitler]] rose to power, Paunzen moved to [[Great Britain]].

==Later life and death==

Arthur Paunzen died on 9 August 1940, in [[Central Internment Camp]], Douglas, Isle of Man. (In a panic measure, the British authorities interned all [[German people|German]] and [[Austrian people|Austrian]] citizens in the country, including all those who were Jews fleeing Nazi oppression, in May 1940.) His death is described by his friend and fellow-internee, the composer [[Hans Gál]], in his internment diary.&lt;ref&gt;'Musik hinter Stacheldraht', Peter Lang, Bern, 2003, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; He died of severe [[bronchial pneumonia]], exacerbated, according to Gál's account, by neglect on the part of the authorities. He is buried in the Jewish section of Douglas Borough Cemetery, Isle of Man &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishgen.org/JCR-uk/community/Iom/Isle_of_Man_Cemetery.htm&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"''''' is a non-fiction work by [[Zora Neale Hurston]]. It is based on her interviews in 1927 with [[Cudjo Lewis]], the last living survivor of the [[Middle Passage]].&lt;ref name=vulture&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/04/zora-neale-hurston-barracoon-excerpt.html|title=Zora Neale Hurston's Lost Interview with One of Americ's Last Living Slaves |work=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]] |access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book failed to find a publisher at the time, in part because it was written in [[vernacular]], and also in part because it described the involvement of other African people in the business of [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref name=vulture/&gt;

'''Bizarro Fiction''' is a contemporary [[literary genre]], which often uses elements of [[absurdism]], [[satire]], and the [[grotesque]], along with pop-surrealism and [[genre fiction]] staples, in order to create subversive, weird, and entertaining works. The term was adopted in 2005 by the [[small press|independent publishing companies]] Eraserhead Press, [[Raw Dog Screaming Press]], and Afterbirth Books. Much of its community revolves around Eraserhead Press, which is based in [[Portland, Oregon]], and has hosted the [[BizarroCon]] yearly since 2008. The introduction to the first ''Bizarro Starter Kit'' describes Bizarro as "literature's equivalent to the [[cult film|cult]] section at the video store" and a genre that "strives not only to be strange, but fascinating, thought-provoking, and, above all, fun to read."&lt;ref&gt;''The Bizarro Starter Kit.'' Bizarro Books, 2006. p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Rose O'Keefe of Eraserhead Press: "Basically, if an audience enjoys a book or film primarily because of its weirdness, then it is Bizarro. Weirdness might not be the work's only appealing quality, but it is the major one."&lt;ref name="Bizarro FAQs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mondobizarro.yuku.com/topic/362|title=Bizarro FAQs – What is BIZARRO? – Discussion Areas – Mondo Bizarro – Message Board|first=Rose|last=O'Keefe|date=2 October 2005|work=|publisher=[[Yuku]]|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, Bizarro has more in common with [[speculative fiction]] genres (such as [[science-fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]]) than with [[avant-garde]] movements (such as [[Dadaism]] and [[surrealism]]), which readers and critics often associate it with.&lt;ref name="Fantasy Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasy-magazine.com/2010/04/bizarro-fiction-101-not-just-weird-for-weirds-sake/|title=Fantasy Magazine » Bizarro Fiction 101: Not Just Weird for Weird’s Sake|author=Randy Henderson|date=21 April 2010|work=|publisher=''[[Fantasy Magazine]]''|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the genre may place an emphasis on the cult and outré, it is not without critical praise.

==Origins==

Bizarro literature can trace its roots at least as far back as the foundation of Eraserhead Press in 1999,&lt;ref name="About « Eraserhead Press"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eraserheadpress.com/about/|title=About « Eraserhead Press|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Eraserhead Press|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the description of the literature as "Bizarro" is a more recent development. Previous terms used to refer to the burgeoning scene include "[[Irrealism (the arts)|irreal]]"&lt;ref name="Dark Scribe Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darkscribemagazine.com/feature-interviews/d-harlan-wilson-keeping-it-irreal.html|title=Dark Scribe Magazine – Feature Interviews – D. Harlan Wilson: Keeping It Irreal|author=Blu Gilliand|date=1 August 2009|work=|publisher=Dark Scribe Magazine|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Specusphere - Irrealism and the Bizarro movement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specusphere.com/feature-articles/irrealism-and-the-bizarro-movement.html|title=The Specusphere – Irrealism and the Bizarro movement|author=Stephen Thompson|date=19 August 2008|work=|publisher=The Specusphere|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[absurdist fiction|new absurdism]]",&lt;ref name="The Specusphere - Irrealism and the Bizarro movement"/&gt; but neither of these was used broadly. On 19 June 2005, Kevin Dole II released "What The Fuck is This All About", a sort of manifesto for the then unnamed genre.&lt;ref name="Bizarro FAQs-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mondobizarro.yuku.com/forum/viewtopic/id/968|title=What the Fuck is This All About? – Articles &amp; Essays – Discussion Areas – Mondo Bizarro – Message Board|author=Kevin Dole 2|date=28 June 2005|work=|publisher=[[Yuku]]|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="So What the Fuck Is This All About?"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizarrocentral.com/article_detail.asp?articleID=8 |title=So What the Fuck Is This All About?|author=Kevin Dole 2|date=24 August 2007|work=|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=22 October 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824114545/http://www.bizarrocentral.com/article_detail.asp?articleID=8 |archivedate = 24 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kevin Dole 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizarrocentral.com/authors/25-kevin-dole-2.html|title=Kevin Dole 2|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Bizarro Central|accessdate=22 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729042919/http://bizarrocentral.com/authors/25-kevin-dole-2.html|archivedate=29 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the essay does not feature the word "Bizarro," subsequent discussion about the essay led to the name as well as the inauguration of the Mondo Bizarro Forum.

In his essay, "The Nab Gets Posthumously Bizarroized",&lt;ref name="Nab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bizarrocentral.com/2013/06/22/a-blast-from-the-bizarro-past|title=The Nab Gets Posthumously Bizarroized|last=Bradley|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Bradley (author)|date=|website=Bizarro Central|work=|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;!-- Text included as part of the ref, should it be a separate one? : see also ''Fission Among the Fanatics'' by Tom Bradley, Spuyten Duyvil Books (NYC), pages 231-245.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tom Bradley (author)|Tom Bradley]] traces the genre's roots back in literary history to the time of [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s "gogolization," and his cry of despair and horror at having his central nervous system colonized: "...after reading [[Gogol]], one's eyes become gogolized. One is apt to see bits of his world in the most unexpected places."&lt;ref name="The Overcoat and The Nose"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Overcoat and The Nose|last=Gogol |first=Nikolai |authorlink=Nikolai Gogol |translator=Ronald Wilks |year=1995 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradley claims the Bizarro movement is continuing and fulfilling that gogolization process, under the name "Bizarroization": "...we have been completing the preposterous project which [Nabokov] took over from Gogol nearly a hundred years ago.."&lt;ref name="Nab"/&gt; Bradley further asserts that Bizarro writers can trace their spiritual roots back to the [[Epistulae ex Ponto|letters]] which [[Ovid]] wrote while exiled on the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Notable Bizarro Works&lt;!-- This is a work in progress --&gt; ==
Most notable Bizarro works generally tend to come from the major Bizarro presses, most notably Eraserhead Press. Although there are many books that have qualities of Bizarro, such as William Burroughs [[Naked Lunch]] or Daniel Z Lewinski's [[House of Leaves]], a Bizarro work tends to be defined by its publication inside of the Bizarro scene, from between the years 2001, when the first Carlton Mellick III book was published, to the present. 

Although Bizarro is a DIY genre that gets little media attention, a notable Bizarro work is often one that has broken past the barriers of the genre and received wider attention in literature and media.

'''Boris Stepanovich Petrov''' ({{lang-ru|Петров, Борис Степанович}}) (July 10, 1910, [[Oryol]], [[Russian Empire]] &amp;ndash; 1981, [[Leningrad]]) was a Russian and Soviet painter and mountain climber, who lived and worked in Leningrad. He was a member of the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Artists]],&lt;ref&gt;''Справочник членов Ленинградской организации Союза художников РСФСР.'' Л., Художник РСФСР, 1980. С. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; and regarded as one of representatives of the [[Leningrad School of Painting|Leningrad school of painting]],&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' Saint Petersburg, NP-Print Edition, 2007. P.387, 393—398.&lt;/ref&gt; mostly known for his mountain landscape paintings.

== Biography ==
'''Boris Stepanovich Petrov''' was born July 10, 1910 in [[Oryol]] city. In 1931-1933 he studied in [[Repin Institute of Arts]] in Leningrad. In 1933-1941 Petrov worked as a decorator and painter, mainly in genre of landscape. In the second half of 1930s Petrov participated in several exhibitions of Leningrad artists, where he exhibited 17 works painted in the Leningrad suburbs.

Petrov took part in the [[Great Patriotic War]] of 1941-1945. He fought on the [[Leningrad Front]], was marked by military awards. In [[Siege of Leningrad|Blockade period]] he participated in exhibitions of Leningrad artists. After the World War II, Boris Petrov returned to Leningrad and worked as an artist. In 1965 he was admitted to the [[Leningrad Union of Artists]]. In 1955 he first visited the [[Caucasus]]. Since that time, began his fascination with the mountains and mountaineering. Mountain landscape has taken a leading role in his work. For several months he lived in solitude in the mountains and painted. Solo Exhibitions of his works were in Nalchik in 1960, and in 1963 and 1975 in Leningrad. For over the years Petrov painted a lot of paintings and sketches, and created a whole suite of picturesque mountains, diverse and unexpected in color. His paintings reside in Art museums and private collections in Russia, China, Spain, and other countries.

A '''chronicle''' ({{lang-la|chronica}}, from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χρονικά}} ''chroniká'', from {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, ''chrónos'' – "time") is a historical account of facts and events arranged in [[chronology|chronological]] order, as in a [[time line]]. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important.

Chronicler information sources vary; some chronicles are written from first-hand knowledge, some are from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed mouth to mouth prior to being written down.&lt;ref name="MGME19-20"&gt;Elisabeth M. C. Van Houts, Memory and Gender in Medieval Europe: 900–1200 (Toronto ; Buffalo : University of Toronto Press, 1999), pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Some used written material: Charters, letters, or the works of earlier chroniclers.&lt;ref name="MGME19-20"/&gt; Still others are tales of such unknown origins so as to hold mythical status.&lt;ref name="MGME19-20"/&gt; Copyists also affected chronicles in creative copying, making corrections or in updating or continuing a chronicle with information not available to the original author(s).&lt;ref name="MGME19-20"/&gt;  The reliability of a particular chronicle is an important determination for modern historians.&lt;ref name="MGME19-20"/&gt;

In modern times various contemporary newspapers or other periodicals have adopted "chronicle" as part of their name. Various fictional stories have also adopted "chronicle" as part of their title, to give an impression of epic proportion to their stories. A chronicle which traces world history is called a [[universal chronicle]].

==Subgroups==
Scholars categorize the genre of chronicle into two subgroups: live chronicles, and dead chronicles. A ''dead'' chronicle is one where the author gathers his list of events up to the time of his writing, but does not record further events as they occur. A ''live'' chronicle is where one or more authors add to a chronicle in a regular fashion, recording contemporary events shortly after they occur. Because of the immediacy of the information, historians tend to value live chronicles, such as [[annals]], over dead ones.

The term often refers to a book written by a chronicler in the Middle Ages describing historical events in a country, or the lives of a nobleman or a clergyman, although it is also applied to a record of public events. The earliest medieval chronicle to combine both retrospective (''dead'') and contemporary (''live'') entries, is the [[Chronicle of Ireland]], which spans the years 431 to 911.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Flechner, '"The Chronicle of Ireland: Then and Now" ''Early Medieval Europe'' v.21:4(2013)422-54  [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/emed.12025/abstract Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronicles are the predecessors of modern "[[time line]]s" rather than analytical histories. They represent accounts, in prose or verse, of local or distant events over a considerable period of time, both the lifetime of the individual chronicler and often those of several subsequent [[continuator]]s. If the chronicles deal with events year by year, they are often called [[annal]]s. Unlike the modern historian, most chroniclers tended to take their information as they found it, and made little attempt to separate fact from legend. The point of view of most chroniclers is highly localised, to the extent that many anonymous chroniclers can be sited in individual [[abbey]]s.

It is impossible to say how many chronicles exist, as the many ambiguities in the definition of the genre make it impossible to draw clear distinctions of what should or should not be included. However, the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle]]'' lists some 2,500 items written between 300 and 1500 AD.

==English chronicles==
The most important [[List of English chronicles|English chronicles]] are the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', started under the patronage of King Alfred in the 9th century and continued until the 12th century, and the ''Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland'' (1577–87) by [[Raphael Holinshed]] and other writers; the latter documents were important sources of materials for Elizabethan drama.&lt;ref&gt;'A Glossary of Literary Terms' – M.H. Abrams&lt;/ref&gt; Later 16th century Scottish chronicles, written after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], shape history according to Catholic or Protestant viewpoints.

The '''[[coat of arms]] of [[Tonga]]''' ('''ko e Sila {{okina}}o Tonga''') was designed in 1875 with the creation of the [[constitution]].

== History ==
The three swords represent the three dynasties or lines of the kings of [[Tonga]], namely the [[Tu'i Tonga|Tu{{okina}}i Tonga]], [[Tu'i Ha'atakalaua|Tu{{okina}}i Ha{{okina}}atakalaua]] and the current [[Tu'i Kanokupolu|Tu{{okina}}i Kanokupolu]]). Tonga was united under King [[George Tupou I|Siaosi Tupou I]], who then orchestrated the formation of the first formal government and also the coat of arms. The [[dove]] with the [[olive]] branch symbolises the wish of God's [[peace]] to reign in Tonga forever (the dove and olive branch are taken from the story of [[Noah]] and the [[Great Flood]] in the Bible). The three stars symbolise the main island groups of Tonga, which are [[Tongatapu]], [[Vava'u|Vava{{okina}}u]] and [[Ha'apai|Ha{{okina}}apai]]. The Crown symbolises the ruling monarchy, the King of Tonga. The text on the [[scroll]] at the bottom reads ''Ko e {{okina}}Otua mo Tonga ko hoku Tofi{{okina}}a'' in the [[Tongan language]]: 'God and Tonga are my inheritance'.

== Description ==
There is no official specification of how exactly the arms should look. Even the shield on the front gate of the late king's [[Royal Palace, Tonga|palace]] is different from the old black/white copy used by the (ex-) government printer on all official stationery, is different from the copy on the prime minister's office webpage, etc. Some have pointed crowns, some rounded; some have normal flags, others have flags looking more like banners; some use the modern orthography, some the old (Ko e Otua mo Toga ko hoku Tofia); some have black swords, others white; and so forth.

==Royal Standard ==
{{stack|[[File:Royal Standard of Tonga.svg|thumb|left|190px|The Royal Standard of Tonga.]]}}
The [[Royal Standard]] of Tonga is the monarch's personal flag and is an armorial banner of the '''Royal Arms of Tonga'''.

'''''Crime Illustrated''''' was a black-and-white magazine published by [[EC Comics]] in late 1955 and early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The format alternated panels of typography with panels of illustrations. Thus, it was arranged in tiers like a comic book but eliminated hand-lettering, balloons and panel borders.

The first issue appeared with a cover date of November–December 1955. ''Crime Illustrated'' ran for a total of two issues. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and when EC's distributor went bankrupt, they had no choice but to cancel them.

==Writers==
The editor of ''Crime Illustrated'' was [[Al Feldstein]]. As with EC's comics, Feldstein was the most prolific writer of this title, and generally wrote up to three stories per issue. In addition to stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote using the pseudonyms Maxwell Williams and Alfred E. Neuman. In a move suggested by publisher [[William Gaines]], Feldstein included retellings of previous stories: the first issue's "Fall Guy for Murder" and "Mother's Day", and the second issue's "Screenplay for Murder" and "Pieces of Hate". Writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had contributed to EC's earlier publications), Richard Smith and John Larner.

==Artists==
Artists featured in ''Crime Illustrated'' include [[Joe Orlando]], [[Bernard Krigstein]], [[Reed Crandall]], [[Graham Ingels]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and [[Johnny Craig]].

==Reprints==
''Crime Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines in hardbound volumes by Russ Cochran (and [[Gemstone Publishing]]) in 2006 as part of his ''Complete EC Library''. These reprints also included the first-time publication of the third issue (assembled in 1956 but never published by EC).

'''''Dark Souls III'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|ダークソウルIII|Dāku Sōru Surī|lead=yes}}}} is an [[action role-playing video game]] developed by [[FromSoftware]] and published by [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].

Club]] | date=June 15, 2015 | accessdate=June 15, 2015 | last=Barsanti | first=Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Souls III'' was critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies worldwide within the first two months after release. A complete version containing the base game and both [[downloadable content]] expansions, titled ''Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades'', was released in April 2017.

== Gameplay ==
''Dark Souls III'' is an [[action role-playing game]] played in a [[third-person perspective]], similar to previous games in the series. According to lead director and series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]], the game's gameplay design followed "closely from ''[[Dark Souls II]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/06/17/dark-souls-3-follows-closely-from-dark-souls-2-says-miyazaki-about-games-design/|title="Dark Souls 3 follows closely from Dark Souls 2," says Miyazaki about game’s design|first=Sherif|last=Saed|work=[[VG247]]|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are equipped with a variety of weapons to fight against enemies, such as bows, throwable projectiles, and swords. Shields can act as secondary weapons but they are mainly used to deflect enemies' attacks and protect the player from suffering damage.&lt;ref name="IGNPre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/16/e3-2015-dark-souls-3-is-everything-i-want-in-a-dark-souls-sequel|title=E3 2015: Dark Souls 3 Is Everything I Want In A Dark Souls Sequel|first=Chloi|last=Rad|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each weapon has two basic types of attack, one being a standard attack, and the other being slightly more powerful that can be charged up, similar to FromSoftware's previous game, ''[[Bloodborne]]''. In addition, attacks can be evaded through dodge-rolling.&lt;ref name="edgepre"/&gt; [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|Bonfires]], which serve as checkpoints, return from previous installments.&lt;ref name="PCPre"/&gt; Ashes, according to Miyazaki, play an important role in the game.&lt;ref name="PolyE3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/17/8798005/dark-souls-3-e3-2015|title=Our first look at Dark Souls 3 gameplay and its new changes to combat|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magic is featured in the game, with a returning magic system from ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', now known as "[[Magic (gaming)|focus points]]" (FP). When performing spells, the player's focus points are consumed. There are two separate types of Estus Flasks in the game, which can be allotted to fit a players' particular play style. One of them refills [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] like previous games in the series, while another, newly introduced in ''Dark Souls III'', refills focus points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/9/16/9336813/dark-souls-3-magic-spells-miracles|title=How magic works in Dark Souls 3|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combat and movements are faster and more fluid in ''Dark Souls III'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/19/8814811/dark-souls-3-e3-preview|title=Dark Souls III is faster, weirder, and far more beautiful|first=Sam|last=Byford|work=[[The Verge]]|date=June 19, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/20/9002955/dark-souls-3-bloodborne-combat-influences|title=Dark Souls 3's combat is faster in a post-Bloodborne world|first=Dave|last=Tach|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; several player movements (such as backstepping and swinging heavy weapons) can now be performed more rapidly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-23-dark-souls-3|title=Dark Souls 3 is familiar, and that's fin|first=Aoife|last=Wilson|date=July 23, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing players to deal more damage in a short period of time.&lt;ref name="edgepre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/how-dark-souls-3-combat-changing-post-bloodborne/?hootPostID=d0bb79889104f7063157b57840a895d5|title=How Dark Souls 3 combat is changing post-Bloodborne|first=Dom|last=Reseigh-Lincoln|date=July 19, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015|work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the game, players encounter different types of enemies, each with different behaviors. Some of them change their combat pattern during battles.&lt;ref name="IGNPre"/&gt; New combat features are introduced in ''Dark Souls III'', including weapon and shield "Skills", which are special abilities that vary from weapon to weapon that enable unique attacks and features at the cost of focus points.&lt;ref name="IGNPre"/&gt; The game places more focus on role-playing; the expanded character builder and improved weapons provide the player with more tactical options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/06/dark-souls-iii-fewer-maps-larger-scale|title=Dark Souls III Have Fewer Maps, But Larger Scale|first=Sal|last=Romano|work=Gematsu|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features fewer overall maps than its predecessor ''Dark Souls II'', but they are larger and more detailed, which encourages exploration.&lt;ref name="PCPre"/&gt; The adaptability stat from ''Dark Souls II'' was removed in ''Dark Souls III'', with other stats being adjusted.&lt;ref name="PCPre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls-3-preview-a-grander-sense-of-scale-but-still-familiar/|title=Dark Souls 3 preview: a grander sense of scale, but still familiar|first=Wes|last=Fenlon|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features multiplayer elements like the previous games in the series.&lt;ref name="HGPre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/06/16/e3-2015-worlds-first-dark-souls-iii-details-revealed/154333/|title=E3 2015: World’s First Dark Souls III Details Revealed|first=Mike|last= Patuleia|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015|work=[[Hardcore Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Set in the Kingdom of Lothric, a bell has rung to signal that the First Flame, responsible for maintaining the Age of Fire, is dying out. As has happened many times before, the coming of the Age of Dark produces the undead: cursed beings that rise up after death. The Age of Fire can be prolonged with the linking of the fire, a ritual in which great lords and heroes sacrifice their souls to rekindle the First Flame. However, Prince Lothric, the chosen linker for this age, has abandoned his duty and instead chooses to watch the flame die from afar. The bell is the last hope for the Age of Fire, resurrecting previous Lords of Cinder (heroes who linked the flame in past ages) to attempt to link the fire again; however, all but one Lord shirk their duty.

The Ashen One, an Undead who failed to become a Lord of Cinder and thus called an Unkindled, rises and must link the fire by returning Prince Lothric and the defiant Lords of Cinder to their thrones in  Firelink Shrine. The Lords include the Abyss Watchers, a legion of warriors sworn to protect the land from the Abyss and linked by a single soul; Yhorm the Giant, who was once a conqueror of the very people for whom he then sacrificed his life; and Saint Aldrich of the Deep, who became a Lord of Cinder despite his ravenous appetite for both men and gods. Lothric himself was raised in order to link the First Flame, but rejected his destiny and chose to watch the fire fade.

Once the Ashen One succeeds in returning Lothric and the Lords of Cinder to their thrones, they travel to the ruins of the Kiln of the First Flame. There, they encounter the Soul of Cinder, an amalgamation of all the previous Lords of Cinder who had linked the flame in the past. Once the Soul of Cinder is defeated, four endings are made possible based on the player's actions during the game. The player can attempt to link the fire, summon the Fire Keeper to extinguish the flame and begin an age of Dark or kill her. A fourth ending consists of the Ashen One taking the flame for their own and becoming the Dark Lord of Londor.

''Ashes of Ariandel'' introduces a new area, the Painted World of Ariandel. On arriving at a location in the base game, the Ashen One meets a wandering knight, Gael, who implores him to enter the Painted World and fulfill a prophecy to bring "Fire for Ariandel." Inhabitants of this world variously beg the Ashen One to burn the Painted World per the prophecy or leave it to its slow rot. A painter girl tells the Ashen One of "Uncle Gael"'s promise to find her dyes to paint a new world. The player's decision to proceed elicits first coldness from the world's self-appointed guardian and then a boss fight, in which Ariandel is ultimately set on fire. The painter thanks the player for showing her flame and paints her new world.

In keeping with previous franchise DLC, ''Ashes of Ariandel'' introduces not only a substantial new area, with two boss fights, but also several new weapons, spells and pieces of armour. On completing the DLC, the player has the option of proceeding to ''The Ringed City'' DLC, if owned.

=== ''The Ringed City'' ===
{{Main|Dark Souls III: The Ringed City}}

In ''The Ringed City'', the Ashen One begins their journey to an area known as "The Dreg Heap", a region where ruined kingdoms of different eras are piled upon each other as the world draws to a close. From the Dreg Heap, after battling through the ruins of Lothric Castle, the Ashen One encounters the amnesiac knight Lapp, who cannot remember his past. The Ashen One traverses the Earthen Peak, an area encountered in ''[[Dark Souls II]]'', before fighting a boss known as the Demon Prince. Victorious, the player travels to the Ringed City, an ancient city of the Pygmies, the ancestors of humanity, which has fallen into the Abyss. After defeating the guardian of the Church of Filianore, the player's actions transport him to a ruined wasteland of ash, ostensibly in the world's future. There, the Ashen One meets a dishevelled Gael, from ''Ashes of Ariandel'', who has begun killing and looking for the souls and blood of the Pygmies for the painter girl to use as ink.

== Development ==
The development of the game began in mid-2013, prior to the release of ''Dark Souls II'', whose development was handled by Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura instead of the series creator, [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/06/18/dark-souls-3-bloodborne-development-teams-pc-ps4-xbox-one/|title=Dark Souls 3 has been in the works for two years|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed alongside ''[[Bloodborne]]'' but was handled by two mainly separate teams. Miyazaki also returned to direct ''Dark Souls III'', while Isamu Okano and Tanimura, the directors of ''[[Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor]]'' and ''Dark Souls II'' respectively, served as co-directors for the game.&lt;ref name="2year"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scammell|first1=David|title=Dark Souls 3 is being developed by a different team to Bloodborne|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/dark_souls_3/news/dark_souls_3_is_being_developed_by_a_different_team_to_bloodborne.html|publisher=VideoGamer.com|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Miyazaki originally believing that the series would not have many sequels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/29/miyazaki-dark-souls-shouldnt-have-multiple-sequels|title=Miyazaki: Dark Souls Shouldn't Have Multiple Sequels|first=Luke|last=Karmali|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 29, 2013|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dark Souls III'' would serve as the fourth installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series. Miyazaki later added that the game would not be the last game in the series, and instead would serve as a "turning point" for both the franchise and the studio, as it was the last project by FromSoftware before Miyazaki became the president of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-17-dark-souls-3-isnt-the-last-in-the-series-but-it-is-a-turning-point|title=Dark Souls 3 isn't the last in the series – but it is a turning point|first=Martin|last=Robinson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple screenshots of the game were leaked prior to its initial reveal at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/gallery-leaked-dark-souls-iii-screenshots-look-legit-293409.phtml|title=Gallery: Leaked Dark Souls III screenshots look legit|first=Jordan|last=Devore|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-3-is-directed-by-hidetaka-miyazaki/1100-6428145/|title=Dark Souls 3 is Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki|first=Tamoor|last=Hussain|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's gameplay was then first shown at [[Gamescom 2015]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/08/dark-souls-iii-gameplay-revealed-in-new-trailer.html|title=Dark Souls III Gameplay Revealed in New Trailer|first=Scott|last=Russell|work=[[Paste Magazine]]|date=August 4, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miyazaki said that ''Bloodborne''{{'}}s limitations made him want to return to the ''Souls'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Zarmena|title=Hidetaka Miyazaki Says Bloodborne’s Limitations Made Him Return to Dark Souls 3|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2015/09/13/miyazaki-talks-dark-souls-3-freedom/|publisher=PlayStation Lifestyle|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the game's level design was created to become more of another "enemy" the player must face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/feature/a658679/everything-we-know-about-dark-souls-3-including-trailers-gameplay-and-screenshots.html#~plGXgHGBMpobLj|title=Everything we know about Dark Souls 3, including trailers, gameplay and screenshots|first=Liam|last=Martin|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/06/24/dark-souls-3-everything-is-designed-to-kill-you/|title=Dark Souls 3: "everything is designed to kill you"|first=Matt|last=Martin|work=[[VG247]]|date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just as how the former ''Souls'' games narrate their stories, ''Dark Souls III'' unfolds the plot with strong vagueness: players can learn the storyline merely through the conversation with [[non-playable characters]] (NPCs), art design, and item [[flavor text]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2016/03/02/dark-souls-3-miyazaki-bloodborne-interview/|title=Dark Souls 3: Miyazaki explains the difference between “difficult” and “unreasonable”|last=Donaldson|first=Alex|date=|website=VG247|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, Miyazaki states that there is no official and unique story, and his intention of designing this game was to not impose his own viewpoint, with him stating that any attempts to discover and understand the plot and that world are encouraged.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The improvement to archery, specifically draw speed, was inspired by [[Legolas]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' franchise.&lt;ref name="PolyE3"/&gt; The game's visual design focuses on "withered beauty", with ember and ash scattered throughout the game's world.&lt;ref name="HGPre"/&gt; The game's original score was primarily written by ''Dark Souls II'' and ''Bloodborne'' composer, Yuka Kitamura, and performed by the [[Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Additional music was written by ''Dark Souls'' composer [[Motoi Sakuraba]], with a single boss theme each by Tsukasa Saitoh and Nobuyoshi Suzuki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greening|first1=Chris|title=Dark Souls III composers and soundtrack detailed|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/dark-souls-iii-composers-and-soundtrack-detailed/|website=Video Game Music Online|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Souls III'' was released in Japan for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on March 24, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 12, 2015 |url=http://www.fromsoftware.jp/pc_en/product.html?mode=2&amp;category=0|title=Product &amp;#124; FromSoftware|website=[[FromSoftware]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released worldwide, along with the [[Microsoft Windows]] version, on April 12, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Frank |first=Allegra |date=December 4, 2015 |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/12/4/9849070/dark-souls-3-release-date |title=Dark Souls 3 nails down its April 2016 release date |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stress test for the game, which allowed players selected by Bandai Namco to test the game's network functionality before release, was available for three days in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/dark-souls-3-stress-test-will-begin-tomorrow-3426374|title=Dark Souls 3 stress test will begin tomorrow|first=Mike|last=Splechta|work=GameZone|date=October 15, 2015|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has three different special editions for players to purchase, all of which cost more than the base game. Players who pre-ordered the game had their game automatically upgraded to the ''Apocalypse Edition'', which has a special case and the game's original soundtrack. ''The Collector's Edition'' contains physical items such as the Red Knight figurine, an artbook, a new map, and special packaging. ''The Prestige Edition'' features all the content in ''The Collector's Edition'', but has an additional Lord of Cinder resin figurine, which can form a pair with the Red Knight figurine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/dark-souls-3-gets-special-editions/|title=Dark Souls 3 gets new gameplay, release date &amp; special editions|first=Conner|last=Sheriden|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=December 5, 2015|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Souls III'' received "generally favorable" reviews according to [[review aggregator]], [[Metacritic]], with praise given to the game's visuals and combat mechanics, reminding reviewers of its faster paced similarity to FromSoftware's previous game, ''[[Bloodborne]]''.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Game Informer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanton|first1=Rich|title=''Dark Souls 3'' review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-04-dark-souls-3-review|website=Eurogamer|date=April 4, 2016|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chloi Rad of [[IGN]] awarded the game a 9.5 out of 10, stating she thought that "If ''Dark Souls 3'' truly is the last in the series as we know it, then it's a worthy send-off."&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; Rich Stanton of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' rated the game as "essential", calling it "fabulous" and that it was "a fitting conclusion" to the series.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; Steven Strom of [[Ars Technica]] wrote that he thought the title still had the "smooth and impressive rendering of the series' signature style" and some of "the best boss fights in any ''Souls'' game".&lt;ref name="Ars Technica"/&gt; Simon Parkin of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the game 5 out of 5 stars, and wrote that while ''Dark Souls III'' "may not have the novelty of the first ''Dark Souls''", it was "the more pristine and rounded work" of the series.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

However, criticism was directed at issues with the game's [[frame rate]] and performance,&lt;ref name="Polygon"/&gt; linear map design,&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ars Technica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strom|first1=Steven|title=''Dark Souls 3'' review: Marching toward masochism|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/dark-souls-3-review-marching-towards-masochism/|website=Ars Technica|date=April 5, 2016|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the way Bandai Namco handled the Western launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bashore|first1=Nicholas|title='Dark Souls 3' and the Problem with Regional Release Dates|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/14019-dark-souls-3-and-the-problem-with-regional-release-dates|website=inverse.com|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leack|first1=Jonathan|title=Dark Souls 3's Launch Has Been Poorly Handled By Bandai Namco|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/manifesto/dark-souls-3s-launch-has-been-poorly-handled-by-bandai-namco-36405|website=Game Revolution|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Kollar of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' rated the game a 7 out of 10, stating disappointment at the lack of surprises and the arbitrary nature of the game's design, writing that "in so many important ways -- its world design, its pacing, the technology powering it - ''Dark Souls III'' falls short of the mark."&lt;ref name="Polygon"/&gt; A later patch, released on April 9, fixed some of the technical issues reviewers had with the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Imtiaz|first1=Khurram|title=Dark Souls 3 Gets Patch 1.03 In Japan, Tweaks Gameplay And Improves Performance|url=http://gearnuke.com/dark-souls-3-gets-patch-1-03-japan-tweaks-gameplay-improves-performance/|website=GearNuke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reception to ''Ashes of Ariandel'', the game's first [[downloadable content]] (DLC) expansion, was generally positive. Brendan Graeber of ''IGN'' enjoyed what the DLC offered, enjoying the introduction of a dedicated [[player versus player]] (PvP) arena, as well as the new enemies and bosses, but criticized the length, stating that ''Ashes of Ariandel'' served more as "an appetizer than a full course meal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graeber|first1=Brendan|title=Dark Souls 3: Ashes of Ariandel Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review|website=IGN|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kollar of ''Polygon'' considered the content of the DLC to be "great", but agreed with Graeber's criticism of the length, saying that there was not much of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kollar|first1=Philip|title=Dark Souls 3: Ashes of Ariandel review|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/25/13411264/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review-dlc-ps4-xbox-one-pc|website=Polygon|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reception to ''The Ringed City'', the game's second and final DLC expansion, was also generally positive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3270">'''EU Talent Day''' is an observance of the [[European Union]] on [[Béla Bartók]]'s birthday who was a well-known composer in and outside of [[Europe]].

== History ==

The first European TalentDay was held on April 9, 2011. This coincided with the Hungarian [[EU Presidency|EU Presidential Conference]] on Talent Support, held in [[Budapest]] on April 7–9, 2011. Conference delegates proposed March 25, birthday of Béla Bartók, as EU TalentDay. This event,&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian EU Presidential Conference on Talent Support ; [BUDAPEST DECLARATION ON TALENT SUPPORT http://talentday.eu/content/budapest-declaration-talent-support] (April 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; written on the first EU TalentDay, includes the following points about the purpose of [[aptitude|talent]] development in the [[European Union]] and of EU TalentDay:

*Talent development has beneficial effects on the economies of individual nations, and of the European Union as a whole. 
*Talent support programmes may boost the self-esteem and social success of talented people.
*Talent support is becoming important in the social-economic progress of underprivileged people groups.
*Effective networking of groups facilitating talent development, as is now happening in Hungary, will be even more beneficial once extended across Europe.
*EU TalentDay can help to focus the attention of stakeholders and the European general public, and seeks recognition of talents support benefits and of best practices by the [[European Commission]], the [[European Council]] and the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;The final Written Declaration on the importance of talent support http://www.talentcentrebudapest.eu/content/wd-342012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hagiographic life==

According to the legend, Ephigenia was the daughter of [[Ethiopia]]n King Egippus. She was dedicated to God by Saint [[Matthew the Apostle]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine'', trans. and adapted by Ryan, Granger and Helmut Ripperger. (Arno Press: Longmans, Green &amp; Co) 1941. pp. 561–566.&lt;/ref&gt; who [[Christian headcovering|veiled]] her.&lt;ref name=ROCOR2004&gt;The Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of Western Europe and the Americas (ROCOR). ''St. Hilarion Calendar of Saints for the year of our Lord 2004.'' St. Hilarion Press (Austin, TX). p.&amp;nbsp;70.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hirtacus succeeded the King, he promised the [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]] half of his kingdom if he could persuade Ephigenia to marry him. Matthew thus invited the king to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] the following Sunday where he explained that she was already espoused to the eternal King and thus could not be purloined by Hirtacus. The king thus sent a swordsman to kill Matthew who stood at the altar, making him a [[martyr]].

Not having managed to bend Ephigenia to his will, Hirtacus tried to destroy her home with fire. However, the apostle appeared and warded the flames from the house, turning them upon the royal palace. The king's son was seized by the [[devil]] and the king himself contracted [[leprosy]], eventually killing himself.

The people thus chose Ephigenia's brother as their king, who reigned for seventy years, leaving his kingdom to his son who filled [[Egypt]] with [[Christian]] churches.

The oldest textual source of her ''Life'' seems to be the ''[[Golden Legend|Legenda Aurea]]'' (''Golden Legend'', also known as the ''Historia Longobardica'' or ''Flos Sanctorum'') of Italian chronicler [[Jacobus de Voragine]], compiled around 1275 AD.&lt;ref name=JACOBUS5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Halsall.

That is to say that early medieval sources were often not written as objective records of social reality. The authors of these texts often had motives other than simply recording attitudes of the time. Thus to treat them as ethnographies or to approach them from a socio-anthropological perspective would be to misinterpret the period.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S.

The [[Bollandist]]s included an entry for Saint Iphigenia in their ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'' for September 21. She is listed in a German language Bollandist-derived collection of saints of 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} "[http://www.zeno.org/Heiligenlexikon-1858/A/Iphigenia,+S.

Iphigenia, V. (21. Sept.)]." Vollständiges Heiligen-Lexikon, I-L, Volume 3, 1869. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Roberto Sánchez in his paper '' 'The Black Virgin: Santa Efigenia, Popular Religion, and the African Diaspora in Peru' '' notes the following about the Bollandist account:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[Bollandist]]s, whose work is to historicize and contextualize the lives of the saints, concede that there is some doubt as to whether St. Matthew even went to Ethiopia. They conclude however that the legend is consistent with other sources and apocryphal writings of the period. It is clear that the story of Santa Efígenia is written as a [[corollary]] to the keen interest in the martyrdom of St. Matthew. His martyrdom is a significant historical event that has been subject of different versions. In effect, the origins of Santa Efigenia are shrouded in myth, folklore, and a spirited ecclesiastical historical debate."&lt;ref name=SANCHEZ642&gt;Roberto Sánchez. "The Black Virgin: Santa Efigenia, Popular Religion, and the African Diaspora in Peru." ''Church History'' 81:3 (September 2012), 631–655. p. 642.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Austrian Jesuit missionary and author [[Francis Xavier Weninger]] ([[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]) included the life of Saint Ephigenia in his ''Lives of the Saints'' (1876), inscribed within the life of Saint Matthew on September 21:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...Incontestible writings prove that he preached the Gospel for twenty-three years, partly in Ethiopia, partly in other countries, at the same time founding almost innumerable Churches, and supplying them with priests and bishops, in order to preserve the faith he had taught... ...Iphigenia, the eldest daughter of the newly converted king of Ethiopia, had not only become a Christian, but also, with the knowledge and consent of the holy Apostle, had consecrated her virginity to the Almighty, after having frequently heard the Saint preach on the priceless value of purity, and exhort others to guard and preserve it. Her example was followed by many other virgins, who, choosing the princess as their superior, lived together and occupied their time in prayer and work..."&lt;ref&gt;Rev. [[Francis Xavier Weninger|F. X. Weninger]] ([[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]). ''[https://archive.org/details/LivesOfTheSaintsV2 LIVES OF THE SAINTS: Compiled from Authentic Sources with a Practical Instruction on the Life of Each Saint, for Every Day in the Year].'' VOL. 2 - July–Dec. New York, 1876. pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her listing in the ''Roman Martyrology'' (1916 English edition) states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Ethiopia, St. Iphigenia, virgin, who being baptized and consecrated to God by the blessed apostle Matthew, ended her holy life in peace."&lt;ref name=ROMAN292/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Book of Saints'' (1921) compiled by the Benedictine Monks of [[St Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate]] has the following entry for Saint Iphigenia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A Virgin converted to Christianity and afterwards [[Religious vows|consecrated to God]] by St. Matthew the Evangelist, Apostle of Ethiopia. The extant [[Matthew the Apostle#Non-canonical or Apocryphal Gospels|Acts of St. Matthew]] are however so untrustworthy that no reliance can be placed on the particulars given therein of St Iphigenia and others of the first fruits of the Gospel in Ethiopia."&lt;ref name=RAMSGATE/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Saint Matthew, the Publican, preached the gospel in Ethiopia. He is, as Bartholomew for Armenia, an Apostle of a Nation, because, not only did he make many converts (as did all the Twelve) but he converted the king of Ethiopia by the stupendous miracle of raising the king’s daughter from the dead. Her name was Iphigenia and she is listed as a saint in the Martyrology. After her resurrection from the dead, with Saint Matthew’s approval, she took a vow of virginity. This so enraged the next king, Hirtacus, who wanted to marry her, that he had Matthew slain at the altar while offering Mass. The year was 68.

The [[Anglican Catholic Church]] records the memory of Saint Ephigenia, contained within the ''Life'' of Saint Matthew, citing ''The Anglican Breviary'' (1955):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although many parts of Christendom have delighted to claim this Apostle as the founder of their Churches, the usual tradition is that '''he went into the regions south of the [[Caspian Sea]], (which same are in this instance called Ethiopia)''' where he preached the Gospel and confirmed the same by many wondrous deeds. The greatest of these is told on this wise: that he raised to life the king's daughter, Iphigenia, whereby the royal family was converted to Christ; that after the king died Hirtacus his successor demanded Iphigenia to wife; and that she (who through Matthew's teaching had vowed herself to God) rejected Hirtacus in pursuance of her vow; for which reason Matthew was by royal order put to death whilst celebrating the holy Mysteries, whereby he fulfilled his apostleship in martyrdom."&lt;ref name=ANG-BREVIARY-1955/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Orthodox Church===

Significantly, the ''Life'' of Saint [[Matthew the Apostle]] in traditional Orthodox [[Synaxaria]] does not directly mention Saint Ephigenia by name, although the Synaxaria do record Saint Matthew's travels to "Ethiopia", that he [[List of Eastern Orthodox saint titles|enlightened]] the area, and was martyred there. The Orthodox [[Synaxarion]] according to the tradition of [[Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos]] (c. 1320), states that after being cruelly treated by the [[Parthia|Parthians]] and [[Medes]], St. Matthew then went to spread the Gospel to a certain city called "Mirmena / Myrmena",&lt;ref&gt;Hieromonk Makarios of [[Simonopetra|Simonos Petra]] (Ed.).

The source is most likely a ''local'' Greek account, which refers to this Saint Iphigenia as "''Saint Iphigenia the Virgin-Martyr of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]''", maytyred in 68 AD at the age of 15.&lt;ref name=ARCHIM-DOROTHEOS/&gt; This local account makes her a young virgin-martyr and places her in Pontus, which is apparently at odds with the account in the ''Golden Legend,'' which places her in "Ethiopia", includes Saint Matthew in the story and makes Ephigenia an abbess.

Therefore there are two possibilities: 1) either the details of her current ''Life'' are a confused [[conflation]] of these two different traditions, if indeed she was a single individual; or otherwise, 2) it is possible that there were two distinct Saints named "Iphigenia", both dating from the first century: one from Pontus who was martyred in 68 AD aged 15, based on the local Greek account; and a different one from "Ethiopia" (i.e. "Asiatic Ethiopia"), based on the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] account in the ''[[Golden Legend]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6080">The '''epic laws of folk narrative''' were a series of principles identified by [[Axel Olrik]] for understanding the structure and form of [[Oral tradition|folktales]], and have a foundational significance in European [[Folkloristics|folklore studies]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Epic Laws of Folk Narrative’, in The Study of Folklore, ed. by [[Alan Dundes]] (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1965), pp. 129–41 (p. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;

Olrik's formulation of his 'epic laws' was inspired by an idea of [[Moltke Moe]], but whereas Moe sought to derive rules for the historical development of narratives, Olrik's approach focuses on the structure of oral narrative.&lt;ref name=Dundes85&gt;[[Alan Dundes]], ''International Folkloristics: Classic Contributions by the Founders of Folklore'', Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999, {{ISBN|9780847695140}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jQ6bGz4qmWsC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Axel+Olrik,+Epic+laws&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UrzjUJPWNqjmiwLjuoHIDw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Moe%27s%20notion%20of%20epic%20laws&amp;f=false p. 85].&lt;/ref&gt; The principles were articulated in various publications, the first prominent one appearing in Danish in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, 'Episke love i folkedigtningen', ''Danske Studier'', 5 (1908): 69-89 (http://danskestudier.dk/materiale/1908.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Olrik presented the principles in German at an interdisciplinary congress in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, ‘Epic Laws of Folk Narrative’, trans. by Jeanne P. Steager in ''The Study of Folklore'', ed. by [[Alan Dundes]] (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1965), pp. 129–41 (p. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;

Olrik's thought on 'epic laws' was part of a wider project, developed with [[Kristian Erslev]], for understanding oral narrative (which Olrik called ''sagn'' in Danish), also including principles for the study of sources and a theory of transmission.&lt;ref name="DBL"&gt;Bengt Holbek, [http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Historie/Folkemindeforsker/Axel_Olrik "Axel Olrik"], ''[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]'', retrieved 1 January 2013 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Olrik drew on non-European material, his focus was explicitly on European folk narrative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53381">{{Feminism sidebar}}'''Feminist poetry''' is inspired by, promotes, or elaborates on feminist principles and ideas.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/146073/poetry-and-feminism|title=Poetry and Feminism|last=Golden|first=Shyama|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might be written with the conscious aim of expressing feminist principles, although sometimes it is identified as feminist by critics in a later era.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some writers are thought to express feminist ideas even if the writer was not an active member of the political movement during their era.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many feminist movements, however, have embraced poetry as a vehicle for communicating with public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Formally, feminist poetry often seeks to challenge assumptions about language and meaning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It usually foregrounds women's experiences as valid and worthy of attention, and it also highlights the lived experiences of minorities and other less privileged subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sometimes feminist poems seek to embody specific women's experiences, and they are often [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] registering specific forms of oppression depending on identities related to race, sexuality, gender presentation, disability, or immigration status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This has led to feminist writing journals like [http://sotospeakjournal.org/about-so-to-speak/ So To Speak] providing a statement of intention to publish the work of women and [[Genderqueer|nonbinary]] people in particular.

Kim Whitehead states that feminist poetry has "no identifiable birth date," but there are a few key figures identified as early proponents of feminist ideas, and who convey their politics through poetry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminist Poetry Movement|last=Whitehead|first=Kim|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1996|isbn=|location=Jackson MI|pages=3, ix-x, xii, xv, xvi, xviii, xviii-ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of first feminist poet is often given to [[Sappho]], at least in part because she seems to write about female [[homosexuality]] in [[Ancient Greece]], a culture and time when [[lesbian]] sexuality was usually ignored or erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43477494|title=Reading Sappho : contemporary approaches|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|others=Greene, Ellen, 1950-|isbn=9780520918061|location=Berkeley|oclc=43477494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jannerson|first=Deb|date=2011|title='ADVENTURES IN FEMINISTORY: SAPPHO'|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/adventures-in-feministory-sappho|journal=Bitch Media|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalano|first=Gabby|date=|title=How This Historic Icon Influenced Feminist Writers Today|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/fbomb/how-this-historic-icon-influenced-feminist-writers-today|journal=Women's Media Centre|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist Poetry in Asia==
[[File:Toru Dutt.jpg|thumb|Toru Dutt]]

=== Feminist Aspects of Sanskrit Writing ===

The beginning of works categorised as literature in India began with the [[Sanskrit]] term ''[[kāvya]]'', a discourse separate from science or from the purely oral, and specific literary style that included works thought to contain a kind of soulfulness.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70701869|title=The language of the gods in the world of men : Sanskrit, culture, and power in premodern India|last=Pollock|first=Sheldon I.|date=2006|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=9780520932029|location=Berkeley|pages=3, 16, 19, 126|oclc=70701869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this early period, men were often posed as poets, and women as a kind of muse, as in the tenth century explanation for the origins of Indian literary culture:  Poem Man's wife ("Poetics") chases him across [[South Asia]] creating varying kinds of literature across the region.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Poetry was certainly an important part of political cultural life in the [[Sanskrit]] cosmopolis, and some women contributed; for example the poet [[Rajashekhara|Rajasekhara]] tells of women in different regions who entertain with songs.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The early civilisation of [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] country in modern-day Cambodia cultivated a literature in [[Sanskrit]], and diverged from its neighbours in creating a strain of poetry from the fifth century to the thirteenth century in which women were a source of praise and admiration.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Take for example the Mebon Inscription of [[Rajendravarman II|Rājendravarman]], which features eulogies for specific women of note, and which is, according to Sheldon I. Pollock, "without obvious parallel in South Asia," and may be related to "specific kinship structures in the region."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth Century Feminist Poets in India ===

Early anglophone women poets in India blended native traditions and literary models from Europe.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/739722886|title=Anglophone poetry in colonial India, 1780-1913 : a critical anthology|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=Ohio University Press|others=Gibson, Mary Ellis, 1952-|year=|isbn=9780821443576|location=Athens|pages=287–288, 294–297, 363–371|oclc=739722886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst these early feminists, the Dutt Sisters - [[Toru Dutt]] (1856-1877) and Aru Dutt (1854-1874) stand out, and are sometimes compared to the [[Brontë family|Brontë Sisters]] in England.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Dutt sisters came from a family of poets, including their father Govind Chandra Dutt, and their access to education was unprecedented.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The mother of the family Kshetramoni Mitter Dutt along with all three children - Toru, Aru, and their brother Abju Dutt, had received an education in English, and to some extent, in the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The family had a reformist bent, and some members had converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Both sisters visited England in the 1870s, and attended the higher lectures for women at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Toru Dutt's poetry in particular has been labelled extraordinary, because her writing "created a new idiom in Indian English verse."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Spanning the turn from the nineteenth to twentieth century, [[Sarojini Naidu]] (1879–1949) represents a figure for whom politics and poetry are intertwined.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Like the Dutt Sisters, Naidu was allowed access to all the educational resources she desired, and she passed the [[University of Madras|Madras University]] matriculation examination at age 12. She came from a large and free-thinking family.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Her father, [[Aghorenath Chattopadhyay]], was a well-regarded doctor, known for his educational reforms, and her mother, Barada Sundari Devi, was educated at a [[Brahmo]] school.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Naidu had seven siblings all of whom made contribution to Indian life, for example her brother [[Virendranath Chattopadhyaya|Virendranath Chattopadhyay]] was an Indian revolutionary.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Naidu studied at [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]], Cambridge, which brough her into contact with writers of the day, including [[Arthur Symons]], and [[W. B. Yeats|W.B. Yeats]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Ultimately, Naidu's unconventional upbringing and education were catalysts for her intellectual powers, since as she writes in her roman-de-clef 'Sulani,' ""Unlike the girls of her own nation, she had been brought up in an atmosphere of large un-convention and culture and absolute freedom of thought and action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Sunalini," ms.|last=Naidu|first=Sarojini|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=British Library.|pages=EUr.A.95}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her marriage to Govindarajulu Naidu - controversial because of his age and class - Naidu began publishing poetry to international acclaim, and in parallel with this literary art, she maintained her nationalist efforts, eventually becoming the first Indian woman to serve as president of the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Post 1960s Feminist Poetry ===

Anthologies were an important part of foregrounding women's writing in volumes like [[Eunice de Souza|Eunice De Souza]]'s ''Nine Indian Women Poets'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bethala|first=Melody|date=February 2017|title='The battle is to validate the material': A brief history of Eunice de Souza's anthologies of Indian literature.|url=https://humag.co/features/the-battle-is-to-validate-the-material|journal=Honest Ulsterman|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Feminist Legacy of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz'''

During the Latin American colonial period, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (est 1651-1695) was a poet, dramatist, and nun.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/sor-juana-in%C3%A9s-de-la-cruz|title=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|last=Cruz|first=Sor Juana Inés de la|date=2003-02-04|website=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptionally talented and intelligent, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz chose to spend most of her life in the Convent of the Order of St. Jérôme, and her response to a critical Bishop, ''Respuesta a Sor Filotea,'' is hailed as one of the first feminist manifestos.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Not only did Sor Juana have to deal with the criticisms of men of her era, but she also faced the Spanish perception of literature from the colonies as second-rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/985840432|title=Routledge research companion to the works of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|last=Schlau|first=edited by Emilie L. Bergmann and Stacey|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781317041641|location=London|pages=xi|oclc=985840432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sor Juana's poems challenge the assumptions of men about women, for example in [https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/you-foolish-men 'You Foolish Men.']

=== Post 1960s Feminist Poetry in Central America and the Caribbean ===

Anthologies of women's writing in the 1980s foregrounded the importance of women poets in the Caribbean, for example in M.J. Fenwick's ''Sisters of Caliban'' (1996) described as "a gendered and racialized position of resistance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lara|first=Irene|date=2007|title=Beyond Caliban's Curses:  The Decolonial Feminist Literacy of Sycorax|url=https://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1289&amp;context=jiws|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|volume=9.1|pages=97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist Poetry in North America ==

[[File:Joy harjo 3271646.JPG|thumb|Poet Joy Harjo's argument for the centrality and importance of native poetry in North America is significant for feminist literary histories.]]

=== Early Feminist Poets in North America ===

Though they lived in an era before an organised feminist movement, certain American poets have been lauded by [[feminist literary criticism]] as early examples of feminist writers. Feminist poetry in the United States is often thought of as beginning with [[Anne Bradstreet]] (1612-1672), the first poet of the [[New World]]. There were also, however, native poetic traditions before colonialism, which continue to the present day, and represent an important strand of American poetry. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native]] traditional verse has included "lyrics, chants, anecdotes, incantations, riddles, proverbs, and legends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Preface to Colonial American Poetry: A Study in the Poetry of the Age in Relation to American History and Literature|last=Jabbar|first=Wisam Abdul|publisher=iUniverse|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is difficult to ascertain from these oral traditions whether the authors of early texts were male or female, precolonial native poetry certainly addresses issues relevant to women in a sensitive and positive way, for example the [[Seminole]] poem, 'Song for Bringing a Child Into the World.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/865473325|title=Native American songs and poems : an anthology|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Swann, Brian,|year=|isbn=9780486112138|location=Mineola, New York|pages=1|oclc=865473325}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, native poetry is a separate but relevant tradition in the United States; as poet [[Joy Harjo]] comments, "The literature of the aboriginal people of North America defines America.

When colonialism did arrive, Anne Bradstreet was one of the first poets to win acclaim, and many of her poems are thought to have feminist themes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The mother of eight children, Bradstreet sometimes found herself in conflict with her domestic circumstances and her role as a [[Puritans|Puritan]] woman.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anne-bradstreet|title=Anne Bradstreet|last=Martin|first=Wendy|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist literary criticism defined Bradstreet in retrospect as a "protofeminist," because of her "gender awareness," and her treatment of domestic concerns of importance in women's lives.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/785576747|title=Feminist writings from ancient times to the modern world : a global sourcebook and history|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood|others=Wayne, Tiffany K., 1968-|year=|isbn=9780313345814|location=Santa Barbara|pages=106|oclc=785576747}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[Alicia Ostriker]] describes Bradstreet's style as "a combination of rebellion and submission," a pattern that Ostriker also sees in poets to come like [[Phillis Wheatley|Phyllis Wheatley]] and [[Emily Dickinson]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/92110/a-change-of-world-episode-1-the-wilderness|title=A Change of World, Episode 1: The Wilderness|last=Fox|first=Curtis|date=2018|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phillis Wheatley|Phyllis Wheatley]] (1753-1784) was brought to the United States from Africa as a slave, and sold to the Wheatley family of Boston in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/phillis-wheatley|title=Phillis Wheatley|last=O'Neale|first=Sondra A.|date=|website=Poetry Foundation.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prodigy as a child, Wheatley was the first black person to publish a book of poems in the American colony, and though her poems are sometimes thought of as expressing "meek submission," she is also what [[Camille Dungy]] describes as "a foremother," and a role model for black women poets as "part of the fabric" of American poetry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Involved in the abolitionist movement, Wheatley became "a spokeswoman for the cause of [[American independence]] and the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316827798|title=The right to write : the literary politics of Anne Bradstreet and Phillis Wheatley|last=Seidler.|first=Engberg, Kathrynn|date=2010|publisher=University Press of America|year=|isbn=9780761846093|location=Lanham, MD|pages=xvi|oclc=316827798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth century poet [[Emily Dickinson]] (1830-1886) is often thought of as feminist, though she never wrote for public audiences. Not necessarily recognized in her own lifetime, Dickinson offers powerful female speakers. Engaging with male writers like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] or [[William Wordsworth]], her work is praised for developing "others ways of representing the position of a female speaking subject" in particular romantic and psychological dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22490475|title=Dickinson and the boundaries of feminist theory|last=1958-|first=Loeffelholz, Mary,|date=1991|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=|isbn=0252017897|location=Urbana|pages=22–25|oclc=22490475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See for example the declaration of desire and longing in [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44087/wild-nights-wild-nights-269 'Wild nights - Wild nights!.']&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the 1970s, [[feminist literary criticism]] articulated Dickinson's feminism through groundbreaking studies by [[Margaret Homans]], [[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]], and Suzanne Juhasz.

===Post 1900s North American Feminist Poets===

[[File:Alice Dunbar Nelson cropped.jpg|thumb|Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson]]
Feminist poets of the early twentieth century harnessed the new opportunities and rights which came as a result of coeducational resources now afforded to women.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/928779869|title=A history of twentieth-century American women's poetry|last=Kinnhan.|first=Linda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cristianne Miller goes so far as to say that 'In no period before and rarely since have women poets had greater success and influence than in the first half of the twentieth century in the United States.'&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

Living through the turn of the century was [[Alice Dunbar Nelson|Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson]](1875-1935), a poet often thought of in relation to her marriage to [[Paul Laurence Dunbar|Paul Dunbar]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alice-moore-dunbar-nelson|title=Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson|last=|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunbar-Nelson, however, is an accomplished writer in her own right, praised by poet [[Camille Dungy]] for breaking out of writing only about "black women's things," instead addressing "the theater and war of life."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Born in New Orleans, Dubar-Nelson's family had a heritage of African American, Anglo, Native American, and Creole roots.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; [[Camille Dungy]] suggests that bringing black women writers like Dunbar-Nelson into the feminist canon alongside Bradstreet and Dickinson is of great importance in rediscovering literary foremothers for black women writers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The early twentieth century was also a significant moment for feminism, because it saw the rise of the [[Women's suffrage|suffragist]] movement, and poets responded to the political moment by writing poems regarding the debate as to whether or not women should have the right to vote. In her collection ''Suffrage Songs and Verses,'' [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] criticises wealthy women, who because they live a life of ease, deny other women their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/gilman/suffrage/suffrage.html#anti|title=Suffrage Songs and Verses.|website=digital.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice Duer Miller]] (1874-1942) wrote poems mocking [[Anti-suffragism|anti-suffragist]] advocates, which were published in the [[New-York Tribune|New York Tribune]], a popular news outlet of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aliceduermiller.com|title=Alice Duer Miller|website=www.aliceduermiller.com|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2012/01/are-women-people-the-suffragist-poems-of-alice-duer-miller|title=Are Women People?

While some poets have been embraced by the feminist canon, others are seen as awkward additions in spite of their success, for example [[Gertrude Stein]] (1874-1946) is often defined more as a poet involved in modernist experimentation than feminist discourse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/gertrude-stein|title=Gertrude Stein|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of modernism's tenets seem incompatible with some kinds of feminism, like the repression of emotion, and avoidance of domesticity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Nevertheless, second wave feminists found modernist women poets like [[H.D.]] (1886-1961) to be a powerful example, unfairly overlooked by male critics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/h-d|title=H.

By the time of the 1940s, magazines were being set up which, though perhaps not obviously feminist, certainly in their practices were very different to male-run publications: take for example [[Contemporary Verse 2|Contemporary Verse]] (1941–52) published in Canada by a group of women writers, including [[Dorothy Livesay]], [[P. K. Page|P.K.

===Post 1960 North American Feminist Poets===

[[File:Audre Lorde.jpg|thumb|Audre Lorde]]
Historian [[Ruth Rosen]] describes the mainstream poetry world before 1960 as "an all boy's club," adding that poetry was not "women's place," and explains that in order to get a poetry book published, writers would have to overcome their gender and race.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/101723/books-that-broke-down-barriers|title="A Change of World, Episode 2: Books that Broke Down Barriers"|last=Fox|first=Curtis|date=|website=Poetry Foundation.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest of American feminist poets in the rights of minorities have often put them in conflict with American institutions like the [[Academy of American Poets|American Academy of Poets]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of the strategies of feminist poets is to demonstrate "their opposition to a dominant poetry culture that does not recognize the primacy of gender and other oppressions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[1960s]] feminist poetry provided a useful space for [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] American feminist politics.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/146073/poetry-and-feminism|title=Poetry and Feminism|last=|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poets, however, were not necessarily unified in their themes or formal techniques, but had links to specific movements and trends, such as the New York Poets, the [[Black Mountain poets]], the [[San Francisco Renaissance]], or the [[Beat poets|Beat Poets]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Denise Levertov]] (1923-1997), for example, refined and built upon poetics from the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain]] School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levertov|first=Denise|date=1965|title=Some Notes on Organic Form|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/69392/some-notes-on-organic-form-56d249032078f|journal=Poetry|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/denise-levertov|title=Denise Levertov|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women like [[Sylvia Plath]] (1932-1963) and [[Anne Sexton]] (1928-1974) provided a feminist version of the [[Confessional poetry|Confessional Poets]]' poetics, which worked alongside feminist texts of the day, like [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', to "address taboo subjects and social limitations that plagued American women" (although Plath died before ''The Feminine Mystique'' was published)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/09/confessionalism-feminism-at-coldfront|title=Confessionalism and Feminism at Coldfront|last=Harriet|first=Staff|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anne-sexton|title=Anne Sexton|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/sylvia-plath|title=Sylvia Plath|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucille Clifton]] (1936-2010) also borrowed from [[Confessional poetry|Confessional]] poetics, a strategy that was key according to [[Adrienne Rich]] for avoiding being trapped between "misogynist black male critics and white feminists still struggling to unearth a white woman's tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coldfrontmag.com/confessionalism-birthed-from-feminism-jd/|title=Confessionalism Birthed from Feminism|last=Wilson|first=Merida|date=|website=http://coldfrontmag.com/confessionalism-birthed-from-feminism-jd/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/lucille-clifton|title=Lucille Clifton|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confessional poetry|Confessionalism]] lent to feminist poetry the possibility of agency for the female speaker, and the refusal to present well-behaved women, though it was troubling that the Confessional women poets who committed suicide tended to be foregrounded and promoted in poetry circles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

[[Muriel Rukeyser]] (1913-1980) was a generation older than Plath and Sexton, and rejected the suicidal poetics of the Confessional writers.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Rukeyser also wrote frankly about the body and sexuality, inspiring later poets like [[Sharon Olds]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/144891/a-change-of-world-episode-4-a-place-of-permission|title=A Change of World, Episode 4 : A Place of Permission - Poetry Off the Shelf|date=2018-09-26|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Rukeyser's leftist politics and militant writing style proved to be a model for poet [[Adrienne Rich]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Both poets also contributed to the [[Anti-Vietnam War Movement|anti-Vietnam War movement]]: for example [[Muriel Rukeyser|Rukeyser]] and [[Adrienne Rich|Rich]] took part in readings as part of the event series, the Week of the Angry Arts Against the War in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Adrienne Rich]] (1929-2012) also became a key feminist poet, praised by [[Alicia Ostriker]] for bringing "intellect" to poetry, "something that women were not supposed to have," as well as "a leftward leaning sensibility in which coming out as lesbian was just one part."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/adrienne-rich|title=Adrienne Rich|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich's [https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/diving-wreck 'Diving into the Wreck'] is an important feminist poem, as it describes moving down as an act of triumph, where the wreck might be history, literature, or human life, and the poem itself is a kind of "battlecry."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Famously, when Rich received the National Book Award for her collection, ''Diving into the Wreck,'' she accepted it on behalf of all the female nominees, including [[Audre Lorde]] and [[Alice Walker]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;We, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, and Alice Walker, together accept this award in the name of all the women whose voices have gone and still go unheard in a patriarchal world, and in the name of those who, like us, have been tolerated as token women in this culture, often at great cost and in great pain. We believe that we can enrich ourselves more in supporting and giving to each other than by competing against each other; and that poetry— if it is poetry— exists in a realm beyond ranking and comparison. We symbolically join together here in refusing the terms of patriarchal competition and declaring that we will share this prize among us, to be used as best we can for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nbaacceptspeech_arich_74.html#.W5_7ri-ZN8c|title=National Book Awards Acceptance Speeches: ADRIENNE RICH, WINNER OF THE 1974 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR DIVING INTO THE WRECK|last=Rich|first=Adrienne|date=1974|website=National Book Foundation.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Audre Lorde]] (1934-1992) was a feminist poet whose poetry and prose writings have had a great impact on feminist thinking to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/09/feminist-lesbian-warrior-poet-rediscovering-work-audre-lorde|title=Feminist, lesbian, warrior, poet: rediscovering the work of Audre Lorde|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/what-audre-lordes-language-self-care-can-teach-us-after-metoo|title=What Audre Lorde's Language of Self-Care Can Teach Us After #MeToo|website=frieze.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde|title=Audre Lorde|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes thought of as a writer who developed a "black lesbian eroticism," Lorde's poetry also shows a deep ethical and moral commitment, which seeks to challenge racism, sexism, and homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53315369|title=Warrior poet : a biography of Audre Lorde|last=1948-|first=De Veaux, Alexis,|date=2004|publisher=W.W.

=== Feminist Anthologies in North America in the 1970s and 80s ===

In the 1970s and 80s, feminist poetry evolved alongside the feminist movement, becoming a useful tool for activist groups organised around [[radical feminism]], [[socialist feminism]], and [[lesbian feminism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Poetry readings became spaces for feminists to come together in cities and in rural communities, and talk about sexuality, women's roles, and the possibilities beyond heteronormative life.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Figures like [[Judy Grahn]] were figureheads for the women's movement, providing electrifying readings that enlivened and inspired audiences.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Often the poems were political, and sometimes the writers tried to use language that "ordinary women" could read and understand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Countering tokenism was also an important aspect of the feminist poetry project.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/143653/shattering-the-blue-velvet-chair|title=A Change of World, Episode 3: Shattering the Blue Velvet Chair - Poetry Off the Shelf|date=2018-09-26|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carolyn Forché]] describes the "blue velvet chair" effect, inspired by group portraits of canonical poets, in which one - but only one - woman writer was allowed to join the men, often sat in a Victorian blue velvet chair.&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;

As poetry took on a new significance for the feminist movement, so a number of new poetry anthologies were published which emphasised women's voices and experiences.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585915|title=The Oxford handbook of Canadian literature|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Sugars, Cynthia Conchita, 1963-|year=|isbn=9780199941865|location=New York, NY|pages=853|oclc=907585915}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthologies played an important role generally in opening up the political consciousness of poetry, an important example being [[Raymond Souster]]'s volume, ''New Wave Canada: The Explosion in Canadian Poetry'' (1966).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;[[Louis Dudek]] and Michael Gnarowski describe the anthology's embracing of counterculture, including new ideas about sexuality and the role of women.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Other anthologies began to focus specifically on women's writing, such as:

*''[[Sisterhood Is Powerful|Sisterhood is Powerful]]'' (1970) edited by [[Robin Morgan]];
*''[http://msmagazine.com/blog/2018/05/15/no-masks-celebrating-landmark-anthology-womens-poetry-45-years-later/ No More Masks!]'' (1971) edited by [[Florence Howe]] and [[Ellen Bass]];
*''[https://www.pacificaradioarchives.org/recording/bc1738 The World Split Open]'' (1972) edited by [[Louise Bernikow]];
*''Psyche'' (1973) edited by Barbara Segnitz and Carol Rainey;
*''New Poets, Women'' (1976) edited by Terry Wetherby;
*''Contemporary Women Poets'' (1977) edited by Jennifer McDowell and Milton Leventhal;
*''Open to Sun'' (1979) edited by Nora Jacquez Wieser;
*''[[Lesbian Poetry: An Anthology|Lesbian Poetry]]'' (1982) edited by Elly Bulkin and [[Joan Larkin]];
*''Daughters of the Sun, Women of the Moon: Poetry by Black Canadian Women'' (1990) edited by Ann Wallace.

Other anthologies created new canons of women's writing from the past, such as ''Black sister: poetry by black American women, 1746-1980'' (1981) edited by Erlene Stetson; or ''Writing Red: An Anthology of American Women Writers, 1930-1940'' (1987) edited by Paula Rabinowitz and Charlotte Nekola. Such anthologies "established solid ground for the communication and circulation of feminist ideas" in the American and Canadian Academies.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Conferences also provided important spaces for feminists to share and discuss ideas about the possibilities of poetry: for example a key moment for Canadian feminist poetry was the "Women and words / Les femmes et les motes" conference in 1983.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beverley|first=Andrea|date=2017|title='Women and Words'|url=https://champlainsociety.utpjournals.press/findings-trouvailles/2017/11/women-and-words-1983-visual-traces|journal=The Champlain Society - Findings|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Vancouver convention brought together women writers, publishers, and booksellers to discuss the issues of the Canadian literary world, including gender inequity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modern Feminist Poetry in North America ===
One change in the writing of women poets after the 1960s and 1970s was the possibility of writing about women's lives and experiences.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; To give authority to women's voices, writers like [[Honor Moore]] and [[Judy Grahn|Judy Graun]] held workshops specifically for women in order to overcome women's inner critics exacerbated by sexism.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; These networks of mentorship sprang up in feminist communities, and in universities.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

The work at this time was focussing on "images of women," and this often meant broadening representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Juhasz|first=Suzanne|date=1977|title=The critic as feminist: Reflections on women's poetry, feminism, and the art of criticism|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F00497878.1977.9978438|journal=Women's Studies|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=113–127|doi=10.1080/00497878.1977.9978438|issn=0049-7878|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This methodology eventually began to be criticised, however, because it failed to recognise the complications of violence embedded in the very structure of language.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sojka|first=Eugenia|date=2001|title=Canadian Feminist Writing and American Poetry|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1128&amp;context=clcweb|journal=CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture|volume=3.2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers influenced by the [[avant-garde]] and by [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry]] sought to challenge the idea of language's neutrality.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; US feminist language poets like [[Lyn Hejinian|Lynn Hejinian]] or [[Susan Howe]], or Canadian writers like [[Daphne Marlatt]] looked back to the legacy of experimentalist modernists like [[Gertrude Stein]], or [[Mina Loy]], and also to diverse sources of inspiration like [[Denise Levertov]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Nicole Brossard]], [[Phyllis Webb]], [[Louky Bersianik]], and [[Julia Kristeva]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  They also reframed the language poetics from male mentors like [[Charles Olson]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Gary Snyder]], or [[Allen Ginsberg]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Poets also sought to intervene in spheres traditionally dominated by men. Take for example [[Eileen Myles]]' intervention into politics in her 1992 "Write-in Campaign for President."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eileenmyles.net/howto.htm|title=1992 Write-in Campaign for President:  Eileen Myles|website=www.eileenmyles.net|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

By the time of the 1990s, and the rise of [[intersectionality]] as a key feminist term, many feminist poets resisted the term "woman poet," because it suggested "too confining a collective identity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also sought to undermine "the assumption that has sometimes structured feminist political organizing and even feminist literary publishing and criticism—that gender can be separated from race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality, and that white middleclass women first and foremost have the tools and the knowhow for the enterprise of analyzing gendered experience and literary production."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Present day feminist poetry in North America holds space for a great variety of poets tackling identity, sexuality, and gender issues. Key writings in the recent past include [[Claudia Rankine]]'s careful skewering of race related [[microaggression]]s in ''Citizen,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/04/23/claudia-rankine-new-way-writing-about-race/|title='A New Way of Writing About Race'|last=Laird|first=Nick|work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothea Laskey's "ferocious confession" in Rome for example,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://feministing.com/2014/07/31/feministing-readz-dorothea-laskys-rome/|title=Feministing Readz: Dorothea Lasky's Rome|work=Feministing|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bhanu Kapil's challenge the violent inherent in structures of language and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/laying-down-banlieue|title=L(a)ying Down in the Banlieue {{!}} Mute|website=www.metamute.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist Writing after Mary Wollstonecraft ===

Eighteenth century advocate for women's rights [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Mary Wollstonecraf]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t (1797-1851), put great emphasis on the power of the poetic imagination as a liberator tool, and many nineteenth century British women writers were inspired by Wollstonecraft to use poetry to enter public debates about gender roles, poverty, and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wollstonecraft|first=Mary|date=1797|title="On Poetry and Our Relish for the Beauties of Nature"|url=|journal=Monthly Magazine|volume=April|pages=279–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/mary-wollstonecraft-shelley|title=Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The verse-novel ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856) by [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] (1806-1861) is one such feminist work, which challenged a prevailing attitude that women's lives were incompatible with writing poetry.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/elizabeth-barrett-browning|title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aurora Leigh'' had a very public impact, for example influencing the views of American social reformer [[Susan B. Anthony]] regarding the traditional roles of women, especially in relation to the tension between marriage and women's individuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Susan B.

=== Late Nineteenth Century Feminist Poets in Britain ===

Often cited as an early feminist poet, [[Amy Levy]] (1861-1889) is described by writer [[Elaine Feinstein]] as the first modern Jewish woman poet.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Amy Levy : critical essays|last=Valman|first=Nadia|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780821443071|location=Athens|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/jewess-in-nineteenthcentury-british-literary-culture/A059306B33CC165DA9E8AC54E5816E4C|title=The Jewess in Nineteenth-Century British Literary Culture|last=Valman|first=Nadia|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780511484964|location=Cambridge|pages=119|language=en|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511484964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/amy-levy|title=Amy Levy|last=Levy|first=Amy|date=2013-09-30|website=Amy Levy|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 13, Levy published her first poem in the feminist journal, the ''Pelican'', and she grew to maturity surrounded by writers and social reformers on the London scene of the era, such as [[Eleanor Marx]] and [[Olive Schreiner|Olive Schreiber]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though nothing is known for sure about Levy's sexual relationships, she is often thought of as a lesbian poet, though some critics have challenged affixing a sexual category to Levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women’s Poetry, Late Romantic to Late Victorian: Gender and Genre, 1830–1900|last=Blain|first=Virginia|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=|location=London|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy's poems, however, are an early example of poetry that challenges [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/blog/amy-levy-1861-1889-'minor-poet'|title=Amy Levy (1861-1889): a ‘Minor Poet’|last=|first=|date=|website=Senate House Library, University of London|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953030317|title=Odd women? : spinsters, lesbians and widows in British women's fiction, 1850s-1930s|last=Emma,|first=Liggins,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781526111654|location=Manchester|pages=4|oclc=953030317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twentieth Century Feminist Poets in Britain ===

Levy is often thought of as prefiguring or representing an early version of the New Woman, a stereotypical image of an independent woman who often worked rather than relying on her menfolk, and was associated with [[Gender bender|gender bending]] and deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Dolores|date=1991|title=The "New Woman" as Prometheus: Women Artists Depict Women Smoking|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1358183|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=12|issue=1|pages=3–9|doi=10.2307/1358183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/20661/|title=Amy Levy: her life, her poetry and the era of the new woman|last=Christine|first=Pullen,|date=2000|website=eprints.kingston.ac.uk|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century was an era of surplus women, who had to work to survive: by 1911, 77 per cent of women workers in the UK were single.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=V.|last2=Marland|first2=H.|date=2009-01-01|title=From Danger and Motherhood to Health and Beauty: Health Advice for the Factory Girl in Early Twentieth-Century Britain|url=https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article/20/4/454/1690021|journal=Twentieth Century British History|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=454–481|doi=10.1093/tcbh/hwp027|issn=0955-2359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the struggle of [[suffragette]]s campaigning for votes for women, many British feminist poets sought to emulate the example of Victorian women writers, often expressing their radical political beliefs through poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://britlitsurvey2.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/mary-wollstonecraft-influence-beyond-the-grave/|title=Mary Wollstonecraft: Influence Beyond the Grave|last=|first=|date=|website=British Literature 1700-1900, A Course Blog|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the writers were not professional poets, but wrote out of necessity, including satirical portraits of politicians, or writings from prison, as in ''Holloway Jingles'', a collection of writing from imprisoned women collated by the Glasgow Branch of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54206569|title=Literature of the women's suffrage campaign in England|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Broadview Press|others=Nelson, Carolyn Christensen.|year=|isbn=1551115115|location=Peterborough, Ont.|pages=153|oclc=54206569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British Feminist Poets and Modernism ===

In the inter-war years, British women poets associated with modernism began to find themselves public figures, though their feminist ideas sometimes came into conflict with the literary establishment which remained a kind of "exclusive male club."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, Modernism and British Poetry, 1910–1939: Resisting Femininity|last=Dowson|first=Jane|publisher=Ash gate|year=2002|isbn=9780754604631|location=Burlington, VT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often these writers are difficult to categorize in relation to literary groups traditionally used, like the [[avant-garde]] or [[Modernism|modernists]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was also a period when American women poets living in Britain made an important contribution to the writing of the day: writers like [[H.D.]], [[Mina Loy]], and [[Amy Lowell]] all combined radical poetic content with experimentation of form, allowing them to explore feminist polemic and non-heteronormative sexualities in innovative new modes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other British feminist poets of the time like [[Anna Wickham]], [[Charlotte Mew]], and [[Sylvia Townsend Warner]], receive less critical attention, but also sought to challenge and reevaluate tropes of femininity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Post 1960s Feminist Poetry in Britain ===

During the 1960s, the Women's Liberation Movement in the UK had a great influence on the literary world.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/sisterhood/articles/feminist-literature|title=Feminist literature|last=Sisterhood and After Research Team|first=|date=|website=The British Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist publishers, [[Virago Press|Virago]] (founded in 1973), [[Onlywomen Press|Onlywomen]] (1974), The Women's Press (1978), and Sheba (1980), were established, alongside magazines like [https://www.bl.uk/spare-rib Spare Rib].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Like their counterparts in the US, British feminist editors in the 1970s and 80s created landmark anthologies of women's poetry, which foregrounded the variety and strength of women's writing.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These included Lilian Mohin's ''One Foot on the Mountain'' (1979), [[Jeni Couzyn]]'s ''The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Women Poets'' (1985), Moira Ferguson's ''First Feminists: British Women Writers 1578-1799'' (1985), Kate Armstrong's ''Fresh Oceans'' (1989), Jude Brigley's ''Exchanges'' (1990), and Catherine Kerrigan's ''An Anthology of Scottish Women Poets'' (1991).

[[Image:Tibaes Church Interior.JPG|thumb|Gilded woodcarving in the [[monastery of Tibães]], an example of Portuguese [[rococo]], by the architect [[André Soares (architect)|André Soares]], 1757-1760, [[Braga]]]]
'''Gilded woodcarving in Portugal''' is, along with [[tile]], one of the country's most original and rich artistic expressions. It is usually used in the interior decoration of churches and cathedrals and of noble halls in palaces and large public buildings. An impressive collection of [[altarpiece]]s are found in Portuguese churches. Originating in the Gothic era, Portuguese gilded woodcarving assumed a nationalist character during the 17th century and reached its height in the reign of King [[D. João V]]. In the 19th century it lost its originality and began to disappear with the end of the revival era.

==Comparison==
Gilded woodcarving is a less expensive and more flamboyant artform than other technically more demanding types of decoration, such as sculpture or painting, although tile is also inexpensive. The amount of gold required is relatively small. It does not require the extensive training of a sculptor or painter. The forms are copied and adapted from decorative architecture and inspiration taken from books. During the seventeenth century a typically Portuguese vocabulary developed. After being transported to the empire, it adapted to local traditions and artistic capacities, as is visible in [[Brazil]] or in [[India]] – mainly in [[Goa]].

Artists take commissions from regional orders to guarantee the activity of their workshop, sometimes making several related works in a specific geographical area. Examples exist in colour, white or natural wood, but without the visual impact of the gilded carvings.

== Gothic, and Renaissance Manueline ==
Gilded woodcarving in [[Portugal]] started during the Gothic period following architectural models, taken mainly from [[sculpture]] and goldsmithery, using the decorative vocabulary of the style. Gothic arches, [[pinnacle]]s, columns, etc., are associated with [[sculpture]] or [[painting]]. The typical form was a wooden structure, with the gold carving kept for the architectural part of the “machine” and the rest of the elements left either in plain wood or covered with colour. In spite of the small number of surviving altarpieces (the overwhelming majority was replaced during the [[Baroque]] period), it is known that they followed the international taste, such as the main [[altarpiece]] in the old Cathedral of [[Coimbra]].

The [[Manueline]]  follows the vocabulary of architecture, using mainly the portal structure, giving importance to the [[heraldic]], [[armillary sphere]], Cross of Christ and sculpted naturalistic elements. The main examples, [[altarpiece]] and Choir Stalls, from [[Convent of the Order of Christ]] in [[Tomar]] and [[Monastery of Alcobaça]], disappeared, but the monumental Choir Stalls from [[Santa Cruz Monastery]] in Coimbra remains. The wood gilt followed the approach of northern [[Europe]], adjusted with the Portuguese aesthetic at the time and was made by Flemish master [[Machim]].

The [[Renaissance]] followed the architectural decoration, but without golden carving, employing painting and sculpture and following the classic imagination from books of the time. The carved decoration in wood was close to the intended stone forms, visible in portals, [[tomb]]s or even in [[goldsmithery]]. The preference for large altarpieces in stone or painting did not allow the development of woodcarving as an autonomous form of expression, leaving it a decorative art. The later [[Mannerism]] provided the necessary conditions for autonomous gilded woodcarving to arise.

==Mannerism==
[[Image:Igreja de Camarate (Imagem).jpg|thumb|Altar in gilded woodcarving inside the church of [[Camarate]]]]
Economic and other factors led to the expansion of gilt woodcarving during the Mannerist era. The economic crisis at the end of the sixteenth century, the growing importance of the [[Jesuits]], the loss of the [[spice trade]] and, finally, the death of King [[D. Sebastião]] in [[Alcácer Quibir]], cause a gradual reduction of economic resources and the reduction of major programmes of expensive [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], because they were considered a major art, and more subject to the rules imposed by the [[Council of Trent]]. Woodcarving was the perfect decorative type for a time of economic and spiritual crisis, a consequence of the rupture between Catholics and Protestants. The woodcarvings dazzled - giving the idea of wealth - and adapted to all directives of the [[Catholic Church]], while essentially exploring the architectural form. The altarpiece became a composition of architectural character, often designed by architects and subsequently adapted by the artist. The carvings often covered an entire wall and operated as a [[picture frame]]. Woodcarving gained autonomy and left the simple task of framing works of art.

The set is built into floors, with several kinds of solutions. Triumph arches might be combined with [[sculpture]], usually in the choir, allowing the space behind the decorated altarpiece to be seen. Examples include the monumental little-painted altarpieces of the choir at [[Church of São Domingos de Benfica]] and [[Church of Luz]] in [[Carnide]] - [[Lisbon]] and the highly painted Carnide altarpiece, executed by [[Francisco Venegas]] with the collaboration of [[Diogo Teixeira]].

The main altarpiece of [[Church of São Roque]] in [[Lisbon]] belongs to another group, typical of the Jesuitical churches. São Roque in Lisbon is the head of the series for the whole Portuguese empire. It is characterized by its elaborate decoration, well-structured lines, with clear classical references, several floors, columns and well compartmentalised spaces. The scheme was much repeated in Jesuit churches. The [[Cathedral of Portalegre]] exhibits an important variation of this scheme. The painting altarpiece is framed by a classic set of columns, [[relief]]s and [[sculpture]].

==The Baroque==
[[Image:StFranciscoChurch1-CCBY.jpg|thumb|Baroque gilded woodcarving, [[São Francisco Church and Convent]] (1708-1752), Brazil]]
This period was the most monumental phase of woodwork in Portugal and Brazil.

With the end of 60 years of forced Iberian unification under the government of the Spanish kings [[Philip II of Portugal|Felipe II]], [[Philip III of Portugal|III]] and [[Felipe IV|IV]], the restoration of independence in 1640 and subsequent war, woodcarving in Portugal detached from Spanish baroque models. In difficult economic times, woodcarving gained in meaning, as sculpture and painting were reduced in altarpieces, leaving behind the classical inspirations, taken from international books arriving through Spain. The inspiration is clearly taken from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and Manueline portals. The design flowed from the first while the decoration adopted the latter's naturalistic style.

The altarpiece resembles a powerful machine, built with concentric [[archivolt]]s, classical spiral columns (pseudo salomonic), platforms and throne. The decoration is based mainly on dispersed leaves covering the whole set. The altarpiece is undoubtedly Baroque, although presenting characteristics clearly opposed to the Spanish models.

Iberian peace, and the discovery of Brazilian gold and diamonds make Portugal under King D. João V Europe's richest country, allowing the development of international Baroque art in all forms. Portuguese taste adjusted to international models and was baptised "[[Joanina]]". It converted the archivolts to trim cut, incorporated sculpture-like angels, garlands, vegetal-like forms, birds and architectural elements. It kept the spiral columns, gallery and throne. The decor is suggestive of sculpture and spreads throughout the church, covering every available surface - vaults, walls, columns, arches and pulpits. Notable examples are scattered from north to south, but the main ones are the Church of [[São Francisco (Porto)]] and Church of [[Santa Clara (Porto)]]. Both were completely covered in baroque gilded woodcarving giving them the look of a golden cave. The most significant examples in Porto are the following:

The King owned gilded woodcarving carriages, among which are three baroque carriages used by his embassy to the [[Pope]], now in the [[Museu Nacional dos Coches]] (National Carriages Museum), in Lisbon.

==The Rococo==

King [[D. João V]] was succeeded by his son King [[D. José]]. The abundance of resources sustained the politics of splendour, based in diamonds and precious metals from Brazil, allowing for an architecture of luxury and modern decorative programmes, after [[Rococo]]. During the period Portugal survived its worst natural catastrophe and one of the worst in Europe - the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].

Rococo gilded woodcarving is subdivided into several currents or regional styles, allowing it to maintain variety and originality, from north to south. Shells, angels, volutes, leaves, puti, columns, spiral columns (pseudo-salomonic), painted materials and a lot of gold are its formal vocabulary.

Two major variations developed around Lisbon. Some works followed the royal house, characterized by elegance and the quality of the decorative motives, but with the Rococo vocabulary, and with influences remaining from the Joanina woodcarving and the chapel of São João Baptista in the Church of São Roque. Example include:

* Chapel of the [[Queluz National Palace]] – With painted materials simulating colour marbles, some gilded woodcarving, very elegant with a classic touch.
* Main altar in [[Madre de Deus convent in Lisbon]] - With Joanina influence, keeping gallery and throne, it has the typical vocabulary of Rococo. It is completely golden and perfectly integrated in the building.

The [[pombaline]] churches developed a different expressin. The earthquake reconstruction used prefabricated materials. These buildings have internal Rococo decoration, painted materials in wood and plaster, gallery and throne in the main altar, columns, architectural forms, a few golden shapes, some painting (the work of [[Pedro Alexandrino de Carvalho]] is the most important) and sculpture. Examples include: [[Church of Santo António of Lisbon]] (built in the birthplace of   [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony]]), [[Church of the Encarnação]], Magdalena Church and [[Basilica of Nossa Senhora dos Mártires]]. In less destroyed buildings, the aim was to harmonise the pombaline shapes with existing decor.

The non-sacred ("profane") French influence was visible. It was characterized by sumptuous decorations in gilded woodcarvings and/or plaster simulating materials, normally inside palaces. It was popular among the aristocracy. The main example is the throne room of the [[Queluz National Palace]].

In the area of Coimbra a regional school started with the main altarpiece of the Church of the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz]]. Structures are Rococo, but the pombaline influence is obvious in painted marbles, columns, gallery and throne. The influence of "Joanina", mainly in the upper conclusion, with cute fronton and angel-like sculptures is visible.

The north of Portugal developed an impressive list of Rococo altarpieces, fusing Rococo and “Joanino”. The works were completely golden, associated with painting or sculpture.

Around [[Braga]], thanks to the work of [[André Soares (architect)|André Soares]] another regional school developed, characterized by the fusion of colour and gold, in altarpieces of great elegance and quality. These augur the approaching [[Classicist]] period.  Examples are:

* Church of the [[Monastery of Tibães]] – Main altarpiece, arch of triumph and monumental organ.
* [[Carmo Church (Porto)]] - Chapel.
* [[Church of Nossa Senhora da Vitória (Porto)]] – Main altarpiece.
* [[Church of Santa Maria Madalena (Braga)]] - called Chapel of Falperra – Main altarpiece.

In southern Portugal woodcarving is less common because of the abundance of marble, obviating the need to develop timber structures imitating marble.. Notable examples in the [[Alentejo]] and [[Algarve]] are different from the rest of the country. This originality is particularly visible in [[Évora]], in:

* [[Convent of Carmo (Évora)]]
* [[Convent of Remédios (Évora)]] - Absolutely remarkable.
* [[Convent of São José (Évora)]]
* [[Church of Mercês (Évora)]]
* [[São Francisco Church (Faro)]] - Remarkable mixture of gilded woodcarving and tile.

Carriages continued to bear carvings and gilt. The reign of Queen [[D. Maria I]] produced the latest major examples exhibited in the Museu Nacional dos Coches.

==Neoclassicism==

[[Neoclassicism]] marked the end of quality woodcarving in Portugal. Few churches were built, supporting few examples. They follow the classical Roman models and because the requirement to respect classic architectural orders, cost their originality. Noteworthy examples include the [[Church of Ordem Terceira de São Francisco]] and the altar of [[Church of Lapa (Porto)]]. Another important factor is the exile of the royal family to Brazil during the French invasion, where the country (The United Kingdom of Portugal and Brazil) concentrate its artistic investments. Seventeen years later, when the King returned, Romanticism was installed and gilded woodcarving had lost its meaning and originality, overwhelmed by the revivalist fashion.

}}The '''Group of Six Artists''' ({{lang-hr|Grupa šestorice autora}}) was an [[artist collective]] founded in 1975 by the Croatian artists [[Mladen Stilinović|Mladen]], Sven Stilinović, Fedor Vučemilović, [[Boris Demur]], [[Vlado Martek]] and [[Željko Jerman]] in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Stipančić, Branka: Vlado Martek – Poezija u akciji / Poetry in Action, Zagreb 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In defiance of restrictions set by local art institutions, they performed their pieces in open air spaces using objects such as sun loungers and urban projectors (projecting images onto buildings). They also exhibited in city squares.&lt;ref name="monoskop"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://monoskop.org/Group_of_Six_Artists |title=Group of Six Artists | work=monoskop.org | accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "exhibition-actions" were shown in Croatia and abroad, including the municipal bath on the [[Sava|Sava River]] in the Upper Town Zagreb centre, in Sopot in New Zagreb in the main square in Zagreb (1975), on the beach in Mošćenička Draga (1976), in Venice (1978) and in Belgrade (1976-1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mladenstilinovic.com/bio/|title=BIOGRAPHY|date=4 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="monoskop" /&gt; 

These exhibitions would usually last a day and were often meant to provoke.&lt;ref name="monoskop" /&gt; Between 1975 and 1979, the Group of Six Artists performed and documented more than 20 pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/poet/item/21773/17/Vlado-Martek|title=Vlado Martek (poet) - Croatia - Poetry International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Group of Six Artists were influenced by their predecessors, the [[Gorgona Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avantgarde-museum.com/en/museum/collection/4511-GORGONA/influence-to-3897-VLADO-MARTEK/|title=GORGONA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, their aim was to provide a different perspective on life and art, expressing themselves freely.&lt;ref name="monoskop" /&gt;

In addition to their exhibition-actions, the Group of Six Artists launched the self-published magazine ''MAJ/75'', printed in the studio of Vlasta Delimar and [[Željko Jerman]]. Eighteen issues of the magazine were printed between 1978 and 1984, and the publication became an additional alternative exhibition space for the Group of Six Artists and other eastern European creatives, including Vlasta Delimar, Tomislav Gotovac, Sanja Iveković, [[Dimitrije Bašičević|Mangelos]], Balint Szombathy, Raša Todosijević and Goran Trbuljak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/ScenesFromZagreb/|title=Scenes from Zagreb|work=moma.org|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5212">'''Grunge speak''' was a [[hoax]] created by Megan Jasper, then [[receptionist]] for [[Sub Pop|Sub Pop Records]]. Under pressure from a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'' who wanted to know if [[grunge]] fans had their own [[slang]], Jasper, 25 at the time, told the reporter a set of slang terms that she claimed were associated with the [[Seattle]] grunge scene in the early 1990s, but which she had in fact invented on the spot. The information given by Jasper appeared in the sidebar of a November 15, 1992, feature article by reporter Rick Marin in the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Marin, Rick. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/style/grunge-a-success-story.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Grunge: A Success Story]" (November 15, 1992). ''New York Times''. Section 9, Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The sidebar, titled "Lexicon of Grunge: Breaking the Code," mistakenly said that Jasper was working for [[Caroline Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Marin, Rick. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/style/grunge-a-success-story.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Lexicon of Grunge: Breaking the Code]" (November 15, 1992). ''New York Times.'' Section 9, Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In truth, there was no particular slang language used in the Seattle grunge scene. Many{{who|date=July 2014}} had in fact resented the assumption by the ''Times'' that they even had a slang, as well as the claim that it was "coming soon to a high school or mall near you."

[[Thomas Frank]]  of ''[[The Baffler]],'' a journal of [[cultural criticism]], demonstrated that the list was a hoax.  He revealed that Jasper had purposely misled the ''Times'' as well as the British ''[[SKY magazine]]'' as a prank.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Thomas. "[http://thebaffler.com/salvos/harsh-realm-mr-sulzberger Harsh Realm, Mr. Sulzberger!]" (Winter/Spring 1993). ''The Baffler''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jasper had been sick of the attention that reporters were paying to people involved in the Seattle grunge scene, and thus pulled the prank to get back at them for their relentless fascination.

The ''Times'' demanded that Frank fax over an apology for claiming it had printed false information, believing that it was Frank who was the hoaxer. Frank instead sent a letter standing by the story.  "When The [[Newspaper of Record]] goes searching for the Next Big Thing and the Next Big Thing piddles on its leg," he wrote, "we think that's funny."&lt;ref&gt;Neyfakh, Leon. "[http://observer.com/2009/08/remember-the-grunge-hoax/ Remember the Grunge Hoax]" (August 14, 2009). ''[[New York Observer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank considered the article to be part of an attempt by mainstream culture to co-opt the grunge scene and felt that the ''Times'' had gotten what it deserved.

Shortly after the release of ''The Baffler''{{'s}} story, some people in Seattle began selling and wearing t-shirts with the words "lamestain" and "harsh realm" printed in the same font as the famous banner of the ''Times''. The words themselves never caught on as actual slang within the grunge scene (though "score" and "dish" are in use elsewhere). One of the terms, "[[Harsh Realm|harsh realm]]", was used as the title of a [[Science fiction|science-fiction]] [[comic book]] and a short-lived 1999 [[television series]] based on it, and was used by characters in ''[[The Dirty Pair]]'' comics written and drawn by [[Adam Warren (comics)|Adam Warren]] as part of their futuristic slang (where it had the same definition as the one Jasper created for the term). The events of Jasper's prank would be documented in the 1996 film ''[[Hype!]]'', a documentary about the grunge scene of the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Pray, D., Helvey-Pray Productions. ''Hype!''. 1996. [[Republic Pictures]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grunge speak words==
During the interview, Jasper made up the following terms and their definitions:
*'''bloated, big bag of bloatation'''&amp;nbsp;– drunk
*'''bound-and-hagged'''&amp;nbsp;– staying home on Friday or Saturday night
*'''cob nobbler'''&amp;nbsp;– loser
*'''dish'''&amp;nbsp;– desirable guy
*'''fuzz'''&amp;nbsp;– heavy wool sweaters
*'''harsh realm'''&amp;nbsp;– bummer
*'''kickers'''&amp;nbsp;– heavy boots
*'''lamestain'''&amp;nbsp;– uncool person
*'''plats'''&amp;nbsp;– platform shoes
*'''rock on'''&amp;nbsp;– a happy goodbye
*'''score'''&amp;nbsp;– great
*'''swingin' on the flippity-flop'''&amp;nbsp;– hanging out
*'''tom-tom club'''&amp;nbsp;– uncool outsiders
*'''wack slacks'''&amp;nbsp;– old ripped jeans

'''Guy Ben-Ari''' (born 1984 in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]) is an Israeli painter living and working in [[New York City]].

== Biography ==
Ben-Ari received his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from [[Columbia University]]'s School of the Arts in 2011, and his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] with honors from [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 2009, where he received the Presser Award for Excellence in Painting.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}} In 2008, Ben-Ari was selected for the Exchange Program for Merit Students to study Painting at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]], [[University College London|UCL]], [[London]].{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

Ben-Ari's body of work focuses on the connection between [[Psychoanalytic theory]], [[Semiotics]] and the medium of painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voxpopuligallery.org/exhibitions/yes-to-burning-eyes/|title=Yes to Burning Eyes|last=|first=|date=2012|website=voxpopuligallery.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]’s notion that 'The word kills the thing'&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques (1977). Ecrits. A Selection. Trans. A. Sheridan. London, Tavistock. p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; by fixing its meaning, he uses an illustrative approach to examine the way metaphors, when taken literally, become dysfunctional. Ben-Ari is interested in the implications of using painting, a medium that rejects [[literal interpretation]], to analyze concepts that reject visual interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lmcc.net/person/guy-ben-ari/|title=Guy Ben-Ari|website=Lower Manhattan Cultural Council|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben-Ari's recent work uses painting as a framework to study elements of [[post-structuralism]] and psychoanalytic theory. Much of his work originates in [[jokes]] or [[illustration]]s of related concepts and situations, as he attempts to employ a literal strategy in an image, without collapsing into a mere illustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Artis Agenda|title=Guy Ben-Ari: Yes to Burning Eyes at Vox Populi Gallery, Philadelphia |url=http://www.artiscontemporary.org/agenda_detail.php?id=577|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aicf.org/event/guy-ben-ari-2/|title=Guy Ben-Ari, Out of Sight – Solo Exhibition|last=|first=|date=2013|work=America-Israel Cultural Foundation|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, Ben-Ari runs an arts cultural group with artist [[Leah Wolf]] called ''Meta Meta Meta'', to help support the arts in their community in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://patch.com/new-york/heights-dumbo/brooklyn-management-company-offers-dozen-artists-low-rent-dumbo-studios|title=Brooklyn Management Company Offers A Dozen Artists Low-Rent DUMBO Studios|date=2017-03-21|work=Brooklyn Heights-DUMBO, NY Patch|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben-Ari is a recent artist-in-residence at the Lower East Side Printshop, Triangle Arts in Brooklyn, New York and was a SIP Award recipient from the Robert Blackburn [[Printmaking]] Workshop Program at The Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Ben-Ari also worked as an [[Artist-in-residence|Artist-in-Residence]] at the [[Lower Manhattan Cultural Council]] Workspace Residency and at the NARS Foundation, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Triangle|title=Artist-In-Residence: Guy Ben-Ari|url=http://www.triangle-arts-association.org/post/137515913991/artist-in-residence-guy-ben-ari|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanzan and Jittoku by SesshûTôyô, Muromachi.jpg|thumb|320x320px|''Kanzan and Jittoku'' by Sesshū Tōyō, Muromachi period]]
[[Hanshan (poet)|'''Hanshan''']] 寒山 and [[Shide (monk)|'''Shide''']] 拾得 (Japanese: Kanzan and Jittoku) are popular figures in Zen painting. They have been depicted many times as a pair, and the duo has become an identifiable motif in Zen painting and representative of deeper meanings in Zen Buddhism as a whole. Hanshan, whose name means “Cold Mountain,” is believed to be an eccentric Zen poet from the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]] (618-907) who lived on the Tiantang Mountain in Zhejiang Province. Shide, whose name means “foundling” or “pickup,” was a kitchen worker at the nearby Guoqing Temple. He is said to have been abandoned by his family, and then found and raised by [[Fenggan]], another Zen eccentric. As legend goes, the two formed a close friendship, with Shide stealing scraps from the kitchen to bring to Hanshan, and the pair spending time in nature, away from societal structure and institutions. Little is verified about the lives of these two figures, and they “have come to exist only in the works they have left behind&lt;ref&gt;Robert Borgen “The Legend of Hanshan: A Neglected Source.” www.jstor.org/stable/604274&lt;/ref&gt;.”

Hanshan and Shide are easily recognizable in Zen painting. They are almost always depicted wearing scrappy and ratty clothing, appearing disheveled, wandering in nature, laughing, or with mischievous looks on their faces. Hanshan is identified by the scroll he holds in his hand, alluding to his work as a poet. Shide is identified by the broom he holds, which references his work as a kitchen cleaner at the monastery. 

== Significance and Symbolism ==
The figures Hanshan and Shide, while often depicted simply and with humor, carry deep symbolism for the religion of Zen Buddhism as a whole. As seen in the attached images, Hanshan’s scroll is often depicted blank. This indicates “that written or printed sutras are nothing compared to the book of nature.” Shide’s broom can be read as a tool to “sweep out of the cobwebs in our impure souls.” Their carefree attitude symbolizes their knowledge that “the things which most men strive for are illusions, and that what really counts is not rank or riches but their own Buddha nature&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Munsterberg, “Zen and Art.” www.jstor.org/stable/774379&lt;/ref&gt;.” Additionally, “in these lunatic figures the Zen artists portray something slightly more than a parody of their own wu-shin or mindless way of life, for as genius is to madness close allied there is a suggestive parallel between the meaningless babble of the happy lunatic and the purposeless life of the Zen sage&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watts. “The Way of Zen.” The Way of Zen. Vintage Books, 1999, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;.” Hanshan and Shide serve the purpose of causing viewers to “confront the fundamental meaning of their own existence&lt;ref&gt;Katsuhiro Yoshizawa, The Religious Art of Zen Master Hakuin, (Counterpoint: 2009), https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/georgetown/detail.action?docID=478380.&lt;/ref&gt;.”

Many scholars during the [[Muromachi period]] regarded Hanshan and Shide to be incarnations of the bodhisattvas [[Manjushri|Mañjuśrī]] (Monju) and [[Samantabhadra|Samantabadhra]] (Fugen)&lt;ref&gt;“Itō Jakuchū | Hanshan and Shide (Japanese: Kanzan and Jittoku) | Japan | Edo Period (1615–1868) | The Met,” www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/670929.&lt;/ref&gt;. These bodhisattvas represent wisdom and Buddhist practice respectively, perhaps creating a parallel between the wisdom and practice of Hanshan and Shide. Mañjuśrī is often connected to poetry, oratory, and writing, in the same way that Hanshan is connected to his own poems. This comparison suggests the hidden significance of these otherwise eccentric and simple characters&lt;ref&gt;Tim Lerch, “Manjushri and Samantabhadra,” https://kwanumzen.org/teaching-library/2003/09/01/manjushri-and-samantabhadra&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Visual Representations ==

=== Four Sleepers ===
Early representations of Hanshan and Shide in Zen painting can be found in images depicting the “Four Sleepers.” The exact creation of this theme is unclear, though it is believed to have been established as a part of Zen painting in China by the early thirteenth century. “The earliest reference known to us concerning the artistic treatment of the subject is a poem in the Rujing Heshang yulu composed by the Chinese abbot Changweng Rujing (1163-1228) for a now lost painting of the ‘Four Sleepers&lt;ref name="''brinker''"&gt;Helmut Brinker “ZEN Masters of Meditation in Images and Writings,” www.jstor.org/stable/1522704&lt;/ref&gt;.’”

One example of early renderings of the “Four Sleepers” is by the Japanese artist [[Mokuan Reien|Mokuan]]. In Mokuan’s “Four Sleepers,” Hanshan and Shide are seen sleeping soundly on the ground with Fenggan (the Zen master who found and raised Shide) and Fenggan’s tiger. The inscription on this hanging scroll reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Old Fenggan embraces his tiger and sleeps, &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;All huddled together with Shide and Hanshan. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;They dream their big dream, which lingers on&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Levine and Yukio Lippit, Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan, (Japan Society: 2007), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;The imagery of the Four Sleepers was made popular in Japan through paintings imported from China. Japanese interpretations of the theme emerged as early as the fourteenth century&lt;ref name="''tawaraya''"&gt;“Tawaraya Sōtatsu | The Four Sleepers | Japan | Edo Period (1615–1868) | The Met,” metmuseum.org/exhibitions/view?exhibitionId=%7B5bc821dc-2782-4897-854f-ebbdc0f09577%7D&amp;oid=77247.&lt;/ref&gt;.'"

Images of the Four Sleepers are meant to symbolize “peaceful coexistence with nature and the enlightened mind&lt;ref name="''tawaraya''" /&gt;,” as the three men sleep soundly among a tiger and outdoors, in nature. Additionally, the sleeping figures hint at a “dream world that cannot be represented on paper” or a “peacefulness of Enlightenment that cannot be attained in the waking world&lt;ref&gt;“World Art.” Annenberg Learner, www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/61/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;.” Key themes of Zen Buddhism are given shape in images of the Four Sleepers, such as the non-duality of man and animal sleeping peacefully, the serenity of enlightenment, and expunging of opposite figures and forces&lt;ref name="''brinker''" /&gt;.

=== Representations as a pair ===
Hanshan and Shide are most commonly depicted with just one another. In Zen painting, the two eccentrics are typically shown laughing uproariously, frequently at a Zen joke and at the expense of the “pompous monks” at their monastery&lt;ref&gt;“Kanzan &amp; Jittoku by Chuzan.” Robyn Buntin of Honolulu Gallery, www.robynbuntin.com/Kanzan-Jittoku-p/4524.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;. Hanshan and Shide wear shabby clothing and are easily identifiable by their scroll and broom, respectively. Over centuries, Zen painters have depicted these figures in different styles and manners, though keep to the main themes, motifs, and ideas that the pair represents.

During the 14th century, important Zen painters like Yintuoluo, a Chan monk born in India who lived in China during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]] (1279-1368), created images of Hanshan and Shide that are now considered national treasures in Japan. During this period, painters followed traditional standards for figure painting, with a combination of thin and delicate lines to render their faces and thicker lines on their bodies. These images were almost always accompanied by an inscription, though not all have been translated or attributed to an author. This style of painting is also exemplified through Kao Ninga’s ''Zen Eccentrics Hanshan and Shide'', a pair of paintings depicting the figures.

===== 15th Century =====

[[File:豊干寒山拾得図-Fenggan, Hanshan, and Shide MET DP361145.jpg|thumb|267x267px|''Fenggan, Hanshan, and Shide'' by Resai, Muromachi Period, 1st half of the 15th century, ink and color on paper, Metropolitan Museum of Art]][[File:伊藤若冲筆 伝池大雅賛 寒山拾得図-Hanshan and Shide (Japanese- Kanzan and Jittoku) MET DP-12232-277.jpg|thumb|''Hanshan and Shide'' by Ike Taiga, late 18th century, ink on paper, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]The subject of Hanshan and Shide remained popular in Zen painting in the 15th century. During the [[Muromachi period|Muromachi Period]] (1392-1573) in Japan, artists like Resai experimented with color and tonality more so than in previous centuries. Resai’s depiction of Hanshan and Shide is complex and contemplative, as the pair is seen on the pair on a mountain’s edge with a vast space of nothingness beyond where they stand. They are shown in discussion and pointing out to the nothingness, perhaps exploring different facets of enlightenment as they often did. There are varying tones of ink, and areas are shaded and filled in. Resai stays true to common themes with Hanshan and Shide, showing their scroll, broom, joyous faces, and depicting them in nature.

Also painting during the Muromachi period was [[Sesshū Tōyō]], who is described as the most prominent master of ink painting from this time. Sesshu Toyo’s painting of Kanzan and Jittoku differs from others seen, as it is a bust length image of the two figures’ faces. Sesshu Toyo pays great attention to rendering their emotions and mischievous glances, as they laugh together while Kanzan holds a blank scroll. Through this, he captures the essence of the two figures. Sesshu Toyo employs variation in ink tonalities and in the thickness of his lines. There is three dimensional modeling to the faces and hands of the figures, demonstrating a more elevated and advanced style of painting.

==== Modern Representations ====
Representations of Hanshan and Shide remained very popular in Japan in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, and well into the 19th century.

In the late 18th century, during the [[Edo period|Edo Period]] (1615-1868), Ito Jakuchu painted ''Hanshan and Shide (Kanzan and Jittoku)''. His rendition is more abstract than any of the aforementioned paintings. The figures are depicted embracing and in opposites – one in a black robe and one in a white robe, with a scroll at their feet and a broom rising up. There is no background, placing the focus on the figures themselves. The inscription is attributed to Ike Taiga (Japanese, 1723-1776) and reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;"One is the Bodhisattva of the Great Path,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The other is the Patriarch of the Great Buddha.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What evidence is there? A broken broom, a tattered scripture, and unrhymed verse.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Kanzan, Jittoku shizuki-zu by Mochizuki Gyokusen.jpg|left|thumb|344x344px|''Hanshan and Shide'' by Mochizuki Gyokusen, 19th century, Museum of Fine Arts Boston]]

The inscription references their emanations of Mañjuśrī (Monju) and Samantabadhra (Fugen).

In the 19th century, Japanese Zen painter Mochizuki Gyokuzen created a hanging scroll depicting the pair. Here, we see a shift in style from previous centuries. This painting is done in a more graphic manner, and Mochizuki Gyokuzen employs different colors and sharper lines to create a more cartoon-looking image of the pair. The figures are emotive and looking upwards at something outside of the picture frame, rather than at a scroll. Still, we see the common motifs of the ragged clothing, the broom, and the blank scroll in Kanzan’s hand.

Also in the 19th century, during the [[Meiji period|Meiji Period]] (1868-1912), was Hashimoto Gahō. His hanging scroll depicting the pair is done in ink and slight tint on paper, harkening back to the simple ink and wash paintings of previous centuries, though done in a far more modern manner. Hashimoto Gaho employs variations in ink tonalities and texture, as seen through the fuzzy hair, the different tones of the ground they stand on, and the fur on Kanzan’s skirt. Jittoku is seen laughing and pointing to the blank scroll, while Kanzan looks on in amusement. The faces of the two figures are three dimensionally modeled, making them appear more realistic and modern than past renderings. The tree branches point downward to the characters to direct the attention of viewers. Nearly every common motif associated with the figures are employed in this painting, though it is done in a modern and expressive manner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freersackler.si.edu/friday-fave-chinese-taoist-immortals/|title=Friday Fave: Chinese Taoist Immortals – Freer{{!}}Sackler|website=www.freersackler.si.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''I Passed for White''''' is a 1960 film directed and adapted for the screen by [[Fred M. Wilcox (director)|Fred M. Wilcox]] from a novel of the same name by [[Reba Lee]] "as told to" [[Mary Hastings Bradley]]. The film stars [[Sonya Wilde]] and [[James Franciscus]] and features [[Jimmy Lydon]], Patricia Michon, and Isabel Cooley. It was released by [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]] on March 18, 1960.

==Plot==
Bernice Lee ([[Sonya Wilde]]) is a young woman of mixed African and European ancestry, living in [[Chicago]] with her family, who is mistaken for a purely white woman by a white man, who tries to hit on her repeatedly. Her brother, more obviously of mixed heritage, fights off the man. Bernice's grandmother consoles her when she confides her troubles.

After a failed attempt at looking for employment as a black woman, she decides to leave town. She begins to use the name Lila Brownell and [[Passing (racial identity)|live as a white woman]]. On the plane to [[New York City]] she meets and eventually marries the man of her dreams – Rick Leyton ([[James Franciscus]]) – and fails to mention her African ancestry, an important omission as [[Interracial marriage in the United States|miscegenation]] is not [[Loving v. Virginia|a constitutional right]] in 1960. James and his wealthy family and friends are white. Her white friend Sally (Patricia Michon), and black maid Bertha (Isabel Cooley) both advise her not to tell him. She becomes pregnant, and fears the child will have black features or coloring – and gets a book to read about this unlikely possibility, which she hides.  Rick eventually discovers it and their maid claims the book belongs to her.

Lila goes into premature labor and has a stillborn child, but cries out "Is the baby black?" after she awakens from anesthesia. This leads Rick to suspect that his wife has been unfaithful. Eventually, she and her husband divorce without Bernice ever having revealed her true name or past. She then returns to her family in Chicago and her original identity.

A '''lake monster''' is a lake-dwelling entity of mythic origin.  A well-known example is the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Lake monsters' depictions are often similar to [[sea monster]]s.

== Origins ==

According to the Swedish naturalist and author Bengt Sjögren (1980), the present-day lake monsters are variations of older legends of [[kelpie|water kelpies]].{{R|"Sjögren"}} Sjögren claims that the accounts of lake-monsters have changed during history, as do others.{{R|"hill"}} Older reports often talk about horse-like appearances, but more modern reports often have more reptile and dinosaur-like appearances, he concludes that the legendary kelpies evolved into the present day [[saurian]] lake-monsters since the discovery of [[dinosaur]]s and giant aquatic reptiles and the popularization of them in both scientific and fictional writings and art.{{R|"Sjögren"}}{{R|"dinsdale"}}

The stories cut across cultures, existing in some variation in many countries.{{R|"Baraniuk"}}{{R|"meurger"}}{{R|"sharpe"}} They've undergone what Michel Meurger calls concretizing (The process of turning items, drawings, general beliefs and stories into a plausible whole) and naturalization over time as humanity's view of the world has changed.{{R|"hill"}}

In many of these areas, especially around [[Loch Ness]], [[Lake Champlain]] and the [[Okanagan Valley]], these lake monsters have become important tourist draws.

== Alternative explanations ==

In [[Ben Radford]] and [[Joe Nickell]]'s book ''Lake Monster Mysteries'',{{R|"RadfordNickell"}} the authors attribute a vast number of sightings to [[otter]] misidentifications. Ed Grabianowski plotted the distribution of North American lake monster sightings. Then he overlaid the distribution of the common otter and found a near perfect match. It turns out that three or four otters swimming in a line look remarkably like a serpentine, humped creature undulating through the water. It is very easy to mistake for a single creature if you see them from a distance. "This isn't speculation. I'm not making this up," Nickell said. "I've spoken to people who saw what they thought was a lake monster, got closer and discovered it was actually a line of otters. That really happens."{{R|"nickell2007"}} Clearly, not every lake monster sighting can be accounted for with otters, but it's an excellent example of how our perceptions can be fooled.{{R|"Grabianowski"}}

Paul Barrett and [[Darren Naish]] note that the existence of any large animals in isolation (i.e., in a situation where no breeding population exists) is highly unlikely. Naish also observes that the stories are likely remnants of tales meant to keep children safely away from the water.{{R|"Baraniuk"}}{{R|"sharpe"}}

There have been many purported sightings of lake monsters, and even some photographs, but each time these have either been shown to be deliberate deceptions, such as the Lake George Monster Hoax,{{R|"nickell2004"}} or serious doubts about the veracity and verifiability have arisen, as with the famous Mansi photograph of [[Champ (folklore)|Champ]].{{R|"bartholomew"}}

'''''Lakeview Terrace''''' is a 2008 American [[crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/lakeview-terrace-v386281|work=Allmovie|accessdate=4 September 2012|author=Buchanan, Jason|title=Lakeview Terrace}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Neil LaBute]], written by [[David Loughery]] and [[Howard Korder]], and co-produced by [[Will Smith]], and starring [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] and [[Kerry Washington]]. Jackson plays a prejudiced [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] police officer who terrorizes his new next-door neighbors because they are an [[Interracial marriage|interracially married]] couple. The title is a reference to the ethnically-mixed middle class Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Lake View Terrace, Los Angeles|Lake View Terrace]]. The film was released on September 19, 2008, received mixed reviews and grossed $44 million.

==Plot==
An interracial newlywed couple, Chris and Lisa Mattson ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] and [[Kerry Washington]]) are moving into their first home. Chris’s first exchanges with their neighbor, widowed and longtime LAPD officer Abel Turner ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), have somewhat hostile undertones, with Abel making comments about Chris’ smoking (which Abel later exposes to Lisa) and listening to [[hip hop music]], and making remarks about his ethnicity in his interracial relationship to Lisa. The following night, Chris and Lisa have sex in their swimming pool. Unknown to them, Abel's children, Marcus and Celia, watch them. Abel arrives home and witnesses the spectacle. Angry, he re-positions his home security floodlights to shine into Chris and Lisa's window, keeping them awake. Abel begins to insinuate to Chris that he disapproves of his interracial marriage and that he wants them to move out of their new neighborhood. One evening, Chris and Lisa hear noises downstairs and find the tires on Chris' car slashed. Suspecting Abel, they call the police, who are unable to do anything because of Abel's status within the LAPD. Chris retaliates by shining his own floodlights into Abel's bedroom.

Lisa later reveals she is pregnant, creating conflict with Chris, who does not yet want children. Meanwhile, Abel is suspended without pay for abusing a suspect, inciting more fury within him. Abel continues his harassment of the couple by hosting a loud bachelor party with his colleagues where he forces Chris to be sexually harassed by a stripper. Chris later plants trees along the fence between their properties, which leads to a near-violent exchange, as Abel objects to having trees hanging over his property. When Chris goes to a local bar, Abel enters and tells Chris that his own wife died in a traffic accident because she was having an affair with a white man, and that he distrusts white men and is prejudiced against interracial relationships because of this.

Abel sends his informant, Clarence Darlington ([[Keith Loneker]]), to trash the Mattson's home in another effort to force them out. Lisa arrives home early, surprising Clarence. They struggle and Lisa is knocked out, but not before she triggers the alarm. Chris races home, followed by a frustrated Abel. When Abel comes upon his hired criminal, he fatally shoots him to keep him quiet. Lisa is rushed to the hospital, but is okay.

Wildfires are raging in the surrounding hills and the residents are instructed to leave their homes. Abel, who remains behind, enters the Mattsons' home, hoping to retrieve Clarence's dropped cell phone, fearing that it will incriminate him. Lisa and Chris unexpectedly return from the hospital before Abel finds the phone, and he leaves. While the Mattsons pack to evacuate, Chris finds the cell phone. He calls the last number dialed and hears Abel answer. Chris realizes Abel is responsible for the break-in, and Abel realizes Chris has discovered the phone.

Abel goes over with his gun drawn, and he and Chris struggle. Before Lisa can escape, Abel shoots her car, causing her to crash into a parked vehicle. After pistol whipping Abel and seemingly knocking him out, Chris rescues Lisa and holds Abel's other gun at him. Hiding his gun behind his back, Abel insists he is unarmed when county sheriff officers arrive on the scene and that Chris should listen to his wife after he is demanded by the officers to drop his gun. Chris finally throws Abel off by asking him about his wife's death and how she had become unfaithful to him, implying that she had done so because of his strictness. Infuriated, Abel finally pulls out his hidden gun, shooting Chris in the shoulder, prompting Abel to be killed by the deputies in self-defense. Chris survives and he and Lisa later talk about their pride in their home, neighborhood, and soon-to-be family, while the wildfires finally seem to be contained.

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 45% based on 163 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "This thriller about a menacing cop wreaking havoc on his neighbors is tense enough but threatens absurdity when it enters into excessive potboiler territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1196215_lakeview_terrace? | title=Lakeview Terrace (2008) | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has an average weighted score of 47 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/lakeviewterrace | title=Lakeview Terrace Reviews | publisher=Metacritic | accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=Lakeview Terrace – CinemaScore |work=[[CinemaScore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a very positive review, awarding it his highest rating of four stars and saying: "Some will find it exciting. Some will find it an opportunity for an examination of conscience. Some will leave feeling vaguely uneasy. Some won't like it and will be absolutely sure why they don't, but their reasons will not agree. Some will hate elements that others can't even see. Some will only see a thriller. I find movies like this alive and provoking, and I'm exhilarated to have my thinking challenged at every step of the way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080918/REVIEWS/809180303 Lakeview Terrace review], Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, September 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' also enjoyed the film, saying: "In its overall shape and message, ''Lakeview Terrace'' is a conventional suspense thriller, but the details kick it up a notch. ... The fun of ''Lakeview Terrace'' is not in what happens but in how it happens."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/18/DDMK1290A2.DTL&amp;type=movies Lakeview Terrace review], Mick LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle,&lt;/ref&gt; J.R. Jones of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' called the film "one of the toughest racial dramas to come out of Hollywood since the fires died down &amp;ndash; much tougher, for instance, than [[Paul Haggis]]'s hand-wringing Oscar winner ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/moviereviews/080918/ Lakeview Terrace review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921022013/http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/moviereviews/080918/ |date=21 September 2008 }}, J.R. Jones, Chicago Reader&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that ''Lakeview Terrace'' "delivers fairly tense and engrossing drama" but "succumb[s] to thriller convention."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117938230.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;query=Lakeview+Terrace Lakeview Terrace review], Dennis Harvey, Variety&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said that "the first hour of the film ... feels dangerous, necessary, and rife with comic disturbance," but added that "the later stages ... overheat and spill into silliness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2008/09/22/080922crci_cinema_lane?currentPage=1 Lakeview Terrace review], Anthony Lane, The New Yorker&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] of ReelViews gave the film two stars out of four, saying that "the first two-thirds of ''Lakeview Terrace'' offer a little more subtlety and complexity than the seemingly straightforward premise would afford, but the climax is loud, dumb, generic, and over-the-top."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/lakeview-terrace Lakeview Terrace review], James Berardinelli, ReelViews&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said that "the movie might have something to say about black racism, but the conversations go nowhere, and the clichés of the genre take over."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;id=11269 Lakeview Terrace review], Wesley Morris, Boston Globe&lt;/ref&gt; Sura Wood of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said: "[The idea of] a black actor cast as the virulent bigot, with the object of his campaign of harassment the young interracial couple who move in next door, could be viewed as a novel twist. But the film, absent a sense of place and populated by repellent or weak characters, soon devolves into an increasingly foul litany of events."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?rid=11631 Lakeview Terrace review], Sura Wood, The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' gave it one half of a star out of five, and called the film a "joyless and airless suspense thriller."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122177747252654291 Lakeview Terrace review], Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

On its opening weekend, the film grossed $15 million placing it at number one in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&amp;yr=2008&amp;wknd=38&amp;p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results from 9/19 to 9/21 | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | date=2008-09-21 | accessdate=26 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed $39.2 million in the United States and Canada and $3.2 million in other territories, making $42.4 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lakeviewterrace.htm | title=Lakeview Terrace (2008) | publisher=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=26 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memling Triptych of Family Moreel.jpg|thumb|560px|Hans Memling, ''Moreel Triptych'', 1484. [[oil painting|Oil]]-on-wood, 291cm x 121.1cm]]
[[File:Hans Memling - Triptych of the Family Moreel (closed) - WGA14933.jpg|thumb|300px|Exterior panels; [[John the Baptist]] (left) and [[Saint George]] (right)]]
The '''''Moreel Triptych''''' (or the '''''Saint Christopher Altarpiece''''') is the name given to a 1484 panel painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Hans Memling]] (d. 1494). It was [[Donor portrait|commissioned]] by the prominent Bruges politician, merchant and banker Willem Moreel (d. 1501) and his wife Barbara van Vlaenderberch, née van Hertsvelde (d. 1499). It was intended as their [[epitaph]] at the chapel&lt;ref name="b100"&gt;Blum, 100&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[St. James's Church, Bruges]], an extension they paid for, to the funerary church of Willem's family, where the couple intended to be interred in an underground tomb before the altar.

The inner center panel of the [[triptych]] altarpiece show [[Saint Christopher]] holding the [[Christ Child]], with [[Saint Maurus]] to his left and Saint Gills to his right. Willem Moreel kneels in prayer and venerating the saints in the left-hand panel with their five sons. Barbara kneels with eleven of their daughters on the right panel. The exterior panels are probably an early 16th-century addition, completed after the donor's and artist's deaths.

The triptych was installed on the altar of St. James's Church in 1484.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;Pearson, Andrea. ''Envisioning Gender in Burgundian Devotional Art, 1350–1530''. Ashgate, 2005. {{ISBN|978-07-5465-154-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in its original frames, which are each inscribed with the words ''anno Domini 1484'', or a variant containing the year, on their lower borders.&lt;ref name="r352" /&gt; The altarpiece has a strong association with the [[Benedictine]] order; three of the figures are Benedictine monks or saints.&lt;ref name="b101"&gt;Blum, 101&lt;/ref&gt; It is to dedicated to [[Saint Maurus]] and St Giles, the latter a Benedictine hermit. Today the work is located in the [[Groeningemuseum]] in Bruges.

==Commission==
[[File: Hans Memling - Portraits of Willem Moreel and His Wife - WGA14854.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Hans Memling, ''Portrait of the family Moreel'', 1482. Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]
The family of Willem Moreel are known to have lived in Bruges since the 13th century.&lt;ref name="b97"&gt;Blum, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Willem inherited land and a title lord of Oostcleyhem from his father. During his career he was twice appointed both [[alderman]] and [[burgomaster]] of the city, as well as its [[bailiff]] and later its [[treasurer]]. He was named as one of the fortieth riches men in the city in a 1490 tax list. The couple has eighteen children.  Memling earlier portrayed the couple in 1482, with a pair of panel portraits now in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]].

Saint James's Church was his family's burial ground and was founded in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="b100" /&gt; It underwent a major reconstruction in the late 15th century, which Willem Moreel partly financed along with members of the prominent [[Portinari Altarpiece|Portinari]], Gros and Moor families.&lt;ref name="b98" /&gt; The couple intended to be buried with the church building, in a chapel they had paid for and dedicated to saints Gills and Maurus, with space left before the altar as burial space for two people. To the same end, they commissioned the triptych from Memling, then a highly prominent, prestigious and sought-after painter, to be placed on the chapel altar, and only interred in the chapel in 1504, at the request of their son John.&lt;ref name="b98" /&gt; Barbara died in 1899, he followed in 1501.&lt;ref name="b98"&gt;Blum, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moreels did not at first get their wishes as to their burial places. Their standing and political security hamper by the struggles after the deaths of [[Charles the Bold]] in 1477 and [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1482 and the struggle with [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Austria]]. Willem was a prominent adversary of Maximilian, and was imprisoned in October 1481 for six months.&lt;ref name="r356"&gt;Ridderbos et al, 356&lt;/ref&gt; On their deaths, were each buried on exterior church grounds.&lt;ref name="b98" /&gt; They were not moved to their intended resting places in front of the chapel altar until 1504.

==Interior==
The inner panels share a continuous overcast skyline and broad landscape,&lt;ref name="r352"&gt;Ridderbos et all, 352&lt;/ref&gt; which contains two city-scapes, cottages and a meadow with a variety of trees animals and wild strawberries, daisies, daffodils and other recognisable flowers and plants.&lt;ref name="m141"&gt;Michiels, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the sense of harmony, both wing panels are identically composed, excepting the number of children.&lt;ref name="j163"&gt;Jacobs, 163&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen of the couple's eighteen children are shown in total. However, some of the figures are later additions, painted over the first layers of oil and pigment.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

The figures were identified in the mid 19th century by James H. Weale through their facial characteristics and extant established portraits, through the commonality of Christian names from family names to some of the saints, city records, and the examination of headstones in the Saint James graveyard.&lt;ref name="r356" /&gt;

The inner panels are in relatively good condition for late 15th-century oil paintings, but have suffered some damage and paint loss, and have been depreciated by ill-advised restorations and touch-up work.&lt;ref name="m141"&gt;Michiels, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center panel===
[[File:Hans Memling - Triptych of the Family Moreel (central panel) - WGA14930.jpg|320px|thumb|Center panel with Saint Christopher, and Saint Maurus 
to his left and Saint Gills to the right&lt;ref name="j163" /&gt;]]
The central figure is [[Saint Christopher]], patron saint of travelers, who shares his feast day, July 25, with Saint James, after whom the containing church is named.&lt;ref name="b100" /&gt; He is shown standing in water as he crosses a river or inlet, carrying the [[Child Jesus]] on his shoulders. He is presented with his attributes, including a large staff, a symbol of Christ's miraculous presence,&lt;ref name="b101" /&gt; and is intended as a protector against sudden death.&lt;ref name="vp"&gt;"[http://vlaamseprimitieven.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/collection/moreel-triptych Moreel Triptych]". [[Flemish Art Collection]]. Retrieved 16 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher is dressed in a blue coat, covered with a long red cape folded over his right shoulder. He closely resembles depictions in both [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' and now lost ''[[Saint Christopher (after van Eyck)|Saint Christopher]]'', by whom Memling was deeply influenced by.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kmska.be/en/collectie/Restauratie/Hans_Memling/Over_het_kunstwerk.html The Paintings]". [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]. Retrieved 16 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On the left is Saint Maurus who holds a [[crosier]] and looks at an open book. Saint Gills stands to the right, standing with his attributes, an arrow and a [[deer|doe]].&lt;ref name="r352" /&gt; Both are dressed in long black robes and are holding books.

===Left panel===
[[File:Hans Memling 069.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Left panel, with Willem Moreel, sons, and Saint Wilhemus van Maleval]]
The left interior wing shows Willem Moreel kneeling, his hands clasped in prayer, before an open prayer book. His hair is short in a [[bowl cut]],&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt;  wears a fur-lined dress and black [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]], a very fashionable outfit in the 1480s. Behind him are his five male children, also shown kneeling. Of the sons, two are known to have died in infancy. Willem was the oldest, while John and George are thought to have commissioned the outer panels after their parents' death (see below).

The Moreels are presented by Saint Wilhemus van Maleval,&lt;ref name="vp" /&gt; who stands among them, dressed a fur-lined black coat over army clothing.&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt; He places his hand on Willem's shoulder, as he guides and presents him to Christopher in the center panel.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

===Right panel===
[[File:Hans Memling 071.jpg|thumb|180px|Right panel with Barbara Moreel, daughters, and Saint Barbara]]
The right interior wing presents Barbara Moreel with her eleven of her thirteen daughters,&lt;ref name="j163" /&gt; who all also kneel in prayer before an open book. Barbara wears a truncated [[hennin]], a [[damask]] silk dress with a white collar, and a wide red belt with a golden buckle. They are presented by [[Saint Barbara]], patron of the donor's wife,&lt;ref name="r355"&gt;Ridderbos et all, 355&lt;/ref&gt; who is shown standing before the tower where she was, by legend, imprisoned, which through innovative use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], she seems to hold in her hand.&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Hans Memling 049.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Hans Membling, ''[[Sibylla Sambetha]]'', 1480]]--&gt;
One of the daughters, Catherine, earlier posed for Memling's 1480 ''[[Sibylla Sambetha]]''.&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt; The eldest daughter, shown directly behind Barbra, and also in a black dress, is known to have become a Dominican nun. The girl in the light brown clothing, black v-neck and transparent [[veil]] has been identified as Maria from her name written in her headband, their second born daughter, given her linear position in the painting. Genealogical research notes that the couple has two daughters named Marie; but is assumed one died in infancy and the second was named after her. Efforts to name other of the daughters have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="r360"&gt;Ridderbos et al, 360&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the daughters were painted by Memling; examination by the art historian Dirk De Vos identifies at least six that are later additions, layered over the original landscape. Some of these additions can be explained by daughters born after the 1484 completion date, and were probably added by members of Memling's workshop. The left-hand panel containing sons underwent similar updated.&lt;ref name="r360" /&gt;

==Exterior==
The outer part of the wings contains [[grisaille]] representations of [[John the Baptist]] with his lamb and staff (left wing) and [[Saint George]] in full [[armour]], slaying the dragon (right wing) with a lance. The panels may have been completed after the deaths of Willem and Barbara, and dated as c 1504 by a number of art historians, probably commissioned by two of their sons,&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Blum considers this "highly likely". See Blum, 102&lt;/ref&gt; Jan (John) and Jaris (George), as the final, successful, effort to have their parents interred within the chapel space.&lt;ref name="b102"&gt;Blum, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensions: overall (when open), 25 3/8 × 46 3/8 in.; central panel, 25 1/4 × 24 7/8 in,; each wing, 25 3/8 × 10 3/4 in]]
[[File:Robert Campin 006.jpg|thumb|260px|''The Annunciation''. The [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], Brussels, version of the central panel, at one time attributed to [[Jacques Daret]], a pupil of Campin's. This panel was painted earlier than the New York version, and may be the original.&lt;ref name="r50"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 50&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Mérode Altarpiece'''{{efn-ua|The triptych is named after a previous owner, comtesse Marie-Nicolette de Merode (1849–1905)}} (or '''''Annunciation Triptych''''') is an [[Oil painting|oil]] on oak panel [[triptych]], now in [[The Cloisters]], in New York City. It is unsigned and undated, but attributed to [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Robert Campin]] and an assistant.{{efn-ua|The painting is attributed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art to "Robert Campin and assistant". The "assistant" is attributed with the figure of the female donor, rather than the main subjects}} The three panels represent, from left to right, the [[votive portrait|donors]] kneeling in prayer in a garden, the moment of the [[Annunciation]] to Mary, which is set in a contemporary, domestic setting, and [[Saint Joseph]], a carpenter with the tools of his trade. The many elements of religious symbolism include the lily and fountain (symbolising the purity of Mary), and the [[Holy Spirit]] represented by the rays of light coming falling from the left hand window.

The central panel was completed after 1422, likely between 1425 and 1428, by a member of Campin's workshop.{{efn-ua|Dates as early as 1420 have been suggested, based on Campin presumed birth date and that [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Ghent altarpiece]] "Annunciation" was influenced by Campin's treatment of the same subject. See Rousseau (1957), 128}}  The outer panels are later additions by a workshop member, probably on request by the donor who sought to elevate the central panel to a triptych and place himself in the pictorial space. The wings contain views of the city of [[Liège]], in today's Belgium. A version of the center panel in Brussels is earlier, and maybe Campin's original panel.

The triptych is a founding and important work in the then emerging late Gothic, [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] style, and has been described as a "milestone between two periods; it at once summarizes the medieval tradition and lays the foundation for the development of modern painting".&lt;ref name="r117"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and attribution==
The New York triptych has been at times attributed to the young [[Rogier van der Weyden]]&lt;ref name="r117" /&gt; It is today accepted as belonging to a group of paintings associated with the Master of Flémalle, assumed to be Robert Campin,{{efn-ua|Until the connection had been made, Campin was associated with a separate grouping of works. See Campbell (1998), 72}} a mentor of [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref name="dg130" /&gt; There is another version of the Annunciation panel in [[Brussels]], slightly earlier but damaged,&lt;ref name="c643"&gt;Campbell (1974), 643&lt;/ref&gt; which may represent the original version by Campin.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

Technical examination of the wood panels suggest that the New York triptych was completed by a number of hands. The wood of the central panel is different and earlier to that of the wings, while the hinging further suggest that the central panel was not intended as part of a triptych. The central panel is likely a copy of an earlier composition by Campin, while the wings were probably a later commissioned by the donor, who presumably wished that they were attached to the main panel to form a devotional altarpiece, probably (given its size) for private devotion.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; Areas of the panels have been reworked; both the female doner and bearded man on the left wing were painted over landscape, while the window behind the Virgin was originally painted in gold.&lt;ref name="s140"&gt;Suhr, 140-44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Campbell]] has dismissed the triptych's association with the Flemalle group, and thus Robert Campin. He describes the Mérode as "incoherent in design", in that it lacks spatial continuity between the panels, a trait most noticeable in the ''[[Seilern Triptych]]''.&lt;ref name="c643" /&gt; In addition the open sky seen through the windows in the central is incongruous in point of view with the street scene in the donor panel. He further notes the poor command of perspective in the donor panel, and notes that it is "unfortunate that a line of one of the mortar courses in the garden wall disappear into the donor's mouth".&lt;ref name="c644" /&gt; Campbell disregards the wing panels as pedestrian and by lesser hands, thrown together at the will of the donor. He gives prominence to the Brussels panel, which he cautiously attributes to the Master of Flémalle.&lt;ref name="c643" /&gt;

==Description==
The triptych was commissioned for private and domestic use; the central panel is a relatively small 64 × 63&amp;nbsp;cm and each wing measures 65 × 27&amp;nbsp;cm. Each panel has a steep perspective, in that the viewer seems to be looking down on the figures from an elevated point of view. In other respects the perspective is underdeveloped; neither the Virgin nor Gabriel seem to rest on solid ground, while the female donor seems to hover, and  barely able to fit into the space she is positioned in.&lt;ref name="r124"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The panels are well preserved, with little over-paint, glossing, dirt layers or paint losses.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/470304 Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece)]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 17 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; They are almost entirely in oil; and establish many of the inventions that were to make the technique so successful and adaptable over the following centuries.&lt;ref name="r121"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 121&lt;/ref&gt; The serenity of the works is achieved, in part, through the dominance of pale, opaque white, red and blue hues. The panels are relatively small; the at times minute attention to detail calls to mind the focus of contemporary miniatures, of the kind seem in the two [[illuminated manuscripts]] in the central panel.&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt;

===Annunciation===
[[File:Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece) MET DT7255.jpg|thumb|260px|Detail, center panel, with table, book of hours, fading candle and vase]]
The panel is one of the earliest representations of the [[Annunciation to Mary]] in a contemporary middle-class Northern European interior,&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt; perhaps a dining room. This is Campin's main innovation; showing a reading Madonna, with unbound hair in a then familiar setting; an image that lead to many adoptions, most famously [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[The Magdalen Reading|Reading Magdalen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 65&lt;/ref&gt; The colours of the central panel are dominated by the cool grays of the plaster and the brown of the timber wall.&lt;ref name="g76"&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 76&lt;/ref&gt; The lower half is characterised by warmer and deeper brownish greens and reds.&lt;ref name="r117"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 117&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian suggest that the success of the panel is due to the contrast between the warm reds of the Virgin's robe and the pale blue hues of the archangel [[Gabriel]]'s vestment.&lt;ref name="r118"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mérode Altarpiece (Mary).jpg|left|thumb|240px|Detail with the Virgin reading a book of hours]]
The perspective is very steep and unevenly distributed. The angle of the table in particular is illogical. Art historian [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] describes these distortions as "disturbing".&lt;ref name="c644"&gt;Campbell (1974), 644&lt;/ref&gt; The panel shows the moment before the traditional scene, as Mary, absorbed in her book, is still unaware of the presence of Gabriel.&lt;ref name="r118" /&gt; Mary is in a red gown rather than the more usual blue. She is in a relaxed pose, reading from a [[book of hours]], her hair unbound. Unusually for a medieval depiction of the Annunciation, the dove of the Holy Spirit is not included. Instead he is represented by the extinguished light of the candle, and the beam of light falling from the window to the left, which carries the Christ Child holding a cross.&lt;ref name="r479"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 47–51&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Christ Child flies down towards Mary from the left oculus, signifying her impregnation by [[God the Father]]. He gazes directly at her and holds a cross. The folding-table contains a recently extinguished candle,&lt;ref name="r46" /&gt; and shows coiling smoke and a still glowing [[Candle wick|wick]]. This maybe a reference to the Holy Spirit, who, according to some late medieval writers, descended to the apostles "like a puff of wind".&lt;ref name="r47"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The white [[Lilium|lily]] in a Tuscan earthenware jug&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt; on the table represents Mary's virginity and purity, as does the white, [[ocher]] towel. The jug contains a series of enigmatic letters in Latin and Hebraic, deciphered by some art historians as ''De Campyn'', that is the artist's signature.&lt;ref name="r47" /&gt; An opened manuscript is positioned on a green velvet book pouch. Unusually the book is positioned next to the Virgin rather than the shelf. The pages seem worn and handled, indicating that it has been well read.&lt;ref name="r47" /&gt; It has been suggested that the book reflects the [[Carthusian]] [[Ludolf of Saxony]]'s idea of the  secluded life of the Virgin - that she earlier lived with "the Holy Scriptures as her sole companion".&lt;ref&gt;Châtelet, quoted in Reuterswärd (1998), 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The right hand half of the back wall holds three windows, one of which contains a [[Latticework|lattice]] screen.&lt;ref name="r117" /&gt; The beams of the ceiling are supported by a series of [[corbel]]s.&lt;ref name="r120"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 120&lt;/ref&gt; The sky visible through the windows is a later addition, which was painted over an earlier gold ground. The armorial shields are also later additions.&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt;

===Donors===
[[File:Merode Altarpiece left Panel Detail a.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Left panel, with street scene and attendant]]
The [[donor portrait|donor]] and his wife are shown kneeling in prayer are in the left panel, looking through a half-open door into the Virgin's [[Hortus conclusus]].&lt;ref name="r117"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 117&lt;/ref&gt; The door presents a continuity oddity; although it can be seen opening into the Virgins room from the left panel, no such door entrance is visible in the center panel. Addressing this, the art historians Rose-Marie and Rainer Hagen suppose that the donor is "imagining that she has entered into his house. From without, he has opened the door; with his own eyes he beholds the Mother of God and petitions her for a family".&lt;ref name="h33"&gt;Hagen; Hagen (2003), 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The servant or attendant dressed in a festive outfit&lt;ref name="r122"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 122&lt;/ref&gt; appears to be an later addition by a different artist, perhaps after the donor's marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, (2005), 51–65&lt;/ref&gt; The space contains an unlocked entrance which leads to a minutely detailed street scene.&lt;ref name="r46"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 46&lt;/ref&gt; The panel is the more striking as the door leading into the Virgin's chamber is wide open, hugely presumptuous for even a mid-fifteenth century commission, and suggesting access to the gates of heaven.&lt;ref name="g78"&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The donors are identifiable as bourgeoisie from nearby [[Mechelen]], and are documented in Tournai in 1427, identifiable from the [[coat of arms]] in the [[stained glass]] window of the central panel.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

It is assumed that this panel was a later commission to Campin's workshop, not part of the original single panel design. There has been speculation that it was completed by the young [[Rogier van der Weyden]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2002), 297&lt;/ref&gt;

The altarpiece was commissioned either by the businessman Jan Engelbrecht, or the [[Cologne]]-born merchant Peter Engelbrecht and his wife Margarete Scrynmaker.&lt;ref name="k441"&gt;Kleiner (2013), 441&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CorkArts"&gt;"[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/merode-altarpiece.htm Merode Altarpiece (1435)]". visual-arts-cork.com. Retrieved 1 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbrecht translates from German as "angel brings", while Scrynmaker means "cabinet maker", the latter perhaps influencing the choice of Joseph in the right hand panel.&lt;ref name="k441" /&gt;

===Joseph===
[[File:Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece) MET DT7259.jpg|thumb|200px|Right panel, detail with street scene and view of [[Liège]]]]
[[Saint Joseph]], a carpenter by trade, occupies the right-hand panel. He is shown at work, boring spike holes into one of the instruments of the Passion. An unusual feature is that, although Mary and Joseph did not marry until after the Annunciation, they are apparently living together and sharing the same space. Joseph is shown with the tools of his craft, including an ax, saw and rod, laid out across a table, and a small footstool, sitting before a fire of burning logs. Joseph's presence is probably intended to invoke  10 :15 from the [[Book of Isaiah]]: "Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth there-
with? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?
as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if
the staff should lift up itself as if was it were no wood."&lt;ref name="m267"&gt;Minott (1969), 267&lt;/ref&gt; Isaiah's words were intended as incentatory and revolutionary, were followed by a treatise for the salvation of [[Israel]], and protested against an [[Assyria]]n king he considered considered boorish and vainglorious.&lt;ref name="m267" /&gt; Given this, Joseph is seen by art historians as a reassuring presence, warding the devil from the center panel.&lt;ref name="s185"&gt;Schapiro (1945), 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph is shown as an old man&lt;ref name="s185" /&gt; wearing an [[eggplant]] coloured coat and blue turban, in a panel characterised by dark and warm colours, and framed by the shadows from the window shutters.&lt;ref name="r117"/&gt; He works on a mouse trap, probably intended as a symbol of the cross at the [[Crucifixion]],&lt;ref name="dg129"&gt;Duchesne-Guillemin (1976), 129&lt;/ref&gt; in that it represents an imagined but literal capture of the Devil, said to have held a man in ransom because of the [[original sin|sin of Adam]].&lt;ref name="m268"&gt;Minott (1969), 268&lt;/ref&gt; In some scripts, Christ's naked flesh was served as bait for the devil; "He rejoiced in Christ's death, like a bailiff of death. What he rejoiced in was then his own undoing. The cross of the Lord was the devil's mousetrap; the bait by which he was caught was the Lord's death."&lt;ref&gt;Sermo ccLcxii, "De ascensione Domini" . Migne, Pat. Lat., xxxvII, col. 1210. See Schapiro (1945), 182-87&lt;/ref&gt;

The background contains a cityscape, probably fictitious, showing the spires of two churches, one of which is now lost, the churches of St. Pierre (left) and Sainte Croix (right) in Liege.{{efn-ua|The church is however identifiable from surviving documents and contemporary descriptions. See Duchesne-Guillemin (1976), 129}}&lt;ref name="dg130"&gt;Duchesne-Guillemin (1976), 130-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Merode Altarpiece Center Panel Detail d.jpg|left|thumb|340px|Detail of the center panel]]
The [[Iconography]] contains complex religious symbolism, although their extent and exact nature is debated – [[Meyer Schapiro]] pioneered the study of the symbolism of the mousetrap,&lt;ref name="ms182"&gt;Schapiro (1945), 82&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erwin Panofsky]] later extended, or perhaps over-extended, the analysis of symbols to cover many more details of the furniture and fittings. Similar debates exist for many Early Netherlandish paintings, and a number of the details seen for the first time here reappear in later Annunciations by other artists. 

The symbolic elements in the central panel mostly relate to the Annunciation, the Mass and the [[sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1984), 42–47&lt;/ref&gt; Mary sits on the floor to show her humility. The [[scroll]] and book in front of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] symbolize the Old and the [[New Testament]]s, and the roles Mary and the [[Christ]] child played in the fulfillment of prophecy.  The lilies in the earthenware vase on the table represent Mary's virginity. Other symbols of her purity include the enclosed garden (''[[Hortus conclusus]]''),&lt;ref name="k441" /&gt; and the white towel, while the small windows to the right, and  the half-closed windows at the rear, serve to emphasise the quiet, virginal life she has lived.&lt;ref name="h33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CorkArts" /&gt;

[[File:Merode Altarpiece Center Panel Detail c.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail with [[coat of arms]] in window, center panel]]
The lion finials on the bench may have a symbolic role (referring to the [[Seat of Wisdom]], or throne of [[Solomon]]) – this feature is often seen in other paintings, religious or secular (like [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'').  The arrangements for washing at the back of the room, which are considered unusual for a domestic interior, may relate to the similar arrangements of a [[piscina]] for the officiating priest to wash his hands during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].  The sixteen sides of the table may allude to the sixteen main Hebrew prophets; the table is usually seen as an altar, and the [[archangel]] [[Gabriel]] wears the [[vestment]]s of a [[deacon]].&lt;ref&gt;McNamee (1998), 151&lt;/ref&gt; The basin may represent both the purity of Virgin, and the cleansing of the Christian act of [[baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In the right-hand panel, [[Saint Joseph]], a carpenter, has constructed a mouse trap symbolizing Christ's trapping and defeat of the devil, a metaphor used three times by [[Saint Augustine]]: "The cross of the Lord was the devil's mousetrap; the bait by which he was caught was the Lord's death."&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro (1945), 1&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the right-hand panel has been studied in detail by Russell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=Malcolm|date=2017|title=The woodworker and the Redemption: the right shutter of the Merode triptych|url=|journal=Simiolus|volume=39|pages=335-350|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that the object that Joseph is working on is a scandalum or stumbling block, a spiked block that gashes the legs of a punishment victim who walks with it hanging from a cord around his waist. Joseph's joinery instruments are displayed in a consistently unnatural manner, suggesting that they have been planned to fit a specific agenda; for example the joinery instruments on the table are so placed as to represent the three crosses of Christ and the two thieves.

==Provenance==
Its early history is obscure. The triptych was owned by the aristocratic [[Belgium|Belgian]]  [[Arenberg]] and [[House of Merode|Mérode]] families from 1820 to 1849 before reaching the art market, and has been in the collection of [[the Cloisters]], New York since 1956. Until its acquisition it had been in private collection for many years and thus inaccessible to both scholars and the public. Its purchase was funded by [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] and was described at the time as a "major event for the history of collecting in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16028coll12/id/871 The Merode Altarpiece, a great and famous landmark in the history of western painting, by the Master of Flémalle, has been acquired for the Cloisters]".

'''Natalie Jeremijenko''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} (born 1966) is an artist and engineer whose background includes studies in [[biochemistry]], [[physics]], [[neuroscience]] and [[precision engineering]]. She is an active member of the [[net.art]] movement, and her work primarily explores the interface between society, the [[environmentalism|environment]] and technology.  
She has alternatively described her work as "X Design" (short for [[experimental design]]) and herself as a "thingker", a combination of thing-maker and thinker.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2010/09/environmental_design | title=The Q&amp;A: Natalie Jeremijenko, thingker | date=20 September 2010 | accessdate=19 October 2012 | last=More Intelligent Life | first=M.G | newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently an associate professor at [[New York University]] in the [[Visual Art]] Department, and has affiliated faculty appointments in the school's Computer Science and Environmental Studies.

==Early life and education==
She was born in [[Mackay, Queensland]], and raised in Brisbane, the second of ten children to a physician and a schoolteacher. Her parents were champions of domestic technology, and Jeremijenko claims that her mother was the first woman in Australia to own a [[microwave oven|microwave]].&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2006/06/22/natalie/ | title=The artist as mad scientist | publisher=salon.com | date=January 2006 | accessdate=19 October 2012 | last=Kevin | first=Berger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She enrolled in PhDs, in Australia and possibly [[Stanford University]] but was not awarded a doctorate.{{Clarify|date=March 2014}}&lt;ref name=salon /&gt;

==Transition to art installations==
In 1988, Jeremijenko co-founded the [[Livid (festival)|Livid rock festival]] in [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Peter|title=A Brief History of Livid|url=http://www.livid.com.au/livid1999/brief.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She credits her involvement in helping her move towards [[public art]] as she created [[installation art|installations]] that would appeal to the young crowd.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;

==Notable works==

===''D4PA: Designed 4 Political Action''===
A catalogue of devices and strategies for political engagement and direct action developed by the '''Bureau of Inverse Technology''' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BUREAU OF INVERSE TECHNOLOGY: THE DECADE REPORT, THE BUREAU THE EVIDENCE THE FIRST 10 YEARS|url=http://bureauit.org/decade/projects.html#bitradio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described by Wired Magazine as "the DARPA of dissent".&lt;ref&gt;http://xdesign.ucsd.edu/d4pa/&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Live Wire (Dangling String),'' 1995===
In 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natalie Jeremijenko|url=http://mediaartists.org/content.php?sec=artist&amp;sub=detail&amp;artist_id=216|publisher=Media Artists|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[artist-in-residence]] at [[Xerox PARC]] in [[Palo Alto, California]] under the guidance of [[Mark Weiser]], she created an art installation made up of [[LED]] cables that lit up relative to the amount of [[internet traffic]]. The work is now seen as one of the first examples of ambient or "calm" technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calm Technology|url=http://iu.berkeley.edu/IU/stories/storyReader$397|publisher=Berkeley|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ubicomp|url=http://ipv6.com/articles/sensors/Ubiquitous-Computing.htm|publisher=IPV6|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''OOZ''===
Various technological interfaces to facilitate interaction with natural systems as opposed to virtual systems.

===''Feral Robots''===
An [[open source]] [[robotics]] project providing resources and support for upgrading the raison d'etre of commercially available [[robot dog|robotic dog toy]]s; and facilitating mediagenic Feral Robotic Dog Pack Release events. Because the dogs follow concentration gradients of the contaminants they are equipped to sniff, their release renders information legible to diverse participants, provides the opportunity for evidence-driven discussion, and facilitates public participation in environmental monitoring and remediation.{{sfn|"Shocking the Big City with a Little Green Grass," ''Yes!'' magazine, Winter 2013|p=40}}

===''BIT Plane,'' 1997===
{{main|BIT plane}}
The BIT plane is a radio-controlled [[model aircraft]], designed by the '''Bureau of Inverse Technology''' and equipped with a micro-video camera and transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BUREAU OF INVERSE TECHNOLOGY: THE DECADE REPORT, THE BUREAU THE EVIDENCE THE FIRST 10 YEARS|url=http://bureauit.org/decade/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name could be a reference to [[bit plane]], a set of [[discrete signal|digital discrete signals]]. In 1997 it was launched on a series of sorties over the [[Silicon Valley]] to capture an aerial rendering.

Guided by the live control-view [[video feed]] from the plane, the pilot on the ground could steer the unit deep into the heartlands of the [[Information Age]]. Most of the corporate research parks in Silicon Valley are no-camera zones and require US citizen status or special clearance for entry. The bit plane (with an undisclosed citizenship) flew covertly through this rarified information-space, buzzing over the largest concentration of [[venture capital]] in the world, returning with several hours of [[aerial photography|aerial footage]].

===''Suicide Box''===
Suicide Box consists of motion sensor cameras, placed on the Golden Gate Bridge for an initial 100 day period. The name is a reference to the location, the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] ranking amongst the most popular suicide spots in the United States. Cameras were installed without permission from local municipal authorities. Data recorded by the footage, vertical motions assumed to be suicides, came out to an average of .68 suicides per day over the duration of the project.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Artworks I|url=https://read-dukeupress-edu.ezproxy.neu.edu/public-culture/article/11/1/313-317/49896|journal=Public Culture|volume=11|pages=313-317|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage was later compared against information about fluctuations in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], the average being popularly held as an indicator of the economy's health.  A commonly held conception is that suicides increase during times of economic downturn, though the comparison of data from "Suicide Box" when compared to DOW fluctuations indicated no correlations.   

Controversies surrounding the work related to its subject matter and authenticity. Questions have been raised with regards to the authenticity of the footage (whether or not what are depicted are actually suicides) and the subject matter (the depiction of actual suicides as part of an art piece).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Created in 2008, this project's goal was to dispel misinformation, as well as educate people on [[bat]]s, their habitat, and activities. The billboard was an interactive home for bats that would display written messages based on the sonar messages the bats were sending. This work was showcased at [[MoMA]]'s 2011 exhibit [[Talk to Me (exhibition)|"Talk to Me"]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/objects/&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Art Of The Eco-mindshift,'' Oct 2009===
Jeremijenko gave a [[TED Talk]] in October 2009. Here she discussed her various projects and what she was currently working on with the Environmental Health Clinic. In the TED Talk she also discusses what her plans are to improve the environment in industrious areas like New York City.

'''''Noori Jam Tamachi''''' ({{lang-sd|'''نوري ڄام  تماچي '''}}) is a famous tale of Prince [[Jam Tamachi]]'s falling in love with the charming fisherwoman Noori. Noori makes Jam happy with her perfect surrender and obedience which causes him to raise her above all the other queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Pain and grace:a study of two mystical writers of eighteenth-century Muslim India|author= Annemarie schimmel|publisher =Sang-E-Meel Publications| year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story also appears in [[Shah Jo Risalo]] and forms part of seven popular tragic romances from [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. The other six tales are ''[[Umar Marvi]]'', ''[[Sassui Punnhun]]'', ''[[Sohni Mahiwal|Sohni Mehar]]'', ''[[Lilan Chanesar]]'', ''[[Sorath Rai Diyach]]'' and ''[[Momal Rano]]'' commonly known as [[the Seven Queens of Sindh]], or the Seven heroines of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].

It is the only story of fulfilled love and happiness and not of burning love and helpless search.

== Overview ==
[[Jam Tamachi]] was a [[Samma Dynasty|Samma]] prince, a ruler of Sindh, [[Thatta]], [[Pakistan]]. There are three lakes lying between [[Jhirk|Jherruk]] and [[Thatta]], called the [[Kalri Lake|Keenjhar]], the Chholmari and Sonahri. On the banks of Keenjhar, broken walls are still visible that mark the site of an old fishing village. A girl of this class, Noori, attracts the attention of Jam Tamachi, who madly fell in love with her and raised her above the ladies of royal blood. She was also called ''Gandri'', her clean name.

This legend has been retold countless times and is often used as metaphor for divine love by [[Sufi]]s. Its most beautiful rendering is in found in poetic compendium ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]'' of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai]]. By this anecdote, Shah shows that humility is great thing and is meant to rise in the favour of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=K F MIRZA (Mirza Kalich Beg)|  title=Life of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai: A Brief Commentary on his Risalo| publisher=Bhit Shah cultural centre committee| place=Hyderabad, Sindh, Pakistan| year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Noori's grave ==

According to the legend, Noori was buried in the middle of [[Keenjhar Lake]], [[Pakistan]]. Her last resting place is visited by hundreds of tourists daily.

[[Image:Olive Pink.jpg|thumb|right|Olive Pink]]
'''Olive Muriel Pink''' (17 March 1884 – 6 July 1975) was an Australian [[Botany|botanical]] illustrator, [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], [[gardener]], and activist for [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] rights.

Pink spent much of her life agitating and being a passionate advocate for improved rights and conditions for Australia's Indigenous people. She never married, having lost a 'very dear friend' Harold Southern, a fellow artist who was killed at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Item 26 - Water colour painting by H A Southern |url=https://sparc.utas.edu.au/index.php/water-colour-painting-by-h-a-southern |website=Library Special and Rare Collections |publisher=University of Tasmania |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her later years, Pink concentrated on botanical pursuits and established the currently named [[Olive Pink Botanic Garden]] in Alice Springs.

==Early life==
[[File:Santalum acuminatum(detail).jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of a [[Santalum acuminatum|quandong]] by Olive Pink]]
Pink was born in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], the eldest child of Robert Stuart Pink and his wife Eveline Fanny Margaret (née Kerr).  She was educated at [[Hobart Girls' High School]] and later studied art at [[Hobart Technical School]] under acclaimed artist and sculptor [[Benjamin Sheppard]].  In 1909 she joined the staff of the school.

Her father died in 1907, and in 1911 she moved with her mother and brother to [[Perth, Western Australia]] and then in 1914 to Sydney, offering art lessons both privately and in private girls' schools.  In May 1915, she joined the [[New South Wales]] Department of Public Works as a tracer having attained a Town Planning Diploma the previous year.  Sometime later she moved to the [[New South Wales Government Railways|NSW Government Railways and Tramways]] where she designed various advertising posters.  During this period, she developed her artistic skills further by attending classes at the 'Sydney Art School', one of the most influential art schools in Australia and run by [[Julian Ashton]].

==Central Australia==
In 1926 she holidayed with well-known welfare worker and anthropologist [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] in remote [[Ooldea, South Australia|Ooldea]] on the edge of the [[Nullarbor Plain]], having her first encounter with Aboriginal culture.  In 1930, Pink found herself retrenched from her government position and with her interest having been piqued by visits to the remote countryside, she travelled to central Australia sketching desert flora.

She returned to Sydney and attended lectures in anthropology at the [[University of Sydney]] and became secretary to the [[Anthropological Society of New South Wales]].  Between 1933 and 1936 she received grants from the [[Australian Research Council|Australian National Research Council]] to work among the [[Arrernte people]] near Alice Springs and the [[Warlpiri people]] of the [[Tanami Desert]].  She published several papers on the Arrernte in 1933 and 1936, but, sensitive to cultural needs, refused to release her work on the Warlpiri.  She also met [[Albert Namatjira]] during this period and purchased two of his early paintings.  The two remained friends until his death in 1959.

At this time, Pink started agitating by writing endless letters to politicians and newspapers to raise the profile and awareness of difficulties faced by Aboriginal people. She strongly criticised government officials, missionaries and pastoralists, making uncompromising demands and constant badgering of politicians which resulted in her being investigated by [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|ASIO]] as a communist sympathiser.

Pink lived with the remote people for several years, teaching English and other skills and including a failed attempt at establishing a 'secular sanctuary' (or commune) for the Warlpiri people, before moving to Alice Springs to live in 1946.  Suffering financial difficulties she lived in huts and a tent on the outskirts of the town living off the proceeds of her home grown fruit and flowers and exhibitions of her artwork as well as a job cleaning the local courthouse. During this period, she met with the artist [[Sidney Nolan]] and his wife, with whom she discussed her experiences with the Aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Cynthia, ''Outback and Beyond'', Angus &amp; Robertson Sydney, 1994, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; She refused the old age pension and managed to live on an income of approximately £6.00 a week.

In 1955 she applied to the Northern Territory administrator for a reservation of about 20 hectares of land on the eastern bank of the [[Todd River]] as a flora reserve.  The following year the grant was gazetted as the 'Australian Arid Regions Flora Reserve', with assistance from the Minister for the Territories, Sir [[Paul Hasluck]].  Pink was appointed as the 'honorary curator'.

Hasluck had considerable correspondence with Pink over many years. In the ''Northern Territory Newsletter'' obituary in 1975 he told the following story:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'At the Arid Zone reserve Miss Pink planted trees and, with the aid of her Aboriginal helper, watered them and tended them. Each tree bore the name of some prominent citizen and if that citizen fell out of favour with her she ceased to water it. So that if the leaves of 'Mr Archer' were drooping and the leaves of 'Mr Marsh' were bright and green or 'Mr Barclay' was growing vigorously one knew at once what had happened in the handling of her latest request. I visited her on several occasions and could never restrain a curious glance at my tree and felt suitably gratified if I saw that 'Mr Hasluck' was being watered regularly.'&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: ''Miss Pinks love story'', Northern Territory Newsletter, July 1975, pp4-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Olive Pink lived in the reserve, assisted by her longtime companion and gardener, Johnny Jambijimba Yannarilyi, until her death, in [[Alice Springs]], [[Northern Territory]], at the age of 91.  She died in [[Alice Springs Hospital]] and is buried in the local cemetery within the [[Quaker]] section, a group with which she held close ties throughout her life and alongside the Aboriginal plots.  After her death, the botanical garden she built was renamed the ''[[Olive Pink Botanic Garden]]'' and opened to the public in 1985.

A collection of Olive Pink's sketches, in pencil and crayon, is held in the [[University of Tasmania]] Library to whom she bequeathed most of her art collection.  Several Namatjira paintings previously owned by her were bequeathed and are held at the [[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery]].

'''Photography by indigenous peoples of the Americas''' is an art form that began in the late 19th century and has expanded in the 21st century, including [[digital photography]], [[underwater photography]], and a wide range of alternative processes. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] have used [[photography]] as a means of expressing their lives and communities from their own perspectives. Native photography stands in contrast to the ubiquitous photography of indigenous peoples by non-natives, which has often been criticized as being staged, exoticized, and romanticized.

==1880s–1920s==

Indigenous peoples of the Americas embraced photography in the 19th century. Some even owned and operated their own photography studios, such as [[Antonio Calderón Sandoval]] ([[Purépecha]], ca. 1847–unknown), the grandfather of [[Frida Kahlo]]; [[Benjamin Haldane]] (1874–1941), [[Tsimshian]] of [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]] Village on [[Annette Island, Alaska]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/inthespirit/our_artwork.php Artwork in ''Our People, Our Land, Our Images.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829153559/http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/inthespirit/our_artwork.php |date=2008-08-29 }} ''The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.'' Retrieved 1 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Throssel]] (1882–1933), [[Cree]] of [[Montana]]. [[Max T. Vargas]] (father of pin-up artist [[Alberto Vargas]]), was a successful Mestizo photographer in [[Arequipa, Peru]], who taught photography to [[Martín Chambi]] (Quechua, 1891–1973), an Indigenous miner. [[Jennie Ross Cobb]] (1881–1959), [[Cherokee Nation]] of [[Park Hill, Oklahoma]], began developing her own film as a young child and photographed her college classmates, family, neighbors, and students.

The works of these early indigenous photographer stand in stark contrast to the romanticized images of non-native photographers. Recent scholarship by Mique’l Askren ([[Tsimshian]]-[[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]) on the photographs of Benjamin A. Haldane has analyzed the functions that Haldane's photographs served for his community: as markers of success by having European-American-style formal portraits taken, and as markers of the continuity of [[potlach]]ing and customary ceremonials by having photographs taken in ceremonial regalia. This second category is particularly significant because the use of the ceremonial regalia was against the law in Canada between 1885-1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travelpeapod.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/bringing-our-history-into-focus/ Mique'l Askren, Bringing our History into Focus: Re-Developing the Work of B.A. Haldane, 19th Century Tsimshian Photographer, ''Blackflash: Seeing Red'', Volume 24, No. 3, 2007, pp. 41-47] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306171344/http://travelpeapod.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/bringing-our-history-into-focus/ |date=2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Native American boarding schools]] were important centers for photography at the turn of the century. John Leslie ([[Puyallup (tribe)|Puyallup]]) learned photography at [[Carlisle Indian School]]. In 1895, Leslie published a book of his photography and exhibited his photographs at the 1895 [[Atlanta International Exposition]]&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Laura.

==1920s–1940s==
[[Peter Pitseolak]] (1902–1973), [[Inuk]] from [[Cape Dorset, Nunavut]], documented Inuit life in the mid-20th century while dealing with challenges presented by the harsh climate and extreme light conditions of the Canadian Arctic. He developed his film himself in his igloo, and some of his photos were shot by oil lamps.

[[Horace Poolaw]] (1906–1984), [[Kiowa]], shot over 2,000 images of his neighbors and relatives in Western Oklahoma from the 1920s onward.

[[Jean Fredericks]] (b. 1906), [[Hopi]], had to carefully negotiate cultural views towards photography and made a point of not offering his portraits of Hopi people for sale to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger 42&lt;/ref&gt;

For a 1980s exhibit of Hopi photographers at Northlight Gallery in [[Tempe, Arizona]], Victor Masayesva, Jr. (Hopi) explained how Hopis protect their privacy from the flood of photographs of them and their community by non-Hopi people. Hopi photographers know that certain subjects, especially ceremonial dances are not meant to be photographed. "The camera which is available to us is a weapon that will violate the silences and secrets so essential to our group survival," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger 10&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hopi photographers do not sell their work to outsides.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of tribal newspapers, such as the ''Qua Toqti'' and ''Hopi Tribal News'' both in the 1970s, created a demand for Native [[photojournalist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger 36&lt;/ref&gt; Owen Seumptewa (Hopi) became photographic consultant to his tribe in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger 37&lt;/ref&gt;

While many native photographers were interested in documenting tribal life, [[Luis González Palma]] ([[Mestizo]], b. 1957) borrows from a [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] aesthetic to create haunting, mysterious portraits of [[Mayan people|Mayan]] and mestizo people, especially women, from his native [[Guatemala]]. He shoots in [[black and white photography|black and white]] but then hand-tints the photographs in [[sepia tone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utata.org/salon/19586.php "Luis González Palma."] ''Utata Tribal Photography.'' Retrieved 1 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Canadian national conference of indigenous photographers took place in March 1985 in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and from that the Native Indian/Inuit Photographers' Association (NIIPA) was formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/CX3039.htm "Native Indian/Inuit Phototgraphers' Association (NIIPA)."] ''Connexions.'' 1986. Retrieved 6 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, NIIPA had fifty members from North America.&lt;ref&gt;Weideman 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Today more Native people are professional art photographers; however, acceptance to the genre has met with challenges. [[Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie]] ([[Navajo people|Navajo]]-[[Muscogee (Creek)|Muscogee]]-[[Seminole]]), has not only established a successful career with her own work, she has also been an advocate for the entire field of Native American photography. She has curated shows and organized conferences at the C.N. Gorman Museum at [[UC Davis]] featuring Native American photographers. Tsinhnahjinnie wrote the book, ''Our People, Our Land, Our Images: International Indigenous Photographers.'' [[Larry McNeil (photographer)|Larry McNeil]] ([[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]) is a fine art photographer and professor who has mentored many emerging indigenous photographers. Together with Tsinhnahjinnie, McNeil curated ''New Native Photography'' at the [[New Mexico Museum of Art]] to draw more attention to the genre of photography during the 2011 [[Santa Fe Indian Market]].&lt;ref&gt;Weideman 36–7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poetry''' (the term derives from a variant of the [[Greek language|Greek]] term, ''[[poiesis]]'', "making") is a form of [[literature]]  that uses [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] and rhythmic&lt;!-- Please discuss on talk page before removing or altering this word. Dictionary definitions of "poetry" tend to include, in addition to the aesthetic quality of poetry, a structural/rhythmical/metrical quality as well. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/poetry?q=poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|year=2013|postscript=—Based on the Random House Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/poetry?s=t}}&lt;/ref&gt; qualities of [[language]]—such as [[phonaesthetics]], [[sound symbolism]], and [[metre (poetry)|metre]]—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the [[Prose|prosaic]] ostensible [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].

Poetry has a long [[history of poetry|history]], dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry in Africa, and panegyric and elegiac court poetry were developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile, Niger and Volta river valleys &lt;ref&gt; Oral Literature in Africa, Ruth Finnegan, Open Book Publishers, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among the [[Pyramid Texts]] written during the 25th century BCE, while the [[Epic of Sundiata]] is one of the most well-known examples of [[griot]] court poetry. The earliest Western Asian epic poetry, the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', was written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].  Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]'', or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]] ''[[Vedas]]'', [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ''[[Gathas]]'', and the [[Homer]]ic epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', focused on the uses of [[Speech communication|speech]] in [[rhetoric]], [[drama]], [[song]] and [[comedy]]. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, [[line (poetry)|verse form]] and [[rhyme]], and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively informative, [[prose|prosaic]] forms of writing.

Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as [[assonance]], [[alliteration]], [[onomatopoeia]] and [[rhythm]] are sometimes used to achieve [[music]]al or [[incantation|incantatory]] effects. The use of [[ambiguity]], [[symbol]]ism, [[irony]] and other [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] elements of [[poetic diction]] often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as [[metaphor]], [[simile]] and [[metonymy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Strachan, John R|author2=Terry, Richard, G|isbn=978-0814797976|title=Poetry: an introduction|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2000|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual [[Verse (poetry)|verses]], in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.

Some poetry types are specific to particular [[culture]]s and [[genre]]s and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]] and [[Rumi]] may think of it as written in [[Line (poetry)|lines]] based on [[rhyme]] and regular [[meter (poetry)|meter]]; there are, however, traditions, such as [[Biblical poetry]], that use other means to create rhythm and [[euphony]]. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliot, TS|chapter=The Function of Criticism|title=Selected Essays|isbn=978-0151803873|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|year=1999|pages=13–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Longenbach, James|title=Modern Poetry After Modernism|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195101782|year=1997|pages=9, 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=xxvii–xxxiii|editor=Schmidt, Michael|title=The Harvill Book of Twentieth-Century Poetry in English|publisher=Harvill Press|year=1999|isbn=1860467350}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's increasingly [[globalization|globalized]] world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.

Some scholars believe that the art of poetry may predate [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoivik|first=S|author2=Luger, K|title=Folk Media for Biodiversity Conservation: A Pilot Project from the Himalaya-Hindu Kush|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=3 June 2009|volume=71|issue=4|pages=321–346|doi=10.1177/1748048509102184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, however, suggest that poetry did not necessarily predate writing.&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 98"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goody, Jack|title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|page=98|isbn=0521337941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving [[epic poetry|epic poem]], the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', comes from the 3rd millennium{{nbsp}}BCE in [[Sumer]] (in [[Mesopotamia]], now [[Iraq]]), and was written in [[cuneiform script]] on clay tablets and, later, on [[papyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sanders, NK (trans.)|title=The Epic of Gilgamesh|publisher=Penguin Books|edition=Revised|year=1972|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tablet dating to c.{{nbsp}}2000{{nbsp}}BCE describes an annual rite in which the king [[sacred marriage|symbolically married]] and mated with the goddess [[Inanna]] to ensure fertility and prosperity; it is considered the world's oldest love poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/750/|title=

[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aristotle]]]]
Other ancient [[epic poetry]] includes the [[Greek language|Greek]] epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''Odyssey''; the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] books, the ''[[Gathas|Gathic Avesta]]'' and the ''[[Yasna]]''; the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[national epic]], [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''; and the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]], the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.  Epic poetry, including the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the ''[[Gathas]]'', and the [[Vedic period|Indian]] ''[[Vedas]]'', appears to have been composed in poetic form as an aid to memorization and oral transmission, in prehistoric and ancient societies.&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ahl, Frederick |author2=Roisman, Hannah M |title=The Odyssey Re-Formed|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1996|pages=1–26|isbn=0801483352}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of poetry developed directly from folk songs. The earliest entries in the oldest extant collection of [[Chinese poetry]], the  ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]'', were initially lyrics.&lt;ref name="Ebrey"&gt;{{cite book|first=Patricia|last=Ebrey|year=1993|title=Chinese Civilisation: A Sourcebook|edition=2nd|publisher=The Free Press|isbn=978-0029087527|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of ancient thinkers to determine what makes poetry distinctive as a form, and what distinguishes good poetry from bad, resulted in "[[poetics]]"—the study of the aesthetics of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abondolo|first=Daniel|title=A poetics handbook: verbal art in the European tradition|year=2001|publisher=Curzon|isbn=9780700712236|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient societies, such as China's through her ''[[Shijing]]'' (''Classic of Poetry''), developed canons of poetic works that had ritual as well as aesthetic importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gentz, Joachim|title=Text and Ritual in Early China|chapter=Ritual Meaning of Textual Form: Evidence from Early Commentaries of the Historiographic and Ritual Traditions|editor=Kern, Martin|pages=124–48|isbn=978-0295987873|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, thinkers have struggled to find a definition that could encompass formal differences as great as those between Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Matsuo Bashō]]'s ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'', as well as differences in content spanning [[Tanakh]] [[Biblical poetry|religious poetry]], love poetry, and [[rapping|rap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=607–09, 620|title=A history of literary criticism|author=Habib, Rafey|isbn=978-0631232001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western traditions ===
[[File:John keats.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.4|[[John Keats]]]]
Classical thinkers employed classification as a way to define and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Heath, Malcolm|title=Aristotle's ''Poetics''|publisher=Penguin Books |year=1997|isbn=0140446362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Aesthetics|aestheticians]] identified three major genres: epic poetry, [[lyric poetry]], and [[dramatic poetry]], treating [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]] as [[Genre|subgenres]] of dramatic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frow|first=John|title=Genre|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415280631|pages=57–59|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's work was influential throughout the Middle East during the [[Islamic Golden Age]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogges, WF |title='Hermannus Alemannus' Latin Anthology of Arabic Poetry |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |year=1968 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=657–70 |doi=10.2307/598112 |jstor=598112}} {{cite book |author=Burnett, Charles |chapter= Learned Knowledge of Arabic Poetry, Rhymed Prose, and Didactic Verse from Petrus Alfonsi to Petrarch |title=Poetry and Philosophy in the Middle Ages: A Festschrift for Peter Dronke |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2001 |isbn=9004119647 |pages=29–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Europe during the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, Paul F |title=The Universities of the Italian Renaissance |publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0801880556 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to [[prose]], which was generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kant, Immanuel; Bernard, JH (trans.)|title=Critique of Judgment |publisher=Macmillan|year=1914|page=131}} Kant argues that the nature of poetry as a self-consciously abstract and beautiful form raises it to the highest level among the verbal arts, with tone or music following it, and only after that the more logical and narrative prose.&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not imply that poetry is illogical or lacks narration, but rather that poetry is an attempt to render the beautiful or sublime without the burden of engaging the logical or narrative thought process. English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet [[John Keats]] termed this escape from logic "[[Negative Capability]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ou |first=Li |title=Keats and negative capability |year=2009 |publisher= Continuum |isbn=978-1441147240 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "romantic" approach views form as a key element of successful poetry because form is abstract and distinct from the underlying notional logic. This approach remained influential into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watten |first=Barrett |title= The constructivist moment: from material text to cultural poetics |year=2003 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |isbn=978-0819566102|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, there was also substantially more interaction among the various poetic traditions, in part due to the spread of European [[colonialism]] and the attendant rise in global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Mahfouz, Ahmad |title=Translation as a Blending of Cultures |journal=Journal of Translation |volume=4 |issue=1 |year=2008 |url= http://pnglanguages.org/siljot/2008/1/51140/siljot2008-1-01.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120309034908/http://pnglanguages.org/siljot/2008/1/51140/siljot2008-1-01.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a boom in [[translation]], during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Highet |first=Gilbert |title=The classical tradition: Greek and Roman influences on western literature |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195002065 |pages=355, 360, 479 |edition=Reissued}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th-century and 21st-century disputes ===
[[File:Archibaldmacleish.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Archibald MacLeish]]]]
Some 20th-century [[Literary theory|literary theorists]], relying less on the opposition of prose and poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wimsatt, William K, Jr |author2=Brooks, Cleanth |title=Literary Criticism: A Short History|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1957|page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some [[modernist poetry|modernist poets]] essentially do not distinguish between the creation of a poem with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Jeannine|title=Why write poetry?: modern poets defending their art|year=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=978-0838641057|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rejection of traditional forms and structures for poetry that began in the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-[[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] means. While there was a substantial [[New Formalism|formalist]] reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Jenkins, Lee M; Davis, Alex|title=The Cambridge companion to modernist poetry|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521618151|pages=1–7, 38, 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[postmodernism]] has come to convey more completely prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize the role of the reader of a text ([[Hermeneutics]]), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Roland Barthes|Barthes, Roland]]|chapter=[[Death of the author|Death of the Author]]|title=Image-Music-Text|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|year=1978|pages=142–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that were once sensible within a tradition such as the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connor|first=Steven|title=Postmodernist culture: an introduction to theories of the contemporary|year=1997|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-0631200529|pages=123–28|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 21st century poetic tradition appears to continue to strongly orient itself to earlier precursor poetic traditions such as those initiated by Whitman, Emerson, and Wordsworth. The literary critic [[Geoffrey Hartman]] has used the phrase "the anxiety of demand" to describe contemporary response to older poetic traditions as "being fearful that the fact no longer has a form", building on a trope introduced by Emerson. Emerson had maintained that in the debate concerning poetic structure where either "form" or "fact" could predominate, that one need simply "Ask the fact for the form." This has been challenged at various levels by other literary scholars such as [[Harold Bloom|Bloom]] who has stated in summary form concerning the early 21st century that: "The generation of poets who stand together now, mature and ready to write the major American verse of the twenty-first century, may yet be seen as what Stevens called 'a great shadow's last embellishment,' the shadow being Emerson's."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold (2006). ''Bloom's Modern Critical Views: Contemporary Poets.'' Bloom's Literary Criticism, Infobase Publishing, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements ==

=== Prosody ===
{{Main article|Meter (poetry)}}
Prosody is the study of the meter, [[rhythm]], and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as [[iambic pentameter]]), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the [[scansion|scanning]] of poetic lines to show meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rhythm ====
{{Main article|Timing (linguistics)|tone (linguistics)|Pitch accent}}
[[File:Robinsonjeffers.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robinson Jeffers]]]]

The methods for creating poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic traditions. Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by [[stress-timed language|accents]], [[syllable-timed language|syllables]], or [[mora-timed language|moras]], depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. [[Japanese Language|Japanese]] is a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-timed language. [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French language|French]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are called syllable-timed languages. Stress-timed languages include [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and, generally, [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schülter, Julia|title=Rhythmic Grammar|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2005|pages=24, 304, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varying [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch or tone. Some languages with a pitch accent are Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek. [[Tonal language]]s include Chinese, Vietnamese and most [[Niger–Congo languages|Subsaharan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yip, Moira|title=Tone|series=Cambridge textbooks in linguistics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521773148|pages=1–4, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called [[foot (prosody)|feet]] within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or [[elision|elided]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[classical languages]], on the other hand, while the [[Meter (music)|metrical]] units are similar, [[vowel length]] rather than stresses define the meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorgens|first=Elise Bickford|title=The well-tun'd word : musical interpretations of English poetry, 1597–1651|year=1982|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0816610297|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old English]] poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief device of ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Biblical poetry]], including many of the [[psalms]], was ''[[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]'', a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to [[antiphon]]al or [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] performance, which could also be reinforced by [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker-Jones|first=Arthur|title=Hebrew for biblical interpretation|year=2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|isbn=978-1589830868|pages=211–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some classical poetry forms, such as [[Venpa]] of the [[Tamil language]], had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]]) which ensured a rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bala Sundara Raman|first=L|author2=Ishwar, S|author3= Kumar Ravindranath, Sanjeeth|title=Context Free Grammar for Natural Language Constructs: An implementation for Venpa Class of Tamil Poetry|journal=Tamil Internet|year=2003|pages=128–36|doi=|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.3.7738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shi (poetry)|Classical Chinese poetics]], based on the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|tone system of Middle Chinese]], recognized two kinds of tones: the level (平 ''píng'') tone and the oblique (仄 ''zè'') tones, a category consisting of the rising (上 ''sháng'') tone, the departing (去 ''qù'') tone and the entering (入 ''rù'') tone. Certain forms of poetry placed contraints on which syllables were required to be level and which oblique.

The formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In the case of [[free verse]], rhythm is often organized based on looser units of [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] rather than a regular meter. [[Robinson Jeffers]], [[Marianne Moore]], and [[William Carlos Williams]] are three notable poets who reject the idea that regular accentual meter is critical to English poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartman|first=Charles O|title=Free Verse An Essay on Prosody|year=1980|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0810113169|pages=24, 44, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffers experimented with [[sprung rhythm]] as an alternative to accentual rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western poetic tradition, meters are customarily grouped according to a characteristic [[metrical foot]] and the number of feet per line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of metrical feet in a line are described using Greek terminology: [[tetrameter]] for four feet and [[hexameter]] for six feet, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=25, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "[[iambic pentameter]]" is a meter comprising five feet per line, in which the predominant kind of foot is the "[[Iamb (foot)|iamb]]". This metric system originated in ancient [[Greek poetry]], and was used by poets such as [[Pindar]] and [[Sappho]], and by the great [[Tragedy|tragedians]] of [[Athens]]. Similarly, "[[dactylic hexameter]]", comprises six feet per line, of which the dominant kind of foot is the "[[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]]". Dactylic hexameter was the traditional meter of Greek [[epic poetry]], the earliest extant examples of which are the works of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref name=greek&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Aoidoi|title=Introduction to Greek Meter|date=January 2006|author=Annis, William S|pages=1–15|url=http://aoidoi.org/articles/meter/intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iambic pentameter and dactylic hexameter were later used by a number of poets, including [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unibl.eu/pdf/examples_metrical_systems.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211254/http://www.unibl.eu/pdf/examples_metrical_systems.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |title=Examples of English metrical systems |publisher=Fondazione Universitaria in provincia di Belluno }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common metrical feet in English are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Homer British Museum.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Homer]]: Roman bust, based on Greek original&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait Bust|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=460092&amp;partId=1|website=britishmuseum.org|publisher=The British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] – one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable (e.g. des-'''cribe''', in-'''clude''', re-'''tract''')
* [[trochee]] – one stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable (e.g. '''pic'''-ture, '''flow'''-er)
* [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] – one stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables (e.g. '''an'''-no-tate, '''sim'''-i-lar)
* [[anapest]] – two unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable (e.g. com-pre-'''hend''')
* [[spondee]] – two stressed syllables together (e.g. '''heart'''-'''beat''', '''four'''-'''teen''')
* [[pyrrhic]] – two unstressed syllables together (rare, usually used to end dactylic hexameter)

There are a wide range of names for other types of feet, right up to a [[choriamb]], a four syllable metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient [[Greek poetry|Greek]] and [[Latin poetry]].&lt;ref name=greek/&gt; Languages which utilize [[vowel length]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as [[Meter (poetry)#Ottoman Turkish|Ottoman Turkish]] or [[Vedic meter|Vedic]], often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiparsky, Paul|journal=Language|pages=576–616|title=Stress, Syntax, and Meter|date=September 1975|volume=51|issue=3|doi=10.2307/412889|jstor=412889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these types of feet has a certain "feel," whether alone or in combination with other feet. The iamb, for example, is the most natural form of rhythm in the English language, and generally produces a subtle but stable verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thompson, John|title=The Founding of English Meter|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1961|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scanning meter can often show the basic or fundamental pattern underlying a verse, but does not show the varying degrees of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], as well as the differing pitches and [[vowel length|lengths]] of syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|pp=11–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate over how useful a multiplicity of different "feet" is in describing meter. For example, [[Robert Pinsky]] has argued that while dactyls are important in classical verse, English dactylic verse uses dactyls very irregularly and can be better described based on patterns of iambs and anapests, feet which he considers natural to the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual rhythm is significantly more complex than the basic scanned meter described above, and many scholars have sought to develop systems that would scan such complexity. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term "scud" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nabokov, Vladimir|title=Notes on Prosody|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|year=1964|isbn=978-0691017600|pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Metrical patterns ====

{{Main article|Meter (poetry)}}
Different traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean [[iambic pentameter]] and the Homeric [[dactylic hexameter]] to the [[anapestic tetrameter]] used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a [[caesura]] (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a [[Meter (poetry)|feminine ending]] to soften it or be replaced by a [[spondee]] to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=36–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, [[iambic tetrameter]] in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nabokov, Vladimir|title=Notes on Prosody|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|year=1964|isbn=0691017603|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kiprensky Pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Pushkin]]]]
Some common metrical patterns, with notable examples of poets and poems who use them, include:
* [[Iambic pentameter]] ([[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]''; [[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Shakespeare's Sonnets|Sonnets]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dactylic hexameter]] (Homer, ''[[Iliad]]''; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iambic tetrameter]] ([[Andrew Marvell]], "[[To His Coy Mistress]]"; [[Alexander Pushkin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''; [[Robert Frost]], ''[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]'')&lt;ref name=tetra&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tetrameter.com|accessdate=10 December 2011|title=What is Tetrameter?|publisher=tetrameter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Trochaic tetrameter]] ([[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]) "[[The Song of Hiawatha]]"; the Finnish national epic "[[Kalevala]]" is also in trochaic tetrameter, the natural rhythm of Finnish and Estonian.
* [[Alexandrine]] ([[Jean Racine]], ''[[Phèdre]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=ED|title=Racine: Phèdre|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521397216|pages=32–34|author2=Jondorf, G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhyme, alliteration, assonance ===
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Old English]] [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is in [[alliterative]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]].]]
{{Main article|Rhyme|Alliterative verse|Assonance}}

Rhyme, alliteration, assonance and [[Literary consonance|consonance]] are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound. They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem,  to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, [[Chaucer]] used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter='I kan nat geeste': Chaucer's Artful Alliteration|author=Osberg, Richard H|editor=Gaylord, Alan T|title=Essays on the art of Chaucer's verse|isbn=978-0815329510|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|pages=195–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhyme consists of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("[[internal rhyme]]"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|author=Alighieri, Dante; Pinsky Robert (trans.)|title=The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|year=1994|isbn=0374176744}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.&lt;ref name=kiparsky&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Daedalus|title=The Role of Linguistics in a Theory of Poetry|author=Kiparsky, Paul|pages=231–44|date=Summer 1973|volume=102|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.

Assonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in [[skald]]ic poetry, but goes back to the Homeric epic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=64–86|title=Beowulf and old Germanic metre|author=Russom, Geoffrey|isbn=978-0521593403|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liu|first=James JY|title=Art of Chinese Poetry|year=1990|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226486871|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.&lt;ref name=kiparsky/&gt;

==== Rhyming schemes ====

{{Main article|Rhyme scheme}}

In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as [[ballad]]s, [[sonnet]]s and [[couplet|rhyming couplets]]. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional [[rhyme scheme]]s. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wesling|first=Donald|title=The chances of rhyme|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520038615|pages=x–xi, 38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhyme entered European poetry in the [[High Middle Ages]], in part under the influence of the [[Arabic language]] in [[Al Andalus]] (modern Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=88|author=Menocal, Maria Rosa|title=The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2003|isbn=0812213246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the [[6th century in poetry|sixth century]], as in their long, rhyming [[qasida]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Sperl, Stefan|title=Qasida poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004103870|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the [[chant royal]] or the [[Ruba'i|rubaiyat]], while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=71–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line does not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an "a-a-b-a" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an "a-b-b-a" quatrain (what is known as "[[enclosed rhyme]]") is used in such forms as the [[Petrarchan sonnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the "a-b-c" convention, such as the [[ottava rima]] and [[terza rima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=81–82, 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types and use of differing rhyming schemes is discussed further in the [[rhyme scheme|main article]].

=== Form in poetry ===
Poetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry, and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in [[free verse]]. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitworth|first=Michael H|title=Reading modernist poetry|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405167314|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the [[stanza]] or [[verse paragraph]], and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as [[canto]]s. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and [[calligraphy]]. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called ''poetic forms'' or poetic modes (see following section), as in the [[sonnet]] or [[haiku]].

==== Lines and stanzas ====
Poetry is often separated into lines on a page. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=7–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the article on [[line break (poetry)|line breaks]] for information about the division between lines.

Lines of poems are often organized into [[stanza]]s, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a [[couplet]] (or [[distich]]), three lines a [[tercet|triplet]] (or [[tercet]]), four lines a [[quatrain]], and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander Blok - Noch, ulica, fonar, apteka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s [[Russian language|Russian]] poem, "''Noch, ulitsa, fonar, apteka''" ("Night, street, lamp, drugstore"), on a wall in [[Leiden]]]]

Other poems may be organized into [[verse paragraph]]s, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Dalrymple, Roger|title=Middle English Literature: a guide to criticism|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-0631232902|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the [[ghazal]] and the [[villanelle]], where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the [[strophe]], [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In [[skald]]ic poetry, the [[dróttkvætt]] stanza had eight lines, each having three "lifts" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dróttkvætts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dróttkvætts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-1405137386|pages=269–80|editor=McTurk, Rory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Visual presentation ====
[[File:Visual poetry.jpg|thumb|upright=0.35|[[Visual poetry]]]]
{{Main article|Visual poetry}}
Even before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth. [[Acrostic]] poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Harvard Theological Review|title=Acrostics and Metrics in Hebrew Poetry|author=Freedman, David Noel|volume=65|issue=3|date=July 1972|pages=367–92|doi=10.1017/s0017816000001620}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arabic poetry|Arabic]], [[Jewish literature#Poetry|Hebrew]] and [[Chinese poetry]], the visual presentation of finely [[calligraphy|calligraphed]] poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kampf|first=Robert|title=Reading the Visual – 17th century poetry and visual culture|year=2010|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3640600113|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[printing]], poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some [[Modernism|Modernist]] poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's [[rhythm]] through visual [[caesura]]s of various lengths, or creates [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtapositions]] so as to accentuate meaning, [[ambiguity]] or [[irony]], or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, this can lead to [[concrete poetry]] or [[asemic writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohn|first=Willard|title=The aesthetics of visual poetry|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226063256|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Wired|author=Sterling, Bruce|title=Web Semantics: Asemic writing|date=13 July 2009|url=https://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2009/07/web-semantics-asemic-writing/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027152452/http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2009/07/web-semantics-asemic-writing/|archivedate=2009-10-27|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetic diction treats the manner in which language is used, and refers not only to the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barfield|first=Owen|title=Poetic diction: a study in meaning|year=1987|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0819560261|edition=2nd|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct [[grammar]]s and [[dialect]]s are used specifically for poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=American Journal of Philology|author=Sheets, George A|title=The Dialect Gloss, Hellenistic Poetics and Livius Andronicus|pages=58–78|volume=102|issue=1|date=Spring 1981|doi=10.2307/294154|jstor=294154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blank|first=Paula|title=Broken English: dialects and the politics of language in Renaissance writings|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415137799|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Register tone|Registers]] in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perloff|first=Marjorie|title=21st-century modernism: the new poetics|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|isbn=978-0631219705|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval lyric: genres in historical context|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0252025365|editor=Paden, William D|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetic diction can include [[rhetorical device]]s such as [[simile]] and [[metaphor]], as well as tones of voice, such as [[irony]]. [[Aristotle]] wrote in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' that "the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg|name=The Poetics of Aristotle|1974}}, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of [[Modernism]], some poets have opted for a poetic diction that de-emphasizes rhetorical devices, attempting instead the direct presentation of things and experiences and the exploration of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge companion to modernist poetry|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521618151|pages=90–96|editors=Davis, Alex; Jenkins, Lee M}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[surrealism|Surrealists]] have pushed rhetorical devices to their limits, making frequent use of [[catachresis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=San Juan|first=E, Jr|title=Working through the contradictions from cultural theory to critical practice|year=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0838755709|pages=124–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allegory|Allegorical]] stories are central to the poetic diction of many cultures, and were prominent in the West during classical times, the [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 BCE, are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry through the ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treip|first=Mindele Anne|title=Allegorical poetics and the epic: the Renaissance tradition to Paradise Lost|year=1994|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0813118314|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notables examples include the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', a 13th-century French poem, [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Ploughman]]'' in the 14th century, and [[Jean de la Fontaine]]'s ''Fables'' (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain [[symbols]] or [[allusion]]s that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crisp|first=P|title=Allegory and symbol – a fundamental opposition?|journal=Language and Literature|date=1 November 2005|volume=14|issue=4|pages=323–38|doi=10.1177/0963947005051287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another element of poetic diction can be the use of vivid [[imagery (literature)|imagery]] for effect. The juxtaposition of unexpected or impossible images is, for example, a particularly strong element in surrealist poetry and [[haiku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Modern Haiku|volume=35|issue=2|pages=21–44|year=2004|author=Gilbert, Richard|title=The Disjunctive Dragonfly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivid images are often endowed with symbolism or metaphor. Many poetic dictions use repetitive phrases for effect, either a short phrase (such as Homer's "rosy-fingered dawn" or "the wine-dark sea") or a longer [[refrain]]. Such repetition can add a sombre tone to a poem, or can be laced with irony as the context of the words changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==
{{see also|Category:Poetic form}}
Specific poetic forms have been developed by many cultures. In more developed, closed or "received" poetic forms, the rhyming scheme, meter and other elements of a poem are based on sets of rules, ranging from the relatively loose rules that govern the construction of an [[elegy]] to the highly formalized structure of the [[ghazal]] or [[villanelle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=160–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described below are some common forms of poetry widely used across a number of languages. Additional forms of poetry may be found in the discussions of poetry of particular cultures or periods and in the [[Glossary of poetry terms|glossary]].

=== Sonnet ===
[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shakespeare]]]]
{{Main article|Sonnet}}

Among the most common forms of poetry, popular from the [[Late Middle Ages]] on, is the sonnet, which by the 13th century had become standardized as fourteen lines following a set rhyme scheme and logical structure. By the 14th century and the [[Italian Renaissance]], the form had further crystallized under the pen of [[Petrarch]], whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; A traditional Italian or [[Petrarchan sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE'', though some variation, perhaps the most common being CDCDCD, especially within the final six lines (or ''sestet''), is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=15–17|title=Petrarch and Petrarchism|author=Minta, Stephen|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1980|isbn=0719007488}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[English sonnet|English (or Shakespearean) sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG'', introducing a third [[quatrain]] (grouping of four lines), a final [[couplet]], and a greater amount of variety with regard to rhyme than is usually found in its Italian predecessors. By convention, sonnets in English typically use [[iambic pentameter]], while in the [[Romance languages]], the [[hendecasyllable]] and [[Alexandrine]] are the most widely used meters.

Sonnets of all types often make use of a ''volta'', or "turn," a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a question is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated. This ''volta'' can often take the form of a "but" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.
[[File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Carol Ann Duffy]]]]
Sonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as [[Edmund Spenser]] (who gave his name to the [[Spenserian sonnet]]), [[Michael Drayton]], and Shakespeare, whose [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Quiller-Couch, Arthur|title=[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the twists and turns associated with the ''volta'' allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics ([[John Milton]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Claude McKay]]), theology ([[John Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]), war ([[Wilfred Owen]], [[e.e. cummings]]), and gender and sexuality ([[Carol Ann Duffy]]). Further, postmodern authors such as [[Ted Berrigan]] and [[John Berryman]] have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of "sonnets" that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.

=== Shi ===
[[File:Dufucalligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Du Fu]], "On Visiting the Temple of [[Laozi]]"]]
{{Main article|Shi (poetry)}}
''Shi'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:詩|詩]]|s=[[wikt:诗|诗]]|p=shī|w=shih}}) Is the main type of [[Classical Chinese poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971). ''CHINESE LYRICISM: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century''. (New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0231034644}}, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Within this form of poetry the most important variations are "folk song" styled verse (''[[yuefu]]''), "old style" verse (''[[gushi (poetry)|gushi]]''), "modern style" verse (''[[jintishi]]''). In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of ''shi'' poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or ''[[jueju]]'') or else an eight line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a [[caesura]] before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971). ''Chinese Lyricism: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century''. (New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0231034644}}, 1–2 and 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; The "old style" verse (''gushi'') is less formally strict than the ''jintishi'', or regulated verse, which, despite the name "new style" verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back as [[Shen Yue]] (441–513 CE), although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of [[Chen Zi'ang]] (661–702 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971). ''Chinese Lyricism: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century''. (New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0231034644}}, 111 and 115&lt;/ref&gt;  A good example of a poet known for his ''gushi'' poems is [[Li Bai]] (701–762 CE). Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]]. The basic form of jintishi (lushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of [[allusion]], and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faurot|first=Jeannette L|title=Drinking with the moon|year=1998|publisher=China Books &amp; Periodicals|isbn=978-0835126397|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yugen|title=Shige: The Popular Poetics of Regulated Verse|journal=T'ang Studies|date=1 June 2004|volume=2004|issue=22|pages=81–125|doi=10.1179/073750304788913221}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the masters of the form was [[Du Fu]] (712–770 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schirokauer|first=Conrad|title=A brief history of Chinese and Japanese civilizations|year=1989|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=978-0155055698|edition=2nd|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Villanelle ===
[[File:AudenLibraryOfCongress.jpg|thumb|upright|[[W.H. Auden]]]]
{{Main article|Villanelle}}

The villanelle is a nineteen-line poem made up of five triplets with a closing quatrain; the poem is characterized by having two refrains, initially used in the first and third lines of the first stanza, and then alternately used at the close of each subsequent stanza until the final quatrain, which is concluded by the two refrains. The remaining lines of the poem have an a-b alternating rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=314|author=Kumin, Maxine|title=An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets Celebrate the Diversity of Their Art|chapter=Gymnastics: The Villanelle|editor=Varnes, Kathrine|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0472067251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villanelle has been used regularly in the English language since the late 19th century by such poets as [[Dylan Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;"[[Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night]]" in {{cite book|author=Thomas, Dylan|title=In Country Sleep and Other Poems|publisher=New Directions Publications|year=1952|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W.H.

=== Limerick ===
{{main article|Limerick (poetry)}}
A limerick is a poem that consists of five lines and is often humorous. Rhythm is very important in limericks for the first, second and fifth lines must have seven to ten syllables. However, the third and fourth lines only need five to seven. All of the lines must rhyme and have the same rhythm.

=== Tanka ===
[[File:Kakinomoto Hitomaro.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|[[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]]]]
{{Main article|Tanka}}
Tanka is a form of unrhymed [[Japanese poetry]], with five sections totalling 31 ''[[onji]]'' (phonological units identical to [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]]), structured in a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=181|title=Global linguistic flows|editors=Samy Alim, H; Ibrahim, Awad; Pennycook, Alastair|isbn=978-0805862836|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is generally a shift in tone and subject matter between the upper 5-7-5 phrase and the lower 7-7 phrase. Tanka were written as early as the [[Asuka period]] by such poets as [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]] (''fl.'' late 7th century), at a time when Japan was emerging from a period where much of its poetry followed Chinese form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brower|first=Robert H|title=Japanese court poetry|year=1988|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0804715249|pages=86–92|author2=Miner, Earl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanka was originally the shorter form of Japanese formal poetry (which was generally referred to as "[[waka (poetry)|waka]]"), and was used more heavily to explore personal rather than public themes. By the tenth century, tanka had become the dominant form of Japanese poetry, to the point where the originally general term ''waka'' ("Japanese poetry") came to be used exclusively for tanka. Tanka are still widely written today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The tanka anthology: tanka in English from around the world|year=2003|publisher=Red Moon Press|isbn=978-1893959408|pages=xxx–xlviii|editor1=McCllintock, Michael |editor2=Ness, Pamela Miller |editor3=Kacian, Jim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiku ===
{{Main article|Haiku}}
Haiku is a popular form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, which evolved in the 17th century from the ''[[hokku]]'', or opening verse of a [[renku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally written in a single vertical line, the haiku contains three sections totalling 17 ''onji'', structured in a 5-7-5 pattern. Traditionally, haiku contain a [[kireji]], or cutting word, usually placed at the end of one of the poem's three sections, and a [[kigo]], or season-word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haiku moment: an anthology of contemporary North American haiku|year=1993|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co|isbn=978-0804818209|editor=Ross, Bruce|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous exponent of the haiku was [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644–1694).

=== Khlong ===
{{Main article|Thai poetry}}
The ''khlong'' ({{lang|th|โคลง}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ|}}) is among the oldest Thai poetic forms. This is reflected in its requirements on the tone markings of certain syllables, which must be marked with ''mai ek'' ({{lang|th|ไม้เอก}}, {{IPA-th|máj èːk|}}, {{lang|th|◌่}}) or ''mai tho'' ({{lang|th|ไม้โท}}, {{IPA-th|máj tʰōː|}}, {{lang|th|◌้}}). This was likely derived from when the Thai language had three tones (as opposed to today's five, a split which occurred during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] period), two of which corresponded directly to the aforementioned marks. It is usually regarded as an advanced and sophisticated poetic form.&lt;ref name="Hudak khloong"&gt;{{cite web|title=โคลง Khloong|work=Thai Language Audio Resource Center|url=http://thaiarc.tu.ac.th/poetry/khloong/khloonge.html|publisher=Thammasat University|accessdate=6 March 2012}} Reproduced form {{cite book|last=Hudak|first=Thomas John|title=The indigenization of Pali meters in Thai poetry|year=1990|series=Monographs in International Studies, Southeast Asia Series|issue=87|publisher=Ohio University Center for International Studies|location=Athens, Ohio|isbn=978-0896801592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''khlong'', a stanza (''bot'', {{lang|th|บท}}, {{IPA-th|bòt|}}) has a number of lines (''bat'', {{lang|th|บาท}}, {{IPA-th|bàːt|}}, from [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Pada (foot)|pāda]]''), depending on the type. The ''bat'' are subdivided into two ''wak'' ({{lang|th|วรรค}}, {{IPA-th|wák|}}, from Sanskrit ''varga'').&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In literary studies, ''line'' in western poetry is translated as ''bat''. However, in some forms, the unit is more equivalent to ''wak''. To avoid confusion, this article will refer to ''wak'' and ''bat'' instead of ''line'', which may refer to either.&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''wak'' has five syllables, the second has a variable number, also depending on the type, and may be optional. The type of ''khlong'' is named by the number of ''bat'' in a stanza; it may also be divided into two main types: ''khlong suphap'' ({{lang|th|โคลงสุภาพ}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ sù.pʰâːp|}}) and ''khlong dan'' ({{lang|th|โคลงดั้น}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ dân|}}). The two differ in the number of syllables in the second ''wak'' of the final ''bat'' and inter-stanza rhyming rules.&lt;ref name="Hudak khloong" /&gt;

==== Khlong si suphap ====
The ''khlong si suphap'' ({{lang|th|โคลงสี่สุภาพ}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ sìː sù.pʰâːp|}}) is the most common form still currently employed. It has four ''bat'' per stanza (''si'' translates as ''four''). The first ''wak'' of each ''bat'' has five syllables. The second ''wak'' has two or four syllables in the first and third ''bat'', two syllables in the second, and four syllables in the fourth. ''Mai ek'' is required for seven syllables and ''Mai tho'' is required for four, as shown below. "[[Dead word (Thai language)|Dead word]]" syllables are allowed in place of syllables which require ''mai ek'', and changing the spelling of words to satisfy the criteria is usually acceptable.

=== Ode ===
[[File:Quintus Horatius Flaccus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Horace]]]]
{{Main article|Ode}}

Odes were first developed by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as [[Pindar]], and Latin, such as [[Horace]]. Forms of odes appear in many of the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Thomas|title=English lyrics from Dryden to Burns|year=2000|publisher=Elibron|isbn=978-1402100642|pages=155–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ode generally has three parts: a [[strophe]], an [[antistrophe]], and an [[epode]]. The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction, and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gayley|first=Charles Mills|title=English Poetry|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1417900862|edition=Reprint|author2=Young, Clement C|page=lxxxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode. One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the [[qasida]] in [[Persian poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuiper|first=edited by Kathleen|title=Poetry and drama literary terms and concepts|year=2011|publisher=Britannica Educational Pub. in association with Rosen Educational Services|isbn=978-1615305391|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ghazal ===

{{Main article|Ghazal}}

The ghazal (also ghazel, gazel, gazal, or gozol) is a form of poetry common in [[Arabic poetry|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Urdu poetry|Urdu]] and [[Bengali poetry]]. In classic form, the ghazal has from five to fifteen rhyming couplets that share a [[refrain]] at the end of the second line. This refrain may be of one or several syllables, and is preceded by a rhyme. Each line has an identical meter. The ghazal often reflects on a theme of unattainable love or divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campo|first=Juan E|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2009|publisher=Infobase|isbn=978-0816054541|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other forms with a long history in many languages, many variations have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in [[Urdu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|volume=43|issue=3|date=Autumn 1990|title=Musical Gesture and Extra-Musical Meaning: Words and Music in the Urdu Ghazal|author=Qureshi, Regula Burckhardt|pages=457–97|doi=10.1525/jams.1990.43.3.03a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghazals have a classical affinity with [[Sufism]], and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter and the use of the refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sequeira|first=Isaac|title=The Mystique of the Mushaira|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=1 June 1981|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1981.4745121.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the masters of the form is [[Rumi]], a 13th-century [[Persia]]n poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Religion &amp; Literature|volume=20|issue=1|date=Spring 1988|title=Mystical Poetry in Islam: The Case of Maulana Jalaladdin Rumi|author=Schimmel, Annemarie|pages=67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the most famous poet in this type of poetry is [[Hafez]], whose poems often include the theme of exposing hypocrisy. His life and poems have been the subject of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, influencing post-fourteenth century Persian writing more than any other author.&lt;ref&gt;Yarshater.

== Genres ==
In addition to specific forms of poems, poetry is often thought of in terms of different [[genre]]s and subgenres. A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter, style, or other broader literary characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chandler, Daniel|title=Introduction to Genre Theory|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/intgenre/intgenre.html|publisher=Aberystwyth University|accessdate=10 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509013303/http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/intgenre/intgenre.html|archivedate=9 May 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators view genres as natural forms of literature. Others view the study of genres as the study of how different works relate and refer to other works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=16, 391–402|title=Beyond the screen: transformations of literary structures, interfaces and genres|editors=Schafer, Jorgen; Gendolla, Peter|isbn=978-3837612585|publisher=Verlag|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narrative poetry ===
[[File:Chaucer_Hoccleve.png|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]]]
{{Main article|Narrative poetry}}

Narrative poetry is a genre of poetry that tells a [[narrative|story]]. Broadly it subsumes [[epic poetry]], but the term "narrative poetry" is often reserved for smaller works, generally with more appeal to [[human interest]]. Narrative poetry may be the oldest type of poetry. Many scholars of [[Homer]] have concluded that his ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' were composed from compilations of shorter narrative poems that related individual episodes. Much narrative poetry—such as Scottish and English [[ballad]]s, and [[Balts|Baltic]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] heroic poems—is [[performance poetry]] with roots in a preliterate [[oral tradition]]. It has been speculated that some features that distinguish poetry from prose, such as meter, [[alliteration]] and [[kenning]]s, once served as [[memory]] aids for [[bard]]s who recited traditional tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=22–45|author=Kirk, GS|title=Homer and the Oral Tradition|isbn=978-0521136716|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable narrative poets have included [[Ovid]], [[Dante]], [[Juan Ruiz]], [[William Langland]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Fernando de Rojas]], [[Luís de Camões]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Robert Burns]], [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], and [[Anne Carson]].

=== Lyric poetry ===
[[File:Christine de Pisan - cathedra.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christine de Pizan]] ''(left)'']]
{{Main article|Lyric poetry}}

Lyric poetry is a genre that, unlike [[epic poetry|epic]] and dramatic poetry, does not attempt to tell a story but instead is of a more [[person]]al nature. Poems in this genre tend to be shorter, melodic, and contemplative. Rather than depicting [[Character (arts)|characters]] and actions, it portrays the poet's own [[feeling]]s, [[Qualia|states of mind]], and [[perception]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blasing|first=Mutlu Konuk|title=Lyric poetry : the pain and the pleasure of words|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691126821|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable poets in this genre include [[Christine de Pizan]], [[John Donne]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[Antonio Machado]], and [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]].

=== Epic poetry ===
[[File:Camões, por Fernão Gomes.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Luís de Camões|Camões]]]]
{{Main article|Epic poetry}}
Epic poetry is a genre of poetry, and a major form of [[narrative]] literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature to the culture of the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a [[heroic]] or [[mythological]] person or group of persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hainsworth|first=JB|title=Traditions of heroic and epic poetry|year=1989|publisher=Modern Humanities Research Association|isbn=978-0947623197|pages=171–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of epic poems are [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', [[Luís de Camões]]' ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'', the ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'', the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnama]]'', [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]] (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the ''[[Epic of King Gesar]]''. While the composition of epic poetry, and of [[long poem]]s generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. [[Derek Walcott]] won a [[Nobel prize]] to a great extent on the basis of his epic, ''[[Omeros]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1992/press.html|accessdate=10 December 2011|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1992: Derek Walcott|publisher=Swedish Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satirical poetry ===
[[File:Jacob Huysmans - Portrait of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|John Wilmot]]]]
Poetry can be a powerful vehicle for [[satire]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had a strong tradition of satirical poetry, often written for [[political]] purposes. A notable example is the Roman poet [[Juvenal]]'s [[Satires of Juvenal|satires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dominik|first=William J|title=Roman verse satire: Lucilius to Juvenal|year=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci|isbn=978-0865164420|pages=1–3|author2=Wehrle, T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same is true of the English satirical tradition. [[John Dryden]] (a [[Tory]]), the first [[Poet Laureate]], produced in 1682 ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'', subtitled "A Satire on the True Blue Protestant Poet, T.S." (a reference to [[Thomas Shadwell]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1056|editor=Black, Joseph|title=Broadview Anthology of British Literature|volume=1|isbn=978-1554810482|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another master of 17th-century English satirical poetry was [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Review of English Studies|volume=24|issue=93|title=Satirical Inversion of Some English Sources in Rochester's Poetry|author=Treglown, Jeremy|pages=42–48|doi=10.1093/res/xxiv.93.42|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satirical poets outside England include [[Poland]]'s [[Ignacy Krasicki]], [[Azerbaijan]]'s [[Mirza Alakbar Sabir|Sabir]] and [[Portugal]]'s [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]].

=== Elegy ===
[[File:Gray0004.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Thomas Gray]]]]
{{Main article|Elegy}}
An elegy is a mournful, melancholy or plaintive poem, especially a [[lament]] for the dead or a [[funeral]] song. The term "elegy," which originally denoted a type of poetic meter ([[elegiac]] meter), commonly describes a poem of [[mourning]]. An elegy may also reflect something that seems to the author to be strange or mysterious. The elegy, as a reflection on a death, on a sorrow more generally, or on something mysterious, may be classified as a form of lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pigman|first=GW|title=Grief and English Renaissance elegy|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521268714|pages=40–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=David|title=Elegy|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134209064|pages=10–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of elegiac poetry have included [[Propertius]], [[Jorge Manrique]], [[Jan Kochanowski]], [[Chidiock Tichborne]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Milton]], [[Thomas Gray]], [[Charlotte Turner Smith]], [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Evgeny Baratynsky]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and [[Virginia Woolf]].

=== Verse fable ===
[[File:Ignacy Krasicki 111.PNG|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Ignacy Krasicki|Krasicki]]]]
{{Main article|Fable}}
The fable is an ancient [[literary genre]], often (though not invariably) set in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. It is a succinct story that features [[anthropomorphized]] animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that illustrate a moral lesson (a "[[moral]]"). Verse fables have used a variety of [[meter (poetry)|meter]] and [[rhyme]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harpham|first=Geoffrey Galt; Abrams, MH|title=A glossary of literary terms|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495898023|page=9|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable verse fabulists have included [[Aesop]], [[Vishnu Sarma]], [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], [[Marie de France]], [[Robert Henryson]], [[Biernat of Lublin]], [[Jean de La Fontaine]], [[Ignacy Krasicki]], [[Félix María de Samaniego]], [[Tomás de Iriarte]], [[Ivan Krylov]] and [[Ambrose Bierce]].

=== Dramatic poetry ===
[[File:Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (Josef Stieler).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Goethe]]]]
{{Main article|Verse drama and dramatic verse|Theatre of ancient Greece|Sanskrit drama|Chinese Opera|Noh}}
Dramatic poetry is [[drama]] written in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, sometimes related forms in many cultures. [[Greek tragedy]] in verse dates to the 6th century B.C., and may have been an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith, Arthur Berriedale Keith|title=Sanskrit Drama in its origin, development, theory and practice|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1992|pages=57–58|isbn=978-8120809772}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the ''[[bianwen]]'' verse dramas in China, forerunners of [[Chinese Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dolby, William|title=Chinese Theater: From Its Origins to the Present Day|chapter=Early Chinese Plays and Theatre|editor=Mackerras, Colin|isbn=978-0824812201|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1983|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[East Asia]]n verse dramas also include Japanese [[Noh]]. Examples of dramatic poetry in [[Persian literature]] include [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s two famous dramatic works, ''[[Layla and Majnun]]'' and ''[[Khosrow and Shirin]]'', [[Ferdowsi]]'s tragedies such as ''[[Sohrab|Rostam and Sohrab]]'', [[Rumi]]'s ''[[Masnavi]]'', [[Asad Gorgani|Gorgani]]'s tragedy of ''[[Vis and Ramin]]'', and [[Vahshi Bafqi|Vahshi]]'s tragedy of ''[[Farhad]]''.

=== Speculative poetry ===
[[File:Edgar Poe 1848.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]]]
{{Main article|Speculative poetry}}
Speculative poetry, also known as fantastic poetry (of which weird or macabre poetry is a major sub-classification), is a poetic genre which deals thematically with subjects which are "beyond reality", whether via [[extrapolation]] as in [[science fiction]] or via weird and horrific themes as in [[horror fiction]]. Such poetry appears regularly in modern science fiction and horror fiction magazines. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] is sometimes seen as the "father of speculative poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Dutcher, Roger|title=The alchemy of stars|year=2005|publisher=Science Fiction Poetry Association|isbn=978-0809511624|pages=11–17|author=Allen, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poe's most remarkable achievement in the genre was his anticipation, by three-quarters of a century, of the [[Big Bang theory]] of the [[universe]]'s origin, in his then much-derided 1848 [[essay]] (which, due to its very speculative nature, he termed a "[[prose poem]]"), ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rombeck |first=Terry |date=January 22, 2005 |authorlink= |title=Poe's little-known science book reprinted |journal=Lawrence Journal-World &amp; News |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/jan/22/poes_littleknown_science/ |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilynne Robinson|Robinson, Marilynne]], "On Edgar Allan Poe", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 2 (5 February 2015), pp. 4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prose poetry ===
[[File:Étienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]]]
{{Main article|Prose poetry}}

Prose poetry is a hybrid genre that shows attributes of both prose and poetry. It may be indistinguishable from the [[microfiction|micro-story]] ([[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|a.k.a.]] the "[[short short story]]", "[[flash fiction]]"). While some examples of earlier prose strike modern readers as poetic, prose poetry is commonly regarded as having originated in 19th-century France, where its practitioners included [[Aloysius Bertrand]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monte|first=Steven|title=Invisible fences: prose poetry as a genre in French and American literature|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803232112|pages=4–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s especially, prose poetry has gained increasing popularity, with entire journals, such as ''The Prose Poem: An International Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.providence.edu/prosepoem/|title=''The Prose Poem: An International Journal''|accessdate=10 December 2011|publisher=Providence College}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contemporary Haibun Online'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contemporaryhaibunonline.com|title=''Contemporary Haibun Online''|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Haibun Today''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haibuntoday.com/pages/about.html|title=''Haibun Today''}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to that genre and its hybrids.  Latin American poets of the 20th century who wrote prose poems include [[Octavio Paz]] and [[Giannina Braschi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/octavio-paz|title= Poetry Foundation: Octavio Paz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Language Association Presents Giannina Braschi". Circumference Magazine: Poetry in Translation, Academy of American Poets. January 1, 2013. Considered one of the most revolutionary Latin American poets writing today, Giannina Braschi, author of the epic prose poem 'Empire of Dreams'.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light poetry ===
[[File:LewisCarrollSelfPhoto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lewis Carroll]]]]
{{Main article|Light poetry}}

Light poetry, or light verse, is poetry that attempts to be humorous.  Poems considered "light" are usually brief, and can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]], including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme and heavy [[alliteration]]. Although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition, light verse in English is usually formal.  Common forms include the [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], the [[clerihew]], and the [[double dactyl]].

While light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]], or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned "serious" poets have also excelled at light verse.  Notable writers of light poetry include [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Ogden Nash]], [[X. J. Kennedy]], [[Willard R. Espy]], and [[Wendy Cope]].

=== Slam poetry ===
{{Main article|Poetry slam}}

[[File:FivaMC.jpg|thumb|upright|Poet performing at a [[poetry slam]]]]

Slam poetry is a genre, developed since about 1984, in which performers comment emotively, aloud before an audience, on personal, social, or other matters. It focuses on the aesthetics of word play, intonation, and voice inflection. Slam poetry is often competitive, at dedicated "[[poetry slam]]" contests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.powerpoetry.org/actions/5-tips-spoken-word]&lt;/ref&gt;

S. Parsonson |accessdate=2016-09-19|quote=The natives of Yap in Micronesia went 300 miles to the Palau Islands for "stone money", great calcite disks, six to twelve feet in diameter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but briefly on [[Guam]] as well, and transported to Yap for use as money. They have been used in trade by the Yapese as a form of currency.

The monetary system of Yap relies on an oral history of ownership. Because these stones are too large to move, buying an item with one simply involves agreeing that the ownership has changed. As long as the transaction is recorded in the oral history, it will now be owned by the person to whom it is passed and no physical movement of the stone is required.

==Form and value==
Rai stones are circular disks with a hole in the middle. The stones vary widely in size. The largest are {{convert|3.6|m|cm ft in}} in diameter and {{convert|0.5|m|cm ft in}} thick and weigh {{convert|4|t|kg ST lb}}. The largest rai stone is located on [[Rumung]] island, near Riy village.&lt;ref name=wondermondo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Au/MicronesiaFS/Yap/RaiOfYap.htm |title=Rai of Yap – the stone money |publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller rai stones might have a diameter of from {{convert|7|to|8|cm}}.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The extrinsic (perceived) value of a specific stone is based on not only its size and craftsmanship, but also its history. If many people—or no one at all—died when the specific stone was transported, or a famous sailor brought it in, the value of the rai stone increases by reason of its anecdotal heft.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Rai stones were, and still are,&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goldstein |first1=Jacob |last2=Kestenbaum |first2=David |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/02/15/131934618/the-island-of-stone-money |title=The Island of Stone Money |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in rare important social transactions, such as marriage, [[inheritance]], political deals, sign of an alliance, [[ransom]] of the battle dead, or, rarely, in exchange for food. Many of them are placed in front of meetinghouses or along pathways. The physical location of the stone is often not significant. Although the ownership of a particular stone might change, the stone itself is rarely moved due to its weight and risk of damage. The names of previous owners are passed down to the new one. In one instance, a large rai being transported by canoe and outrigger was accidentally dropped and sank to the sea floor. Although it was never seen again, everyone agreed that the rai must still be there, so it continued to be transacted as genuine currency.&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt; What is important is that ownership of the rai is clear to everyone, not that the rai is physically transferred or even physically accessible to either party in the transfer.

==History==
Yapese quarried the limestone rocks from the islands of [[Palau]] and took them to Yap with [[canoe]]s and [[raft]]s. There is evidence that some limestone has been mined in Palau by Yapese as early as 500 AD, but more widespread mining started in the time period of 1000–1400 AD.&lt;ref name=wondermondo/&gt; Local legend holds that the Yapese discovered the rock of Palau about 500–600 years ago when an expedition led by a man called [[Anagumang]] landed on Palau.&lt;ref name=Pine&gt;{{Cite news |last=Pine |first=Art |title=Fixed Assets, or Why a Loan in Yap is Hard to Roll Over |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |page=A1 |date=29 March 1984}} reprinted in Mankiw, N. Gregory. ''Essentials of Economics, Third Edition.'' Mason: South-Western, 2004. pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt; Limestone was nonexistent in Yap and therefore very valuable to the Yapese. First Anagumang ordered his men to cut stone into the shape of fish but eventually a circular shape was chosen, probably because it was easier to transport. A pole was put through the hole in the center of the stone so that laborers could carry the stone. The largest of the disks probably needed hundreds of men to transport. Residents of Palau in turn required Yapese to pay in [[bead]]s, [[coconut]] meat and [[copra]] or in the form of services for the privilege of quarrying.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

It is unknown how long money stones have been used in Yap. Flat rocks have been found there that are up to 2000 years old, but the oldest do not resemble today's rai stones, and it is not known if they were used as money. It is nevertheless clear that the size of the stones grew sharply after European techniques and traders came to Yap. The stones may have evolved from smaller carved beads.&lt;ref name=Gillilland&gt;{{cite book |last=Gillilland |first=Cora Lee C. |title=The Stone Money of Yap: A Numismatic Survey (Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology 23) |year=1975 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington, DC |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10088/2422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the Irish-American [[David Dean O'Keefe]] was shipwrecked near Yap and was helped by the natives. Later, he assisted the Yapese in acquiring rai and in return received [[copra]] and [[Sea cucumber as food|trepang]], which were valuable exports in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Dennis M.|title=Tales of the Seven Seas: The Escapades of Captain Dynamite Johnny O'Brien|year=2010|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9781589794474|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keefe provided the Yapese with iron tools. As a result, a form of inflation set in and rai stones acquired with his help were less valuable than more ancient ones. The book ''His Majesty O'Keefe'' is the story of his life on Yap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klingman|first=Lawrence|title=His Majesty O'Keefe|year=1950|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=NY|last2=Green|first2=Gerald}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[His_Majesty_O%27Keefe|film of the same name]] starring Burt Lancaster was made in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045876/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ''His Majesty O'Keefe'' on IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade for rai stones eventually stopped at the beginning of the [[20th century]] due to trade disputes between Spanish and German interests in the area. Quarries were abandoned. When [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese]] forces took over Yap during [[World War II]], they used some of the stones for construction or as anchors.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Economist [[Milton Friedman]] has compared the monetary role of the stone money to the reserves of gold held in Fort Knox for foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Milton|title=The Island of Stone Money|journal=Working Papers in Economics|date=1991|volume=E-91-3|url=http://www.karlwhelan.com/IMB/Friedman-Yap.pdf|accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although modern currency has replaced the stones as everyday currency, the rai stones are still exchanged in traditional ways between the Yapese. They are a [[national symbol]] and are depicted on local [[Vehicle registration plates of the Federated States of Micronesia|license plate]]s.

Ron Hubbard Library, registered in [[Los Angeles County]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavote.net/CLERK/FBN_Search.cfm Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, as an example] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628174722/http://www.lavote.net/CLERK/FBN_Search.cfm |date=2007-06-28 }}, under "HUBBARD L RON LIBRARY"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.org/csi.htm Notice for Materials Copyrighted to Church of Scientology International]&lt;/ref&gt;

While exercising authority over the use of all Dianetics and Scientology materials, RTC claims that it is not involved in the day-to-day management of the Church of Scientology; that role is assigned to a separate corporation, the [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI).
According to the RTC website, "RTC stands apart as an external body which protects the Scientology religion and acts as the final arbiter of orthodoxy" and its stated purpose is "to protect the public from misapplication of the technology and to see that the religious technologies of Dianetics and Scientology remain in proper hands and are properly ministered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html Section of RTC Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430043739/http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html |date=2006-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986, [[David Miscavige]] has served as the organization's Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In a 1993 [[memorandum]] by the [[Church of Scientology International]], the following information was provided to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] with regards to RTC's role and functions, its personnel and its income:&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Summary Description RTC-CSI.pdf|Summary Description of Churches of Scientology - RTC, CSI, CSFSSO, CSFSO, Other Churches, Missions, Field Ministers, CSI Prod. 11-4-93, Bate Stamp: 151396 - 151398, Ex. 1-3, Washington, DC, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] RTC [...] owns the Scientology religious marks and advanced technology. It licenses the marks to CSI for sublicense to subordinate churches and directly licenses the advanced technology to appropriate churches. Through this structure RTC assures that practice of the Scientology religion within the ecclesiastical hierarchy under CSI's authority as Mother Church remains strictly orthodox, in accordance with the Scientology Scriptures. This church has a staff of approximately 50 individuals and an annual budget of approximately $ 6.6 million, based on its annual disbursements for the most recent year for which financial statements are available. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The RTC guarantees the “purity and workability of Scientology so far into the future,” thus engaging in programs to “restore, preserve, maintain and keep uncorrupted” the church’s "religious technology," according to Scientology spokesman Eric Roux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Scientology faces ban in Belgium | url = http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/scientology-faces-ban-in-belgium-amid-fraud-allegations/news-story/c8433d3f797edff382cfd35608e09d2b | work = AFP | publisher = news.com.au | date = December 12, 2015 | accessdate = March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roux |first1=Eric |title=Cult Wars in Historical Perspective: New and Minority Religions |chapter=Scientology |editor-last=Gallagher |editor-first=Eugene V. |publisher=Routledge |date=21 July 2016 |isbn=978-1472458124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate information==
[[File:Church of Scientology building in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.jpeg|thumb|Offices of the Religious Technology Center in Los Angeles]]
RTC was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] on January 1, 1982 in Los Angeles, California by Terri Gamboa, [[David Mayo (Scientology)|David Mayo]], Norman Starkey, Phoebe Mauerer, Lyman Spurlock, Julia Watson, and [[David Miscavige]].&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:RTC-Incorporation.djvu|Articles of Incorporation of Religious Technology Center, Endorsed Filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California, Los Angeles, California, January 1, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, on June 15, 1982, the [[Articles of Incorporation]] were restated.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:RTC-Restated-Incorporation.djvu|Restated Articles of Incorporation of Religious Technology Center, Bate Stamp: A 253931, Los Angeles, California, June 15th &amp; September 13th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, 1986 they were amended in order to clarify the [[disposition]] of RTC's [[assets]] upon the [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]] of the [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:RTC-Certificate-Amendment.djvu|Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation - Religious Technology Center, Los Angeles, California, April 8th, May 13th &amp; 14th, 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At present the official address of RTC is 1710 Ivar Avenue, Suite 1100, Los Angeles 90028, in the Hollywood Guaranty Building, while its main offices are on a big estate complex at 19625 Highway 79, Gilman Hot Springs 92383, California, as it was stated in a supporting document of Scientology's tax-exempt application to the IRS during the years 1992/1993.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Location-RTC.pdf|Response to Second Series of Questions, Church of Scientology International, Correspondence with Internal Revenue Service, Exhibit for Application for Tax-Exempt Status 501(c)(3), June 29th, 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 1993 the following individuals held [[corporate]] positions at RTC: The [[Board of Trustees]] was composed of [[David Miscavige]], Gregory Wilhere, and Norman F. Starkey. The members of RTC's [[Board of Directors]] were at that time [[Mark Rathbun]], Warren McShane, and [[David Miscavige]]. RTC's [[President (corporate title)|President]] was [[Mark Rathbun]], its [[Secretary]] Warren McShane, and its [[Treasurer]] Barbara Griffin.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:CoS-Trustees-Directors-Officers-1993.pdf|List of Trustees, Directors &amp; Officers (of Church of Scientology Entities) - Ex. I-2, CSI Prod 11-4-93, Bate Stamp: 151380 - 151395, Los Angeles, California, September 21st, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 5, 2001 RTC's corporate [[board of directors|officers]] were Warren McShane ([[Chief Executive Officer]]/[[President (corporate title)|President]]), Laurisse Stuckenbrock ([[Secretary]]), and Barbara Griffin ([[Chief Financial Officer]]/[[Treasurer]]).&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Domestic Nonprofit Corporation, Religious Technology Center, Secretary of State, State of California, Filed: Sacramento, California, February 9th, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 14, 2008, RTC's official [[Agent (law)|agent]] has been the attorney Sherman D. Lenske from the law firm Lenske, Lenske &amp; Abramson ALC, Warner Atrium, 6400 Canoga Avenue, Suite 315, Woodland Hills 91367-2491.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C1063697 Entry for Religious Technology Center, California Business Portal of the Secretary of the State of California/March 22, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180322/http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C1063697 |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 1993, RTC filed an application for [[tax exemption]] under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[:File:Application-501-RTC.pdf|Form 1023 - Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code - Religious Technology Center, Washington, DC, August 19th, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[Internal Revenue Service]] granted RTC's request for exemption.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The granting of tax exemption to RTC and other Scientology corporations was preceded by years of continuous litigation between the IRS and the various entities of Scientology. According to former high-ranking executives, the Scientology organization had launched about 200 [[lawsuits]] against the IRS until 1991. During the same time, individual [[parish]]ioners of Scientology had initiated 2,300 [[Claim (legal)|claims]] against the agency, challenging the denial of tax deduction for their services at Scientology organizations. Late 1991, the dispute over Scientology's tax-exempt status began to resolve through high-level meetings between [[David Miscavige]] and the then [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner of the IRS]], Fred Goldberg, who encouraged a final resolution of the legal battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/article1012148.ece Scientology: The Truth Rundown, Part 1 of 3 in a special report on the Church of Scientology, By Joe Childs &amp; Thomas C.

'''Main Corporate Activities'''

The Religious Technology Center (RTC) is the [[owner]] of certain [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]]. These marks and its related [[intellectual property]] form the "Dianetics spiritual healing technology" and the "Scientology applied religious technology".&lt;ref&gt;Copyright and trademark notice of the book "Dianetics" by L. Ron Hubbard, Los Angeles, California, (c) 1950, 2000, {{ISBN|0-88404-632-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology organizations, like "Churches," "Celebrity Centres" or "Missions," derive their income from the worldwide sales of this "technology" in form of courses, books, etc. to their members or to the general public. The organizations receive the right to sell the "technology" through license agreements with RTC as license holder and/or the [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI) as a sub-licensor. RTC and CSI in return derive their corporative income through the license fees, which in turn are obtained through those agreements. The licensing and its related actions are major corporate activities of the various Scientology-organizations.&lt;ref name="LicenseAgreement"&gt;[[:File:License-Agreement-RTC-CSI.pdf|"License Agreement - CSI (Marks)", License Agreement between Religious Technology Center and Church of Scientology International, California, May 18th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Licensing of Trademarks &amp; Service Marks'''

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] (CST)''

Shortly after its inception on January 1, 1982, RTC received on May 16, 1982 "the ownership, supervision and control" of the trademarks and service marks identifying "Scientology applied religious philosophy" and "Dianetics spiritual healing technology" by the originator and founder of Scientology, [[L. Ron Hubbard]] through an "[[Assignment (law)|Assignment]] [[Contract|Agreement]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Assignment-RTC.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, County of Los Angeles, California, May 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This agreement was subject to an additional "Option Agreement" between Hubbard, RTC and another Scientology corporation, the "[[Church of Spiritual Technology]]" (CST). In two "Option Agreements" from May 1982, Hubbard granted CST the right to purchase at any time from RTC the "Marks", the "Advanced Technology" and all the rights to them for the sum of $100.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST.pdf|"Option Agreement (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, County of Los Angeles, California, May 10th, 1982/July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST-AT.pdf|Option Agreement (Advanced Technology-U.S.) - Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, California, May 10th &amp; July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel and similar-sounding agreements between Hubbard, RTC and CST were created during that period concerning the "Advanced Technology," which consists of unpublished derivates of Scientology's confidential "Advanced technology".&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Assignment-Agreement-LRH-RTC-AT.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Advanced Technology - US)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, Los Angeles, California, May 10th &amp; 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under these agreements RTC is to turn over 90% of its net income to CST. A document from 1991, reflecting the "financial money flows" of RTC during the year 1989, showed a turnover of 59% of RTC's net income towards CST.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Analysis-Financial-Flows-RTC.pdf|"Religious Technology Center - Analysis of Financial Flows 1989", Exhibit I-9 for Application for Tax-Exempt Status 501(c)(3), Bate Stamp: CSI Prod 11-4-93 151414]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI)''

RTC and CSI entered a license agreement on May 18, 1982, granting CSI, the new "Mother Church of Scientology," the right to use and sub-license certain of the trademarks and service marks. In return for the grant of the marks, the agreement gave RTC practically an unlimited corporate control not only over the activities of CSI but also over every organization that is a sub-licensee of CSI.&lt;ref name="LicenseAgreement"/&gt;

In particular the agreement stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] d) RTC shall have the right to monitor all operations of CSI and its related organizations, inspect all books, records and facilities, pertaining to use of the Marks and receive sample specimens and summaries of literature, publications and products using the marks, [...] e) RTC may, if it ever deems it necessary or advisable, send a corrective mission to any organization authorized the Marks to correct any deviation from the standards, specifications or guidelines of this Agreement, [... ]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally RTC and CSI signed on January 1, 1982 an "Organizational Covenant" granting CSI the right to deliver the "Advanced Technology" to its staff members.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CSI-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between Church of Scientology International &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably Los Angeles, California, January 1st, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Scientology Western United States]] (CoSWUS)''

RTC and CoSWUS entered on May 23, 1985 an organizational covenant granting CoSWUS the right to sell and deliver the "Advanced Technology" to its public members while guaranteeing weekly payments of 6% of the monetary value of the "Advanced Technology"-services that are being delivered to the public from CoSWUS towards RTC.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CSWUS-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between the Church of Scientology Western United States &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably: Los Angeles, California, May 23rd, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc.]] (FSO)''

On January 1, 1982 RTC and FSO signed an organizational covenant with similar content to the covenant between RTC and CoSWUS.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CSFSO-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably Clearwater, Florida, January 1st, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and other Scientology organizations''

RTC has entered over the years similar organizational covenants/license agreements with all the other "Advanced Organizations" (AOs) within the Scientology network. As all the AO's are integrated within a corporation, these agreements are formulated between RTC and these corporations, such as "Church of Scientology Flag Ship Service Organization, Inc." from Netherlands Antilles,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:License-Agreement-RTC-FSSO.pdf|License Agreement - RTC/Licensee - License Agreement between Religious Technology Center and Church of Scientology Flag Ship Service Organization, Netherlands Antilles, June 2nd, 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt; the "Church of Scientology Religious Education College, Inc." from East Grinstead, England,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CoSRECI-AT.pdf|Advanced Technology Covenant RTC/RECI, Covenant between Religious Technology Center &amp; Church of Scientology Religious Education College, Inc., East Grinstead, England, November 18th, &amp; December 1st, 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt; the "Church of Scientology, Inc." from Sydney, Australia&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CoSInc-AT.pdf|Advanced Technology Covenant RTC/Church of Scientology (Australia), Covenant between Religious Technology Center &amp; Church of Scientology Inc., Sydney, Australia, December 24th, 1988 &amp; March 16th, 1989]]&lt;/ref&gt; and with "Church of Scientology Advanced Organization Saint Hill Europe &amp; Africa" (AOSH EU).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-AOSHEU-AT.pdf|Example Covenant: "Advanced Technology Covenant - RTC/AOSH", Covenant between the Church of Scientology Advanced Organization Saint Hill Europe &amp; Africa &amp; Religious Technology Center, Copenhagen, Denmark, December 1st, 1988, November 25th &amp; December 14th, 1989]]&lt;/ref&gt;

RTC has registered its service marks and trademarks in various countries all over the world. Due to certain legal restrictions for religious corporations in certain countries, RTC founded the corporation "Inspector General Network, Inc." (IGN) on June 7, 1985, which functions as a "secular" representative for RTC in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Amendement-Incorporation-IGN.pdf|Notarized Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation, Inspector General Network, Endorsed Filed in the Office of the Secretary of State in the State of California, CSI Prod - November 22, 1993 - Bate Stamp: 237255, Los Angeles, California, June 7th, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 RTC entered with IGN a so-called "Reversion and Reservation Agreement", which regulated the rights and obligations with regards to the Scientology and Dianetics trademarks of the "secular" organizations IGN and "World Institute of Scientology Enterprises, Inc." (WISE Inc.), a dormant Delaware corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Reversion-Agreement-RTC-WISE.pdf|Reversion and Reservation Agreement between Religious Technology Center and Inspector General Network, a California non-profit public benefit corporation, Los Angeles, California, June 17th, &amp; 18th, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Control of Other Corporations'''

At the time of RTC's filing for [[tax exemption]], RTC controlled four other corporations:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

* ''"Inspector General Network" (IGN)''

IGN has served as [[legal]] [[agent (law)|representative]] for RTC and [[secular]] [[registered owner]] of RTC's [[trademarks|trade]] and [[service marks]] "in countries where contracts by religious corporations are not enforced". All [[corporate]] positions of IGN were held by members of RTC.

* ''"WISE, Inc."''

At the time of [[Scientology|Scientology's]] application for [[tax exemption]], WISE, Inc. has been a dormant [[corporation]] from [[Delaware]]. It had the same functions as IGN, prior to IGN's [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] in 1985.

* ''"RTC Australia"''

RTC Australia was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1986 as a regional office for RTC in Australia. It is a dormant [[corporation]] and has obtained [[tax exempt]] status.

* ''"Inspector General Network International AB" (IGN Int)''

IGN was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1992 in Sweden. The organization was founded to [[Registered trademark symbol|register]] [[Scientology|Scientology's]] [[trademarks|trade]] and [[service marks]] as a [[nominee]] for RTC in [[countries]], such as [[Libya]] or [[Iran]] "that do not recognize and will not do business with any United States entity".

==Organizational structure and management==
RTC stands hierarchically at the top of the [[Church of Scientology]] network. It has regulatory, corporate and [[ecclesiastical]] power over the policy and activities of all other Scientology management units, corporations, churches, missions and other organizations - with the only exception being the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]]. The position of RTC is notably visible in a drawing titled "The Command Channels of Scientology", which the [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI) and RTC provided to the IRS in their application for tax-exempt status. It should be noted that the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] has not been included in this application.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Image:Command Channels CoS.jpg|The Command Channels of Scientology, Sketch depicting the hierarchical structure of the network of the Church of Scientology, the drawing was provided by CSI to the IRS in their application for tax-exempt status in September 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its application for tax exemption, RTC described the internal structure of the organization as follows:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] RTC's daily activities are carried out by a staff of 54 highly-trained individuals who function in their positions within the overall ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Scientology religion. Through receipt of reports and direct inspections, RTC ensures that those utilizing the marks are ministering orthodox Scientology religious services. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] The senior ecclesiastical position in RTC is held by David Miscavige, who continues to serve as Chairman of the Board RTC and also as Inspector General. There are also several Deputy Inspector Generals who assist in the performance of RTC's
religious functions. There is a Deputy Inspector General who functions as Chairman of the Board RTC's second in command and
sees to the day to day functioning of the organization. There is a Deputy Inspector General who oversees internal matters in RTC
and another who is in charge of RTC's religious programs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The religious mission of RTC, protecting the orthodoxy of the technologies of Dianetics and Scientology, is carried out by two ecclesiastical divisions within RTC as described below. There is now one Inspectorate division which consists of four departments. The Department of Data receives reports and collects information from other organizations and Scientologists and collates, analyzes and distributes the information to all other departments that require it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Department of Trademark Registration, Maintenance and Enforcement gets the religious marks of Dianetics and Scientology legally registered and sees to it that all users of the marks are properly licensed. It also investigates and, where necessary, prosecutes legal infringements of the marks."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Department of Technical Policing inspects application of the Scientology Scriptures pertaining to the ministry of religious services by licensees and corrects misapplication where it is found."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Department of Organization Policing inspects the application of Scientology Scriptures as it pertains to governance of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and corrects misapplication where it is found."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Authorization, Verification and Correction International ('AVC INT') is a division within RTC which is responsible for authorizing and verifying that the ecclesiastical programs, evaluations, strategies, promotional materials and issues as authored by CSI are in accordance with Scripture. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As previously mentioned, RTC is currently led by the "[[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] (of [[Board of directors|Directors]])" [[David Miscavige]], who has held this position since 1987. Miscavige has been in leading positions within the Scientology management since the early 1980s. Prior to being in his current position, Miscavige had been a member of the [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]] and had been instrumental in the internal purge of the [[Guardian's Office]], the former [[intelligence service]] and legal defense unit of the Scientology network. In 1982 he became the [[Chief Executive Officer]] and later the [[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] of the [[for-profit corporation]] [[Author Services Inc.]] (ASI). Miscavige stayed on this position until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/scientology/Scien56.html The Man behind Scientology by Thomas C. Tobin, St. Petersburg Times, October 25, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

About the role and the position of the RTC within the structure of the Scientology network, David Miscavige declared in 1994:&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Declaration David Miscavige 1994.pdf|Declaration of David Miscavige, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Riverside County, February 8th, 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] Since March of 1987, I have been Chairman of the Board of Religious Technology Center [...]. RTC is not part of Church management, nor is it involved in the daily affairs of various Church of Scientology organizations or missions. RTC ensures that the trademarks of Dianetics and Scientology, and the technology they represent, are properly used around the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] 8 . RTC was formed with the specific purpose of seeing that the religion of Scientology was kept pure and true to the source materials of the religion. In fact, a major reason for its formation was to have such a Church organization that performed these functions in a capacity entirely separate from the actual management of the various Churches and Missions of Scientology. Not only is RTC not involved in the management of the international hierarchy of Scientology churches, but its very existence and performance of its true functions depends on the fact that it is not part of Church management. The authority of the Religious Technology Center stems from the ownership of the trademarks of Dianetics and Scientology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] 11. Neither RTC nor I has any corporate authority over any Scientology church, including CSI. CSI is the Mother Church of the Scientology religion and has been since its inception in 1981. As such, CSI is responsible for the activities commensurate with such a role, including the ecclesiastical management of Churches, dissemination and propagation of the faith and defense of its activities, including external and legal affairs. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such representations stand in stark contrast to declarations of high-level ex-scientologists, who have worked in the Scientology management. Former CSI security officer Andre Tabayoyon and former RTC second-in-command Jesse Prince have stated in [[affidavit]]s and declarations that RTC and its chairman [[David Miscavige]] maintain de facto control of the entire Scientology network, including the [[Church of Scientology International]].&lt;ref name="prince"&gt;[http://lisatrust.bogie.nl/Media/video/legal/prince_erlich.pdf Affidavit of Jesse Prince] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041101175401/http://lisatrust.bogie.nl/Media/video/legal/prince_erlich.pdf |date=2004-11-01 }} United States District Court, Central District of California, San Jose Division case no. C-95-20091 RMW (EAI)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within that context, André Tabayoyon stated in a 1994 declaration the following about Miscavige's exertion of power as [[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] and ultimate [[head]] of the global [[Scientology]] network:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_at.html Declaration of Andre Tabayoyon from April 4, 1994, Church of Scientology International, Case No. CV 91 6426 HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224143/http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_at.html |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] 59. I have personal knowledge that Miscavige issues oral and written orders and instructions to Scientologists irrespective of either ecclesiastical lines of authority or corporate lines of is authority or demarcation. Miscavige uses this omnipotent authority to exercise personal control over any and all Scientology organizations whenever he elects to do so. I observed that in running the various Scientology organizations, Miscavige constantly crosses all corporate and ecclesiastical command lines without regard to the fact that there are numerous Scientology related corporations of which he is neither an employee, officer nor director. He does not have to be to control any Scientology organization. He is above all Scientology organizations as the ecclesiastical head of Scientology, COB RTC and Commander of the Sea Org. In this capacity, Miscavige acts as the managing agent of each Scientology organization."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] 61. I personally observed Miscavige take over this position of ultimate power over all of Scientology after Hubbard died. I observed Miscavige when he was COB RTC ordering into Golden Era Studios ("Gold"), a CSI division, and ordering into the Commodore's Messenger Organization International ("CMO Int"), another CSI division planetary dissemination organization, etc. Both of these Sea Org units are corporately part of CSI. RTC, CMO Int and Gold are all located at a large compound outside of Hemet, California. It is called Gold. As I learned, the Scientology corporate structure was only for the benefit of the outside "wog" world. It didn't have any bearing on how Scientology operated."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"62. When Hubbard was alive it was common knowledge and I also observed it personally that he was in direct control, via Miscavige and [[Pat Broeker]], of CMO Int and Gold, and the rest of Scientology. After Hubbard died[,] Miscavige ousted Pat Broeker and Vicki Aznaran, who were then in control of Scientology. After that, it was my experience that Miscavige had complete control over Scientology just as Hubbard had when he was alive. Miscavige took over Hubbard's place as managing agent of all Scientology organizations. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mark Rathbun|Mark ("Marty") Rathbun]], [[David Miscavige]] and [[Warren McShane]], Deputy Inspector General for Legal Affairs formed for several years the above-mentioned "Board of Directors RTC".&lt;ref name="rtc.org"&gt;Religious Technology Center, Board of Directors, (c) 1999–2001 Religious Technology Center, http://www.rtc.org/board/&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2008, all references to both Rathbun and McShane have disappeared from the RTC website, and their names or pictures have also been removed from other official Scientology websites. Though Miscavige is still listed as Chairman of the Board, no other board members are acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtc.org/david-miscavige.html David Miscavige - Official website of Religious Technology Center, (c) 1996–2008 Religious Technology Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the executive branch of RTC existed at least until 2001 the position of "Inspector General RTC," which had been held by Mark Rathbun. This network spanned from RTC headquarters in Gilman Hot Springs to all of the "Advanced Organizations" in Los Angeles, Clearwater, East Grinstead, Copenhagen and Sidney, where RTC has maintained offices.&lt;ref name="rtc.org"/&gt;

In an internal newsletter, "Keeping Scientology Working," RTC stated the following about the purpose and duties of the "Inspector General Network":&lt;ref&gt;"Keeping Scientology Working", Caption of photo depicting the staff of the RTC IG Network, page 4, (c) 1995 Church of Scientology International&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"These Deputy Inspector Generals head the entire IG Network, which locates and handles internal and external infiltration and suppression, legally protects and safeguards the trademarks and technology of the religion of Scientology, and sees that management, orgs and missions and their application of tech and policy remain standard and true to LRH's writings."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While RTC has a dominant role over the "mother church," CSI and its subordinate organizations, the relationship to the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] (CST) is unclear. While the above-mentioned "assignment agreement" with L. Ron Hubbard on May 10, 1982 granted CST corporative authority over RTC with respect to Scientology's trademarks and service marks, there is no sign that CST ever executed any internal, "ecclesiastical" authority over RTC. In fact, the U.S. Claims Court noted in its opinion in a tax case, which involved CST in 1992:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/blog/suleiman2/cst_vs_irs_1992.html Opinion, Church of Spiritual Technology vs. United States, No. 581-88T, United Claims Court, June 29, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"CST claims that it does not and will not monitor RTC's use of the religious marks and technology. CST explains that there is no need to do so because any unorthodox use would be immediately obvious. Regardless of how it arrived at the conclusion, however, the point is that one of its obligations is to prevent misuse of the marks and technology. CST's present confidence in RTC has no significance. If CST ignored that element of its charter, one of the assumptions built into LRH's gift would be missing. Monitoring for a misuse by RTC is a form of ongoing oversight. The decision to exercise the option is an ecclesiastical one which would not be readily susceptible to judicial review."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Litigation==

Since its inception in 1982, RTC has been involved in various [[lawsuit]]s in both [[State court (United States)|state]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. The majority of the cases initiated by RTC contend unauthorized use of Scientology's [[copyright]]s, [[service mark]]s, or [[trademark]]s. Critics of Scientology contend that a great number of these lawsuits have been launched in order "to silence critics."&lt;ref&gt;Church in Cyberspace, Marc Fisher, Washington Post, August 19, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The courts have agreed in some cases; in ''RTC v. Lerma'' Judge Leonie Brinkema found that the RTC's lawsuit was intended to pursue the "broader motivation" of "the stifling of criticism and dissent of the religious practices of Scientology and the destruction of its opponents."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/specials/scientology/SCIENTOLOGY_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The RTC filed a lawsuit on January 1, 1985 in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] against Robin Scott and the Church of New Civilization (not to be confused with the [[New Civilization Church]]), a Scientology splinter group, alleging [[theft]] and unauthorized use of confidential material owned by RTC. The case took over a decade to resolve, and was dismissed on April 11, 1996 by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. In its final [[legal opinion|opinion]] the court summarized the history of the case and commented on the conduct of RTC while the case was litigated:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Religious Technology Center v. Scott|Unpublished Opinion from April 11, 1996, Religious Technology Center et al. vs. Robin Scott et al., 82 F.3d 423, 1996 WL 171443, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] In January 1985 RTC sued Mayo and other persons connected with the Church of the New Civilization, a splinter group of the official Church of Scientology, contending that they were making unauthorized use of stolen documents relating to the religion of Scientology. RTC stated that it was "the protector" of the religion of Scientology, its philosophy and its technology "including the Advanced Technology" consisting of "confidential and proprietary information regarding counseling and training," and was the owner of various trademarks registered with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] protecting the Advanced Technology. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] After 1,825 docket entries and nine years of pretrial litigation involving three [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] [[United States magistrate judge|magistrates]], a special master, the [[recusal]] of two district court judges, the denial of five petitions for writ of [[mandamus]], three appeals [...] and three denials of [[certiorari]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the third district judge [...] entered Final Judgment."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] [T]here is little doubt that RTC is playing "fast and loose" with the judicial system as required in the minority view of [[estoppel]]. To first assert that its unfair competition and false designation of origin claims are [[Justiciability|justiciable]] and at the same time assert that Mayo's identical claims are not is at best questionable; in light of RTC's documented history of [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious behavior]], RTC's actions are indefensible. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Knowledge reports==
The RTC maintains a task force called the Inspector General Network, an investigatory body which operates from seven offices on four different continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430043739/http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html |archivedate=2006-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IGN's stated function is to "keep Scientology working by ensuring the pure and ethical use of Dianetics and Scientology technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtc.org/en_US/matters/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022163614/http://www.rtc.org/en_US/matters/index.html |archivedate=2006-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTC, like the Church of Scientology, encourages the use of "Knowledge Reports" (KR) from anyone inside or outside of the Church, to report on potential misuse of the [[Standard Tech]] and copyrighted/trademarked materials. They maintain an online form in which anyone is encouraged to report any such matters that may be of concern.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rtc.org/reports/form/index.html?locale=en&lt;/ref&gt; The use of reports is one system used by RTC to police the use of Scientology materials and the application.

'''The Roux Scholarship''' is a cooking competition for up and coming chefs in the UK. Set up by the brothers [[Michel Roux|Michel]] and [[Albert Roux]], and now run by their sons [[Alain Roux]] and [[Michel Roux Jr.|Michel Roux Jr]]. It was first run in 1984 with [[Andrew Fairlie (chef)|Andrew Fairlie]] being named the first winner. It has since been run on a yearly basis, with winners going on to win a three-month placement in a [[Michelin star]]red restaurants including the [[French Laundry]] and [[Maison Pic]].

==History==
[[Michel Roux]] credits Nick Rowe with originating the idea for the Roux Scholarship. Rowe was dining at Roux's [[Waterside Inn]] when he suggested to Roux that the Roux brothers could front a scholarship for up and coming chefs and that Rowe's credit card company would be willing to back it financially. Michel spoke to his brother [[Albert Roux|Albert]] the following day, who said that Michel could lead on it. Michel thought it would be a good way for young chefs to gain experience in French restaurants, which were not open to employing British chefs at the time.&lt;ref name=tvchoice&gt;{{cite news|title=Michel Roux: The Roux Scholarship|url=http://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/michel-roux-roux-scholarship|accessdate=3 September 2012|newspaper=TV Choice|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was formerly known as the Roux Diners Club Scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Colmer wins Roux Diners Club Scholarship|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/30/01/2008/26826/chris-colmer-wins-roux-diners-club-scholarship.htm|accessdate=3 September 2012|newspaper=Caterer and Hotelkeeper|date=30 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each entrant must enter a paper application, which are then reviewed and broken down into regional competitions. Each regional winner goes through to the final, where there is one Scholar named.&lt;ref name=uktvgoodfood/&gt;&lt;ref name=adamsmith&gt;{{cite news|last=Kühn|first=Kerstin|title=Adam Smith named 2012 Roux Scholar|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/22/06/2012/343465/Adam-Smith-named-2012-Roux-Scholar.htm|accessdate=3 September 2012|newspaper=Caterer and Hotelkeeper|date=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrants are limited to chefs who are working in full-time employment.&lt;ref name=oneweek2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Kühn|first=Kerstin|title=One week left to enter the 2012 Roux Scholarship|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/23/01/2012/341988/One-week-left-to-enter-the-2012-Roux-Scholarship.htm|accessdate=3 September 2012|newspaper=Caterer and Hotelkeeper|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chefs are not limited to applying on one occasion; both [[Simon Hulstone]] and [[Mark Birchall]] competed on four occasions before winning.&lt;ref name=adamsmith/&gt; The winner of the competition is allowed to choose a three [[Michelin star]]red restaurant to cook in for three months.&lt;ref name="uktvgoodfood"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Roux Scholarship|url = http://goodfood.uktv.co.uk/the-roux-masterclass/video/angela-hartnett-cooks-stone-bass-and-squid/|publisher = Good Food|accessdate = 3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honorary President of Judges for the 2018 competition was [[Michel Guérard]].  

The winner of the 2018 competition was Martin Carabott, who had previously competed in the national final twice and works for [http://www.hide.co.uk/ollie Ollie Dabbous] at Hide in London.

'''Shopkins''' are a range of tiny, collectable toys, manufactured  by [[Moose Toys]]. Based on [[grocery store]] items, each plastic figure has a recognisable face and unique name. They also have special finishes like translucent, glitter, or squishy. The collectable toys (which are designated as common, rare, ultra rare, special edition, limited edition, and exclusive) also have lines of clothing, trading cards, and other merchandise.  

The toy line began in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shopkins™ Is The Biggest Tiny Toy Crossing Retail Registers, With Season Two Characters To Continue Sales Momentum |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shopkins-is-the-biggest-tiny-toy-crossing-retail-registers-with-season-two-characters-to-continue-sales-momentum-300000580.html |website=PR Newswire |accessdate=23 June 2018 |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toynews-online.biz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toynews-online.biz/news/read/2015-to-be-a-strong-year-for-shopkins/043431|title=2015 to be a strong year for Shopkins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the fall of 2018, there are ten seasons of the toys.

==History==
Shopkins was designed and developed by [[Moose Toys]] in [[Melbourne]]. Co-chief Paul Solomon credits his mother Jacqui Tobias, director of girls’ products, for the idea of Shopkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/shopkins-inventor-among-toy-nominees|title=Shopkins Inventor Among Toy Nominees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moose Toys had success with their line of [[Trash Pack]] and [[Grossery Gang]] collectible figurines which were geared towards boys, but overall lacked a market for girls. Shopkins was produced initially as a similar product for girls — however, it appeals to both genders.&lt;ref name="racked.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nechamkin |first=Sarah |url=http://www.racked.com/2015/9/22/9365361/shopkins-tiny-toy-for-girls-consumerism-pink |title=How Shopkins Became the Biggest Tiny Toy on the Planet |publisher=Racked |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cam Lindsay |url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2015/08/27/shopkins-the-latest-toy-craze-to-captivate-canadian-kids.html |title=Shopkins the latest toy craze to captivate Canadian kids &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2015-08-27 |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shopkins movies===
An animated film called ''Shopkins: Chef Club'' was released on DVD 25 October 2016 by [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]] to promote the sixth season of Shopkins toys. The movie had mostly positive reviews, although some reviewers had concerns at the overt consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shopkins Chef Club Movie Reviews|author=Jill Thompson|url=http://spkfans.com/shopkins-chef-club-movie-reviews|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two sequels, Shopkins World Vacation and Shopkins Wild, were released on October 11, 2017 and April 17, 2018.


====Web series====
{{main article|List of Shopkins episodes}}
In August 2014, Moose Toys built brand awareness with their Shopkins short cartoon videos on their YouTube channel Shopkins world,&lt;ref name="racked.com"/&gt; but it was the YouTube videos of consumers unwrapping and playing with the toy that helped bring the line to mainstream prominence.&lt;ref name="moosetoys"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shopkins-is-the-biggest-tiny-toy-crossing-retail-registers-with-season-two-characters-to-continue-sales-momentum-300000580.html|title = Shopkins™ Is The Biggest Tiny Toy Crossing Retail Registers, With Season Two... -- LOS ANGELES, Nov. 24, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --|author = Moose Toys|date = 24 November 2014|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/business/article50009520.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223235942/http://www.kentucky.com/news/business/article50009520.html |archivedate=23 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shopkins Direct ===
As of May 2017, [http://www.culturefly.com CultureFly LLC]., a licensee of Shopkins/Moose Toys, began offering a subscription box with exclusive Shopkins accessories and merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/CultureFly+Announces+Shopkins+Direct/12871903.html|title=CultureFly Announces Shopkins Direct|work=StreetInsider.com|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.shopkinsdirect.com/ Shopkins Direct] is described as a quarterly/seasonal subscription service, featuring accessories, apparel, and other exclusive merchandise featuring Shopkins characters. Additionally, exclusive Shopkins have been distributed via Shopkin pop-up chain stores located in North America. Such contents include but are not limited to: plushies, lip balm, and limited-edition Shopkins.

In March 2018, the box was discontinued.

==Counterfeit Shopkins==
[[File:Shopkins Funny Sweet.jpg|thumbnail|Counterfeit Shopkins in packaging with "Funny Sweet" categories.]]
[[Counterfeit consumer goods|Counterfeit]] Shopkins began to surface around mid-2015, including those with "Funny Sweet" or "Shopkinsins" on the packaging, which can refer to Shopkins in colours which Moose Toys never officially produced, such as ''Boo Hoo Onion'' being in light blue and ''Chee Zee'' in orange. The arms and other parts might be broken, and the paint chips off easily. &lt;ref name="moosefake"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRd4w_OQ8EE|title=The Official guide to spotting counterfeit Shopkins - YouTube|author=Moose Toys|date=12 August 2015|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of sellers on websites offer counterfeit Shopkins, which can include item pictures which have the "Shopkins" branding, most likely as a way to avoid the listing being taken away under [[intellectual property]] policies of the website and/or store.

===Cases===
Two factories in [[Yiwu]] producing counterfeit Shopkins toys were raided by local police in [[China]] in mid-2015,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/police-raid-chinese-toy-factory-moose-enterprise-and-local-police-seize-over-150000-counterfeit-shopkins-toys-in-china-300121778.html "Police Raid Chinese Toy Factory: Moose Enterprise and Local Police Seize Over 150,000 Counterfeit Shopkins Toys in China,"] PR Newswire, 31 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and Moose Toys stated they will take legal action against anyone selling counterfeit Shopkins,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theabcshow.myindustrytracker.com/en/article/75292/anb-media-news-august-25?referer=read-next "Moose Continues to Defend Against Counterfeit Shopkins,"] ''aNB Media News'', August 25, 2015, Retrieved 16 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; which included a chain of Thriftway businesses selling counterfeit Shopkins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020150813B45/MOOSE%20TOYS%20PTY%20LTD%20v.%20THRIFTWAY%20HYLAN%20BLVD.%20DRUG%20CORP.

[[File:Spectra above chimney tops.png|thumb|upright|''spectra [london]'', 2014. The beam could be seen for miles above the rooftops and chimneys of London.]]
'''''Spectra''''' is the name of a series of art [[installation art|installations]] by [[Ryoji Ikeda]] which use intense white light as a sculptural material.&lt;ref name=RI/&gt; The most recent presentation of ''spectra'' was in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia for four days ending 24 June, 2018 to mark the winter solstice, and as an installation piece at the [[MONA_FOMA|Dark Mofo]] festival held by [[Museum_of_Old_and_New_Art|MONA]]. ''spectra [Amsterdam]'' was the first presentation of the work in 2008 its current form; an array of xenon lamps pointed skywards lit from dusk till dawn accompanied by a mathematically derived score audible from each of the lamp bases. The work was first commissioned and produced by Forma Arts.

==History==
Ryoji Ikeda has produced ''spectra'' installations in a number of locations, all in several different configurations. The first was a tunnel of light and sound at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] at Eero Saarinen's abandoned TWA Terminal in New York in 2004.&lt;ref name=RI/&gt;  Four site-specific light and sound installations were created across [[Amsterdam]] in 2008 for the city's ''Dream Amsterdam'' event.&lt;ref name=RI/&gt;  A more concentrated 64-beam installation was then created in Paris that year for their annual ''[[Nuit Blanche]]'' festival.&lt;ref name=RI/&gt;  Other cities which have hosted the installation include [[Buenos Aires]], [[Hobart]],&lt;ref name="HobartABC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/arts/stories/s3782288.htm |title=Artists cover Hobart in white light for the opening of Dark Mofo - News - ABC Arts &amp;#124; Australian contemporary art and culture reviews, news &amp; videos |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nagoya]].&lt;ref name=RI&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ryojiikeda.com/project/spectra/ |title=spectra | year=2010 |author=Ryoji Ikeda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''spectra [tasmania]'', 2013 &amp; 2018==
[[File:Spectra &amp; Full Moon from Mt Wellington (9111132653).jpg|thumbnail|''spectra [tasmania]'' pierces the [[Hobart]] Skyline, 22 June 2013.]]
''spectra [tasmania]'' was an installation of 49 Xenon searchlights. It was placed in front of [[Hobart Cenotaph|Hobart's Cenotaph]] on the western shore of that city's central business district. Installed and active from sunset to sunrise 14 - 23 June 2013 as part of The Red Queen, a group exhibition for 1st Dark Mofo Festival. It was estimated to reach 5-15km into the sky, depending on the weather.&lt;ref name="HobartABC"/&gt; In 2018 it was displayed from the grounds of MONA (Museum of Old and New Art) with the addition of Ikeda's accompanying soundscape, where it was confirmed that plans were in place to house ''spectra'' at the museum permanently.

==''spectra [london]'', 2014==
[[File:Spectra London.jpg|thumb|Spectra London, Victoria Tower Gardens]]
The London installation consisted similarly of 49 Xenon searchlights shining together into the sky, accompanied by a [[soundscape]]. This presentation of ''Spectra'' was produced and presented by [[Artangel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artangel.org.uk/projects/2014/spectra/about_the_project/spectra |title=Ryoji Ikeda: spectra |publisher=Artangel |date=2014-08-11 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-commissioned by [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]] and the [[14-18 NOW]] programme of the [[Imperial War Museum]] for the [[First World War centenary|centenary of World War One]].&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;&lt;ref name=G/&gt; and funded by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. It was switched on at the end of the Lights Out event on 4 August 2014, when the lights of many buildings in the UK were turned off in recollection of [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]]'s famous prophecy that, "[[The lamps are going out|The lamps are going out all over Europe;]] we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28655977 |title=WW1 centenary: Column of light illuminates London commemoration |publisher=BBC News |date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation was turned off for good at dawn on 11 August 2014, as the presentation was only planned to last for one week.&lt;ref name=DT&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/11013386/ArtAngel-spectra-Londons-centenary-beam-of-light.html |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |title=ArtAngel spectra: London's centenary beam of light |author=Richard Dorment |date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spotlights used were [[xenon arc lamp]]s requiring 4 kilowatts of power each.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;  The array and the sound system was powered by four [[diesel generator]]s fuelled by [[biodiesel|vegetable oil]].&lt;ref name=G/&gt;  A crew of thirty technicians assembled, tested and maintained the installation.&lt;ref name=G&gt;{{citation |title=Spectra: the dazzling column of light over London |author=Sean O'Hagan |newspaper=The Guardian |date=5 August 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/05/ryoji-ikeda-spectra-first-world-war-artangel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The soundscape was inspired by mathematical concepts and consisted of pure [[sine wave]]s.&lt;ref name=1418N&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.1418now.org.uk/lights-out/artist/ryoji-ikeda/ |title=Spectra Ryoji Ikeda|work=Lights Out |publisher=[[14-18 NOW]] |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Textile arts''' are [[art]]s and [[craft]]s that use [[fiber crop|plant]], [[animal fiber|animal]], or [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] [[fiber]]s to construct practical or decorative objects.

[[Textile]]s have been a fundamental part of human life since the beginning of [[civilization]].&lt;ref name="GW"&gt;Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance: ''World Textiles'', p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;Barber, Elizabeth Wayland: ''Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years'', p. 42-70&lt;/ref&gt; The methods and materials used to make them have expanded enormously, while the functions of textiles have remained the same. The history of textile arts is also the history of [[international trade]].  [[Tyrian purple]] [[dye]] was an important trade good in the ancient [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Silk Road]] brought [[China|Chinese]] silk to [[India]], [[Africa]], and [[Europe]]. Tastes for imported luxury [[fabric]]s led to [[sumptuary law]]s during the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].  The [[Industrial Revolution]] was shaped largely by innovation in textiles technology: the [[cotton gin]], the [[spinning jenny]], and the [[power loom]] mechanized production and led to the [[Luddite]] rebellion.

==Concepts==
The word ''textile'' is from [[Latin]] ''texere'' which means "to weave", "to braid" or "to construct".&lt;ref name="GW" /&gt; The simplest textile art is [[felt]]ing, in which animal fibers are matted together using heat and moisture.  Most textile arts begin with  twisting or [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[plying]] fibers to make [[yarn]] (called ''thread'' when it is very fine and ''[[rope]]'' when it is very heavy). The yarn is then [[macrame|knotted]], [[Loop (knot)|looped]], [[braid]]ed, or [[weaving|woven]] to make flexible ''fabric'' or ''cloth'', and cloth can be used to make [[clothing]] and soft furnishings.  All of these items &amp;ndash; felt, yarn, fabric, and finished objects &amp;ndash; are collectively referred to as ''textiles''.&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles''&lt;/ref&gt;

The textile arts also include those techniques which are used to embellish or decorate textiles &amp;ndash; [[dyeing]] and [[textile printing|printing]] to add [[color]] and pattern; [[embroidery]] and other types of [[needlework]]; [[tablet weaving]]; and [[lace]]-making.  Construction methods such as [[sewing]], [[knitting]], [[crochet]], and [[tailoring]], as well as the tools employed ([[loom]]s and [[sewing needle]]s), techniques employed ([[quilting]] and [[pleat]]ing) and the objects made ([[carpet]]s, [[kilim]]s, [[rug hooking|hooked rugs]], and [[woven coverlet|coverlets]]) all fall under the category of textile arts.

==Functions==

From early times, textiles have been used to cover the human body and protect it from the elements; to send [[social interaction|social cues]] to other people; to store, secure, and protect possessions; and to soften, insulate, and decorate living spaces and surfaces.&lt;ref name="Cambridge intro"&gt;''Cambridge History of Western Textiles'', p. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The persistence of ancient textile arts and functions, and their elaboration for decorative effect, can be seen in a [[Jacobean era]] portrait of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]] by [[Robert Peake the Elder]] (&lt;small&gt;above&lt;/small&gt;). The prince's [[capotain]] [[hat]] is made of felt using the most basic of textile techniques. His clothing is made of woven cloth, richly embroidered in [[silk]], and his [[stocking]]s are knitted. He stands on an [[oriental rug]] of [[wool]] which softens and warms the floor, and heavy [[curtain]]s both decorate the room and block cold drafts from the window. [[Goldwork (embroidery)|Goldwork embroidery]] on the [[tablecloth]] and curtains proclaim the status of the home's owner, in the same way that the felted fur hat, sheer [[linen]] [[shirt]] trimmed with [[reticella]] lace, and opulent embroidery on the prince's clothes proclaim his social position.&lt;ref&gt;For general discussion of textile techniques in this era and their significance, see Janet Arnold, ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'' and ''Patterns of Fashion: the cut and construction of clothes for men and women 1560–1620'', as well as Karen Hearn, editor, ''Dynasties: Painting in Tudor and Jacobean England 1530–1630'', throughout.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textiles as art==
Traditionally the term ''art'' was used to refer to any skill or mastery, a concept which altered during the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period of the nineteenth century, when art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Ernst. "[http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 Press statement on The Story of Art]". The Gombrich Archive, 2005.The main textile artist was Tom Riddle Retrieved on January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction between ''craft'' and [[fine art]] is applied to the textile arts as well, where the term ''[[fiber art]]'' or ''textile art'' is now used to describe textile-based decorative objects which are not intended for practical use.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== History of plant use in textile arts ==
Natural fibers have been an important aspect of human society since 7000 B.C.,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1533/9780857095503.1|title=Introduction to natural textile fibres|last=kozłowski|first=R.M.|last2=Mackiewicz-Talarczyk|first2=M.|pages=1–8|doi=10.1533/9780857095503.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is suspected that they were first used in ornamental cloths since 400 B.C. in India where cotton was first grown.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015006754272|title=The textile arts, a handbook of fabric structure and design processes:ancient and modern weaving, braiding, printing, and other textile techniques.|last=Birrell|first=Verla Leone|date=1959|publisher=New York,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural fibers have been used for the past 4000 to 5000 years to make cloth, and plant and animal fibers were the only way that clothing and fabrics could be created up until 1885 when the first synthetic fiber was made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cotton and flax are two of the most common natural fibers that are used today, but historically natural fibers were made of most parts of the plant, including bark, stem, leaf, fruit, seed hairs, and sap.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Flax ===
[[File:Mummy Cloth Fragment MET 43868.jpg|thumb|Linen cloth that was used in mummification.]]
Flax is believed to be the oldest fiber that was used to create textiles, as it was found in the tombs of mummies from as early as 6500 B.C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maier|first=Ursula|last2=Schlichtherle|first2=Helmut|date=2011-11-01|title=Flax cultivation and textile production in Neolithic wetland settlements on Lake Constance and in Upper Swabia (south-west Germany)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00334-011-0300-8|journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany|language=en|volume=20|issue=6|pages=567–578|doi=10.1007/s00334-011-0300-8|issn=0939-6314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fibers from the flax are taken from the filaments in the stem of the plant, spun together to create long strands, and then woven into long pieces of linen that were used from anything from bandages to clothing and tapestries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each fiber's length depends on the height of the leaf that it is serving, with 10 filaments in a bundle serving each leaf on the plant. Each filament is the same thickness, giving it a consistency that is ideal for spinning yarn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The yarn was best used on warping boards or warping reels to create large pieces of cloth that could be dyed and woven into different patterns to create elaborate tapestries and embroideries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  One example of how linen was used is in the picture of a bandage that a mummy was wrapped in, dated between 305 and 30 B.C. Some of the bandages were painted with hieroglyphs if the person being buried was of importance to the community.

=== Cotton ===
[[File:Fustat Indian.jpg|thumb|Cotton tapestry that was woven into an intricate pattern in India]]
Cotton was first used in 5000 B.C. in India and the Middle East, and spread to Europe after they invaded India in 327 B.C. The manufacture and production of cotton spread rapidly in the 18th century, and it quickly became one of the most important textile fibers because of its comfort, durability, and absorbency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cotton fibers are seed hairs formed in a capsule that grows after the plant flowers. The fibers complete their growth cycle and burst to release about 30 seeds that each have between 200 and 7000 seed hairs that are between 22 and 50 millimeters long. About 90% of the seed hairs are cellulose, with the other 10% being wax, pectate, protein, and other minerals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once it is processed, cotton can be spun into yarn of various thicknesses to be woven or knitted into various different products such as velvet, chambray, corduroy, jersey, flannel, and velour that can be used in clothing tapestries, rugs, and drapes, as shown in the image of the cotton tapestry that was woven in India.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Plant fiber identification in ancient textiles ==
Light microscopy, normal transmission electron microscopy, and most recently scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to study ancient textile remains to determine what natural fibers were used to create them.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryder|first=M. L.|last2=Gabra-Sanders|first2=Thea|date=1985|title=The Application of Microscopy to Textile History|url=https://doi.org/10.1179/004049685793701061|journal=Textile History|volume=|pages=123–140|via=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once textiles are found, the fibers are teased out using a light microscope and an SEM is used to look for characteristics in the textile that show what plant it is made of.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In flax, for example, scientists look for longitudinal striations that show the cells of the plant stem and cross striations and nodes that are specific to flax fibers. Cotton is identified by the twist that occurs in the seed hairs when the fibers are dried to be woven.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This knowledge helps us to learn where and when the cultivation of plants that are used in textiles first occurred, confirming the previous knowledge that was gained from studying the era in which different textile arts aligned with from a perspective of design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Future of plants in textile art ==
While plant use in textile art is still common today, there are new innovations being developed, such as Suzanne Lee's art installation “BioCouture.” Lee uses fermentation to create a plant-based paper sheet that can be cut and sewn just like cloth- ranging in thickness from thin plastic-like materials up to thick leather-like sheets.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hemmings|first=Jessica|date=2008|title=Grown Fashion: Animal, Vegetable or Plastic?|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175183508X377627|journal=The Journal of Cloth and Culture|volume=|pages=262–273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garments are “disposable” because they are made entirely of plant based products and are completely biodegradable. Within her project, Lee places a large emphasis on making the clothing look fashionable by using avant-garde style and natural dyes made from fruits because compostable clothing is not appealing to most shoppers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, there is a possibility to create designs with the plants by tearing or cutting the growing sheet and allowing it to heal to create a pattern made of scars on the textile.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The possibilities to use this textile in art installations is incredible because artists would have the ability to create a living art piece, such as Lee does with her clothing.

'''Thanjavur painting''' is a classical [[South India]]n [[painting]] style, which was [[Inauguration|inaugurated]] from the town of [[Thanjavur]] (anglicized as [[Tanjore]]) and spread across the adjoining and geographically contiguous Tamil country. The art form draws its immediate resources and inspiration from way back about 1600 AD, a period when the [[Nayak (title)|Nayakas]] of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas encouraged art—chiefly, classical dance and music—as well as literature, both in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and painting of chiefly Hindu religious subjects in temples.It is distinguished by its famous gold coating. However, it can safely be surmised that Thanjavur painting, as we know it now, originated in the Maratha court of Thanjavur (1676 - 1855).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paramparaproject.org/traditions_tanjor-gold-paintings.html|title=Parampara Project - Tanjore Gold Leaf Painting|publisher=paramparaproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been recognized as a [[Geographical indication]] by the [[Government of India]] in 2007-08.&lt;ref name="GI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/|title=Geographical indication|publisher=Government of India|access-date=28 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826183844/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/|archivedate=26 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thanjavur]] paintings are characterised by rich, flat and vivid colors, simple iconic composition, glittering gold foils overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work and inlay of glass beads and pieces or very rarely precious and semi-precious gems. In Thanjavur paintings one can see the influence of Deccani, Vijayanagar, Maratha and even European or Company styles of painting. Essentially serving as devotional icons, the subjects of most paintings are [[Hindu]] gods, goddesses, and saints. Episodes from Hindu Puranas, ''Sthala-puranas'' and other religious texts were visualised, sketched or traced and painted with the main figure or figures placed in the central section of the picture (mostly within an architecturally delineated space such as a ''mantapa'' or ''prabhavali'') surrounded by several subsidiary figures, themes and subjects.  There are also many instances when Jain, Sikh, Muslim, other religious and even secular subjects were depicted in Tanjore paintings.

Thanjavur paintings are [[panel painting]]s done on wooden planks, and hence referred to as ''palagai padam'' (''palagai'' = "wooden plank"; ''padam'' = "picture") in local parlance. In modern times, these paintings have become souvenirs for festive occasions in South India - colourful pieces of art to decorate walls, and collectors' items for art lovers, as also sadly sometimes, dime-a-dozen bric-a-bracs to be purchased from street corner practitioners.

==History==

===Introduction===

Thanjavur has a unique place in the history of Indian painting, in that it houses the 11th century [[Chola]] wall paintings in the [[Brihadeeswarar temple]] (''Periya koyil'' or ''Pervudaiyar koyil'' in Tamil) as also paintings from the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayak]] period (many times superimposed on the earlier [[Chola]] paintings&lt;ref&gt;Preserving the past - Unique achievement by archaeologists in restoring Thanjavur paintings - S.H. Venkatramani in Thanjavur  November 19, 2013 | UPDATED 16:06 IST http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/unique-achievement-by-archaeologists-in-restoring-thanjavur-paintings/1/328875.html&lt;/ref&gt;) dating to the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_cholabt.asp|title=Great Living Chola Temples, Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur; Temple of Gangaikonda Cholisvaram, Tamil Nadu, Archaeological Survey of India|publisher=asi.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the [[Vijayanagar Empire]] and the sack of [[Hampi]] in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 CE resulted in the migration of painters who had been dependent on the patronage of the empire. Some of them migrated to Thanjavur and worked under the patronage of the Thanjavur Nayakas. Subsequently, the [[Maratha]] rulers who defeated the Thanjavur [[Nayak dynasty|Nayakas]] began to nurture the Thanjavur atelier. Needless to say, the artists absorbed the local influences and the individual tastes of their [[Maratha]] patrons which helped evolve the unique Thanjavur style of painting. The Thanjavur artists in addition to decorating temples also began painting and decorating the major buildings, palaces, ''chatrams'' and residences of the Maratha kings and nobility.

===Vijayanagara Rayas===
The [[Vijayanagar]] empire, founded by Harihara and Bukka, was for long a bulwark against the rapidly advancing Islamic influence from the nearby Deccan and the farther North. While the foreign influences did gradually percolate into the Peninsular South, the Vijayanagar empire ensured that the older Hindu artistic traditions were protected and preserved.
The empire had reached its zenith under [[Krishnadevaraya]] (1509–29). Its territory stretched across the entire South Indian peninsula, from the [[Tungabhadra]] river in the North to [[Kanyakumari]] in the south and the Malabar coast on the Arabian sea in  the west to the Coromandel coast on the Bay of Bengal in the east at its peak. In 1521-22, [[Krishnadevaraya]] travelled to the Tamil country ''(Tamilagam)'' visiting holy places and as was his wont, made munificent donations to temples and other religious establishments.&lt;ref name="MuseumDallapiccola2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=South Indian Paintings: A Catalogue of the British Museum Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIzWapiacQcC&amp;pg=PA78|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-7141-2424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be surmised that some of this munificence was also channeled into art and artists.

===Thanjavur Nayakas===
The Vijayanagar Rayas administered their vast kingdom through Nayaka Governors who also administered the outlying provinces or states under the supervision of the Raya. The third important [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaka]] state in Tamil country, Thanjavur, ([[Gingee|Senji]] and [[Madurai]] being the others) had been established under the reign of [[Krishnadevaraya]]'s half-brother and successor Achyutaraya (1529–42). The Thanjavur Nayaka line commenced with Sevappa Nayaka (1532–72). Sevappa ruled for several years, ably supported by his son Achyutappa (1564-1614), who later succeeded him. It was during Achyutappa's reign that the [[Vijayanagara]] empire fell, leading to the exodus of numerous litterateurs, philosophers, musicians and artists who migrated to several other neighbouring kingdoms like [[Mysore]] and Thanjavur. Achyutappa was succeeded by his son Raghunatha Nayaka who in turn was succeeded by Vijayaraghava Nayaka. Raghunatha, who was possibly the most successful Thanjavur Nayaka ruler, was also a great patron of art and artists and helped establish the unique school of Thanjavur artists who later evolved the Thanjavur style of paintings under the Marathas.

===Marathas===
Due to internal dissensions in the Nayaka line, [[Ekoji]] otherwise called [[Venkoji]] (1676–83), half-brother of Chatrapati [[Shivaji]] marched into Thanjavur on behalf of the Adil Shah of Bijapur under whom he was a General. He subsequently captured Thanjavur and established the [[Maratha]] rule. Despite intermittent wars, when Thanjavur was overrun first by the Nawab of Arcot and later by Haidar Ali, [[Ekoji]] and his successors like Tulajaji, [[Serfoji II]] (''Sarabhoji'' in Tamil) and others remained great patrons of the arts and artists. By the time [[Serfoji II]] succeeded to the Maratha throne in Thanjavur, the Britishers had taken over the complete administration of the state, retaining the king in only a nominal capacity to exercise power over the fort and a smidgen of surrounding lands . Though [[Serfoji II]] had to fight off a spirited competition from Amarasimha, his paternal uncle, to the Maratha throne of Thanjavur, it was during his reign&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Thanjavur - A Cultural History by Pradeep Chakravarthy Published by Niyogi books&lt;/ref&gt; that Thanjavur painting flourished and reached the form and style in which we recognise it today. [[Serfoji II]] had to traverse a difficult path throughout his reign, being constantly challenged by Amarasimha who ran a parallel court in [[Thiruvidaimarudur]] even after his accession. However, despite the troubled times, [[Serfoji II|Serfoji's]] reign was a time of great innovations in Thanjavur art and many other parallel fields.

The Maratha rule came to a sad end after the death of its last ruler Shivaji II, (resembling only in name his vastly greater ancestor) who died without a male issue, when the Britishers obliged by annexing the Thanjavur state to its dominions under the notorious [[Doctrine of Lapse]]. After the [[Maratha]] rule waned, the mercantile [[Chettiar]] community continued to patronise the Thanjavur artists. The [[Chettiar]]s being staunch Shaivites encouraged Shaivite themes. One of their monasteries in [[Koviloor]] has large Thanjavur paintings on the lives of the 63 Nayanmars (Saivaite saints) and the 64 miracles (''Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam'') of Lord Shiva minutely labelled in Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;Thanjavur Paintings in Koviloor  By C. Nachiappan Hardcover Kalakshetra Publications 14 Nov 2004, 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Bhimarajagoswami monastery in Thanjavur has a large painting of 108 Vishnu temples. The Britishers who had come into Thanjavur in the wake of the [[Anglo-Mysore wars]] also patronised Thanjavur artists and their paintings.

==Style and Technique==
Thanjavur paintings were made in various sizes depending upon the function, the subject and the choice of the patron. Large paintings of deities and the Maratha rulers, their courtiers and nobility, were painted and installed to serve as architectural accents in the Maratha palaces and buildings. To quote Dallapiccola - ' ''The works, executed on canvas pasted on a wooden support, were framed - a major departure from the pan-Indian tradition, in which paintings are of small size - and designed to be hung on the walls of domestic puja rooms or in bhajan halls. The themes, as in painted albums, (made for European patrons) were usually gods and goddesses, holy places, religious personalities and occasionally portraits. Their dazzling palette consisted generally of vivid reds, deep greens, chalk white, turquoise blues and the lavish use of gold (foil) and inset glass beads. Sometimes precious stones were also used in the paintings. The large format of the majority of such works and the relatively simple composition are the hallmark of the style. This school was greatly inspired by European techniques and was the most popular in Tamil Nadu until the early twentieth century.''&lt;ref&gt;South Indian Paintings - A catalogue of the British Museum collection by A. L. Dallapiccola Published by Mapin Publishing in association with the British Museum Press&lt;/ref&gt;'

Paintings in addition to being done on canvas, were also done on walls, wooden panel, glass, paper, mica and exotic media such as ivory. Small Ivory portraits were typically worn as cameo pendants called ''rajaharam'' and were quite popular.

Thanjavur glass paintings following the techniques of Chinese reverse glass paintings were popularised during [[Serfoji II|Serfoji II's]] reign as a cheaper and faster craft. The paintings were done on the reverse surface of a glass sheet with strips of metal beaten into transparent gaps to simulate the effect of jewellery and precious stones. Most of the paintings were of Hindu deities &amp; saints. Other courtly and secular portraits were also created.

[[File:Raja Sarabhoji of Tanjore.jpg|thumb| Tanjore Glass painting of Raja Sarabhoji]]

A Thanjavur Painting was generally made on a canvas pasted over a plank of wood (Jackfruit or teak) with Arabic gum. The canvas was then evenly coated with a paste of French chalk (''gopi'') or powdered limestone and a binding medium and dried. The artist then drew or traced using a stencil, a detailed outline of the main and subsidiary subjects on the canvas. A paste, made of limestone powder and a binding medium called ''sukkan'' or ''makku'', was used for creating the Gesso work. Gold leaves and gems of varied hues were inlaid in selected areas like pillars, arches, thrones, dresses, etc. Finally, colours were applied on the sketch.

In the past, artists used natural colours like vegetable and mineral dyes, whereas the present day artists use chemical paints. For outlines dark brown or red was usually used. Red was favoured for the background, though blue and green were also used. Lord Vishnu, was coloured blue, and Lord Nataraja chalk white, and his consort Goddess Sivakami was green.  The sky, of course, was blue, but black was also employed on occasions. The portrayal of figures in the paintings was also typical with almost all the figures having rounded faces with almond-shaped eyes and smooth, streamlined bodies. The composition is static and two-dimensional with the figures placed within arches, curtains and decorative borders. The main subject is much larger than the other subjects and occupies the centre of the painting. Seraphs or angels resembling those in European paintings and Islamic miniatures were also shown flanking the main figure. The figures were painted with bright flat colours except for the face where shading was shown. The shading in Thanjavur art was more to create a feeling of depth than to conform to the European conventions of lighting and perspective.

There are some examples of this art in the [[Saraswathi Mahal Library]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thanjavur.nic.in/sml/library/Library_History/library_history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233630/http://thanjavur.nic.in/sml/library/Library_History/library_history.html |archivedate=2014-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Tanjore built by [[Serfoji II]]. The Sanskrit work ''Prabotha Chandrodayam'' in the library has a few pages of Tanjore art as also Marathi translations of ''Mahabharata &amp; Bhagavatham'' in which are found the works of the painter Madhava swami dated 1824 AD. Faint traces of Maratha style paintings inset with glass are found on the walls of the [[Thiruvaiyaru]] Chatram built by [[Serfoji II|Serfoji]] after his pilgrimage to [[Varanasi|Kashi]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many other buildings in and around Thanjavur have fine examples of the paintings on the roofs and walls, though many are gradually disappearing and dying due to serious neglect and stupid acts of vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.chennaionline.com/newsitem.aspx?NEWSID=11457ae7-3659-4b76-8349-708dcedc113c&amp;CATEGORYNAME=tnadu |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145649/http://news.chennaionline.com/newsitem.aspx?NEWSID=11457ae7-3659-4b76-8349-708dcedc113c&amp;CATEGORYNAME=tnadu |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/a-treasure-trove-of-thanjavur-paintings-lies-in-neglect/article6074700.ece|title=A treasure trove of Thanjavur paintings lies in neglect|author=M.

The [[Government Museum, Chennai]] and the Thanjavur Art Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;Frommer's India by Pippa de Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice, Shonar Joshi&lt;/ref&gt; Thanjavur also house  fine collections of Thanjavur paintings depicting the [[Maratha]] kings of Thanjavur and other allied subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennaimuseum.org/draft/gallery/03/01/012/tanjore1.htm|title=Government Museum Chennai|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many private museums and collectors also possess enviable collections of Thanjavur paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Hasta Shilpa heritage village, Manipal {{cite web |url=http://www.indiaheritagevillage.org/treasures/mutanjore.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116020553/http://www.indiaheritagevillage.org/treasures/mutanjore.htm |archivedate=2014-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British and Victoria &amp; Albert museums in England also house a large collection of Thanjavur paintings in the company and traditional styles. The National Museum of Copenhagen also houses a fine collection of 17th century Thanjavur paintings. King Christian IV of Denmark had received permission to build a fort at Tranquebar ( ''Tharangambadi'' in Tamil) which led to the building of the Danesborg fort as also a Danish relationship with Thanjavur which resulted in the museum collection.&lt;ref&gt;Chiang Mai &amp; Northern Thailand Footprint Focus Guide  By Andrew Spooner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==
Tanjore paintings were painted by 'Moochys or Artists of India' according to the British chronicler Charles Gold in his book ''Oriental Drawings'' published in 1806. Traditionally, it is well known that the Raju community of Thanjavur and Tiruchi, also called as Jinigara or Chitragara and the Nayudu community of Madurai were the artists who executed paintings in the Thanjavur style.&lt;ref&gt;Tanjore Paintings, A Chapter in Indian Art History by N. S. 'Kora' Ramaswami&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanjavurpaintings.com/abouttp.html|title=Thanjavur Paintings - About Thanjavur paintings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists (Rajus &amp; Naidus) were originally Telugu speaking people from the artistically vibrant "Rayalseema" region of Andhra, who moved to Tamil Nadu in the wake of the fall of the Vijayanagar empire and the establishment of Nayak rule in Madurai and Thanjavur.

The artists turned out a wide repertoire of paintings on different subjects and of varied quality depending upon the patron's interest, urgency and most importantly influence and financial capacity. However, the art was by and large a sacred task to be performed with a reasonable degree of ritual purity and humility by the master craftsmen, many of whom chose to remain anonymous and never signed their paintings, true to the Indian artistic tradition. However a few works signed by the Thanjavur artists are also known. [[C. Kondaiah Raju|C. Kondiah Raju]],&lt;ref name="BabbWadley1998"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Lawrence A. Babb|editor2=Susan S. Wadley|title=Media and the Transformation of Religion in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgDHFFe7YM8C&amp;pg=PA55|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1453-0|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; the famous calendar artist from [[Kovilpatti]], was one of the illustrious descendants to make a name as an artist during modern times from the Raju community.

==Influences==

The Tanjore style of paintings spring from a late phase of South Indian classical art, when the society in which it originated was itself going through turbulent times. Needless to say, Tanjore paintings are informed by a syncretic style, notable for its assimilation of the contemporary diverse cultural influences - Tamil, Telugu, Maratha, European, Deccani, Folk, etc. The style drew heavily from the other major South Indian styles of painting which were all deeply influenced by the Vijayanagar school. The closest influences among these could be the [[Kalamkari]] and [[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] paintings.

[[File:Tirupati Venkateswarar with consorts.jpg|thumb|left|A portable wooden shrine carrying painted terracotta plaques of Tirupati Venkateswarar and consorts- Circa 19th century CE]]

[[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] paintings, in particular were produced in the famous temple town using different media and techniques, like painted terracotta reliefs, brass repousse works, paintings on paper and canvas, etc. The commonest examples were painted and gilded terracotta relief slabs of the deity, framed and packaged in neat wooden boxes which could be carried back as holy memorabilia and worshipped in the ''Puja room'' by the pilgrim-devotee. Paintings of the main deity, gilded and gem-set, in a manner similar to Tanjore paintings are also known.

[[File:Painted Brass repousse Tirupati Balaji.jpg|thumb|A painted brass repousse of Tirupati Balaji. Circa 19th century CE.]]

Tanjore paintings were also closely related to the crafts of painted and carved wood on the one hand and gilded, stone set jewellery work which flourished in Thanjavur. It is also pertinent to remember that Thanjavur art was functional, in that it was made for a specific purpose on a specific demand from a customer. And it is also in the same context that one understands the iconic style of Thanjavur paintings in contrast to say, the [[Pahari miniatures]] or even [[Surpur paintings]].&lt;ref&gt;Tanjavur Painting of the Maratha Period, By Jaya Appasamy Published by Abhinav publications&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vayu.jpg|thumb|left| A Tanjore painting of Vayu on mica in the collection of Government Museum, Chennai]]

==Tanjore and [[Mysore painting]]s==
Tanjore and [[Mysore painting]]s, both spring from the same source - Vijayanagara paintings to begin with and Nayaka paintings subsequently. The very same artists, Chitragars and Naidus migrated to various places including Thanjavur and Mysore. This is the reason for the remarkable degree of similarity between the two styles. However, there are many differences that can be made out by the discerning viewer.

The differences are largely in the techniques used to create these artworks and in their distinct iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/efeatures.aspx?relid=95533|title=PIB English Features|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques adopted by the Mysore artists are slightly different from those of the Tanjore School. While Tanjore School used white lime powder and powdered tamarind seeds with gum arabic on cloth stretched on wooden panels, Mysore artists used white lead powder (''Makhisafeda'') or ''Makhi Gamboge'' (yellow) drawn from the juice of the indigenous tree (''Revana Chinni halu'') on paper. The paper sometimes was pasted to a wooden board, but mostly was framed as it was. As against the high relief of the Tanjore 'Gesso' work used prominently across large areas of the painting, the Mysore school preferred low relief, in selected areas such as jewellery, clothing, and borders. The Mysore school used pure gold leaf in lesser quantity as against gold-coated silver leaf handled across larger areas in the painting by Tanjore artists. The use of glass beads, precious and semi precious stones is also very rare in [[Mysore painting]]s. More elaborate and detailed interior and exterior landscapes are featured in [[Mysore painting]]s, whereas Tanjore paintings tend to be more iconic and static. In [[Mysore painting]]s, the jewellery, costumes, architectural features, furniture, etc. reflect the contemporary style prevalent in the [[Mysore Palace]]. The throne on which Gods and Goddesses are shown seated is usually a replica of the Mysore throne in many [[Mysore painting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Indian Painting : The Modern Period by Krishna Chaitanya pages 36 &amp; 37 {{ISBN|8170173108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both styles however, frequently show traditional temple pavilions (''prabhavalis'') and towers particularly for framing the main characters. However the geographical proximity, constant transmigration of artists and a heavy cross fertilisation of ideas and techniques ensured that one could see Tanjore paintings employing Mysore techniques and vice versa.

==Tanjore paintings in Company style==
[[File:Rama and Hanuman fighting Ravana, an album painting on paper, c1820.jpg|thumb|Rama and Hanuman fighting Ravana, an album painting on paper, c1820 - British Museum Collection]]

Many of the traditional Indian artists were also patronised by Europeans, beginning with the Portuguese who  landed on the west coast in 1498. Gradually the other Europeans followed suit and commissioned local artists to paint in the so-called company style. While no specific character or technique marked out the Company school of paintings, it can be understood to mean the large body of paintings painted by Indian artists in a mixed Indo-European style which would appeal to the Europeans who were employed by the various East India Companies.

[[File:The deity Yama with fangs and holding a daṇḍa (a rod).jpg|thumb|left|The deity Yama with fangs and holding a daṇḍa (a rod), circa 1814 - British Museum Collection]]

The direct European impact on Tanjore paintings began with the stationing of a British garrison in Thanjavur in 1773, during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] of 1767-99. Throughout the nineteenth century, artists based in and around Thanjavur prepared, by and large a  standard sets of paintings for the Company personnel. These sets were called albums or album paintings and were a collection of 'native' or 'Indian' subjects of interest, suited to the English sensibilities and tastes. Common subjects were Gods and Goddesses, episodes from Hindu mythology; Fairs, ceremonies, processions and festivals; Castes, their occupations and dresses; Indian Flora and Fauna, etc.  These paintings were executed by the same Tanjore artists in a style suited to western tastes. The paintings were usually executed on European paper, without gesso work, little or no Gold foil and without any glass or gem inlay. The paintings would also carry a brief description ( most times extremely quaint and so typically English) of the subject in English and sometimes in Tamil or Telugu. Paintings on cloth backed by wooden panels were also executed for the English patrons. Many of these were carried to England where they probably enlivened many an evening tea!  The [[British Museum]] and The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] have an enviable collection of such paintings.

Though the British patronised paintings tend to be grouped under the Company style of paintings, they were Tanjore paintings in spirit. In addition to being executed by the same traditional group of artists in Thanjavur and the neighbouring Tamil country, the style and characterisation in these paintings are very typically Thanjavur as against the style of say, Company paintings executed in Calcutta or Lucknow.

==Modern Times==
Thanjavur paintings continue to be made even to the present day, though not with the rigour and virtuosity that marked the paintings of yore. 'Revival' programmes, Exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/Thanjavur-paintings-steal-the-show-at-Madurai-exhibition/articleshow/20964245.cms|title=Thanjavur paintings steal the show at Madurai exhibition|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops and Training camps on Thanjavur paintings are being held regularly by many institutions including State Governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/16/stories/2011051653050700.htm|title=News Archives: The Hindu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/Women-queue-up-to-learn-Thanjavur-painting/articleshow/21738811.cms|title=Women queue up to learn Thanjavur painting|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials used have also changed according to the cost, ease of availability and the choice of individual artists. Plywood, for example has by and large replaced Jack and teak wood. Synthetic colours and adhesives are preferred over the natural and mineral colours and other traditional components. In addition to the traditional subjects, a wide range of popular and modern subjects and themes are being depicted in Thanjavur paintings. While it is a happy development that this traditional art continues to hold its sway, the brazen commercialisation and lack of aesthetics are disturbing trends. Be that as it may, Thanjavur paintings - the style and aesthetics continue to inspire many contemporary artists. The Calendar prints of [[C. Kondaiah Raju|C. Kondiah Raju]] and his student followers, marked by an iconic solidness as against the western naturalism of [[Raja Ravi Varma]], are examples of the continued influence of Tanjore paintings in modern, popular and academic art.

Artists have taken this old form of art and over the years combined it with other styles to create mixed media arts. For example, tanjores are also done on mirrors, glass and canvas. The idea of applying gold foil is unique to this traditional art, so this same style is taken and recreated on different mediums.

'''The New Zealand Dance Company''' (incorporated as The New Zealand Dance Advancement Trust) is an [[Auckland]] based, nationally focused contemporary dance company.

Established in 2011, by co-founders Chief Executive/Artistic Director (and [[Arts Foundation of New Zealand|Arts Laureate]]) Shona McCullagh and the founding General Manager Frances Turner, the company sought to break the paradigm of dance companies operating on a project by project basis, presenting work by one choreographer, and moved instead to a sustainable model of presenting a variety of choreographic works.

== Productions ==

Language of Living was The New Zealand Dance Company's first production and is composed of five short works by [[New Zealand]] choreographers.

Dreamy McFloat was choreographed by Tupua Tigafua and has music by Richard M Moyle, [[Antonio Vivaldi]], and a poem excerpt from [[John Pule]], Little Sun. Tenerezza was choreographed by Michael Parmenter, with music by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E Bach]]. Human Human God was choreographed by Sarah Foster-Sproull, with music by Eden Mullholland.

Language of Living opened in 2012 at the [[Aotea Centre]] in [[Auckland]]. In 2013 Language of Living toured the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], The New Zealand Dance Company performed in [[Auckland]], [[Warkworth, New Zealand|Warkworth]], [[Whangarei]], [[Orewa]], [[Hawkes Bay]] and [[Wellington]]. In 2014 Language of Living toured in New Zealand, performing in [[Invercargill]], [[Christchurch]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], [[New Plymouth]] and [[Tauranga]].

Rotunda is The New Zealand Dance Company's second production, and its first full-length work.

It was choreographed by Shona McCullagh.

'''''The South Bank Show''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] arts magazine show. It was originally produced by [[London Weekend Television]] and broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] between 1978 and 2010. A new version of the series began on [[Sky Arts]] from 27 May 2012.&lt;ref name="rt revival"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-02/sherlock-and-twenty-twelve-up-for-south-bank-awards|title=Sherlock and Twenty Twelve up for South Bank Awards|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceived, written and presented by former [[BBC]] arts broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]], the show aims to bring both [[high art]] and [[popular culture]] to a mass audience.

==History==
===ITV (1978-2010)===
The programme was a replacement for ''[[Aquarius (UK TV series)|Aquarius]]'', the arts series which had been running since 1970. Presenter [[Melvyn Bragg]] was already well known for his arts broadcasting on BBC television, notably ''[[Monitor (UK TV series)|Monitor]]'' and [[BBC Two]]'s ''The Lively Arts''. It first aired on 14 January 1978, covering many subjects,  including  [[Germaine Greer]], [[Gerald Scarfe]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. It is the longest continuously running arts programme on UK television. From the beginning the series' intent was to mix high art and popular culture. This has remained, and the programme has always focused predominantly on art of the 20th and 21st centuries.

For much of its life, the show was produced by [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT) for the ITV network.

In May 2009, ITV announced that the show was to come to an end. Although it was originally reported that the show was ending due to Bragg's retirement,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/06/itv-the-south-bank-show-melvyn-bragg "ITV to axe The South Bank Show when Melvyn Bragg retires next year"], ''The Guardian'' (London), 6 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bragg later made it clear that he decided to leave after they ended the show, and thought ending it was a mistake; according to him, "they've killed the show, so I thought, I'll go as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://living.scotsman.com/books/Interview-Melvyn-Bragg--Man.5640953.jp | title=Interview: Melvyn Bragg - Man out of time |date= 9 November 2009 | work=[[The Scotsman]] | author=Chitra Ramaswamy | accessdate=9 November 2009| quote='It did [shock me] a bit, especially from [ITV chairman] [[Michael Grade|Michael [Grade]]],' says Bragg before steeling himself. 'I think it's a mistake. But there you go. These things happen. You move on.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Bragg's book of reminiscences, ''The South Bank Show: Final Cut''. Hodder, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4447-0552-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 28 December 2009 the final edition of ''The South Bank Show'' was broadcast featuring [[The Royal Shakespeare Company]] as its subject. Melvyn Bragg announced on this programme, after the final South Bank Show Awards in January 2010, there would be a series of ten ''South Bank Show Revisited'' programmes transmitted in early 2010 featuring updates on previous ''South Bank Show'' subjects.

===Sky Arts (2012-present)===
At the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] awards show in January 2010, Lord Melvyn Bragg said he was baffled by ITV's decision to axe ''The South Bank Show'' after 30 years on air. Also at the awards show, [[Prince Charles]] said in a taped testimonial that it was the end of one of the most important beacons of arts in this country which this country was lucky enough to enjoy.

In July 2010, it was revealed that Bragg had bought the rights to the brand and had first right of access to ''The South Bank Show'' archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/19/south-bank-show-sky-arts | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Maggie | last=Brown | title=Lord Bragg takes South Bank Show to Sky Arts | date=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sky Arts]] broadcasts ''South Bank Show'' archive editions and hosted the [[South Bank Sky Arts Award]]s on 25 Jan 2011, presented by Melvyn Bragg, accompanied by a new arrangement of ''The South Bank Show'' theme.

[[Sky Arts]] revived ''The South Bank Show'' with a new series starting 27 May 2012.&lt;ref name="rt revival"/&gt;

==Theme music and visuals==
[[File:Hands of God and Adam.jpg|thumb|250px|The iconic image of the Hand of God giving life to Adam, used since the series' inception.]] 
The [[theme music]] is taken from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]'' composed in 1977 for his brother, the cellist [[Julian Lloyd Webber]]. This is based on the theme from [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]]'s "[[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|24th Caprice]]". The brand image of the programme is an animated version of a detail from [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] painting, specifically the image of the Hand of God giving life to [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]. It shows the two hands meeting, generating a [[lightning]] bolt.

There are plans to release past interviews as part of the podcast as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title       = ''The South Bank Show'' Podcast RSS |publisher   = [[itv.com]] |date        =  |url         = http://download.itv.com/southbankshow/podcast.xml |accessdate  = 21 May 2013 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100127143608/http://download.itv.com/southbankshow/podcast.xml |archivedate = 27 January 2010 |df          = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The programme has been awarded  more than 110 awards (including 12 [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTAs]], 5 [[Prix Italia]] and 4 [[Royal Television Society|RTS Award]]s). Pat Gavin's animated [[title sequence]]s have won two BAFTAs.

==Parodies==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
The comedy series ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' often parodied ''The South Bank Show''. It does this in a series of sketches called ''South Bank'', a cross between ''The South Bank Show'' and the American cartoon ''[[South Park]]'', set in the [[South Bank]] of London. In these sketches, Melvyn Bragg is [[Stan Marsh]], [[Alan Yentob]] is [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Mark Lawson]] is [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] is [[Kenny McCormick]].

A sketch in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]'' featured [[Vic Reeves]] as Melvyn Bragg (with felt-tip marks on his face) presenting a feature on fictional folk singers Mulligan and O'Hare. Reeves depicts Bragg as an unlikely ''[[The A-Team|A-Team]]'' obsessive.

[[Harry Enfield]]'s TV film ''[[Norbert Smith - a Life]]'' is a parody edition of ''The South Bank Show''.

[[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]]'s second series of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' featured a reference to a fictional episode of ''The South Bank Show'' focused on madcap children's television presenters [[Dick and Dom]].

''[[Private Eye]]'' tends to parody Melvyn Bragg's name, and ''[[Spitting Image]]'' would rather accentuate his nasal accent.

[[Benny Hill]] once parodied Bragg in a 1978 episode of ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'' as Melvyn Dragg. The name of the show was also parodied, and it was called "The South Blank Show."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5961">[[File:Hildesheim Dom Heziloleuchter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hezilo chandelier]] in the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]]]]
[[File:Barbarossaleuchter.jpg|thumb|[[Barbarossa chandelier]] in the [[Aachen Cathedral]]]]
[[File:Comburg Hartwigleuchter.jpg|thumb|Hartwig's chandelier in [[Comburg]]]]
A '''wheel chandelier''' is a [[lighting]] installment, in the form of a [[chandelier]] hanging from the ceiling in the form of a spoked wheel. The oldest and most important examples derive from the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period.

Wheel chandeliers were made for the practical purpose of lighting the [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches|great]] [[church architecture|churches]] and other public areas, but in religion they also had symbolic significance, depicting the [[Garden of Eden]] or the [[Kingdom of God]]. The wheel, its gates, and its towers, which are usually decorated with [[Prophet#Christianity|Prophet]]s and [[Apostle]]s or inscribed with their names, symbolise the city walls of the [[New Jerusalem]]. The buttresses, towers, and candles number twelve or a multiple of twelve, after the [[numerology]] of the [[Book of Revelation]]. This symbolism is first found on two wheel chandeliers of the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Sedlmayr (Lit.), S. 125-128&lt;/ref&gt; The great wheel chandelier of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulcher]] was an inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Gallistl (Lit.), S. 44-45; 76-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanesque wheel chandeliers==
In [[Germany]] there are four great Romanesque wheel chandeliers. The fact that they are made from fire-gilt [[copper]] and not from pure [[gold]] has saved them from being melted down. They were decorated with Prophets and angels in silver and with precious gemstones, but for the most part these have been lost.

*The [[Barbarossa chandelier]] in [[Aachen Cathedral]] is attributted to [[Frederick Barbarossa]] (1122 - 1190).
*[[Hartwig's chandelier]] in [[Comburg]], [[Schwäbisch Hall]], with a 5-metre diameter, from the 12th century (also called ''Himmlische Jerusalem''(Heavenly Jerusalem) &lt;!--[http://www.kirchen.de/drs/wochbild/hallkron.html] --&gt; with saints and soldiers in the towers.
*[[Hezilo chandelier]] in [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] with a 6-metre diameter, a donation of Bishop [[Hezilo of Hildesheim]] (1054–79).
*[[Azelin chandelier]] in [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] with a donation inscription of Bishop [[Thietmar of Hildesheim]] (1038–44).

==Gothic wheel chandeliers==
In the [[Minster Church of St. Alexander (Einbeck)|Minster Church of St. Alexander]] in [[Einbeck]], there is a later gothic wheel chandelier of painted brass with a diameter of c. 3.5 metres. The inscription on its bracket dates it to 1420. It was presumably gifted by Degenhard Ree, a Canon of the collegiate church. The composition ought to go back to a lost moder in Pöhlde Cloister.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Franz Hoffmann|Periodical=Grosse Baudenkmäler|Title=St. Alexandri Einbeck |Edition=2|Issue=318|Publisher=Deutscher Kunstverlag|PublicationPlace=München|Year=1981|Date=  1981|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Gothic example is found in:
*The [[Halberstadt Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Stephan and St. Sixtus]], in bronze, in [[Halberstadt]] (1516)

==Neo-Romanesque wheel chandeliers==
[[File:Altarraum St Elisabeth Bonn.jpg|thumb|Electric wheel chandelier in St. Elisabeth Bonn]]
In some neo-Romanesque churches there are large wheel chandeliers too. Some of these were electric even when they were first installed
Some examples:
*[[St. Godehard's Basilica]] in Hildesheim, gifted in 1864 by [[Marie of Saxe-Altenburg]]
*[[St. Cäcilia (Harsum)|St. Cäcilia]] in [[Harsum]] (c.1886)
*[[Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune]] in [[Strasbourg]] (c.1890)
*[[Bethlehemkirche (Hannover)|Bethlehemkirche]] in [[Hannoverd]] (c.1904)
*[[St. Elisabeth (Bonn)|St. Elisabeth]] in [[Bonn]] under contemporary frescoes in the dome (c. 1910) (electrified from installation)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Kirche | url = http://www.st-elisabeth-bonn.de/kirche.html | publisher = Katholische Pfarrgemeinde St. Elisabeth Bonn | accessdate = 2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary wheel chandeliers==
There are also contemporary wheel chandeliers, which continue this tradition:
*[[Herrenhäuser Church]] in [[Hannover]] (c.1990)
*[[Great St. Martin Church, Cologne|Great St. Martin Church]] in [[Cologne]] (before 1993)
*Church of the [[Lippoldsberg Cloister]] (1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klosterkirche.de/raeume/radleuchter/ Webseite der Klosterkirche]; retrieved, 25 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wagon wheel==
Another type is wagon wheel chandelier. As name suggest it is usually made from old wagon wheels. As opposite to most of the wheel chandeliers, wagon wheel chandeliers were usually created as a cheap way to lighten the common spaces of large houses, businesses and public halls. Most of them were made from wood reinforced with steel.
