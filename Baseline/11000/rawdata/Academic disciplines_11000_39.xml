{{Refimprove|date=July 2016}}
'''Altermodern''', a [[portmanteau word]] defined by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]], is an attempt at contextualizing art made in today's global context as a reaction against standardisation and commercialism. It is also the title of the [[Tate Britain]]'s fourth Triennial exhibition curated by Bourriaud.

==Concept==
In his keynote speech to the 2005 Art Association of Australia &amp; New Zealand Conference, Nicolas Bourriaud explained:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/aaanz05/abstracts/nicolas_bourriaud ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723130718/http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/aaanz05/abstracts/nicolas_bourriaud |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Artists are looking for a new modernity that would be based on translation: What matters today  is to translate the cultural values of cultural groups and  to connect them to the world network. This “reloading process” of  modernism according to the twenty-first-century issues could be called altermodernism, a movement connected to the creolisation of cultures and the fight for autonomy, but also the possibility of producing singularities in a more and more standardized world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Altermodern can essentially be read as an artist working in a [[hypermodernity|hypermodern]] world or with supermodern ideas or themes.

==Exhibitions==

===Tate Britain 2009===
The Tate exhibition includes a series of four one-day events (called "Prologues"), aiming to "introduce and provoke debate" around the Triennial’s themes. Each Prologue includes lectures, performances, film and a manifesto text and attempts to define what the curator sees as the four main facets of Altermodern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tate-triennial-2009-prologue-1-okwui-enwezor-specious-modernity-speculations]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Computer_Workstation_Variables_cleanup.png|thumb|right|240px|The field of ergonomics employs anthropometry to optimize human interaction with equipment and workplaces.]]

'''Anthropometry''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|el|ἄνθρωπος}} ''anthropos'', "human", and {{lang|el|μέτρον}} ''metron'', "measure") refers to the measurement of the human individual. An early tool of [[biological anthropology|physical anthropology]], it has been used for identification, for the purposes of understanding human physical variation, in [[paleoanthropology]] and in various attempts to correlate physical with racial and psychological traits. Anthropometry involves the systematic measurement of the physical properties of the human body, primarily dimensional descriptors of body size and shape.&lt;ref&gt;Md. {{clarify|date=August 2015}} Ariful, Islam; Md. {{clarify|date=August 2015}}, Asadujjaman; Md. {{clarify|date=August 2015}}, Nuruzzaman; Md. {{clarify|date=August 2015}} Mosharraf, Hossain. "Ergonomics Consideration for Hospital Bed Design: A Case Study in Bangladesh". Journal of Modern Science and Technology 01 (01): 30-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, anthropometry plays an important role in [[industrial design]], [[clothing]] design, [[ergonomics]] and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products. Changes in lifestyles, nutrition, and ethnic composition of populations lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions (e.g. the [[Epidemiology of obesity|rise in obesity]]) and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections.

== History ==
{{main|History of anthropometry}}
[[File:Galton at Bertillon's (1893).jpg|right|thumb|180px|A [[History of anthropometry#Forensic anthropometry|Bertillon record]] for [[Francis Galton]], from a visit to [[Alphonse Bertillon|Bertillon]]'s laboratory in 1893]]

The history of anthropometry includes and spans various concepts, both [[scientific method|scientific]] and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]], such as [[craniometry]], [[paleoanthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], [[phrenology]], [[physiognomy]], [[forensic science|forensics]], [[criminology]], [[phylogeography]], [[Anthropogeny|human origins]], and cranio-facial description, as well as correlations between various anthropometrics and [[personal identity]], [[typology (psychology)|mental typology]], [[personality]], [[cranial vault]] and [[brain size]], and other factors.

At various times in history, applications of anthropometry have ranged vastly—from accurate [[description|scientific description]] and [[epidemiology|epidemiological analysis]] to rationales for [[eugenics]] and overtly [[racism|racist]] [[social movement]]s—and its points of concern have been numerous, diverse, and sometimes highly unexpected.

==Individual variation==

===Auxologic===
{{main|Auxology}}
Auxologic is a broad term covering the study of all aspects of [[human]] physical [[human development (biology)|growth]]

====Height====
{{main|Human height}}
[[Human height]] varies greatly between individuals and across populations for a variety of complex biological, genetic, and environmental factors, among others. Due to methodological and practical problems, its measurement is also subject to considerable error in [[statistical sampling]].

The average height in genetically and environmentally [[Homogeneity (statistics)|homogeneous]] [[population genetics|population]]s is often proportional across a large number of individuals. Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from a population's average) within such a population is sometimes due to [[gigantism]] or [[dwarfism]], which are caused by specific [[gene]]s or [[endocrine]] abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ganong, William F. (Lange Medical, 2001) ''Review of Medical Physiology'' (pp. 392-397)&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that a great degree of variation occurs between even the most 'common' bodies (66% of the population)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Simeon|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|title=The True Height of the Waist: Explorations of Automated Body Scanner Waist Definitions of the TC2 scanner|journal=Proc. of 5th Int. Conf. on 3D Body Scanning Technologies|date=2014|pages=55-65|doi=10.15221/14.055|url=http://www.3dbodyscanning.org/cap/abstracts/2014/055gill.html|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and as such no person can be considered 'average'.

In the most extreme population comparisons, for example, the average [[female]] height in [[Bolivia]] is {{convert|142.2|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} while the average [[male]] height in the [[Dinaric Alps]] is {{convert|185.6|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}, an average difference of {{convert|43.4|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}. Similarly, the [[List of shortest people|shortest]] and [[List of tallest people|tallest]] of individuals, [[Chandra Bahadur Dangi]] and [[Robert Wadlow]], have ranged from {{convert|1|ft|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|8|ft|11.1|in|cm|abbr=on|0}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="GWR-Dangi"&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/2/shortest-man-world-record-its-official!-chandra-bahadur-dangi-from-nepal-is-smallest-adult-of-all-time/ Shortest man world record: It’s official!

====Weight====
{{main|Human weight}}
[[Human weight]] varies extensively both individually and across populations, with the most extreme documented examples of adults being [[Lucia Zarate]] who weighed {{convert|4.7|lb|kg}}, and [[Jon Brower Minnoch]] who weighed {{convert|1,400|lb|kg}}, and with population extremes ranging from {{convert|109.3|lb|kg}} in [[Bangladesh]] to {{convert|192.7|lb|kg}} in [[Micronesia]].&lt;ref name='2009-09-24 TT'&gt;{{cite news | first = Tom | last = Chivers | title = Human extremes: the tallest, shortest, heaviest and lightest people ever | date = 2009-09-24 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6226095/Human-extremes-the-tallest-shortest-heaviest-and-lightest-people-ever.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='2012-06-21 TT'&gt;{{cite news | first = Conrad | last = Quilty-Harper |author2=Andrew Blenkinsop |author3=David Kinross |author4=Dan Palmer  | title = The world's fattest countries: how do you compare? | date = 2012-06-21 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/9345086/The-worlds-fattest-countries-how-do-you-compare.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organs====
Adult [[brain size]] varies from {{convert|974.9|cm3|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1498.1|cm3|abbr=on}} in females and {{convert|1052.9|cm3|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1498.5|cm3|abbr=on}} in males, with the average being {{convert|1130|cm3|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1260|cm3|abbr=on}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="refCosgrove"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cosgrove| first = KP|author2=Mazure CM|author3=Staley JK| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006322307001989| title = Evolving Knowledge of Sex Differences in Brain Structure, Function and Chemistry| year = 2007| journal = Biol Psychiatry| volume = 62| pages = 847–55| pmid = 17544382| doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.03.001| issue = 8| pmc = 2711771}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="refAllen"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Allen| first = JS|author2=Damasio H |author3=Grabowski TJ | title = Normal neuroanatomical variation in the human brain: An MRI-volumetric study| journal = Am J Phys Anthropol| year = 2002| volume = 118| pages = 341–58 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.10092| url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/96515947/abstract | pmid = 12124914 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right [[cerebral hemisphere]] is typically larger than the left, whereas the [[cerebellar hemispheres]] are typically of more similar size.

Size of the human [[stomach]] varies significantly in adults, with one study showing volumes ranging from {{convert|520|cm3|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1536|cm3|abbr=on}} and weights ranging from {{convert|77|g}} to {{convert|453|g}}.&lt;ref name='Cox 1945'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Variations in size of the human stomach | journal = California and Western Medicine | year = 1945 | first = Alvin J. | last = Cox | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 267–268 | id =  | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1473711/pdf/calwestmed00012-0041.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2013-05-26 | pmid=18747178 | pmc=1473711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic===
{{main|Human physical appearance|physical attractiveness}}
[[Beauty#Human beauty|Human beauty]] and [[physical attractiveness]] have been preoccupations throughout history which often intersect with anthropometric standards. [[Cosmetology]], [[facial symmetry]], and [[waist–hip ratio]] are three such examples where measurements are commonly thought to be fundamental.

==Evolutionary science==
Anthropometric studies today are conducted to investigate the evolutionary significance of differences in body proportion between populations whose ancestors lived in different environments. Human populations exhibit climatic variation patterns similar to those of other large-bodied mammals, following [[Bergmann's rule]], which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to be larger than ones in warm climates, and [[Allen's rule]], which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to have shorter, stubbier limbs than those in warm climates.

On a microevolutionary level, anthropologists use anthropometric variation to reconstruct small-scale population history. For instance, John Relethford's studies of early 20th-century anthropometric data from Ireland show that the geographical patterning of body proportions still exhibits traces of the invasions by the English and Norse centuries ago.

Similarly, anthropometric indices, namely comparison of the [[human stature]] was used to illustrate anthropometric trends. This study was conducted by [[Jörg Baten]] and Sandew Hira and was based on the anthropological founds that [[human height]] is predetermined by the [[Nutrition|quality of the nutrition]], which used to be higher in the more developed countries. The research was based on the datasets for [[Southern Chinese]] contract migrants who were sent to [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]] and included 13,000 individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |title=ANTHROPOMETRIC TRENDS IN SOUTHERN CHINA,1830–1864 |journal=Australian Economic History Review |date=November 2008 |volume=Vol. 48 |issue=No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Measuring instruments==

===3D body scanners===
Today anthropometry can be performed with [[3D body scanning|three-dimensional scanners]]. A global collaborative study to examine the uses of three-dimensional scanners for health care was launched in March 2007. The Body Benchmark Study will investigate the use of three-dimensional scanners to calculate volumes and segmental volumes of an individual body scan. The aim is to establish whether the [[Body volume index|Body Volume Index]] has the potential to be used as a long-term computer-based anthropometric measurement for health care. In 2001 the UK conducted the largest sizing survey to date using scanners. Since then several national surveys have followed in the UK's pioneering steps, notably SizeUSA, SizeMexico, and SizeThailand, the latter still ongoing. SizeUK showed that the nation had become taller and heavier but not as much as expected. Since 1951, when the last women's survey had taken place, the average weight for women had gone up from 62 to 65&amp;nbsp;kg. However, recent research has shown that posture of the participant significantly influences the measurements taken&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Simeon|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|title=Scan posture definition and hip girth measurement: the impact on clothing design and body scanning|journal=Ergonomics|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1123-1136|doi=10.1080/00140139.2016.1251621|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00140139.2016.1251621|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the precision of 3D body scanner may or may not be high enough for industry tolerances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=GIll|first2=Simeon|last3=Hayes|first3=Steven G.|title=3D Body Scanning has Suitable Reliability: An Anthropometric Investigation for Garment Construction|journal=Proc. of 3DBODY.TECH 2017 - 8th Int.

Despite these current limitations, 3D Body Scanning has been suggested as a replacement for body measurement prediction technologies which (despite the great appeal) have yet to be as reliable as real human data. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Januszkiewicz|first1=Monika|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Hayes|first3=Steven G.|last4=Gill|first4=Simeon|title=Online Virtual Fit Is Not Yet Fit For Purpose: An Analysis Of Fashion e-Commerce Interfaces|journal=Proc. of 3DBODY.TECH 2017 - 8th Int.

===Baropodographic===
{{main|Baropodography}}
[[File:example insole pressure device.jpg|thumb|Example insole (in-shoe) foot pressure measurement device]]
Baropodographic devices fall into two main categories: (i) [[:File:example foot pressure measurement device.jpg|floor-based]], and (ii) [[:File:example insole pressure device.jpg|in-shoe]]. The underlying technology is diverse, ranging from [[piezoelectric sensor]] arrays to [[light refraction]],&lt;ref name="Lord1981"&gt;Lord M 1981. Foot pressure measurement: a review of methodology.

Phys Ther 80 399-409.&lt;/ref&gt; but the ultimate form of the data generated by all modern technologies is either a 2D image or a 2D image [[time series]] of the pressures acting under the plantar surface of the foot. From these data other variables may be calculated (see ''[[Pedobarography#Data analysis|data analysis]].'')

The spatial and temporal resolutions of the images generated by commercial pedobarographic systems range from approximately 3 to 10&amp;nbsp;mm and 25 to 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, respectively. Sensor technology limits finer resolution. Such resolutions yield a [[contact area]] of approximately 500 sensors (for a typical adult human foot with surface area of approximately 100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Britane2004"&gt;Birtane M, Tuna H 2004.

===Neuroimaging===
{{see also|Neuroimaging}}
Direct measurements involve examinations of brains from corpses, or more recently, imaging techniques such as [[MRI]], which can be used on living persons. Such measurements are used in research on [[neuroscience and intelligence]]. Brain volume data and other craniometric data are used in mainstream science to compare modern-day animal species and to analyze the evolution of the human species in archeology.

==Epidemiology and medical anthropology==
Anthropometric measurements also have uses in [[epidemiology]] and [[medical anthropology]], for example in helping to determine the relationship between various body measurements (height, weight, percentage body fat, etc.) and medical outcomes.  Anthropometric measurements are frequently used to diagnose [[malnutrition]] in resource-poor clinical settings.

==Forensics and criminology==

Forensic anthropologists study the human skeleton in a legal setting. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of a decedent through various skeletal analyses that produce a biological profile. Forensic anthropologists utilize the [[Fordisc]] program to help in the interpretation of craniofacial measurements in regards to ancestry or race determination.

One part of a biological profile is a person's racial or ancestral affinity. People with significant European or Middle Eastern ancestry generally have relatively no{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2016}} [[prognathism]]; a relatively long and narrow face; a prominent brow ridge that protrudes forward from the forehead; a narrow, tear-shaped nasal cavity; a "silled" nasal aperture; tower-shaped nasal bones; a triangular-shaped palate; and an angular and sloping eye orbit shape. People with considerable African ancestry typically have a broad and round nasal cavity; no dam or nasal sill; Quonset hut-shaped nasal bones; notable facial projection in the jaw and mouth area (prognathism); a rectangular-shaped palate; and a square or rectangular eye orbit shape. A relatively small prognathism often characterizes people with considerable East Asian ancestry; no nasal sill or dam; an oval-shaped nasal cavity; tent-shaped nasal bones; a horseshoe-shaped palate; and a rounded and non-sloping eye orbit shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redwoods.edu/Instruct/AGarwin/anth_6_ancestry.htm Forensic Anthropology - Ancestry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206061745/http://www.redwoods.edu/instruct/agarwin/anth_6_ancestry.htm |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these characteristics are only a matter of frequency among particular races: their presence or absence of one or more does not automatically classify an individual into a racial group.

==Ergonomics==
{{main|Human factors and ergonomics}}
Today, ergonomics professionals apply an understanding of human factors to the design of equipment, systems and working methods to improve comfort, health, safety, and productivity. This includes [[physical ergonomics]] in relation to human anatomy, physiological and bio mechanical characteristics; [[cognitive ergonomics]] in relation to perception, memory, reasoning, motor response including [[human–computer interaction]], mental workloads, decision making, skilled performance, human reliability, work stress, training, and user experiences; organizational ergonomics in relation to metrics of communication, crew resource management, work design, schedules, teamwork, [[Participatory Ergonomics|participation]], community, cooperative work, new work programs, virtual organizations, and telework; environmental ergonomics in relation to human metrics affected by climate, temperature, pressure, vibration, and light; visual ergonomics; and others.&lt;ref name="IEA def"&gt;International Ergonomics Association.

{{main|Biometrics}}

Biometrics refers to the identification of humans by their characteristics or traits. Biometrics is used in computer science as a form of identification and [[access control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/info.html |title=Biometrics: Overview |publisher=Biometrics.cse.msu.edu |date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107071003/http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/info.html |archivedate=2012-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under [[surveillance]]. Biometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals.&lt;ref name="JainA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jain A. |author2=Hong L. |author3=Pankanti S. | year = 2000 | title = Biometric Identification | url = http://helios.et.put.poznan.pl/~dgajew/download/PUT/SEMESTR_10/IO/FACE_RECOGNITION/BiometricsACM.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 91–98 | doi = 10.1145/328236.328110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics.&lt;ref name=Jain1&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jain| first = Anil K.| last2 = Ross| first2 = Arun| title = Handbook of Biometrics| publisher = Springer| editor-last = Jain| editor-first = AK| editor2-last = Flynn| editor2-first =| editor3-last = Ross| editor3-first = A| year = 2008| chapter = Introduction to Biometrics| pages = 1–22| url = https://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-1-4419-4375-0| isbn = 978-0-387-71040-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Example applications include [[dermatoglyphics]] and [[soft biometrics]].

==United States military research==
The US Military has conducted over 40 anthropometric surveys of U.S. Military personnel between 1945 and 1988, including the 1988 Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR) of men and women with its 240 measures.  Statistical data from these surveys encompasses over 75,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assist.daps.dla.mil/docimages/0000/40/29/54083.PD0  U.S. Military personnel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016064120/http://assist.daps.dla.mil/docimages/0000/40/29/54083.PD0 |date=October 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource Project—CAESAR==
CAESAR began in 1997 as a partnership between government and industry to collect and organize the most extensive sampling of consumer body measurements for comparison. The project collected and organized data on 2,400 U.S. &amp; Canadian and 2,000 European civilians and a database was developed. This database records the anthropometric variability of men and women, aged 18–65, of various weights, ethnic groups, gender, geographic regions, and socio-economic status. The study was conducted from April 1998 to early 2000 and included three scans per person in a standing pose, full-coverage pose and relaxed seating pose. Data collection methods were standardized and documented so that the database can be consistently expanded and updated. High-resolution measurements of body surfaces were made using 3D Surface Anthropometry. This technology can capture hundreds of thousands of points in three dimensions on the human body surface in a few seconds. It has many advantages over the old measurement system using tape measures, anthropometers, and other similar instruments. It provides detail about the surface shape as well as 3D locations of measurements relative to each other and enables easy transfer to Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or Manufacturing (CAM) tools. The resulting scan is independent of the measurer, making it easier to standardize. Automatic landmark recognition (ALR) technology was used to extract anatomical landmarks from the 3D body scans automatically. Eighty landmarks were placed on each subject. More than 100 univariate measures were provided, over 60 from the scan and approximately 40 using traditional measurements. Demographic data such as age, ethnic group, gender, geographic region, education level, and present occupation, family income and more were also captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/standardsdev/tsb/cooperative/caefact.htm|title=CAESAR Fact Sheet|website=www.sae.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinette, Kathleen M, Daanen, Hein A M, Precision of the CAESAR scan-extracted measurements, Applied Ergonomics, vol 37, issue 3, May 2007, pp. 259–265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion design==
Scientists working for private companies and government agencies conduct anthropometric studies to determine a range of sizes for clothing and other items. Measurements of the foot are used in the manufacture and sale of [[footwear]]: measurement devices may be used either to determine a retail shoe size directly (e.g. the [[Brannock Device]]) or to determine the detailed dimensions of the foot for custom manufacture (e.g. [[ALINEr]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goonetilleke, R. S., Ho, Edmond Cheuk Fan, and So, R. H. Y. (1997). "Foot Anthropometry in Hong Kong". ''Proceedings of the ASEAN 97 Conference'', Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 1997. pp. 81–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture ==
In art [[Yves Klein]] termed his performance paintings '''anthropometries''', where he covered nude women with paint and used their bodies as paintbrushes.

'''Applied linguistics''' is an interdisciplinary field of linguistics which identifies, investigates, and offers solutions to language-related real-life problems. Some of the academic fields related to applied [[linguistics]] are [[education]], [[psychology]], [[Communication studies|communication research]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]].

{{Linguistics}}

== Domain ==
Applied linguistics is an [[interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary field]] of linguistics. Major branches of applied linguistics include [[bilingualism]] and [[multilingualism]], [[conversation analysis]], [[contrastive linguistics]], [[Sign language#Linguistics of sign|sign linguistics]], [[language assessment]], [[literacy|literacies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[language pedagogy]], [[second language acquisition]], [[language planning]] and [[language policy|policy]], [[interlinguistics]], [[stylistics (literature)|stylistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[forensic linguistics]] and [[translation]].

== Journals ==
Major journals of the field include ''Annual Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]'', ''Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''International Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''International Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''European Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''Issues in Applied Linguistics'', ''[[Language Learning (journal)|Language Learning]]'', ''Language and Education, TESOL Quarterly'', and ''Linguistics and Education''.

== History ==
The tradition of applied linguistics established itself in part as a response to the narrowing of focus in linguistics with the advent in the late 1950s of [[generative linguistics]], and has always maintained a socially-accountable role, demonstrated by its central interest in language problems.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies &amp; Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the field of applied linguistics started from Europe and the United States, the field rapidly flourished in the international context.

Applied linguistics first concerned itself with principles and practices on the basis of linguistics. In the early days, applied linguistics was thought as “linguistics-applied” at least from the outside of the field. In the 1960s, however, applied linguistics was expanded to include language assessment, [[language policy]], and second language acquisition. As early as the 1970s, applied linguistics became a problem-driven field rather than [[theoretical linguistics]], including the solution of language-related problems in the real world. By the 1990s, applied linguistics had broadened including critical studies and multilingualism. Research in applied linguistics was shifted to  "the theoretical and empirical investigation of real world problems in which language is a central issue."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Brumfit. How applied linguistics is the same as any other science, "International Journal of Applied Linguistics", 7(1), 86-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, applied linguistics also began narrowly as the application of insights from structural linguistics—first to the teaching of English in schools and subsequently to second and foreign language teaching. The ''linguistics applied'' approach to language teaching was promulgated most strenuously by [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who developed the foundation for the [[Army Specialized Training Program]], and by Charles C. Fries, who established the English Language Institute (ELI) at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1941. In 1946, Applied linguistics became a recognized field of studies in the aforementioned university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/applied-linguistics|title=Applied Linguistics {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the Research Club at Michigan established ''Language Learning: A Journal of Applied Linguistics'', the first journal to bear the term ''applied linguistics.'' In the late 1960s, applied linguistics began to establish its own identity as an interdisciplinary field of linguistics concerned with real-world language issues. The new identity was solidified by the creation of the American Association for Applied Linguistics in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Margie Berns and Paul Kei Matsuda. 2006. Applied linguistics: Overview and history. In K. Brown (Ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of language and linguistics'' (2nd ed.), 398-401.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==
The [[International Association of Applied Linguistics]] was founded in France in 1964, where it is better known as Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquée, or AILA. AILA has affiliates in more than thirty countries, some of which are listed below.

'''Australia'''
Australian applied linguistics took as its target the applied linguistics of mother tongue teaching and teaching English to immigrants. The Australia tradition shows a strong influence of continental Europe and of the USA, rather than of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies &amp; Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (ALAA) was established at a national congress of applied linguists held in August 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alaa.org.au/ | title = Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (home page) | date = September 2011 | publisher = Applied Linguistics Association of Australia | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALAA holds a joint annual conference in collaboration with the Association for Applied Linguistics in New Zealand (ALANZ).

'''Canada'''
The Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics / L’Association canadienne de linguistique appliquée (CAAL/ACLA), is an officially bilingual (English and French) scholarly association with approximately 200 members. They produce the ''Canadian Journal of Applied Linguistics'' and hold an annual conference.&lt;ref name="ACLA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics| url=http://www.aclacaal.org/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ireland'''
The [[Irish Association for Applied Linguistics]]/Cumann na Teangeolaíochta Feidhmí (IRAAL) was founded in 1975. They produce the journal ''Teanga'', the Irish word for 'language'.&lt;ref name="IRAAL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Association for Applied Linguistics| url=http://www.iraal.ie/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japan'''
In 1982, the Japan Association of Applied Linguistics (JAAL) was established in the Japan Association of College English Teachers (JACET) in order to engage in activities on a more international scale. In 1984, JAAL became an affiliate of the International Association of Applied Linguistics (AILA).[https://web.archive.org/web/20071103202550/http://www.jacet.org/about-e.html]

'''New Zealand'''
The Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand (ALANZ) produces the journal ''New Zealand Studies in Applied Linguistics'' and has been collaborating with the Applied Linguistics Association of Australia in a combined annual conference since 2010, with the Association for Language Testing and Assessment of Australia and New Zealand (ALTAANZ) later joining the now three-way conference collaboration.&lt;ref name="ALANZ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand| url=http://alanz.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''South Africa'''
The Southern African Applied Linguistics Association (SAALA) was founded in 1980. There are currently four publications associated with SAALA including the ''Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies Journal'' (SAJALS).&lt;ref name="SAALA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern African Applied Linguistics Association| url=http://www.saala.org.za/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''
The [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]] (BAAL) was established in 1967. Its mission is "the advancement of education by fostering and promoting, by any lawful charitable means, the study of language use, language acquisition and language teaching and the fostering of interdisciplinary collaboration in this study [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.baal.org.uk/constitution.pdf | title = British Association for Applied Linguistics constitution | at = Paragraph 3: "Objects" | work = Public Documents  | date = September 2011  | publisher = British Association for Applied Linguistics | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAAL hosts an annual conference, as well as many additional smaller conferences and events organised by its Special Interest Groups (SIGs). 

'''United States'''
The [[American Association for Applied Linguistics]] (AAAL) was founded in 1977. AAAL holds an annual conference, usually in March or April, in the United States or Canada.

The '''Areni-1 winery''' is a 6100-year-old [[winery]] that was discovered in 2007 in the [[Areni-1 cave complex]] in the village of [[Areni]] in the [[Vayots Dzor]] province of [[Armenia]] by a team of Armenian and Irish archaeologists. The excavations were carried out by Boris Gasparyan of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]]  and Ron Pinhasi from [[University College Cork]] (Ireland), and were sponsored by the Gfoeller Foundation (USA) and University College Cork. In 2008 the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) also joined the project with Gregory Areshian as co-director of the Areni Project. Since then the excavations have been sponsored by UCLA and the [[National Geographic Society]] as well. The excavations of the winery were completed in 2010.

The winery consists of [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] [[Barrel|vats]], a [[wine press]], storage jars, pottery sherds, and is believed to be at least a thousand years older than the winery unearthed in [[Judea and Samaria]] in 1963, which is the second oldest currently known.&lt;ref name= "LAT"&gt;Maugh II, Thomas H.

The [[Areni-1 shoe]] was found in the same cave in 2008.

==Discovery==
Excavations at the Areni-1 site began in 2007 and continued until September 2010. Armenian, American and Irish archaeologists fully unearthed a large, well-preserved 2-foot (60 centimeter) deep vat, along with a 3.5-foot (one meter) long basin made of clay and covered with [[malvidin]].&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; In addition to these discoveries grape seeds, remains of pressed grapes, prunes, walnuts, and desiccated vines were found. A number of drinking cups, found next to a set of ancient graves, were also excavated, suggesting that the site was used for funeral ceremonies and ritualistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Belluck, Pam.

==Analysis==
The results of the biochemical analysis of the residues from the bottom of the wine-press and the storage jars carried out by Hans Barnard and his colleagues at UCLA were published in the ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Hans et al. "[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/science/YJASC_2685.pdf Chemical evidence for wine production around 4000 BCE in the Late Chalcolithic Near Eastern highlands]." ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', (2010), {{doi|10.1016/j.jas.2010.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical analysis and [[radiocarbon]] tests carried out by researchers at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and [[Oxford University]] have revealed the date of the Areni-1 winery to around 4100 BC and 4000 BC or the [[Copper Age|Late Chalcolithic Period]].&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt; According to Areshian, the vintners used their feet to press the wine in the clay basin, the juice of which would then drain into the vat, where it would remain to [[Fermentation (wine)|ferment]] until being stored in jars.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; The capacity of the vat has been estimated to be about 14–15 gallons (US or imperial??) {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

According to Areshian, the discovery of the winery has provided greater insight to the study of [[horticulture]]. Patrick E. McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]], has likewise emphasized the importance of the discovery, describing it as "important and unique, because it indicates large-scale wine production, which would imply, I think, that the grape had already been domesticated."&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;

The exact identity of the people who lived in the region at the time is not known, although some researchers have postulated that they may have belonged to the [[Kura-Araxes culture|Kura-Araxes]] people and added that they may have been very involved in trade.&lt;ref name= "LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt;

'''''Aristotle's Masterpiece''''', also known as '''''The Works of Aristotle, the Famous Philosopher''''', is a [[sex manual]] and a [[midwifery]] book that was popular in England from the early modern period through to the 19th century. It was first published in 1684 and written by an unknown author who falsely claimed to be [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt; As a consequence the author is now described as a [[Pseudo-Aristotle]], the collective name for unidentified authors who masqueraded as Aristotle. It is claimed that the book was banned in Britain until the 1960s,&lt;ref name="ex-classics" /&gt; although there was no provision in the UK for "banning" books as such. However reputable publishers and booksellers might have been cautious about vending ''Aristotle's Masterpiece'', at least in the wake of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1857|1857 Obscene Publications Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Lesley A.|title=It wasn't 'banned', and it's hardly rare|url=http://lesleyahall.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/it-wasnt-banned-and-its-hardly-rare.html|publisher=Lesley A. Hall Blog|accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After [[Nicholas Culpeper]]'s ''Directory for Midwives'' had been published in 1651, other writers and booksellers sought to emulate its great success. ''Aristotle's Masterpiece'' was among the two dozen works in the genre which were published in the following decades. This was in sharp contrast to the three titles which had been published on the subject in the previous century. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the work was published in three different versions in 9, 20 and 78 editions respectively.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt; It was probably the most widely reprinted book on a medical subject in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;

===Versions===
The first version borrowed most of its content from two earlier works, the ''Secret Miracles of Nature'' by [[Levinus Lemnius]] and the anonymous ''Complete Midwives Practice Enlarged''. The latter had been a successful work by itself, coming second only to Culpeper's ''Directory for Midwives'' in number of seventeenth century editions.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt;

A second version was released by publisher [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] in 1697. The first half contained most of the first version and the second half was borrowed from John Sadler's ''A Sick Women's Private Looking-Glas'', which was published in 1636. The third version was published around 1710 was more different from the previous versions, but again copied material from other works on the subject. These included the ''Directory for Midwives'', John Pechey's 1698 version of the ''Compleate Midwive's Practice Enlarged'' and other popular books on sex and reproduction available at the time.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt;

The third version was still printed and sold to a general audience in the early twentieth century. It remained unchanged from the eighteenth century editions because modern theory on sexuality had not yet been conceived. Because the book was based on the ancient theory of [[humorism]] it provided some outdated information, in particular on the home remedies it prescribed. Nevertheless, it was in fact more accurate and less harmful than some popular works on sexuality dating from the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;

===Reasons for attribution to Aristotle===
The title of the work was possibly chosen because Aristotle was seen as a sex expert in early modern England. Another popular pseudo-Aristotelian text which covered sex and reproduction, ''Aristotle's Problems'' (1595), had been responsible for this reputation.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt; The real Aristotle had also written works about the reproduction of animals (such as ''[[History of Animals]]'' and ''[[Generation of Animals]]'') and was considered an authority on scientific matters in general.&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;

==Content==
The third version is divided in two parts. The first part covers anatomy, sexual intercourse and marriage. The second part was intended for married women and explains pregnancy and [[midwifery]].

The first part starts with a description of the male and female [[sex organ]]s in the first chapter. The second chapter advocates sexual intercourse in [[monogamy|monogamous]] relationships and warns against [[polygamy]] and [[adultery]] because it is forbidden by [[christianity|Christian]] doctrine. It finishes with an explanation of when the reproductive age begins and ends. The third chapter explores [[virginity]]. It correctly states that a torn [[hymen]] does not necessarily mean a woman is not a virgin.

The second part continues with the process of [[fertilisation]], pregnancy and how the sex of the fetus can be determined. The second chapter provides advice on how women can become pregnant. The third chapter describes the progress of pregnancy. Failure of the pregnancy, [[infertility]] and its causes are the subject of the fourth chapter. The part ends with a chapter on things women should do and avoid during their pregnancy.

'''Art &amp; Language''' is a [[conceptual art|conceptual artists']] collaboration that has undergone many changes since it was created in the late 1960s. The group was founded by artists who shared a common desire to combine intellectual ideas and concerns with the creation of art. The first issue of the group's journal, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]], was published in November 1969 in [[Chipping Norton]] in England, and was an important influence on conceptual art in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/art-language|title=Art &amp; Language {{!}} Artists {{!}} Lisson Gallery|website=www.lissongallery.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First years==

The ''Art &amp; Language'' group was founded around 1967 in the United Kingdom by [[Terry Atkinson]] (b. 1939), [[David Bainbridge (artist)|David Bainbridge]] (b. 1941), [[Michael Baldwin (artist)|Michael Baldwin]] (b. 1945) and [[Harold Hurrell]] (b. 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Neil Mulholland, ''The Cultural Devolution: art in Britain in the late twentieth century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, p165. {{ISBN|0-7546-0392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These four artists began their collaboration around 1966 while they were art teachers in [[Coventry]]. The name of the group was derived from their journal, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]], originally created as a work conversation in 1966. The group was critical of what was considered mainstream modern art practices at the time. In their work conversations, they created conceptual art as part of their discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/art-and-language|title=Art &amp; Language {{!}} Tate|website=www.tate.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1968 and 1982, the group grew to nearly fifty people. Among the first to join were critic and art historian, [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]], and artist [[Mel Ramsden]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Green, ''The Third Hand: Collaboration in Art from Conceptualism to Postmodernism'', UNSW Press, 2001, p47. {{ISBN|0-86840-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the early 1970s, individuals including [[Ian Burn]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Preston Heller]], [[Graham Howard]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Andrew Menard]], and [[Terry Smith (art historian)|Terry Smith]] joined the group. Two collaborators from Coventry, [[Philip Pilkington]] and [[David Rushton]], followed.
The relative degree of anonymity held within the group continues to have historical significance in the art community. Due to an uncertainty of the exact member lists, it is hard to know unequivocally not only who all of the contributors were but also what their exact contributions were.

The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leftmatrix.com/artlanguage.html|title=Art &amp; Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Volume 1, Number 1, May 1969) is subtitled ''The Journal of Conceptual Art''.  By the second issue (Volume 1, Number 2, February 1970), it became clear that there were conceptual art pieces and conceptual artists for whom and to whom the journal did not speak. In order to better encompass the purpose of the journal, the title was abandoned. Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]] had, however, brought to light the beginning of a new art movement. It was the first [[wikt:imprint|imprint]] to identify a public entity called ''[[Conceptual art|Conceptual Art]].'' The journal was the first of its kind to serve the theoretical and conversational interests of a community of artists and critics, who were also its producers and users. While that community was far from a unanimous agreement as to how to define the nature of conceptual art, the editors and most of its historic contributors shared similar opinions about other art movements. Conceptual art was critical of [[modernism]] for its bureaucracy and its historicism, and of [[minimalism]] for its philosophical conservatism. The practice of conceptual art, especially in its early years of origin, was primarily based on theory, and its form, predominately textual.

As the distribution of the journal and the teaching practices of the editors and others contributors expanded, the conversation grew to include more people. In England, by 1971, artists and critics including [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]], [[Philip Pilkington]], [[David Rushton]], [[Lynn Lemaster]], [[Sandra Harrison]], [[Graham Howard]] and [[Paul Wood (artist)|Paul Wood]] had joined. Around the same time in New York, [[Michael Corris]] joined, followed by [[Paula Ramsden]], [[Mayo Thompson]], [[Christine Kozlov]], Preston Heller, [[Andrew Menard]] and [[Kathryn Bigelow]].

The name ''Art &amp; Language'' remained precarious due to the various interpretations of both the many pieces of art and the purpose of the group. Its significance, or instrumentality, varied from person to person, alliance to alliance, discourse to discourse, and from those in New York who produced ''The Fox'' (1974–1976), for example, to those engaged in music projects and those who continued the Journal's edition. There was disagreement among members, and by 1976, there was a growing sense of divide that eventually led to competing individualities and varied concerns.

Throughout the 1970s, ''Art &amp; Language'' dealt with questions about art production and attempted a shift from conventional "nonlinguistic" forms of art, such as painting and sculpture, to more theoretically text-based works. The group often took argumentative positions against such prevailing views of critics like [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried]].
The ''Art &amp; Language'' group that exhibited in the international ''[[Documenta 5]]'' exhibitions of 1972 included Atkinson, Bainbridge, Baldwin, Hurrell, Pilkington, Rushton, and Joseph Kosuth, the American editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. The work consisted of a filing system of material published and circulated by ''Art &amp; Language'' members.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Bentkowska-Kafel, Trish Cashen, Hazel Gardiner, ''Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice'', Intellect Books, 2009, p104. {{ISBN|1-84150-248-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York Art &amp; Language==
Burn and Ramsden co-founded ''The Society for Theoretical Art'' and ''Analysis in New York'' in the late 1960s. They joined ''Art &amp; Language'' in 1970-71. ''New York Art &amp; Language'' became fragmented after 1975 because of disagreements concerning principles of collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Green, ''The Third Hand: Collaboration in Art from Conceptualism to Postmodernism'', UNSW Press, 2001, p48. {{ISBN|0-86840-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Beveridge]] and [[Carol Condé]], who had been peripheral members of the group in New York, returned to Canada where they worked with trade unions and community groups. In 1977, Ian Burn returned to Australia and Mel Ramsden to the United Kingdom.

==Late 1970s==

By the end of the 1970s, the group was essentially reduced to Baldwin, Harrison, and Ramsden with the occasional participation of [[Mayo Thompson]] and his group [[Red Crayola]]. The political analysis and development within the group resulted in several members leaving the group to work in more activist-oriented political occupations. Ian Burn returned to Australia, joining Ian Milliss, a conceptual artist who had begun work with trade unions in the early 1970s, in becoming active in Union Media Services, a design studio for social and community initiatives and the development of trade unions. Other members from the United Kingdom drifted off into a variety of creative, academic and sometimes "politicized" activities.

At the beginning of the 1970s, there were about thirty members. The ''Art &amp; Language'' group emphasized the use of language on the theory that language is the basis from which ideas and concepts are built. Their philosophy was that language permits index words which appear, disappear, and for some even persist, thus allowing viewers and artists alike to analyze the evolution of a word through the proposal of different definitions.

==Exhibitions and awards==
=== Awards and critics ===
In 1986, ''Art &amp; Language'' was nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].
In 1999, ''Art &amp; Language'' exhibited at [[MoMA PS1|PS1 MoMA]] in New York, with a major installation entitled ''The Artist Out of Work''. This was a recollection of ''Art &amp; Language''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s dialogical and other practices, curated by Michael Corris and Neil Powell. This exhibition closely followed the revisionist exhibition of ''Global Conceptualism: Points of Origin'' at the [[Queens Museum|Queens Museum of Art]], also in New York. The ''Art &amp; Language'' show at PS1 offered an alternative account of the antecedents and legacy of '"classic" conceptual art and reinforced a transatlantic rather than nationalistic version of events from 1968-1972. In a negative appraisal of the exhibition, [[art critic]] [[Jerry Saltz]] wrote, "A quarter century ago, 'Art &amp; Language' forged an important link in the genealogy of conceptual art, but next efforts have been so self-sufficient and obscure that their work is now virtually irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Saltz, ''Seeing out loud: the Voice art columns, fall 1998-winter 2003'', Geoffrey Young, 2003, p293. {{ISBN|1-930589-17-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Permanent collections ===
Other exhibits around the world include the works of Atkinson and Baldwin (working as ''Art &amp; Language'') held in the collection of the [[Tate]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2202&amp;page=1 tate.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Papers and works relating to ''New York Art &amp; Language'' are held at the [[Getty Research Institute]], Los Angeles. 

In March 2011, [[Philippe Méaille]] loaned 800 artworks of the ''Art &amp; Language'' collective to the [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art]], also known as MACBA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avui.cat/noticia/article/5-cultura/19-cultura/390089-un-tresor-al-macba.html?piwik_campaign=rss&amp;piwik_kwd=mesCultura Un tresor al Macba]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the [[:fr:Conseil départemental de Maine-et-Loire|Conseil départemental de Maine-et-Loire]] and Philippe Méaille signed a long term lease agreement for the [[Château de Montsoreau]] to promote contemporary art in the [[Loire Valley]].

==Theoretical installations==

''Art &amp; Language'' and the ''[[Jackson Pollock Bar]]'' collaborated for the first time in January 1995, during the ''Art &amp; Language &amp; Luhmann'' symposium, organized by the Contemporary Social Considerations Institute (Institut für Sozial Gegenwartsfragen) of Freiburg. The 3-day symposium saw the intervention of speakers including [[Catherine David]], who prepared the Documenta X, and [[Peter Weibl]], artist and curator. There was also a theoretical installation of a ''Art &amp; Language'' text produced in playback by the ''Jackson Pollock Bar''. The installation was interpreted by five German actors playing the roles of Jack Tworkow, Philip Guston, Harold Rosenberg, Robert Motherwell and Ad Reinhardt. Using [[lip sync]], the actors used pre-recorded text for a "New Conceptual" conversation. Ever since this collaboration, each new ''Art &amp; Language'' exhibition has been joined by a ''Jackson Pollock Bar'' theoretical installation.

The '''Association for Nutrition''' ('''AfN''') is the voluntary regulator for nutritionists and nutrition scientists in the United Kingdom.

The association is a [[Registered charity in England|registered charity]] and is custodian of the '''United Kingdom Voluntary Register of Nutritionists''' ('''UKVRN''')&lt;ref name="AFN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Association for Nutrition :: AfN Home|url=http://www.associationfornutrition.org/|publisher=Association for Nutrition|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its purpose is to "Protect and benefit the public by defining and advancing standards of evidence-based practice across the field of nutrition and at all levels within the workforce".

The Association for Nutrition and the UKVRN is acknowledged by Public Health England,&lt;ref&gt;[https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2014/10/16/how-to-become-a-registered-nutritionist/ "Public Health England - How to become a nutritionist"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; NHS Careers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/wider-healthcare-team/careers-in-the-wider-healthcare-team/clinical-support-staff/nutritionist/ "NHS Careers - Explore a career: Nutritionist"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; NHS Choices &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/find-a-registered-dietitian-or-nutritionist.aspx "NHS Choices - Find a Registered Nutritionist or Dietitian"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Careers Service &lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/nutritionist.aspx "National Careers Service - Job Profile for Nutritionists"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as the professional body for nutritionists in the UK.

The Chief Executive is Leonie Milliner.

==The register ==

All registrants on the UKVRN have had to provide evidence of their training and professional nutrition experience. They have also committed to abide by a Standard of Ethics, Conduct and Performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationfornutrition.org/default.aspx?tabid=76 "The UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists (UKVRN)"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three categories of UKVRN registrants, ''Registered Nutritionist (RNutr)'' with nutrition specialism in public health, nutrition science, sport &amp; exercise, food or animal nutrition, ''Registered Associate Nutritionist (ANutr)'' and ''Fellow of AfN (FAfN)''.

===Registered Associate Nutritionists ===

Registered Associate Nutritionists ([[post-nominal]]s: '''ANutr''') are recent graduates, who have been able to demonstrate a sound foundation of knowledge and understanding in nutrition science, and are working towards gaining sufficient experience within a specialist area to become a Registered Nutritionist (RNutr).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationfornutrition.org/Default.aspx?tabid=223 "Associate Nutritionist Description"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Registered Nutritionists ===

'''RNutr''' have been assessed as having demonstrated that they have met rigorously applied knowledge, understanding and practice core competencies. They commit to keeping their knowledge up to date and ensuring they follow evidence-based practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationfornutrition.org/Default.aspx?tabid=226 "Registered Nutritionist Description"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fellows of the Association for Nutrition ===

Fellows ('''FAfN''') have been Registered Nutritionists (RNutr) for at least five years and have been recognised by their peers to have made a significant and sustained contribution to the advancement of nutrition practice, research or education at a national or international level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationfornutrition.org/Default.aspx?tabid=230 "Fellowship of the AfN Description"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''[[Candidatus]]'' Atelocyanobacterium thalassa''' (previously '''cyanobacterium UCYN-A,''') is a [[species]] of [[cyanobacteria]] commonly found throughout the world's oceans.&lt;ref name=DOI10.1126science.1222700&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=A. W.|last2=Foster|first2=R. A.|last3=Krupke|first3=A.|last4=Carter|first4=B. J.|last5=Musat|first5=N.|last6=Vaulot|first6=D.|last7=Kuypers|first7=M. M. M.|last8=Zehr|first8=J.

Instead, it is found in a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with photosynthetic [[algae]]. ''A. thalassa'' [[nitrogen fixation|fixes nitrogen]] for the algae, while the algae provides carbon for ''A. thalassa'' through photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=UCSC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/09/symbiosis.html |accessdate=13 January 2017 |title=Unusual symbiosis discovered in marine microorganisms |publisher=University of California Santa Cruz Newscenter |date=20 September 2012 |author=Tim Stephens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''A. thalassa'' was first described in 1998 as a nitrogen-fixing bacteria with a much-reduced genome.&lt;ref name=UCSC/&gt; The microbe was originally given the name UCYN-A for "unicellular cyanobacteria group A".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jzehrlab.com/ucyn-a |title=Zehr Laboratory |accessdate=13 January 2017 |publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''A. thalassa'' was described to be in a symbiotic association with the unicellular algae ''[[Braarudosphaera bigelowii]]'' and ''[[Chrysochromulina parkeae]]''.&lt;ref name=DOI10.1126science.1222700/&gt;

==Biochemistry==
''A. thalassa'' lacks a variety of metabolic components common to cyanobacteria, including the oxygen-producing [[photosystem II]] complex of the [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic apparatus]], the [[carboxysome]], enzymes of the [[Calvin cycle|Calvin]] and [[tricarboxylic acid cycle|tricarboxylic acid]] cycles, as well as several enzymes involved in [[amino acid]] synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature08786 |author1=Tripp, H.

'''The Australian Animal Health Laboratory''' ''(AAHL)'' in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] is a high security laboratory, run by the [[CSIRO]] for exotic animal disease diagnosis and research. The lab is one of four [[Biosafety Level]]-4 labs in the country.

It opened in 1985 costing $185 million, built on [[Corio Oval]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/en/Organisation-Structure/National-Facilities/Australian-Animal-Health-Laboratory.aspx CSIRO: Geelong - Australian Animal Health Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 it delivered an experimental vaccine to help protect horses against the deadly Hendra virus. &lt;ref&gt;http://csironewsblog.com/2012/11/01/vaccine-arrives-to-boost-the-frontline-fight-against-hendra-virus/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Electro Chemical Research Institute''' is one of a chain of forty national laboratories under the aegis of the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR) in [[New Delhi]]. Founded on 25 July 1948 at [[Karaikudi]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], CECRI came into existence on the January 1953. During the last fifty years CECRI has been recognized as the premier institution for research and development in [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] science and technology not only in India but also in the South East Asia, with a total strength of over 600 personnel comprising scientists, engineers, technologists, skilled workers, administrative and other staff, with a combined laboratory space of {{convert|400000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. in a campus of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}. There are four extension centers for CECRI, located at [[Chennai]], [[Cochin]], [[Mandapam]] and [[Tuticorin]].

Major R&amp;D programs at CECRI are in the areas of [[corrosion]] science and engineering, industrial metal finishing, batteries (primary and secondary), [[electrometallurgy]], [[electropyrometallurgy]], [[electrochemicals]] (organic and inorganic), [[Materials Science]], and [[electrochemical instrumentation]] and [[pollution control]]. The programs are directed towards development of new processes or products or novel use of electrochemistry. Techniques, upgrading of the already developed technology, and [[basic research]] are carried out. An excellent library, computer center, workshop, and centralized characterization and measurement laboratory lend active support.

==Projects &amp; Patents==
Over the years, 755 patents have been filed, 250 processes have been developed and 140 sponsored projects and 110 grant-in-aid projects have been undertaken. More than 140 processes have been released to 525 licensees for commercial exploitation. The institute staff has published more than 5500 research papers including several review articles in both national and international journals of repute, edited several books and conference proceedings and maintained intimate contacts with the academic institutions within and outside the country. Recognition of contribution made by CECRI to Indian industry has come in the form of 50 major and minor awards. Direct earnings by the way of foreign exchange savings and energy efficient electrochemical technologies including corrosion prevention amount to about Rs.500 crores.

==Courses==
CECRI also conducts short term refresher courses for the benefit of industry and educational institutions, brings out journals ([[Bulletin Of Electrochemical]], Corrosion Update and Battery Newsletter) and runs a B.Tech. program (Chemical and Electrochemical engineering of [[Anna University]]). The institute is alive to societal obligations and actively participates in the [[Rural Science Forum]] (VPF), [[Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development]] (STED), and [[Swadeshi Science Movement]] (SSM) and [[Ambedkar Nagar]] in collaboration with other agencies.

===The B.Tech Program===
Centre For Education offers the unique 4-year/8-semester bachelor's degree programme in [[Chemical engineering|Chemical]] and [[Electrochemical Engineering]]. This is the World's first unique technology program in Chemical and Electrochemical engineering and also one among the best engineering disciplines in the entire Asian region. The course is conducted in a research atmosphere with scientists and specialized engineers as faculty members and with largest laboratory facilities available in the field of Chemical and Electrochemical Engineering. The curriculum of B.Tech program recognizes the profound challenges in Chemical and Electrochemical Engineering technology. In the first year, the students are introduced to basic [[engineering]] subjects, which lay a strong foundation for Chemical and Electrochemical engineering. During the second and Third year, the attention shifts to Chemical engineering aspects. At the end of third year, students participate in Industrial Internship programs. The final year of study concentrates on electrochemical science and technology and in addition, students undertake research and design projects. The Centre for Education also organizes yearly industrial visits for the students to get first hand experience in Industrial processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1166">'''Certified Broadcast Television Engineer''' (CBTE) is a title granted to an individual that successfully meets the experience and examination requirements of the certification. The certification is regulated by the [[Society of Broadcast Engineers]] (SBE). The CBTE title is protected by [[copyright]] laws. Individuals who use the title without consent from the Society of Broadcast Engineers could face legal action.

The SBE certifications were created to recognize individuals who practice in career fields which are not regulated by state licensing or [[Professional Engineering]] programs. Marine Radio and radar systems still require a [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) license apart from an SBE certification. Broadcast Engineering is regulated at the national level and not by individual states.

'''Climate Impacts Research Centre''' (CIRC) is a [[research institute]] based at the ''Department of ecology and environmental science'' (EMG) at [[Umeå University]], [[Sweden]], but primarily operative at [[Abisko Scientific Research Station]] which is run by the [[Swedish Polar Research Secretariat]].

== Research ==
The CIRC research is focused on increasing the knowledge about [[Arctic]] and [[alpine climate]] [[ecosystem]]s, for better understanding of [[climate]] related impacts on [[subarctic]] and arctic environments, both in [[terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]] (land based) and [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic ecosystems]].

Within the field of [[arctic ecology]] CIRC researchers conduct projects about how the [[tree line]] is affected by [[climate change]]; how [[reindeer]]s influence [[Fell]] vegetation, and the spread of fish species in lakes and watercourses – historically as well as in the light of recent climate change.

In [[biogeochemistry]] researchers study [[watercourse]]s in northern areas, as well as effects of thawing [[permafrost]] in the [[tundra]] and other [[alpine climate|alpine environments]], with regard to [[emission intensity|emissions]] of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]] to the [[atmosphere]] and [[export]] of [[carbon]] to coastal areas.

[[King Carl XVI Gustaf Professorship in Environmental Science]] 2017/18 was awarded to [[John Anderson (physiographist)|John Anderson]], professor in [[physical geography]] and [[paleolimnology]] at [[Loughborough University]] in the [[United Kingdom]], who will be [[visiting professor]] at CIRC these two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kungahuset.se/press/pressmeddelanden/2016/2016pressmeddelanden/innehavareavhmkonungensprofessurimiljovetenskaputsedd.5.186e1cb158b43194193d9.html |title=Innehavare av H.M.

=== Major research projects ===
In 2016 CIRC was granted 37 million SEK over five years by the [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]] for the project "Climate change induced regime shifts in northern lake ecosystems", with Jan Karlsson as principal investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research Projects 2016 |url=https://www.wallenberg.com/kaw/en/research/grants/research-projects-2016 |website=The Wallenberg Foundations |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wallenberg Academy Fellows ===
As of 2017 three young researchers at CIRC are also appointed Wallenberg Academy Fellows – a career programme, initiated by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation in close collaboration with five royal academies and sixteen universities in Sweden, that provides long-term funding for the most promising young researchers of all disciplines to develop their projects.

== Education ==
Since 2002 CIRC also gives education, like courses in ''Arctic ecology, Arctic geoecology'' and ''Fell ecology'', and a postgraduate program. CIRC is also connected to the international cooperative network [[University of the Arctic]].

== History ==
CIRC was founded in 1996 and now (2017) employs some 50 researchers; professors, [[assistant professor]]s, [[post doc]]s, [[doctoral student]]s and visiting professors. Most CIRC researchers are also affiliated to Arcum, [[Arctic Research Centre at Umeå University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcum.umu.se/english/affiliated-researchers/science-and-technology/ |title=Arcum - Affiliated Researchers - Science and Technology |date=2017-03-10 |publisher=Umeå University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

CIRC's first [[director (education)|science director]] was Reiner Giesler, professor in terrestrial ecology, who in 2015 was followed by Jan Karlsson, professor in physical geography with a specialization in aquatic biogeochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umu.se/forskning/popularvetenskap/forskarportratt/professorer-2012/jan-karlsson |title=Växthusgaser och produktivitet i akvatiska ekosystem |date=2017-03-10 |publisher=Umeå University |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coding bootcamps''' are intensive programs of [[software development]] which started in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/08/coding-bootcamps-are-replacing-computer-science-degrees/|title=Coding bootcamps are replacing computer science degrees|last=Choxi|first=Roshan|date=2015|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Coding bootcamps made their debut in 2011 with the Code Academy (now Starter League). Since then, many others have followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/what-hacker-apprenticeships-tell-us-about-the-future-of-education/251039/|title=What Hacker Apprenticeships Tell Us About the Future of Education|last=Moon|first=Joe|date=2012|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2017, there were 95 full-time coding bootcamp courses in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/in-2016-the-coding-bootcamp-bubble-is-bound-to-burst/|title=In 2016, The Coding Bootcamp Bubble Is Bound to Burst|last=Lapowsky|first=Issie|date=2016|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of courses typically ranges from between 8 to 36 weeks, with most lasting 10 to 12 (averaging 12.9) weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-2017|title=2017 Coding Bootcamp Market Size Study|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- I am thinking that these subheadings could probably be merged into a single paragraph, though I am not quite sure how at the moment. -TheSandDoctor --&gt;
=== Collaboration with higher education ===
Following the increased popularity of coding bootcamps, some universities have started their own intensive coding programs or partnered with existing private coding bootcamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/collaboration-in-higher-education-universities-coding-bootcamps|title=Collaboration in Higher Education: Universities + Coding Bootcamps|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online coding bootcamps ===
There are various online options for online bootcamps. Bootcamps usually match students with a mentor and are also generally cheaper and more accommodating to specific student needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2016-08-11/4-things-to-know-about-online-coding-boot-camps|title=4 Things to Know About Online Coding Boot Camps|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data science bootcamps and fellowships ===
Bootcamps that focus less on [[Solution stack|full stack development]] and more on producing [[Data science|data scientists]] and 
[[Information engineering|data engineers]] are known as data science bootcamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends/q-%22Data-Scientist%22-q-%22Data-Engineer%22.html|title="Data Scientist" and "Data Engineer" Job Trends|website=www.indeed.com|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tuition ==

Coding bootcamps can be part-time or online, they may be funded by employers or qualify for student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/29/edtechs-next-big-disruption-is-the-college-degree/|title=Edtech’s Next Big Disruption Is The College Degree|last=Skonnard|first=Aaron|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2017 market research report, tuition ranged from free to $21,000 for a course, with an average tuition of $11,874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-2017|title=2017 Coding Bootcamp Market Size Study|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Deferred Tuition" refers to a payment model in which students pay the school a percentage (18%-22.5%) of their salary for 1–3 years after graduation, instead of upfront tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/coding-bootcamp-deferred-tuition-income-share-agreements|title=Deferred Tuition|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, coding bootcamps can be free or a couple thousand euros per program. In contrast to formal university education, private offerings for training appear expensive. {{Citation needed|reason= Please cite|date=April 2018}}

On August 16, 2016, the US Department of Education announced up to $17 million in loans or grants for students to study with nontraditional training providers, including coding bootcamps.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-administration-to-fund-nontraditional-training-for-students-1471341782|title=Obama Administration to Fund Nontraditional Training for Students|last=Mitchell|first=Josh|date=2016-08-16|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These grants or loans will be administered through the pilot program, EQUIP which stands for Educational Quality through Innovation Partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-08-16-the-equip-eight-dept-of-ed-selects-partners-for-higher-education-experiment|title=The EQUIP Eight: Dept. of Ed Selects Partners for Higher Education Experiment (EdSurge News)|date=2016-08-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Programs must partner with an accredited college and third-party quality assurance entity (QAE) in order to receive federal financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/03/18/groups-seek-become-quality-reviewers-boot-camps-online-courses-and-other-noncollege|title=Groups seek to become quality reviewers of boot camps, online courses and other noncollege offerings|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In 2016, there were concerns that partnering private coding bootcamps with federal financial aid could attract less reputable organizations to create coding bootcamp programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2016/08/22/keep-coding-bootcamps-great-dont-give-them-taxpayer-money/#7821bb1350a0|title=Keep Coding Bootcamps Great: Don't Give Them Taxpayer Money|last=Cooper|first=Preston|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barriers to entry and exit mean established schools face less competition than in a free market, which can lead to deterioration of quality, and increase in prices. Also, problems within traditional university models could easily transfer to the university/bootcamp partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/16/colleges-partner-with-training-bootcamps-and-online-course-providers-for-federal-experiment/|title=Colleges partner with training boot camps and online course providers for federal experiment|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, others believe that enhancing policy around financial aid will help lower income prospective students attend. There are several sentiments of coding bootcamps being accessible only for the rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/06/are-coding-bootcamps-only-for-the-rich/|title=Are coding bootcamps only for the rich?|last=Pathak|first=Prasid|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ExplainingCaseControlSJW.jpg|thumb|Author: Kelidimari]]
In [[statistics]], [[marketing]]  and [[demography]], a '''cohort''' is a group of [[research subject|subjects]] who share a defining characteristic (typically subjects who experienced a common event in a selected time period, such as birth or graduation).

Cohort data can oftentimes be more advantageous to [[Demography|demographers]] than period data. Because cohort data is honed to a specific time period, it is usually more accurate. It is more accurate because it can be tuned to retrieve custom data for a specific study.

In addition, cohort data is not affected by [[tempo effect]]s, unlike period data. On the contrary; cohort data can be disadvantageous in the sense that it can take a long amount of time to collect the data necessary for the [[cohort study]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_CohortStudies/EP713_CohortStudies5.html|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Cohort Studies|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage of cohort studies is that it can be extremely costly to carry out, since the study will go on for a long period of time, demographers often require sufficient funds to fuel the study.

Demography often contrasts [[cohort perspective]]s and [[period perspective]]s. For instance, the total cohort [[fertility rate]] is an index of the average completed family size for cohorts of women, but since it can only be known for women who have finished child-bearing, it cannot be measured for currently fertile women. It can be calculated as the sum of the cohort's age-specific fertility rates that obtain as it ages through time. In contrast, the total period fertility rate uses current age-specific fertility rates to calculate the completed family size for a notional woman, were she to experience these fertility rates through her life.

A study on a cohort is a [[cohort study]].

Two important aspects of cohort studies are: 
# Prospective Cohort Study:  In this type of study, there is a collection of exposure data (baseline data) from the subjects recruited before development of the outcomes of interest. The subjects are then followed through time (future) to record when the subject develops the outcome of interest. Ways to follow-up with subjects of the study include: phone interviews, face-to-face interviews, physical exams, medical/laboratory tests, and mail questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_CohortStudies/EP713_CohortStudies_print.html|title=Cohort Studies|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a prospective cohort study is, for instance, if a demographer wanted to measure all the males births in the year 2018. The demographer would have to wait for the event to be over, the year 2018 must come to an end in order for the demographer to have all the necessary data.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statsref.com/HTML/index.html?cohort_studies2.html|title=Statistical Analysis Handbook|website=www.statsref.com|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Retrospective Cohort Study: Retrospective Studies start with subjects that are at risk to have the outcome or disease of interest and identifies the outcome starting from where the subject is when the study starts to the past of the subject to identify the exposure. Retrospective use records: clinical, educational, birth certificates, death certificates, etc. but that may be difficult because there may not be data for the study that is being initiated. These studies may have multiple exposures which may make this study difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_CohortStudies/EP713_CohortStudies_print.html|title=Cohort Studies|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an example of a retrospective cohort study is, if a demographer was examining a group of people born in year 1970 who have type 1 diabetes. The demographer would begin by looking at historical data. However, if the demographer was looking at ineffective data in attempts to deduce the source of type 1 diabetes, the demographers results would not be accurate.

'''Commensurability''' is a concept in the [[philosophy of science]] whereby [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]] are commensurable if scientists can discuss them using a shared [[nomenclature]] that allows direct comparison of theories to determine which theory is [[scientific realism|more valid or useful]].  On the other hand, theories are '''incommensurable''' if they are embedded in starkly contrasting [[Paradigm|conceptual frameworks]] whose languages do not overlap sufficiently to permit scientists to directly compare the theories or to cite [[empirical evidence]] favoring one theory over the other.  Discussed by [[Ludwik Fleck]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fleck/ Ludwik Fleck (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]; Fleck's term for incommensurability was "''niewspółmierność''".&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by [[Thomas Kuhn]] in the 1960s, the problem of incommensurability results in scientists talking past each other, as it were, while comparison of theories is muddled by confusions about terms, contexts and consequences.

== Introduction of the term ==

In 1962, [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]] both independently introduced the idea of incommensurability to the philosophy of science. In both cases the [[concept]] came from [[mathematics]] and in its original sense is defined as the absence of a common unit of measurement that would allow a direct and exact measurement of two [[variable (research)|variables]], such as the prediction of the [[diagonal]] of a [[square (geometry)|square]] from the relationship of its [[Edge (geometry)|sides]].

The term commensurability was coined because of a series of problems that both authors found when trying to interpret successive scientific [[theories]]. Without doubt its implementation is better understood thanks to the critiques that both Kuhn and Feyerabend have made in response to certain [[thesis|theses]] proposed by followers of the [[received view of theories]]. These include the famous ''thesis on the accumulation of scientific knowledge'', which states that the body of [[scientific knowledge]] has been increasing with the passage of time. Both Kuhn and Feyerabend reject this thesis, in favor of a [[scientific modelling|model]] that sees both [[Paradigm shift|revolutions]] and periods of [[Normal science|normalcy]] in the [[history of science]].

Another equally important thesis proposes the existence of a [[standard language|neutral language]] of comparison which can be used to formulate the [[empiricism|empirical consequences]] of two competing theories. This would allow one to choose the theory with the greatest empirically verified contents or explanatory powers &amp;ndash; or the greatest content that is not falsified if the formulation is [[Karl Popper|Popperian]].

The idea at the root of this second thesis does not just relate to the existence of said language but also implies at least two further postulates.{{original research inline|date=March 2015}} Firstly, this choice between theories presupposes that they can be intertranslated, for example between theory A and its successor B – and in the case of Popper that B can be deduced from A. Secondly, it is assumed that the choice is always carried out under the same standards of [[rationality]].

In both cases the concept of incommensurability makes the viability of the thesis impossible. In the first, by showing that certain empirical consequences are lost between successive theories. In the second case, by confirming that it is possible to make a rational choice between theories even when they can not be translated into a neutral language. However, although the reasons for the introduction of these counter arguments, and the criticism from which they arise, are the same, the sense in which the coauthors use them are in no way identical. For this reason the idea of incommensurability will be discussed for each coauthor separately.

== Perspectives ==

=== Feyerabend's perspectives ===
Feyerabend locates incommensurability within a principle from the field of [[semantics]] which has the underlying idea that the change in significance in the basic terms of a theory changes the totality of the terms of the new theory, so that there are no empirically common meanings between T and T'.

Feyerabend is credited with coining the modern philosophical sense of "incommensurability,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Bas Van Fraassen|Van Fraassen]], Bas. ''The Empirical Stance''. Yale UP: 2002. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberheim and Hoyningen-Huene. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incommensurability/#FeyRouInc "The Incommensurability of Scientific Theories"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. "...he had developed his notion of the incommensurability of scientific theories more than ten years prior to the appearance of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)"&lt;/ref&gt; which lays the foundation for much of his philosophy of science. He first presented his notion of incommensurability in 1952 to [[Karl Popper]]'s [[London School of Economics]] seminar and to a gathering of illustrious Wittgensteinians ([[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Peter Geach]], [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]) in [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Anscombe's]] Oxford flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/|title = Paul Feyerabend |accessdate=4 February 2012|author = Preston, John|date = 1 June 2009|publisher = [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend argued that frameworks of thought, and thus [[scientific paradigm]]s, can be incommensurable for three reasons. Briefly put, Feyerabend's notion of incommensurability is as follows:
# The interpretation of observations is implicitly influenced by theoretical assumptions. It is therefore impossible to describe or evaluate observations independently of theory.
# Paradigms often have different assumptions about which intellectual and operational scientific methods result in valid scientific knowledge.
# Paradigms can be based on different assumptions regarding the structure of their domain, which makes it impossible to compare them in a meaningful way. The adoption of a new theory includes and is dependent upon the adoption of new terms. Thus, scientists are using different terms when talking about different theories. Those who hold different, competing theories to be true will be talking over one another, in the sense that they cannot a priori arrive at agreement given two different discourses with two different theoretical language and dictates.

According to Feyerabend, the idea of incommensurability cannot be captured in [[formal logic]], because it is a phenomenon outside of logic's domain.

==== Theories ====
In 1989, Feyerabend presented an idea informed by Popper's [[critical rationalism]] whereby "investigation starts with a problem. The problem is the result of a conflict between an expectation and an observation, which, in its turn, is formed by the expectation." (Feyerabend, 1989; pp.&amp;nbsp;96). [[Scientific method]]ology then resolves problems by inventing theories that should be relevant and falsifiable, at least to a greater degree than any other alternative solution. Once an alternative theory is presented the critical phase commences regarding T' which must answer the following questions: (a) why has theory T been successful up until now and (b) why has it failed. If the new theory T' answers both questions then T is discarded.

That is, a new theory T', in order to be an adequate successor to the refuted theory T, must have a collection of additional predictions regarding T (Class A), as well as a collection of successful predictions that coincide to a certain degree with the old theory (Class S). These Class S predictions constitute those parts of the new theory containing new truths and they therefore exclude a series of consequences of T, the failures in the old theory, which are part of the untrue (false) contents of the new theory (Class F).

Given this model it is possible to construct [[Relational theory|relational statements]] between certain terms from T and from T', which will be the basis for the comparison between the theories. This will allow a choice between the two in the light of their empirical contents. But, if we come across a theory T' in which Class S is empty then the theories are incommensurable with each other.

However, Feyerabend clarifies this by stating that, incommensurability between T and T' will depend on the interpretation given to the theories. If this is instrumental, every theory that refers to the same language of [[observation]] will be commensurable. In the same way, if a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] perspective is sought then it will favour a unified position which employs the most highly abstracted terms of whatever theory is being considered in order to describe both theories, giving a significance to the observational statements as a function of these terms, or, at least to replace the habitual use they are given.

It can be noted that the instrumentalist interpretation recognizes the existence of certain statements whose truth is not only dependent on the observational statements but also on the evaluation criteria they are subjected to, which are anchored in the theories. For example, to afirm the relational character of [[longitude]], this asseveration can not be decided solely using observational terms. Its truth value, in part, depends on the theory that establishes the sense in which the terms are used. In this case they relate to [[quantum mechanics]] (QM) as opposed to [[classical mechanics]] (CM). In this sense, the instrumentalist position only deals with the empirical consequences and leaves to one side the relationship that the concepts have with each other.

In this same way Feyerabend comments that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13238504|title=Philosophical papers|last=Feyerabend|first=Paul|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=0521316421|edition=1st|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=13238504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is certain, of course, that the relativist scheme has very often given us numbers that are practically identical to the numbers obtained from CM, but this does not mean that the concepts are very similar...[For] even if ...yielding strictly identical predictions can be used as an argument to show that the concepts must match, at least in this case, different magnitudes based on different concepts can give identical values for their respective scales while being different magnitudes...[So] it is not possible to make a comparison of the contents, nor is it possible to make a judgement regarding its verisimilitude.|[[Paul Feyerabend]]}}

==== Realist objections ====

In relation to realist objections, Feyerabend returns to an [[argument]] elaborated by [[Carnap]] and comments that the use of such abstract concepts leads to an impossible position, as "...theoretical terms receive their interpretation by being connected with an observational language and those terms are empty without that connection." (Feyerabend, pp.&amp;nbsp;373). As before it follows that they can not be used to confer significance to the observational language as this observational language is its only source of significance, with which it is not possible to make a translation but only a restatement of the term.

Therefore, Feyerabend considers that both the instrumentalist and the realist interpretations are flawed, as they try to defend the idea that incommensurability is a legitimately unsolvable idea with which to revoke the theses of the accumulation of knowledge and [[panrationalism]] in science. 
 
This leads to the following consideration: if each new theory has its own observational basis, within the meaning of the theoretical framework, how can we hope that the observations that are produced could eventually refute it. Furthermore, how can we actually recognize that the new position explains what it is supposed to explain or if it is deviating off into other areas and therefore how can the theories be definitively compared.

Feyerabend's answer to the first consideration lies in noting that the initial terms of a theory depend on the postulates of the theory and their associated grammatical rules, in addition, the predictions derived from the theory also depend on the underlying conditions of the system. Feyerabend doesn't explore the point further, but it can be assumed that if the prediction does not agree with the observation and if we have a high degree of confidence in the description that we have made from the initial [[material conditional|conditions]] than we can be sure that the error must be present in our theory and in its underlying terms. 
 
In dealing with the second consideration Feyerabend asks "why should it be necessary to have a [[terminology]] that allows us to say that two theories refer to the same experiment. This supposes a unificationist or possibly a realist aspiration, whose objective appears to be the truth, however, it is assumed that the theory can be compared under a criterion of empirical adequacy. Such an approach would build on the relationship established between the observational statement that describes the outcome of an experiment formulated for each theory independently, which is compared with the predictions that each theory posits. In this way the selection is made when a theory is an empirically better fit. If the objection to the possible deviation of the new theory is not answered it is irrelevant as often history has shown that in fact differing points of view change or modify their fields of application, for example the physics of [[Aristotle]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]."

==== Theory selection ====
{{See also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
The above implies that the process of choosing between theories does not obey a universal rationality. Feyerabend has the following view regarding whether the absence of a universal rationality constitutes an irrational position:

{{quote|No, because each individual event is rational in the sense that some of its features can be explained by reasons that are or were accepted at the time in which they occurred, or that were invented in the course of their development. Yes, because even these local reasons, which change over time, are not sufficient to explain all the important features of a particular event.|[[Paul Feyerabend]]|source={{citation needed|date=April 2016}}}}

Feyerabend uses this reasoning to try to shed light on one of Popper's arguments, which says that we are always able to change any statement, even those reference systems that guide our critical thinking. However, the two thinkers reach different conclusions, Popper assumes that it is always possible to make a criticism once the new criteria have been accepted, so the selection can be seen as the result of a rationality "''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]''" to the selection. While, Feyerabend's position is that this solution is merely a verbal ornament whenever the standards are influenced by Popper's first world, the physical world, and they are not just developed in the third world. That is, the standards are influenced by the expectations of their originators, the stances they imply and the ways of interpreting the world they favour, but this is strictly analogous to the same process of the scientific revolution, that leads us to believe that the thesis of incommensurability can also be applied to standards, as is shown by the following asseveration:

{{quote|Even the most puritanical rationalist will be forced to stop arguing and use propaganda, for example, not because some of their arguments have become invalid, but because the psychological conditions have disappeared that allowed effective argument and therefore influence over the others|[[Paul Feyerabend]]|source={{citation needed|date=April 2016}}}}

Feyerabend states that the Popperian criticism is either related to certain clearly defined procedures, or is totally abstract and leaves others with the task of fleshing it out later with specific contents, making Popper's rationality a "mere verbal ornament." This does not imply that Feyerabend is an [[irrationalist]] but that he considers that the process of scientific change can not be explained in its totality in the light of some rationality, precisely because of incommensurability.

=== Kuhn's perspectives ===
The second coauthor of the thesis of incommensurability is [[Thomas Kuhn]], who introduced it in his 1962 book, ''[[The structure of scientific revolutions]]'', in which he describes it as a universal property that defines the relationship between successive [[paradigm]]s. Under this meaning incommensurability goes beyond the field of semantics and covers everything relating to its practical application, from the study of problems to the associated methods and rules for their resolution. However, the meaning of the term was continually refined throughout Kuhn's work, he first placed it within the field of semantics and applied a narrow definition, but later he redefined it in a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] sense, wherein changes are found in the relationships between similarities and differences that the subjects of a defining matrix draw over the world.

In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn wrote that "the historian of science may be tempted to exclaim that when paradigms change, the world itself changes with them".&lt;ref name=SSR/&gt;{{rp|111}} According to Kuhn, the proponents of different scientific paradigms cannot fully appreciate or understand the other's point of view because they are, as a way of speaking, living in different worlds. Kuhn gave three reasons for this inability:
# Proponents of competing paradigms have different ideas about the importance of solving various scientific problems, and about the standards that a solution should satisfy.
# The vocabulary and problem-solving methods that the paradigms use can be different: the proponents of competing paradigms utilize a different conceptual network.
# The proponents of different paradigms see the world in a different way because of their scientific training and prior experience in research.

In a postscript (1969) to ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn added that he thought that incommensurability was, at least in part, a consequence of the role of [[similarity sets]] in normal science. Competing paradigms group concepts in different ways, with different similarity relations. According to Kuhn, this causes fundamental problems in communication between proponents of different paradigms. It is difficult to change such categories in one's mind, because the groups have been learned by means of exemplars instead of definitions. This problem cannot be resolved by using a neutral language for communication, according to Kuhn, since the difference occurs prior to the application of language.

Kuhn's thinking on incommensurability was probably in some part influenced by his reading of [[Michael Polanyi]] who held that there can be a logical gap between belief systems and who also said that scientists from different schools, "think differently, speak a different language, live in a different world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1008553295|title=Personal knowledge : towards a post-critical philosophy|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780203442159|location=London|pages=151|oclc=1008553295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phases ====

Given his changing definition of incommensurability Pérez Ransanz has identified three phases in Kuhn's work, or at least in how it deals with this concept. As we have seen above the first phase was seen in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (SSR) and it is characterized by an overall vision that is applied to paradigms. This perspective was replaced in the 1970s by a localist and semanticist vision in which incommensurability is now defined as the relationship between two theories that are articulated in two languages that are not completely interchangeable, as Kuhn states in the following extract:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/756577696|title=The structure of scientific revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=|others=Hacking, Ian,|year=|isbn=9780226458113|edition= Fourth|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=756577696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The phrase "without common measure" is converted into "without common language". To state that two theories are incommensurable means that there is no neutral language, or other type of language, into which both theories, conceived as sets of statements, can be translated without remainder or loss... [Although] the majority of the terms shared by the two theories function in the same way in both...|[[Thomas Kuhn]]}}

The above only prohibits one type of comparison, that which is carried out between the statements of these two theories in a one-to-one relationship. An idea that underlies this formulation is that translation implies [[symmetry]] and [[transitive relation|transitivity]] so that if theory T is translatable with theory T', then T' can be translated to T, and furthermore if there is a third theory T'' and this can be translated to T', then theories T and T' cannot be incommensurable, as long as the transitive relationship and the symmetrical relationship assures that their statements can be compared one to another.

It should be noted that Kuhn did not deny that two incommensurable theories may have a common reference environment and in this sense he did not state that it was impossible to compare them, his thesis solely refers to the ability to translate the statements belonging to two theories in a one-to-one relationship, as is shown in the following passage:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|The terms that retain their meanings following a change in theory provide a suitable base for the discussion of the differences and for the comparisons that are relevant in the selection of theories. [Continued in a footnote] It may be noted that these terms are not independent of the theory, but they are simply used in the same way in the two theories in question. It follows that the comparison is a process that compares the two theories, it is not a process that can evaluate the theories separately.|[[Thomas Kuhn]]}}

This is relevant because it allow us to elucidate that Kuhn's sense of [[rationality]] is linked to the ability to comprehend, and not to the same capacity for translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43602287|title=Kuhn y el cambio científico|last=Pérez Ransanz|first=Ana Rosa|date=1999|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|year=|isbn=9681641892|edition=1st|location=México|pages=|language=es|oclc=43602287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third stage of Kuhn's work the formulation of the thesis of incommensurability became refined in [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] terms and is explained as a function of the change in the relations of similarity and difference between two theories. Kuhn declared that this change relates to the concepts of Class A not only because there is a change in the way of referring to the concepts but also because their underlying structure becomes altered, that is, the meaning changes – its intention – but also its reference. In this way Kuhn states that not all of the semantic changes are changes that lead to incommensurability, they are only those that, by being made in the basic categories, operate in a [[Holism|holistic manner]] meaning that all the relationships between these terms becomes altered. This uses taxonomic terms to define incommensurability as the impossibility to prove the taxonomic structures of two theories, an impossibility that is expressed as a necessarily incomplete translation of the terms.

==== Taxonomic characterization ====

[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomic]] characterization allowed Kuhn to postulate his no-overlap [[principle]], since, if the taxonomic categories are divisions in a logical sense then this implies that the relations established between these concepts and the rest are necessarily hierarchical. It is for exactly this type of relationship that the changes in categories are holistic, as the modification of a category necessarily implies the modification of the surrounding categories, which explains why once the change takes place the taxonomies can not be comparable – they are isomorphic. 
  
This characterization was already present in Kuhn's writing along with remnants of semantic characterization, which he developed in full towards the end of the 1980s in his taxonomic characterization. An advantage of this characterization is the belief that the criteria that allow the identification of a concept with its references are many and varied, so that a coincidence of criteria is not necessary for successful communication except for those categories that are implicated. Kuhn saw the relations between concepts as existing in a multidimensional space, the categories consist of partitions in this space and they must coincide between the communicators, although this is not the case for the criteria that establish a connection between this space and the associated reference.

==== Reluctance ====

An important clarification that should be made, and which constantly appears in Kuhn's writing, is his reluctance to equate translation and interpretation, a comparison that Kuhn attributes to the analytical tradition of [[philosophy]]. Translation is an almost mechanical activity which produces a Quinean translation manual that relates sequences of words in such a way that their truth values are conserved. However, the process of interpretation implies the development of translation hypotheses, which have to be successful when they allow external preferences to be understood in a coherent and meaningful way. Kuhn then rejected the idea of a universal translatability but not the principle of universal intelligibility, a distinction that is very important in understanding Kuhn's rejection of his critics, such as [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]].

However, without a doubt the previous idea invites us to question how is it that we are able to interpret in the first place. Kuhn's solution consists in affirming that this is like learning a new language. How is it that we are able to learn a new language when we are confronted with a holistic change such as is implied by the notion of incommensurability? Kuhn's work suggests four aspects to this question:

* Firstly, in order to carry out such an [[assimilation (psychology)|assimilation]] it is necessary that the complementary [[vocabulary]] is easily understood.
* Secondly, definitions must fulfill a minimal role, it is the paradigmatic examples that introduce the use of the new concepts, in such a way that an ostensive or stipulative component is essential.
* Thirdly, [[Class (philosophy)|class concepts]] cannot be learned in isolation, but in relation to a series of contrast sets.
* Fourthly, the process of learning involves the generation of expectations, which are the basis of the projectability of the class terms, in such a way that in their turn they form the basis of, among other things, inductive inferences. And lastly, as the criteria for relating the class and its reference vary, this forms the way of learning the subject matter.

=== Conclusion ===

It can be concluded that Kuhn's idea of incommensurability, despite its various reformulations, manages to seriously problematize both the idea of accumulation of a neutral language as well as of the very idea of a neutral language, without falling into [[irrationalism]] nor stating that the common reference level is irrelevant. An idea that differentiates him from Feyerabend who states in books such as ''Problems of Empiricism'' and ''[[Against Method]]'' that if the new theory deviates into new areas, this is not a problem of the theory, as often the conceptual progress leads to the disappearance and not to the refutation or resolution of the old questions.

==Meta-incommensurability==
A more general notion of incommensurability has been applied to the sciences at the meta-level in two significant ways.

Eric Oberheim and [[Paul Hoyningen-Huene]] argue that [[Scientific realism|realist]] and [[Anti-realism#Anti-realism in science|anti-realist]] philosophies of science are also incommensurable, thus scientific theories themselves may be meta-incommensurable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OBERHEIM|first=Eric|last2=HOYNINGEN-HUENE|first2=Paul|date=1997|title=INCOMMENSURABILITY, REALISM AND META-INCOMMENSURABILITY|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23917953|journal=Theoria: An International Journal for Theory, History and Foundations of Science|volume=12|issue=3(30)|pages=447–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Nicholas Best describes a different type of incommensurability between philosophical theories of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Best|first=Nicholas W.|date=September 2015|title=Meta-Incommensurability between Theories of Meaning: Chemical Evidence|url=https://doi.org/10.1162/POSC_a_00176|journal=Perspectives on Science|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=361–378|doi=10.1162/posc_a_00176|issn=1063-6145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that if the meaning of a first-order scientific theory depends on its second-order theory of meaning, then two first order theories will be meta-incommensurable if they depend on substantially different theories of meaning. Whereas Kuhn and Feyerabend’s concepts of incommensurability do not imply complete incomparability of scientific concepts, this incommensurability of meaning does.

[[File:Louis-Nicolas Clerambault.jpg|thumb|French composer [[Louis-Nicolas Clérambault]] composing at the keyboard]]
A '''composer''' ([[Latin]] [[wikt:compono|''compōnō'']]; literally "one who puts together") is a [[musician]] who is an [[author]] of [[music]] in any form, including [[vocal music]] (for a [[Singing|singer]] or [[choir]]), [[instrumental music]], [[electronic music]], and music which combines multiple forms. A composer may create music in any [[music genre]], including, for example, [[classical music]], [[musical theatre]], [[blues]], [[folk music]], [[jazz]], and [[popular music]]. Composers often express their works in a written musical score using [[musical notation]].

Many composers are, or were, also skilled performers of music.

==Composers and performers==
Since [[musical notation]] only incompletely expresses a piece of music, there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in a concert. Even in a classical piece of instrumental music in which all of the melodies, chords, and [[bassline]]s are written out in musical notation, the performer has a good degree of latitude to add artistic interpretation to the work by varying her articulation and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], choosing how long to make [[fermata]]s (held notes) or pauses, and — in the case of bowed string instruments, woodwinds or brass instruments — deciding whether to use expressive effects such as [[vibrato]] or [[portamento]]. For a singer or instrumental performer, the process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a [[musical composition]] often has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in [[musical theatre]], where the songs may be written by one person, the [[orchestration]] of the accompaniment parts and writing of the [[overture]] is done by an orchestrator, and the words may be written by a third person.

A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or, in the 20th and 21st century, computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples of this range from [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze, to avant-garde music from the 20th century that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]].

Music composed in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], particularly in slow tempos, often was written in bare outline, with the expectation that the performer would add [[musical improvisation|improvised]] [[ornamentation (music)|ornaments]] to the melody line during a performance. Such freedom diminished in later eras, reflected in the increased use by composers of detailed notation, including marks of expression telling the performer more precisely how the work should be executed. A culture eventually developed whereby faithfulness to the composer's written intention came to be highly valued (see, for example, [[Urtext edition]]). This musical culture is almost certainly related to the high esteem (bordering on veneration) in which the leading classical composers are often held by performers.

The [[historically informed performance]] movement has revived to some extent the possibility of the performer elaborating in a serious way the music as given in the score, particularly for [[Baroque music]] and music from the early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. The movement might be considered a way of creating ''greater'' faithfulness to the original in works composed at a time that expected performers to improvise. In genres other than classical music, the performer generally has more freedom; thus for instance when a performer of Western popular music creates a "cover" of an earlier song, there is little expectation of exact rendition of the original; nor is exact faithfulness highly valued (with the possible exception of "note-for-note" transcriptions of famous [[guitar solo]]s).

In Classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an [[arranger]] to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in his or her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough the creation of popular and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces and to include spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

==History==
The level of distinction between composers and other [[musician]]s varies, which affects issues such as [[copyright]]{{Specify|date=April 2010}} and the deference given to individual interpretations of a particular piece of music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the development of European [[classical music]], the function of composing music initially did not have much greater importance than that of performing it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The preservation of individual compositions did not receive enormous attention and musicians generally had no qualms about modifying compositions for performance. In as much as the role of the composer in western art music has seen continued solidification, in alternative idioms (i.e. [[jazz]], [[experimental music]]) it has in some ways become increasingly complex or vague. For instance, in certain contexts the line between composer and [[performer]], [[sound designer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], [[Record producer|producer]], and other roles, can be quite blurred.

[[File:Seikilos1.tif|thumb|upright|Ancient Greek marble [[stele]], the so-called [[Seikilos epitaph]], with poetry and musical notation engraved on the stone]]
The term "composer" is often used to refer to composers of [[Instrumental|instrumental music]], such as those found in classical, jazz or other forms of [[Art music|art]] and [[traditional music]]. In [[popular music|popular]] and [[folk music]], the composer is usually called a [[songwriter]], since the music generally takes the form of a [[song]]. Since the mid-20th century, the term has expanded to accommodate creators of [[electroacoustic music]], in which composers directly create sonic material in any of the various [[electronic media]], such as [[reel-to-reel tape]] and electronic [[effects unit]]s, which may be presented to an audience by replaying a tape or other sound recording, or by having live instrumentalists and singers perform with prerecorded material. This is distinct from a 19th-century conception of instrumental composition, where the work was represented solely by a [[Sheet music|musical score]] to be interpreted by [[performers]].

===Ancient Greece===
Music was an important part of social and cultural life in [[Ancient Greece]]. We know that composers wrote notated music during the Ancient Greek era because scholars have found the [[Seikilos epitaph]]. The epitaph, written around 200 BC to around AD 100 {{sfn|Landels|1999|loc=252}} is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, in the world. The song, the melody of which is recorded, alongside its lyrics, in the [[Musical notation#Ancient Greece|ancient Greek musical notation]], was found engraved on a tombstone, a [[stele]], near [[Aydın]], [[Turkey]] (not far from [[Ephesus]]). It is a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Ionia|Ionic]] song in either the [[Mode (music)#Greek scales|Phrygian]] [[octave species]] or [[Musical system of ancient Greece#Ionian (Iastian)|Iastian tonos]].

During the [[Medieval Music|Medieval music]] era (476 to 1400), composers wrote [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. Western Music then started becoming more of an art form with the advances in music notation.&lt;!--?--&gt; The only European Medieval repertory that survives from before about 800 is the monophonic [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant.&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]] and [[Guillaume de Machaut]].

===Renaissance===

[[File:Filippino Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''Allegory of Music'', by [[Filippino Lippi]]]]
During the [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) composers tended to focus more on writing songs about secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread composers' musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. By the middle of the 15th century, composers were writing richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

===Baroque===

During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] (1600 to 1750), composers expanded the range and complexity of the music they were writing. The Baroque music era began when composers looked back to [[Music of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek music]] for the inspiration to create [[opera]]s (dramatic vocal music accompanied by [[orchestra]]). Another key style of music composers used during this era was [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music. This style of writing required composers to have an advanced knowledge of music theory, as contrapuntal music involves multiple, independent melody lines played by instruments or sung by voices. There were strict counterpoint rules that composers had to learn. German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as [[choir]]s and for keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period, composers developed several major music forms that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the [[concerto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html|title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D.|publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu|accessdate=27 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Some of the best-known composers from the Baroque era include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Schütz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[François Couperin]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]].

===Classicism===

|}
Composers of music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical Period]] (1750 to 1830) looked to the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome, to the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. Apart from when writing religious works, composers moved towards writing in a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture, using instrumental melodies that tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed by composers. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct.

Composers focused on [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the [[concerto]], and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to [[ballet]] and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as [[opera]] and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

|}
During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), composers turned the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces. Composers attempted to increase emotional expression and power of their music, and they tried to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. For composers, the emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over following textbooks and tradition. Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as [[literature]]), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, composers explored new approaches to use for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, composers created new forms that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. [[Opera]] and [[ballet]] continued to develop.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Roger. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43289 "Incidental music"], Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 August 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". Composers in the Romantic era increased the size of the orchestra by adding players and using new instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Some Wagnerian orchestras included multiple harps, massive string sections and [[Wagner tuba]]s.

===20th- and 21st-century music===
[[File:PharoahSanders.jpg|thumb|[[Jazz]] group consisting of double bassist [[Reggie Workman]], tenor saxophone player [[Pharoah Sanders]], and drummer [[Idris Muhammad]], performing in 1978]]
In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. With [[20th-century music]], there was a vast increase in music listening as the [[radio]] gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music. In the 20th century, [[contemporary classical composer]]s were also influenced by the [[African-American]] [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]]-based [[jazz]] music. The jazz influence can be seen in [[Third Stream]] music and in the compositions of [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The focus of [[art music]] was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. Cage wrote compositions for traditional classical instruments and unusual sound-producing devices not normally thought of as instruments, such as radios. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music on tape gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition, in which composers made pieces using [[reel-to-reel tape]] recorders and electronic equipment.

==Role of women==
{{Main article|Women in music#Composers|List of female composers by birth date}}
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|upright|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]
In 1993, American [[musicologist]] [[Marcia Citron]] asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993" /&gt;

According to Abbey Philips, "women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve."&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=; 11:04 AM &amp;bull; by Abbey Philips |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=The history of women and gender roles in music |publisher=Rvanews.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer who is mentioned.&lt;ref name="rvanews.com" /&gt; Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name="rvanews.com" /&gt;

Women today are being taken more seriously in the realm of concert music, though the statistics of recognition, prizes, employment, and overall opportunities are still biased toward men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/her-music-emerging-female-composer-today/|title=WQXR – New York's Classical Music Radio Station|website=WQXR|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clustering==
Famous composers have a tendency to cluster in certain cities throughout history. Based on over 12,000 prominent composers listed in ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' and using [[word count]] measurement techniques, the most important cities for classical music can be quantitatively identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Paris has been the main hub for classical music in all periods. It was ranked fifth in the 15th and 16th centuries but first in the 17th to 20th centuries inclusive. London was the second most meaningful city: eighth in the 15th century, seventh in the 16th, fifth in the 17th, second in the 18th and 19th centuries, and fourth in the 20th century. Rome topped the rankings in the 15th century, dropped to second in the 16th and 17th centuries, eighth in the 18th century, ninth in the 19th century but back at sixth in the 20th century. Berlin appears in the top ten ranking only in the 18th century, and was ranked third most important city in both the 19th and 20th centuries. New York City entered the rankings in the 19th century (at fifth place) and stood at second rank in the 20th century. The patterns are very similar for a sample of 522 top composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Training==
Professional classical composers often have a background in performing classical music during their childhood and teens, either as a [[singer]] in a [[choir]], as a player in a [[youth orchestra]], or as a performer on a solo instrument (e.g., [[piano]], [[pipe organ]], or [[violin]]). Teens aspiring to be composers can continue their [[postsecondary]] studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur orchestral and choral singing experience for composition students. Universities offer a range of composition programs, including bachelor's degrees, Master of Music degrees, and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and festivals, which give students the opportunity to get coaching from composers.

===Undergraduate===
Bachelor's degrees in composition (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include individual composition lessons, amateur orchestra/choral experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, composition students must complete significant pieces or songs before graduating. Not all composers hold a B.Mus. in composition; composers may also hold a B.Mus. in music performance or music theory.

===Masters===
Master of music degrees (M.mus.) in composition consist of private lessons with a composition professor, ensemble experience, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two concerts featuring the composition student's pieces. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an M.Mus. or M.M.) is often a required minimum credential for people who wish to teach composition at a university or conservatory. A composer with an M.Mus. could be an adjunct professor or instructor at a university, but it would be difficult in the 2010s to obtain a [[tenure track]] [[professor]] position with this degree.

===Doctoral===
To become a tenure track professor, many universities require a [[doctoral degree]]. In composition, the key doctoral degree is the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], rather than the [[PhD]]; the PhD is awarded in music, but typically for subjects such as [[musicology]] and [[music theory]].

Doctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in composition provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Students must submit examples of their compositions. If available, some schools will also accept video or audio recordings of performances of the student's pieces. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination are required.

Students must prepare significant compositions under the guidance of faculty composition professors. Some schools require DMA composition students to present concerts of their works, which are typically performed by singers or musicians from the school. The completion of advanced coursework and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A program. During a D.M.A. program, a composition student may get experience teaching undergraduate music students.

===Other routes===
Some classical composers did not complete composition programs, but focused their studies on performance of voice or an instrument or on [[music theory]], and developed their compositional skills over the course of a career in another musical occupation.

==Employment==
During the Middle Ages, most composers worked for the [[Catholic church]] and composed music for religious services such as [[plainchant]] melodies. During the [[Renaissance music]] era, composers typically worked for aristocratic employers. While aristocrats typically required composers to produce a significant amount of religious music, such as [[Mass (music)|Mass]]es, composers also penned many non-religious songs on the topic of [[courtly love]]: the respectful, reverential love of a great woman from afar. Courtly love songs were very popular during the Renaissance era. During the [[Baroque music]] era, many composers were employed by aristocrats or as church employees. During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], composers began to organize more public concerts for profit, which helped composers to be less dependent on aristocratic or church jobs. This trend continued in the [[Romantic music]] era in the 19th century. In the 20th century, composers began to seek employment as professors in universities and conservatories. In the 20th century, composers also earned money from the sales of their works, such [[sheet music]] publications of their songs or pieces or as [[sound recording]]s of their works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">'''Cybernetic art''' is [[contemporary art]] that builds upon the legacy of [[Cybernetics]], where feedback involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and material concerns.

==History==
[[Nicolas Schöffer]]'s ''CYSP I'' (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words "CYbernetic" and "SPatiodynamic").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CYSP I, the first cybernetic sculpture of art's history|url=http://www.olats.org/schoffer/cyspe.htm|publisher=Leonardo/OLATS - Observatoire Leonardo des arts et des technosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Roy Ascott]] elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in  "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in "The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including "[http://www.artexetra.com//CyberneticsArtCultConv.pdf Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Energy to Information: Representation in Science, Technology, Art, and Literature|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|pages=255–277|editor=Bruce Clarke and Linda Dalrymple Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of [[Roy Ascott]]"(2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascott|first=Roy|title=Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|editor=Edward A. Shanken}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to [[telematic art]] (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to [[net.art]].)

Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of [[Robert Breer]] and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cyborg art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cyborg art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1976), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In "Beyond Modern Sculpture" from 1968 he builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading art theorists and historians in this field include [[Christiane Paul]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Christine Buci-Glucksmann]], [[Dominique Moulon]], [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Margot Lovejoy]], [[Edmond Couchot]], [[Fred Forest]] and [[Edward A. Shanken]].

[[Image:Naive realism.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Direct realism argues we perceive the world directly]]

The question of '''direct''' or '''naïve realism''', as opposed to '''indirect''' or '''representational realism''', arises in the [[philosophy of perception]] and [[philosophy of mind|of mind]] out of the debate over the nature of [[Consciousness|conscious]] [[Qualia|experience]];&lt;ref name=lehar&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/consc1/consc1.html The Function of Conscious Experience: An Analogical Paradigm of Perception and Behavior], ''Consciousness and Cognition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html Naïve Realism in Contemporary Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811172229/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html |date=2012-08-11 }}, ''The Function of Conscious Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by [[neural]] processes in our [[Human brain|brain]]. [[Naïve realism]] is known as ''direct'' realism when developed to counter ''indirect'' or representative realism, also known as epistemological dualism,&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, Steve. [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html Representationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905185905/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an [[Mental representation|internal representation]], a miniature [[Virtual reality|virtual-reality]] replica of the world.

Indirect realism is broadly equivalent to the accepted view of [[perception]] in natural science that states that we do not and cannot perceive the external world as it really is but know only our ideas and interpretations of the way the world is.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] (or audition) is the ability to perceive (create ideas of)sound by detecting vibrations. The sound waves of language cannot perceive directly. They are only heard, interpreted and understood because the physical waves were transformed into ideas (Mental representation of sound wages) by our brains.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Representationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is one of the key assumptions of [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] in [[psychology]]. The representational realist would deny that "first-hand knowledge" is a coherent concept, since knowledge is always via some means. Our ideas of the world are interpretations of sensory input derived from an external world that is real (unlike the standpoint of [[idealism]], which holds that only ideas are real, but mind-independent things are not).

The main alternative to representationalism is '''anti-representationalism''',&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; the view according to which perception is not a process of constructing internal representations.

==History==
[[Aristotle]] was the first to provide a description of direct realism. In ''[[On the Soul]]'' he describes how a see-er is informed of the [[substance theory|object itself]] by way of the [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic form]] carried over the intervening material continuum with which the eye is impressed.&lt;ref name="Bernecker2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. |last=Bernecker |year=2008 |title=The Metaphysics of Memory |series=Philosophical Studies Series |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781402082191 |lccn=2008921236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNk4jvxjVhUC&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |quote=The distinction between direct and indirect realism about perception has an interesting history. There was a time when perception was understood to be of things themselves, not of our ideas of things. This is what we find in Aristotle and Aquinas, who maintain that the mind or understanding grasps the form of the material object without the matter. What we perceive directly, on this view, are material objects. This changed in the seventeenth century with Descartes and Locke. who can be read as saying that the primary objects of perception are not things external to the mind but sense-data. Sense-data are the messengers that stand between us and physical objects such as tables and chairs. While indirect realism was the standard view of early modern philosophers, nowadays direct realism is, once again, in fashion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval philosophy]], [[direct realism]] was defended by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Bernecker2008"/&gt;

Indirect realism was popular with several [[early modern philosophy|early modern philosophers]], including [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref name=Yolton&gt;John W. Yolton, ''Realism and Appearances: An Essay in Ontology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]],&lt;ref name=Yolton/&gt; [[G. W. Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Dickerson, ''Kant on Representation and Objectivity'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Berkeley]],&lt;ref name=SEP-PP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ The Problem of Perception (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]: "Paraphrasing David Hume (1739...; see also Locke 1690, Berkeley 1710, Russell 1912): nothing is ever directly present to the mind in perception except perceptual appearances."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name=SEP-PP/&gt;

Locke categorized qualities as follows:&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Smith, "On Primary and Secondary Qualities", ''Philosophical Review'' (1990), 221–54.&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Primary qualities are qualities which are "explanatorily basic" – which is to say, they can be referred to as the explanation for other qualities or phenomena without requiring explanation themselves – and they are distinct in that our sensory experience of them resembles them in reality.  (For example, one perceives an object as spherical precisely because of the way the atoms of the sphere are arranged.)  Primary qualities cannot be removed by either thought or physical action, and include mass, movement, and, controversially, solidity (although later proponents of the distinction between primary and secondary qualities usually discount solidity).
* Secondary qualities are qualities which one's experience does not directly resemble; for example, when one sees an object as red, the sensation of seeing redness is not produced by some quality of redness in the object, but by the arrangement of atoms on the surface of the object which reflects and absorbs light in a particular way.  Secondary qualities include colour, smell, and taste.

[[Thomas Reid]], a notable member of the [[Scottish common sense realism]] was proponent of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Rysiew, ''New Essays on Thomas Reid'', Routledge, 2017, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct realist views have been attributed to [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Della Rocca (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Spinoza'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[empirical realism]] has also been interpreted as a form of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Schulting, Jacco Verburgt (eds.), ''Kant's Idealism: New Interpretations of a Controversial Doctrine'', Springer 2010, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Late modern philosophy|Late modern philosophers]], [[J. G. Fichte]] and [[G. W. F. Hegel]] followed Kant in adopting empirical realism.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Breazeale and [[Tom Rockmore]] (eds.), ''Fichte, German Idealism, and Early Romanticism'', Rodopi, 2010, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Rockmore]], ''Before and After Hegel: A Historical Introduction to Hegel's Thought'', Hackett Publishing, 2003, p. xviii: "Hegel follows Kant ... in limiting claims to know to the empirically real. In short, he adopts a view very similar to Kant's empirical realism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottlob Frege]] (in his paper "[[On Sense and Reference|Über Sinn und Bedeutung]]") also subscribed to indirect realism.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lebens, ''Bertrand Russell and the Nature of Propositions: A History and Defence of the Multiple Relation Theory of Judgement'', Routledge, 2017, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], indirect realism has been defended by [[Edmund Husserl]]&lt;ref&gt;Robin D. Rollinger, ''Husserl's Position in the School of Brentano'', ''Phaenomenologica'' 150, Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1999, p. 224 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref name=SEP-PP/&gt; Direct realism has been defended by [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary. Sep. 1994. "The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind." ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''91'''(9):445–518.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McDowell]],&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, &lt;!--November--&gt;1994, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen Strawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Galen Strawson, [https://vimeo.com/91346935 "Real Direct Realism"], a lecture recorded 2014 at Marc Sanders Foundation, Vimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John R. Searle]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''Seeing Things as They Are: A Theory of Perception'', Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, epistemological dualism has come under sustained attack by other contemporary philosophers, such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (the [[private language argument]]) and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] in his seminal essay "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind". Indirect realism is argued to be problematical because of [[Ryle's regress]] and the [[homunculus argument]]. However, recently reliance on the private language argument and the Homunculus Objection has itself come under attack. It can be argued that those who argue for "inner presence", to use Antti Revonsuo's term,&lt;ref&gt;Revonsuo, Antti (2006) ''Inner Presence:  Consciousness as a Biological Phenomenon,'' Cambridge MA:  MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are not proposing  a private "referent", with the application of language to it being "private" and thus unshareable, but a ''private'' use of ''public'' language.  There is no doubt that each of us has a private understanding of public language, a notion that has been experimentally supported;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ragnar Rommetveit|Rommetveit, Ragnar]] (1974) ''On Message Structure:  A Framework for the Study of Language and Communication,'' London:  John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; George Steiner refers to our personal use of language as an "idiolect", one particular to ourselves in its detail.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, George (1998), ''After Babel:  Aspects of Language and Translation,'' London &amp; New York:  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The question has to be put how a collective use of language can go on when, not only do we have differing understandings of the words we use, but our sensory registrations differ.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, C. L. (1988) ''Color for Philosophers,'' Indianapolis IN:  Hackett Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against direct realism==

===The argument from illusion===
[[Image:Café wall.svg|250px|thumb|right|Illusion creates a problem for naïve realists as it suggests our senses are fallible, perceiving things that aren't there. In this illusion, the lines are horizontal, despite how they appear.]]
This argument was "first offered in a more or less fully explicit form in [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] ([[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous|1713]])."&lt;ref name=sep&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ Epistemological Problems of Perception], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as the problem of conflicting appearances (e.g. [[Myles Burnyeat]]'s article ''Conflicting Appearances''). It has been argued that "informed commonsense" indicates that perceptions often depend on organs of perception.&lt;ref name="uor" /&gt; For example, humans would receive visual information very differently if they, like flies, had compound eyes, and may not even be able to imagine how things would appear with entirely different sense organs such as [[infra-red]] detectors or [[acoustic location|echo-location]] devices. Furthermore, perception systems can misrepresent objects even when in full working order, as shown, for example, by [[optical illusion]]s like the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]]. More dramatically, sometimes people perceive things which are not there at all, which can be termed instances of "hallucination" or "perceptual delusion".&lt;ref name=uor&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/ld/Philos/jmp/Theory%20of%20Knowledge/NaiveRealism.htm Naïve Realism], [[University of Reading]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Illusions are present in nature. [[Rainbows]] are an example of a perceptual delusion. "For, unlike an architectural arch, a rainbow recedes as we approach it, never to be reached."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gregory|Gregory, Richard.]] (2003). [http://www.perceptionweb.com/perception/perc0303/editorial.pdf Delusions.] ''Perception.'' '''32''', pp. 257-261.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[argument from illusion]] allegedly shows the need to posit sense-data as the immediate objects of perception. In cases of illusion or [[hallucination]], the object has qualities that no public physical object in that situation has and so must be distinct from any such object.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Naïve realism may accommodate these facts as they stand by virtue of its very vagueness (or "open-texture"): it is not specific or detailed enough to be refuted by such cases.&lt;ref name=uor/&gt; A more developed direct realist might respond by showing that various cases of misperception, failed perception, and perceptual relativity do not make it necessary to suppose that sense-data exist. When a stick submerged in water looks bent a direct realist is not compelled to say the stick actually is bent but can say that the stick can have more than one appearance: a straight stick can look bent when light reflected from the stick arrives at one's eye in a crooked pattern, but this appearance is not necessarily a sense-datum in the mind. Similar things can be said about the coin which appears circular from one vantage point and oval-shaped from another. Pressing on your eyeball with a finger creates double vision but assuming the existence of two sense-data is unnecessary: the direct realist can say that they have two eyes, each giving them a different view of the world. Usually the eyes are focused in the same direction; but sometimes they are not.

However, this response is presumably based on previously observed data. If one were to be able to observe nothing other than the stick in the water, with no previous information, it would appear that the stick was bent. Visual depth in particular is a set of inferences, not an actual experience of the space between things in a radial direction outward from the observation point.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Alex. (2003). [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lka/conr.htm The Empirical Description of Conscious Experience], ''The Science and Philosophy of Consciousness.''&lt;/ref&gt; If all [[empirical evidence]] is based upon observation then the entire developed memory and knowledge of every perception and of each sense may be as skewed as the bent stick. Since objects with different qualities are experienced from each of the different perspectives there is no apparent experiential basis for regarding one out of any such set of related perceptual experiences as the one in which the relevant physical object is itself immediately experienced. The most reasonable conclusion is that the experienced object is always distinct from the physical object or at least that there is no way to identify which, if any, of the immediately experienced objects is the physical object itself. Epistemologically it is as though physical objects were never given, whether or not that is in fact the case.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Another potential counter-example involves vivid hallucinations: phantom elephants, for instance, might be interpreted as sense-data. A direct realist response would differentiate hallucination from genuine perception: no perception of elephants is going on, only the different and related mental process of hallucination. However, if there are visual images when we hallucinate it seems reasonable that there are visual images when we see. Similarly if dreaming involves visual and auditory images in our minds it seems reasonable to think there are visual and auditory images, or sense-data, when we are awake and perceiving things. This argument has been challenged in a number of different ways. First it has been questioned whether there must be some object present that actually has the experienced qualities, which would then seemingly have to be something like a sense-datum. Why couldn't it be that the perceiver is simply in a state of seeming to experience such an object without any object actually being present? Second, in cases of illusion and perceptual relativity there is an object present which is simply misperceived, usually in readily explainable ways, and no need to suppose that an additional object is also involved. Third, the last part of the perceptual relativity version of the argument has been challenged by questioning whether there is really no experiential difference between veridical and non-veridical perception; and by arguing that even if sense-data are experienced in non-veridical cases and even if the difference between veridical and non-veridical cases is, as claimed, experientially indiscernible, there is still no reason to think that sense-data are the immediate objects of experience in veridical cases. Fourth, do sense-data exist through time or are they momentary? Can they exist when not being perceived? Are they public or private? Can they be themselves misperceived? Do they exist in minds or are they extra-mental, even if not physical? On the basis of the intractability of these questions, it has been argued that the conclusion of the argument from illusion is unacceptable or even unintelligible, even in the absence of a clear diagnosis of exactly where and how it goes wrong.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Direct realists can potentially deny the existence of any such thing as a mental image but this is difficult to maintain, since we seem able to visually imagine all sorts of things with ease. Even if perception does not involve images other mental processes like imagination certainly seem to. One view, similar to Reid's, is that we do have images of various sorts in our minds when we perceive, dream, hallucinate and imagine but when we actually perceive things, our sensations cannot be considered objects of perception or attention. The only objects of perception are external objects. Even if perception is accompanied by images, or sensations, it is wrong to say we perceive sensations. Direct realism defines perception as perception of external objects where an "external object" is allowed to be a photon in the eye but not an impulse in a nerve leading from the eye. Recent work in neuroscience suggests a shared ontology for perception, imagination and dreaming, with similar areas of brain being used for all of these.

==Problems with the indirect theory&lt;!--Linked from 'Social constructionism'--&gt;==

A problem with representationalism is that if simple data flow and [[information processing]] is assumed then something in the brain must be interpreting incoming data as a "percept". This something is often described as a [[homunculus]], although the term homunculus is also used to imply an entity that creates a continual [[Regress argument|regress]], and this need not be implied. This suggests that some phenomenon other than simple data flow and [[information processing]] is involved in perception. This is more of an issue now than it was for [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers prior to Newton, such as Descartes, for whom physical processes were poorly defined. Descartes held that there is a "homunculus" in the form of the soul, belonging to a form of natural substance known as ''[[Mental substance|res cogitans]]'' that obeyed different laws from those obeyed by solid matter (''[[res extensa]]''). Although Descartes' duality of natural substances may have echoes in modern physics (Bose and Fermi statistics) no agreed account of 'interpretation' has been formulated. Thus representationalism remains an incomplete description of perception. Aristotle realized this and simply proposed that ideas themselves (representations) must be aware—in other words that there is no further transfer of sense impressions beyond ideas.
[[Image:Rep-perception.jpg|right|thumb|400px|The representational theory of perception]]

A potential difficulty with representational realism is that, if we only have knowledge of representations of the world, how can we know that they resemble in any significant way the objects to which they are supposed to correspond? Any creature with a representation in its brain would need to interact with the objects that are represented to identify them with the representation. This difficulty would seem reasonably to be covered by the learning by exploration of the world that goes on throughout life. However, there may still be a concern that if the external world is only to be [[inference|inferred]], its 'true likeness' might be quite different from our idea of it. The representational realist would answer to this that "true likeness" is an intuitive concept that falls in the face of logic, since a likeness must always depend on the way in which something is considered.

A semantic difficulty may arise when considering [[reference]] in representationalism. If a person says "I see the Eiffel Tower" at a time when they are indeed looking at the Eiffel Tower, to what does the term "Eiffel Tower" refer? The direct realist might say that in the representational account people do not really see the tower but rather 'see' the representation. However, this is a distortion of the meaning of the word see which the representationalist does not imply. For the representationalist the statement refers to the Eiffel Tower, which implicitly is experienced in the form of a representation. The representationalist does not imply that when a person refers to the Eiffel Tower, they are referring to their [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]], and when another person refers to the Tower, they are referring to their sense experience.

Furthermore, representative realism claims that we perceive our perceptual intermediaries-we can attend to them-just as we observe our image in a mirror. However, as we can scientifically verify, this is clearly not true of the physiological components of the perceptual process. This also brings up the problem of [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] and its relation to representative realism, concerning the incongruous marriage of the metaphysical and the physical.

The new objection to the Homunculus Argument claims that it relies on a naive view of sensation.  Because the eyes respond to light rays is no reason for supposing that the visual field requires eyes to see it.  Visual sensation (the argument can be extrapolated to the other senses) bears no direct resemblance to the light rays at the retina, nor to the character of what they are reflected from or pass through or what was glowing at the origin of them.  The reason given is that they only bear the similarities of ''co-variation'' with what arrives at the retinas.&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, Roy Wood (1919), "The epistemology of evolutionary naturalism", Mind, 28:112, 407-26;  se p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as the currents in a wire going to a loudspeaker vary proportionately with the sounds that emanate from it but have no other likeness, so too does sensation vary proportionately (and not necessarily directly) with what causes it but bears no other resemblance to the input.  This implies that the colour we experience is actually a cortical occurrence, and that light rays and external surfaces are not themselves coloured.  The proportional variations with which cortical colour changes are there in the external world, but not colour as we experience it.  Contrary to what Gilbert Ryle believed, those who argue for sensations being brain processes do not have to hold that there is a "picture" in the brain since this is impossible according to this theory since actual pictures in the external world are not coloured.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmond (2005), ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke:  Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 96-102.&lt;/ref&gt; It is plain that Ryle unthinkingly carried over what the eyes do to the nature of sensation; A. J. Ayer at the time described Ryle's position as "very weak".&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, A. J. (1957) ''The Problem of Knowledge,'' Harmondsworth:  Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; So there is no "screen" in front of cortical "eyes", no mental objects before one. As Thomas Hobbes put it: "How do we take notice of sense?—by sense itself". Moreland Perkins has characterized it thus: that sensing is not like kicking a ball, but rather "kicking a kick".&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Thomas (1839 [1655]), ''Elements of Philosophy, The First Section: Concerning Body,'' London: John Bohn, p. 389;  Perkins, Moreland (1983), ''Sensing the World,'' Indianapolis IN: Hackett Pub. Co., pp. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are still philosophers arguing for colour being a property of external surfaces, light sources, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tye (2006), 'The puzzle of true blue', ''Analysis,'' 66: 173-78;  Matthen, Mohan (2009), 'Truly blue:  an adverbial aspect of perceptual representation', ''Analysis,'' 69:1, 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more fundamental criticism is implied in theories of this type. The differences at the sensory and perceptual levels between agents require that some means of ensuring at least a partial correlation can be achieved that allows the updatings involved in communication to take place.  The process in an informative statement begins with the parties hypothetically assuming that they are referring to the "same" entity or "property", even though their selections from their sensory fields cannot match; we can call this mutually imagined projection the "logical subject" of the statement.  The speaker then produces the logical predicate which effects the proposed updating of the "referent". If the statement goes through, the hearer will now have a different percept and concept of the "referent"—perhaps even seeing it now as two things and not one. The radical conclusion is that we are premature in conceiving of the external as already sorted into singular "objects" in the first place, since we only need to behave ''as if'' they are already logically singular.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmond (2005), ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke:  Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 103-120.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram at the beginning of this entry would thus be thought of as a false picture of the actual case, since to draw "an" object as already selected from the real is only to treat the practically needful, but strictly false, hypothesis of objects-as-logically-singular as ontologically given. The proponents of this view thus argue that there is no need actually ''to believe'' in the singularity of an object since we can manage perfectly well by ''mutually imagining'' that 'it' is singular.  A proponent of this theory can thus ask the direct realist feels why he or she thinks it is necessary to move to taking the imagining of singularity for real when there is no practical difference in the outcome in action.  Therefore, although there are selections from our sensory fields which for the time being we treat as if they were objects, they are only provisional, open to corrections at any time, and, hence, far from being direct ''representations'' of pre-existing singularities, they retain an experimental character.  Virtual constructs or no, they remain, however, selections that are causally linked to the real and can surprise us at any time—which removes any danger of solipsism in this theory.  This approach dovetails with the philosophy known as [[social constructivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism:  A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London:  RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of experience of a physical object can be altered in major ways by changes in the conditions of perception or of the relevant sense-organs and the resulting [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] processes, without change in the external physical object that initiates this process and that may seem to be depicted by the experience. Conversely any process that yields the same sensory/neural results will yield the same perceptual experience, no matter what the physical object that initiated the process may have been like. Furthermore, the causal process that intervenes between the external object and the perceptual experience takes time, so that the character of the experience reflects, at the most, an earlier stage of that object than the one existing at the moment of perception. As in observations of astronomical objects the external object may have ceased to exist long before the experience occurs. These facts are claimed to point to the conclusion that the direct object of experience is an entity produced at the end of this causal process, distinct from any physical object that initiates the process."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

==The adverbial theory==
The above argument invites the conclusion of a perceptual dualism that raises the issue of how and whether the object can be known by experience. The adverbial theory proposes "that this dualism is a dualism of ''objects'', with perceptual experience being a more direct experience of objects of a different sort, [[sense-data]]."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Perceptual dualism implies:&lt;blockquote&gt;both an ''act'' of awareness (or apprehension) and an ''object'' (the sense-datum) which that act apprehends or is an awareness of. The fundamental idea of the adverbial theory, in contrast, is that there is no need for such objects and the problems that they bring with them (such as whether they are physical or mental or somehow neither). Instead, it is suggested, merely the occurrence of a mental act or mental state with its own intrinsic character is enough to account for the character of immediate experience.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to the adverbial theory, when, for example, I experience a silver elliptical shape (as when viewing a coin from an angle) I am in a certain specific state of sensing or sensory awareness or of being appeared to: I sense in a certain manner or am appeared to in a certain way, and that specific manner of sensing or of being appeared to accounts for the content of my experience: I am in a certain distinctive sort of experiential state. There need be no object or entity of any sort that is literally silver and elliptical in the material world or in the mind. I experience a silver and [[Ellipse|elliptical]] shape because an object or entity that literally has that color and shape is directly before my mind. But the nature of these entities and the way in which they are related to the mind are difficult to understand. The adverbial theory has the advantage of being metaphysically simpler, avoiding issues about the nature of sense-data, but we gain no real understanding of the nature of the states in question or of how exactly they account for the character of immediate experience."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Lane 2 contains protein as well as a DNA fragment that, based on its sequence, does not interact.  Lane 3 contains protein and a DNA fragment that does react; the resulting complex is larger, heavier, and slower-moving. The pattern shown in lane 3 is the one that would result if all the DNA were bound and no dissociation of complex occurred during electrophoresis.  When these conditions are not met  a second band might be seen in lane 3 reflecting the presence of free DNA or the  dissociation of the DNA-protein complex.]]

An '''electrophoretic mobility shift assay''' (EMSA) or '''mobility shift electrophoresis''', also referred as a '''gel shift assay''', '''gel mobility shift assay''', '''band shift assay''', or '''gel retardation assay''', is a common [[affinity electrophoresis]] technique used to study [[protein–DNA interaction|protein–DNA]] or [[protein]]–[[RNA]] interactions.  This procedure can determine if a protein or mixture of proteins is capable of binding to a given DNA or RNA sequence, and can sometimes indicate if more than one protein molecule is involved in the binding complex.  Gel shift assays are often performed [[in vitro]] concurrently with [[DNase footprinting]], [[primer extension]], and promoter-probe experiments when studying [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] initiation, DNA replication, DNA repair or RNA processing and maturation, as well as pre-mRNA splicing&lt;ref&gt;Granadino B, Penalva LO, Green MR, Valcarcel J, Sanchez L. 1997. Proc Natl
Acad Sci U S A 94: 7343-8.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although precursors can be found in earlier literature, most current assays are based on methods described by Garner and Revzin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garner MM, Revzin A |title=A gel electrophoresis method for quantifying the binding of proteins to specific DNA regions: application to components of the Escherichia coli lactose operon regulatory system |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=9 |issue=13 |pages=3047–60 |date=July 1981 |pmid=6269071 |pmc=327330 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6269071 |doi=10.1093/nar/9.13.3047}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fried and [[Donald Crothers|Crothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fried M, Crothers DM |title=Equilibria and kinetics of lac repressor-operator interactions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=9 |issue=23 |pages=6505–25 |date=December 1981 |pmid=6275366 |pmc=327619 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6275366 |doi=10.1093/nar/9.23.6505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==
A mobility shift assay is [[Gel electrophoresis|electrophoretic separation]] of a protein–DNA or protein–RNA mixture on a [[Polyacrylamide gel|polyacrylamide]] or [[agarose gel]] for a short period (about 1.5-2 hr for a 15- to 20-cm gel).&lt;ref name=CPIMB&gt;{{cite book |author=Ausubel, Frederick M. |title=[[Current Protocols]] in molecular biology |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Chichester |year=1994 |pages=12.2.1–11 |isbn=0-471-50337-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed at which different molecules (and combinations thereof) move through the gel is determined by their size and charge, and to a lesser extent, their shape (see [[gel electrophoresis]]). The control lane (DNA probe without protein present) will contain a single band corresponding to the unbound DNA or RNA fragment. However, assuming that the protein is capable of binding to the fragment, the lane with a protein that binds present will contain another band that represents the larger, less mobile complex of nucleic acid probe bound to protein which is 'shifted' up on the gel (since it has moved more slowly).

Under the correct experimental conditions, the interaction between the DNA (or RNA) and protein is stabilized and the ratio of bound to unbound nucleic acid on the gel reflects the fraction of free and bound probe molecules as the binding reaction enters the gel. This stability is in part due to a "caging effect", in that the protein, surrounded by the gel matrix, is unable to diffuse away from the probe before they recombine.&lt;ref&gt;Fried MG, Liu G. (1994). "Molecular sequestration stabilizes CAP- DNA complexes during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis". ''Nucleic Acids Research'' 22(23): 5054-5059. doi: 10.1093/nar/22.23.5054. {{PMID|7800499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the starting concentrations of protein and probe are known, and if the stoichiometry of the complex is known, the apparent affinity of the protein for the nucleic acid sequence may be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Fried MG (1989) "Measurement of protein-DNA interaction parameters by electrophoresis mobility shift assay". ''Electrophoresis'' 10, 366-376. {{PMID|2670548}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the complex is very long lived under gel conditions, or dissociation during electrophoresis is taken into account, the number derived is an apparent Kd.  If the protein concentration is not known but the complex stoichiometry is, the protein concentration can be determined by increasing the concentration of DNA probe until further increments do not increase the fraction of protein bound. By comparison with a set of standard dilutions of free probe run on the same gel, the number of moles of protein can be calculated.&lt;ref name=CPIMB/&gt;

== Variants and additions ==
An antibody that recognizes the protein can be added to this mixture to create an even larger complex with a greater shift. This method is referred to as a ''supershift assay'', and is used to unambiguously identify a protein present in the protein – nucleic acid complex.

Often, an extra lane is run with a competitor [[oligonucleotide]] to determine the most favorable binding sequence for the binding protein. The use of different oligonucleotides of defined sequence allows the identification of the precise binding site by competition (not shown in diagram). Variants of the competition assay are useful for measuring the specificity of binding and for measurement of association and dissociation kinetics. Thus, EMSA might also be used as part of a SELEX experiment to select for oligonucleotides that do actually bind a given protein. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Shaohua|last2=Li|first2=Hui|last3=Yang|first3=Xiqin|last4=Wang|first4=Wei|last5=Huang|first5=Aixue|last6=Li|first6=Jie|last7=Qin|first7=Xingliang|last8=Li|first8=Fei|last9=Lu|first9=Guanyi|date=2015-03-12|title=Vasorin is a potential serum biomarker and drug target of hepatocarcinoma screened by subtractive-EMSA-SELEX to clinic patient serum|url=http://www.oncotarget.com/fulltext/3541|journal=Oncotarget|volume=6|issue=12|doi=10.18632/oncotarget.3541|issn=1949-2553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once DNA-protein binding is determined ''in vitro'', a number of algorithms can narrow the search for identification of the transcription factor. Consensus sequence oligonucleotides for the transcription factor of interest will be able to compete for the binding, eliminating the shifted band, and must be confirmed by supershift. If the predicted consensus sequence fails to compete for binding, identification of the transcription factor may be aided by Multiplexed Competitor EMSA (MC-EMSA), whereby large sets of consensus sequences are multiplexed in each reaction, and where one set competes for binding, the individual consensus sequences from this set are run in a further reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith AJ, Humphries SE |title=Characterization of DNA-binding proteins using multiplexed competitor EMSA |journal=J. Mol. Biol. |volume=385 |issue=3 |pages=714–7 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19059416 |doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2008.11.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For visualization purposes, the nucleic acid fragment is usually labelled with a [[Isotopic labeling|radioactive]], [[fluorescent marker|fluorescent]] or [[biotinylation|biotin]] label. Standard [[ethidium bromide]] staining is less sensitive than these methods and can lack the sensitivity to detect the nucleic acid if small amounts of nucleic acid or single-stranded nucleic acid(s) are used in these experiments. When using a biotin label, [[streptavidin]] conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase is used to detect the DNA fragment.&lt;ref name="HellmanFried2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hellman|first1=Lance M|last2=Fried|first2=Michael G|title=Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for detecting protein–nucleic acid interactions|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=2|issue=8|year=2007|pages=1849–1861|issn=1754-2189|doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.249|pmc=2757439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Osmosensing and Osmosignaling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7V924wFukWEC&amp;pg=PA288|date=1 October 2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-055211-8|pages=288–}}&lt;/ref&gt; While isotopic DNA labeling has little or no effect on protein binding affinity, use of non-isotopic labels including flurophores or biotin can alter the affinity and/or stoichiometry of the protein interaction of interest. Competition between fluorophore- or biotin-labeled probe and unlabeled DNA of the same sequence can be used to determine whether the label alters binding affinity or stoichiometry.

'''Exhibit design''' (or '''exhibition design'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Exhibition Design | publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | author=Dernie, David | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-393-73211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the process of developing an exhibit—from a concept through to a physical, three-dimensional exhibition. It is a continually evolving field, drawing on innovative, creative, and practical solutions to the challenge of developing communicative environments that ‘tell a story’ in a three-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/course/xmdxmdma/ MA Design for Exhibition and Museum], [[University of Lincoln]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exhibit designer]]s (or [[exhibition designer]]s) use a wide range of technologies and techniques to develop experiences that will resonate with diverse audiences–enabling these targeted audiences to access the messages, stories and objects of an exhibit.
There are many different types of exhibit, ranging from museum exhibitions, to retail and trades show spaces, to themed attractions, zoos, and visitor centers. All types of exhibits aim to communicate a message through engaging their audiences in meaningful and compelling interactions.
   
Exhibit design is a collaborative process, integrating the disciplines of [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[graphic design]], [[audiovisual]] engineering, [[digital media]], [[lighting designer|lighting]], [[interior design]], and content development to develop an audience experience that interprets information, involves and engages a user and influences their understanding of a subject.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Skolnick, [[Jan Lorenc]], and Craig Berger, ''What is Exhibition Design?'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the planning and design process, exhibit designers work closely with [[graphic designers]], content specialists, [[architects]], fabricators, technical specialists, audiovisual experts, and, in the case of museums and other [[mission statement|mission]]-based institutions, stakeholders like community members, government agencies, and other partner organizations.
  
The exhibit design process builds on a conceptual or [[interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. The first phases establish a thematic direction and develop creative and appropriate design solutions to achieve the interpretive and communication goals of the exhibit. The latter phases employ technical expertise in translating the visual language of the designs into detailed documents that provide all the specifications required to fabricate and install an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442230170/Museums-101|title=Museums 101|last=Walhimer|first=Mark|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2015|isbn=9781442230187|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibition design in different parts of the world are influenced by the local culture as well as the availability of materials. Exhibition design in Europe is considered as a meeting place for relationship building while in North America energy is spent on creating a sense of place and building community.

One of the major shifts in museum and exhibit design in the last decade has been a focus on visitor experience.  By identifying the five types of museum visitors and their needs and expectations, museums can design their exhibits to give a positive visitor experience.&lt;ref&gt;John Falk, ''Identity and the museum visitor experience''2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Participatory activities are also becoming more popular, Nina Simon has done research describing and identifying themes and trends in museums that will attract visitors and educate them in fun and engaging ways. &lt;ref&gt;Nina Simon, ''The Participatory Museum'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faculty of Political Science, [[Chulalongkorn University]]''', is regarded as one of the oldest modern higher education institutions in [[Thailand]]. It is the first faculty of political science in Thailand and is considered as one of the best according to the statistics of student who had highest score on admission system chose to study there for 4 years in a row (2010-2013).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matichon.co.th/news_detail.php?newsid=1368077139&amp;grpid=03&amp;catid=19&amp;subcatid=1903&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of Thailand's leading institutions for [[political science]] training. Many senior government officials, politicians, diplomats and prominent academics are the graduates of the Faculty. Due to its logo and colour, the Faculty, students and its graduates are also called by the nickname, "Singh Dam" (Black Singha).

==History==
The Faculty of Political Science was originally established in 1899 as the School of Civil Servant Training by [[King Chulalongkorn]]. Students were selected from those who passed basic educational training and would be educated about [[public administration]] in the school. They were also required to do internship in different governmental agencies after completion and received certificate for specialised skill afterwards. This School had expanded and its graduates mostly worked as royal [[page (occupation)|page]] which allowed these young men to be close to the central authority and became accustomed to senior officials. As a general practice during that time, new government officials would start their career at the Department of Royal Pages before being promoted to work in other departments. Therefore, [[King Chulalongkorn]] renamed the School to the Royal Pages School to reflect this reality in 1902.

In 1910, [[King Vajiravudh]] viewed that training new graduates to work for the Ministry of Interior was not sufficient for increasing public services in other areas; therefore, he ordered and financially supported the expansion of the Royal Pages School to include many areas of trainings. The School was renamed again to "The Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn" on 1 January 1910. The general curriculum was four-year training of which the first three were for general education leaving the last year for internship. However, the School was upgraded and renamed [[Chulalongkorn University]] on 26 March 1916. The newly established [[Chulalongkorn University]] was then administered in 4 faculties, that is, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Arts and Science, and the Faculty of Public Administration.
[[File:PolSciCUFront.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|Samranraj Borirak Building, the first building of the faculty ]]

In 1929 after the promulgation of the new Civil Service Act the popularity of the Faculty of Public Administration decreased significantly. The Act did not require applicants to hold university qualification to apply for first level entry of public service. Holders of ordinary secondary school certificate (equivalent to Grade 11) could also enter to the same level, while the students choosing to enter the Faculty had to pass advanced secondary certificate (equivalent to Grade 12) plus 3 years at the university before starting their career. The nadir of its popularity could be seen by only 35 students enrolling in that year. Therefore, the Ministry of Education proposed to [[King Prajadhipok]] to discontinue the Faculty after the completion of its last class. The King initially endorsed the proposal. However, many government officials especially from the Ministry of Interior appealed to the King to reconsider his decision as they still saw the necessity and usefulness of producing graduates in this field. The committee for reconsidering this issue was set up and finally agreed that the Faculty should be continued on the proviso that its admission and curriculum must be revamped. The name of the Faculty was changed to the School of Civil Service and directly overseen by the Office of the President of Chulalongkorn University. In 1933, the Law School of the Ministry of Justice was incorporated into the School, thereafter renamed together the "Faculty of Law and Political Science.

Following the collapse of the absolute monarchy in 1932, the [[University of Moral and Political Science]] (later called [[Thammasat University]]) was established. Then, the Faculty of Law and Political Science of Chulalongkorn University was transferred to be under this new university. The Faculty of Law and Political Science was therefore temporarily disappeared from Chulalongkorn University's academic structure.

In 1948, the government viewed that there was still need for more graduates for public administration, then agreed to re-establish the Faculty of Political Science in Chulalongkorn University in that same year. The new phase of the Faculty of Political Science then began and has progressively developed until today.

The then Faculty of Political Science comprised 3 divisions, that is, Political Science Division, Public Finance Division, and Law Division. Later on, Public Finance Division was merged with Economics Division of the Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy to become the Faculty of Economics in 1971. Also, Law Division was upgraded to the Faculty of Law in 1972. After these splits, the Faculty has mainly focused in teaching modern [[political science]] discipline.

==Academic Administration==
Currently, the Faculty of Political Science organises its academic disciplines into 4 departments, that is,&lt;br /&gt;
1. Department of [[Government]]&lt;br /&gt;
2. Department of [[International Relations]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. Department of [[Public Administration]]&lt;br /&gt;
4. Department of [[Sociology]] and [[Anthropology]]

The Faculty offers undergraduate ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) and postgraduate degrees ([[Master of Arts|MA]], [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]] and [[PhD]]), including an international master programme in International Development Studies taught in English.

There are also a number of research centres under the Faculty including Policy and Management Development Institute (PMDI), Institute of Security and International Studies (ISIS), Public Enterprise Institute (PEI), Centre for Social Development Studies (CSDS), Institute of Local Government Initiatives (ILGI), and Thai Politics Research Centre (TPRC).

The Faculty has also run a prominent academic journal namely Journal of Social Science for over 35 years. The published articles are both written in Thai and English.

==Logo==
The black singha is used as a symbol of the dedicated leader. The black colour symbolises the colour of the neck of [[Shiva]] who drinks the poison churned up from the world ocean ([[Halahala]]) to protect and save all creatures. (In fact, the actual colour of Shiva's neck in Hindu mythology is deeply dark blue or "nila". That's why one of his names is Nilakantha or "having a blue-coloured neck". However, "nila" in Thai (normally pronounced "nin") becomes a simply black colour). Singha is a mythical animal that rules the [[Himmapan]] forest representing the great ruler or leader. These symbolic meanings convey the fact that the Faculty aims at producing qualified graduates who will be leading figures in the society in any respect with passion and dedication to help improve people's quality of life as their foremost principle.

'''Fat fetishism''' is [[sexual attraction]] to [[overweight]] or [[obesity|obese]] people due to their weight and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/t-magazine/22face-merkin-t.html|title=The F Word|first=Daphne|last=Merkin|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-excess/201506/the-fat-fetish-explained|title=The Fat Fetish, Explained|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of fat fetishism is ''feederism'' or ''gaining'', where sexual gratification is obtained not from the fat itself but from the process of gaining, or helping others gain, [[body fat]]. Fat fetishism also incorporates ''stuffing'' and ''padding'', whereas the focus of [[sexual arousal|arousal]] is on the sensations and properties of a real or ''simulated'' gain.

==Attraction==
[[File:Fa attraction.svg|thumb|Physical attraction of 47 male [[fat admiration|fat admirers]] (FA, in red) towards 10 female figures from the given [[Body mass index|BMI]] range, compared with a control group (CG, in blue)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00224490802645302| pmid = 19116865| title = Big Beautiful Women: The Body Size Preferences of Male Fat Admirers| journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]]| volume = 46| issue = 1| pages = 89–96| year = 2009| last1 = Swami | first1 = V. | last2 = Tovée | first2 = M. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A 2009 study found that heterosexual male [[fat admiration|fat admirers]] preferred females that were clinically overweight and rated both overweight and obese women more positively than slighter individuals. The study also found that participants reacted positively to a much wider range of figures than a control group, even rating emaciated figures higher. It concludes "these findings suggest that an explanation for fat admiration may be that [[fat admiration|FAs]] are rejecting sociocultural norms of attractiveness".&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swami|first=Viren|author2=Tovee, Martin J.|title=Big beautiful women: the body size preferences of male fat admirers.|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|date=1 January 2009|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Big+beautiful+women:+the+body+size+preferences+of+male+fat+admirers-a0196534094|accessdate=25 November 2010|doi=10.1080/00224490802645302|volume=46|pages=89–96|pmid=19116865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaining and feeding==
Gainers and feedees are people who enjoy the fantasy or reality of gaining weight themselves. Encouragers and feeders enjoy the fantasy of helping someone else gain weight. Gainer and encourager are common labels among gay men, while both straight men and women as well as lesbian women often identify as feeders and feedees.&lt;ref name="Bestard"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bestard|first=Alyshia|title=Feederism: an exploratory study into the stigma of erotic weight gain.|journal=University of Waterloo Thesis Paper|date=September 2008|url=https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/3985|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gainers and feedees have a wide array of personal weight-gain goals--only 10 percent of gainers and 13 percent of feedees express interest in immobility as a fantasy or reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.feabie.com/Home/Community|title=Feabie|website=Feabie|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grommr.com/Home/Community#gainer-report|title=Grommr|website=Grommr|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[gaining and feeding]] are often considered fetishes, many within the gainer and feederism communities report viewing them more as a lifestyle, identity or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Bestard"/&gt; 

The gay gainer community grew out of the [[Girth &amp; Mirth]] movement in the 70s. By 1988 there were gainer-specific newsletters and in 1992, the first gainer event, called EncourageCon, was held in New Hope, PA. In 1996, GainRWeb launched, the first website dedicated to gay men into weight gain, ushering in the internet era.&lt;ref name="Textor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Textor|first=Alex Robertson|title=Organization, Specialization, and Desires in the Big Men's Movement: Preliminary Research in the Study of Subculture-Formation.|journal=International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies|date=July 1999|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1023223013536|volume=4|pages=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fir wave''' is a set of alternating bands of [[fir]] [[tree]]s in sequential stages of development, observed in [[forest]]s on exposed [[mountain]] slopes in several areas, including northeastern [[North America]] and [[Japan]]. Fir waves develop by wave-regeneration following wind [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], and is one of various types of [[patterned vegetation]].

==Formation==
Fir waves form by the [[ecology|ecological]] process of wave-regeneration. When a tree falls, a [[gap (ecology)|gap]] in the canopy is formed. This exposes trees at the [[leeward]] edge of the gap to greater wind. These trees are thus more likely to die from damage and desiccation than [[windward]] trees. These leeward trees eventually die, gradually expanding the gap downwind. At the same time, young trees start to grow in the wind shadow in the windward portion of the gap, protected from the high winds by the surviving trees. The combination of dying trees at the leeward edge and regenerating trees at the windward edge results in the propagation of the fir waves in the direction of the predominant prevailing wind. The period of the waves is variable, typically about 60 years in [[Balsam Fir]] (''Abies balsamea'').  One can view these from the Appalachian Trail as it ascends the Hunt Spur of [[Mount Katahdin]] in [[Maine]].  "Looking out to the Owl" and "The Brothers" are extensive areas of this phenomenon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3646">'''Floating population''' is a terminology used to describe a group of people who reside in a given population for a certain amount of time and for various reasons, but are not generally considered part of the official census count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Francesco Sisci|title=China's Achilles' heel: The 'floating population'|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/EE17Ad01.html|newspaper=Asia Times Online Co, Ltd.|date=May 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[population]] is usually broken down into two categories—the residents, who permanently stay in an area for a considerable amount of time and are part of the official [[population census|population count]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doris Fischer|title=China im Zeichen von Globalisierung und Entwicklung|year=2002|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|pages=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEIOIgl5GXUC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=floating+population+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z2hrb8fVey&amp;sig=m7mYBLvJZE68jj1HtWfBuLvWr9U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w8KuTvf8Nqf30gGlp7TDDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=floating%20population%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the floating types, who are in the area but do not live there permanently and are not considered part of the official census count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floating|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-floating.html|publisher=The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English (2009)|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The residing population of a [[city]] can be sub-classified into two groups, one who permanently resides in a city for a considerably long duration of time like ten to fifteen years, and the others are those, like hostel [[students]] and transferable government servants, who might live for two to three years in a given area, as per their requirements, but are replaced by an equal number of new population for the same purpose after their departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shinichi Ichimura|title=Decentralization policies in Asian development|year=2009|publisher=World Scientific|pages=414|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FS_C2RSKLPIC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=floating+population+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xpf3HBN3TX&amp;sig=ltcL8TTdpBTk0y-Zt3N1bueT-fQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w8KuTvf8Nqf30gGlp7TDDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=floating%20population%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, at any given time the number of people under this category remains more or less the same. The floating population, on the other hand, of a city consists of two types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xizhe Peng|title=The changing population of China|year=2000|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWiyiohL8_cC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=floating+population+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Qm7iaNZ5y&amp;sig=6LmwM2RaAJP1Mj1qKlrbzOKSZ0U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w8KuTvf8Nqf30gGlp7TDDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=floating%20population%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first category is those who visit a place regularly but do not stay in that area permanently or long enough to be considered official, like any person working in a city for a short time job. The second type consists of visitors or guests who might live for a small span of time, but their time of stay and their next visit are not predictable, like [[tourists]] and seasonal [[wikt:visitor|visitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4.3 ANALYSIS OF FLOATING POPULATION|url=http://www.dudh.gov.bt/gelephu/part4/4.3.htm|publisher=Department of Urban Development &amp; Engineering Services|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47231">'''Functionalism''' is a view in the [[philosophy of the mind|theory of the mind]]. It states that mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.) are constituted solely by their functional role – that is, they have causal relations to other mental states, numerous sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs.&lt;ref name="Block1996"&gt;Block, Ned. (1996). "What is functionalism?" a revised version of the entry on functionalism in ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy Supplement'', Macmillan. 
([http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/functionalism.pdf PDF online])&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalism developed largely as an alternative to the [[identity theory of mind]] and [[behaviorism]].

Functionalism is a theoretical level between the physical implementation and behavioral output.&lt;ref name="Marr1982"&gt;Marr, D. (1982). ''Vision: A Computational Approach''. San Francisco: Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is different from its predecessors of [[Cartesian dualism]] (advocating independent mental and physical substances) and Skinnerian [[behaviorism]] and [[physicalism]] (declaring only physical substances) because it is only concerned with the effective functions of the brain, through its organization or its "software programs".

Since mental states are identified by a functional role, they are said to be realized on multiple levels; in other words, they are able to be manifested in various systems, even perhaps computers, so long as the system performs the appropriate functions. While computers are physical devices with electronic substrate that perform [[computation]]s on inputs to give outputs, so brains are physical devices with neural substrate that perform computations on inputs which produce behaviors.

==Multiple realizability==
An important part of some accounts of functionalism is the idea of [[multiple realizability]]. Since, according to standard functionalist theories, mental states are the corresponding functional role, mental states can be sufficiently explained without taking into account the underlying physical medium (e.g. the brain, neurons, etc.) that realizes such states; one need only take into account the higher-level functions in the cognitive system. Since mental states are not limited to a particular medium, they can be realized in multiple ways, including, theoretically, within non-biological systems, such as computers. In other words, a silicon-based machine could, in principle, have the same sort of mental life that a human being has, provided that its cognitive system realized the proper functional roles. Thus, mental states are individuated much like a valve; a valve can be made of plastic or metal or whatever material, as long as it performs the proper function (say, controlling the flow of liquid through a tube by blocking and unblocking its pathway).

However, there have been some functionalist theories that combine with the identity theory of mind, which deny multiple realizability. Such ''Functional Specification Theories'' (FSTs) (Levin, § 3.4), as they are called, were most notably developed by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]&lt;ref name="Lewis1980"&gt;Lewis, David. (1980). "Mad Pain and Martian Pain". In Block (1980a) Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;216–222.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Malet Armstrong]].&lt;ref name="Armstrong1968"&gt;Armstrong, D.M. (1968). ''A Materialistic Theory of the Mind''. London: RKP.&lt;/ref&gt; According to FSTs, mental states are the particular "realizers" of the functional role, not the functional role itself.  The mental state of belief, for example, just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function.  Thus, unlike standard versions of functionalism (often called ''Functional State Identity Theories''), FSTs do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states, because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential.  What often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans' (e.g., silicon-based) but performed the same functions as human mental states (e.g., they tend to yell "Yowzass!" when poked with sharp objects, etc.) then we would say that their type of mental state is perhaps similar to ours, but too different to say it's the same. For some, this may be a disadvantage to FSTs. Indeed, one of [[Hilary Putnam]]'s&lt;ref name="Putnam1960"&gt;Putnam, Hilary. (1960). "Minds and Machines". Reprinted in Putnam (1975a).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Putnam1967"&gt;Putnam, Hilary. (1967). "Psychological Predicates". In ''Art, Mind, and Religion'', W.H. Capitan and D.D. Merrill (eds.), pp.&amp;nbsp;37–48. (Later published as "The Nature of Mental States" in Putnam (1975a).&lt;/ref&gt; arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do, and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind.

==Types==

===Machine-state functionalism===
[[Image:Maquina.png|thumb|right| Artistic representation of a [[Turing machine]].]]
The broad position of "functionalism" can be articulated in many different varieties. The first formulation of a functionalist theory of mind was put forth by [[Hilary Putnam]]&lt;ref name="Putnam1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Putnam1967"/&gt; in the 1960s. This formulation, which is now called '''machine-state functionalism''', or just '''machine functionalism''', was inspired by the analogies which Putnam and others noted between the [[mind]] and the theoretical "machines" or computers capable of computing any given [[algorithm]] which were developed by [[Alan Turing]] (called '''[[Turing machine]]s'''). It should be noted that Putnam himself, by the mid-1970s, had begun questioning this position. The beginning of his opposition to machine-state functionalism can be read about in his [[Twin Earth thought experiment]].

In non-technical terms, a Turing machine is not a physical object, but rather an abstract machine built upon a mathematical model. Typically, a Turing Machine has a horizontal tape divided into rectangular cells arranged from left to right. The tape itself is infinite in length, and each cell may contain a symbol. The symbols used for any given "machine" can vary. The machine has a ''read-write head'' that scans cells and moves in left and right directions. The action of the machine is determined by the symbol in the cell being scanned and a table of transition rules that serve as the machine's programming. Because of the infinite tape, a traditional Turing Machine has an infinite amount of time to compute any particular function or any number of functions. In the below example, each cell is either blank (''B'') or has a ''1'' written on it. These are the inputs to the machine. The possible outputs are:

*Halt: Do nothing.
*''R'': move one square to the right.
*''L'': move one square to the left.
*''B'': erase whatever is on the square.
*''1'': erase whatever is on the square and print a '1''.

An extremely simple example of a Turing machine which
writes out the sequence '111' after scanning three blank squares and then stops as specified by the following machine table:

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|  ||'''State One''' || '''State Two''' || '''State Three'''
|-
|B || write 1; stay in state 1 || write 1; stay in state 2 || write 1; stay in state 3
|-
|1 || go right; go to state 2 || go right; go to state 3 || [halt]
|-
|}

This table states that if the machine is in state one and scans a blank square (''B''), it will print a ''1'' and remain in state one. If it is in state one and reads a ''1'', it will move one square to the right and also go into state two. If it is in state two and reads a ''B'', it will print a ''1'' and stay in state two. If it is in state two and reads a ''1'', it will move one square to the right and go into state three. If it is in state three and reads a ''B'', it prints a ''1'' and remains in state three. Finally, if it is in state three and reads a ''1'', then it will stay in state three.

The essential point to consider here is the ''nature of the states'' of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined exclusively in terms of its relations to the other states as well as inputs and outputs. State one, for example, is simply the state in which the machine, if it reads a ''B'', writes a ''1'' and stays in that state, and in which, if it reads a ''1'', it moves one square to the right and goes into a different state. This is the functional definition of state one; it is its causal role in the overall system. The details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. 

The above point is critical to an understanding of machine-state functionalism. Since Turing machines are not required to be physical systems, "anything capable of going through a succession of states in time can be a Turing machine".&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. (1967). “The Mental Life of Some Machines,” in H.-N. Castaneda (Ed.), Intentionality, Minds, and Perception. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Because biological organisms “go through a succession of states in time”, any such organisms could also be equivalent to Turing machines.  

According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the Turing machine states described above. If one can show the rational functioning and computing skills of these machines to be comparable to the rational functioning and computing skills of human beings, it follows that Turing machine behavior closely resembles that of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. (1967). “The Mental Life of Some Machines,” in H.-N. Castaneda (Ed.), Intentionality, Minds, and Perception. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, pp. 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is not a particular physical-chemical composition responsible for the particular machine or mental state, it is the programming rules which produce the effects that are responsible. To put it another way, any rational preference is due to the rules being followed, not to the specific material composition of the agent.

===Psycho-functionalism===
A second form of functionalism is based on the rejection of [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] theories in psychology and their replacement with empirical cognitive models of the mind. This view is most closely associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] and has been labeled '''psycho-functionalism'''.

The fundamental idea of psycho-functionalism is that psychology is an irreducibly complex science and that the terms that we use to describe the entities and properties of the mind in our best psychological theories cannot be redefined in terms of simple behavioral dispositions, and further, that such a redefinition would not be desirable or salient were it achievable. Psychofunctionalists view psychology as employing the same sorts of irreducibly [[teleology|teleological]] or purposive explanations as the biological sciences. Thus, for example, the function or role of the heart is to pump blood, that of the kidney is to filter it and to maintain certain chemical balances and so on—this is what accounts for the purposes of scientific explanation and taxonomy. There may be an infinite variety of physical realizations for all of the mechanisms, but what is important is only their role in the overall biological theory. In an analogous manner, the role of mental states, such as belief and desire, is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best ''scientific'' psychological theory. If some mental state which is postulated by [[folk psychology]] (e.g. hysteria) is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation, then that particular state may be considered not to exist .
On the other hand, if it turns out that there are states which theoretical cognitive psychology posits as necessary for explanation of human behavior but which are not foreseen by ordinary folk psychological language, then these entities or states exist.

===Analytic functionalism===
A third form of functionalism is concerned with the meanings of theoretical terms in general. This view is most closely associated with [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] and is often referred to as '''analytic functionalism''' or '''conceptual functionalism'''. The basic idea of analytic functionalism is that theoretical terms are implicitly defined by the theories in whose formulation they occur and not by intrinsic properties of the phonemes they comprise. In the case of ordinary language terms, such as "belief", "desire", or "hunger", the idea is that such terms get their meanings from our common-sense "folk psychological" theories about them, but that such conceptualizations are not sufficient to withstand the rigor imposed by materialistic theories of reality and causality. Such terms are subject to conceptual analyses which take something like the following form:

:Mental state M is the state that is preconceived by P and causes Q.

For example, the state of '''pain''' is ''caused'' by sitting on a tack and ''causes'' loud cries, and higher order mental states of anger and resentment directed at the careless person who left a tack lying around. These sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be ''[[Logical truth|analytic]]'' and ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths about the submental states and the (largely fictitious) propositional attitudes they describe. Hence, its proponents are known as ''analytic'' or ''conceptual'' functionalists. The essential difference between analytic and psychofunctionalism is that the latter emphasizes the importance of laboratory observation and experimentation in the determination of which mental state terms and concepts are genuine and which functional identifications may be considered to be genuinely [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' identities. The former, on the other hand, claims that such identities are [[Logical truth|necessary]] and not subject to empirical scientific investigation.

===Homuncular functionalism===
'''Homuncular functionalism''' was developed largely by [[Daniel Dennett]] and has been advocated by [[William Lycan]]. It arose in response to the challenges that [[Ned Block]]'s [[China Brain]] (a.k.a. Chinese nation) and [[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism (see below under "Criticism"). In attempting to overcome the conceptual difficulties that arose from the idea of a nation full of Chinese people wired together, each person working as a single neuron to produce in the wired-together whole the functional mental states of an individual mind, many functionalists simply bit the bullet, so to speak, and argued that such a Chinese nation would indeed possess all of the qualitative and intentional properties of a mind; i.e. it would become a sort of systemic or collective mind with propositional attitudes and other mental characteristics. Whatever the worth of this latter hypothesis, it was immediately objected that it [[logical consequence|entailed]] an unacceptable sort of mind-mind supervenience: the ''systemic'' mind which somehow emerged at the higher-level must necessarily supervene on the individual minds of each individual member of the Chinese nation, to stick to Block's formulation. But this would seem to put into serious doubt, if not directly contradict, the fundamental idea of the supervenience thesis: there can be no change in the mental realm without some change in the underlying physical substratum. This can be easily seen if we label the set of [[mental fact]]s that occur at the higher-level ''M1'' and the set of mental facts that occur at the lower-level ''M2''. Given the transitivity of supervenience, if ''M1'' supervenes on ''M2'', and ''M2'' supervenes on ''P'' (physical base), then ''M1'' and ''M2'' both supervene on ''P'', even though they are (allegedly) totally different sets of mental facts.

Since mind-mind supervenience seemed to have become acceptable in functionalist circles, it seemed to some that the only way to resolve the puzzle was to postulate the existence of an entire hierarchical series of mind levels (analogous to [[homunculi]]) which became less and less sophisticated in terms of functional organization and physical composition all the way down to the level of the physico-mechanical neuron or group of neurons. The homunculi at each level, on this view, have authentic mental properties but become simpler and less intelligent as one works one's way down the hierarchy.

===Mechanistic functionalism===

Mechanistic functionalism, originally formulated and defended by [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]&lt;ref name="Piccinini, G. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Piccinini G | year = 2010 | title = The mind as neural software? Understanding functionalism, computationalism, and computational functionalism | url = | journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 269–311 | doi = 10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00356.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carl Gillett&lt;ref&gt;Gillett, C. (2007). “A Mechanist Manifesto for the Philosophy of Mind: The Third Way for Functionalists”. Journal of Philosophical Research, invited symposium on “Mechanisms in the Philosophy of Mind”, vol.32, pp. 21-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillett, C. (2013). “Understanding the Sciences through the Fog of ‘Functionalism(s)’”. In Hunneman (ed.) Functions: Selection and Mechanisms. Dordrecht: Kluwer, pp.159-81.&lt;/ref&gt; independently, augments previous functionalist accounts of mental states by maintaining that any psychological explanation must be rendered in mechanistic terms. That is, instead of mental states receiving a purely functional explanation in terms of their relations to other mental states, like those listed above, functions are seen as playing only a part—the other part being played by structures— of the explanation of a given mental state.
 
A mechanistic explanation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Machamer P. | author2 = Darden L. | author3 = Craver C. F. | year = 2000 | title = Thinking about mechanisms | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 67 | issue = 1| pages = 1–25 | doi=10.1086/392759}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves decomposing a given system, in this case a mental system, into its component physical parts, their activities or functions, and their combined organizational relations.&lt;ref name="Piccinini, G. 2010"/&gt; On this account the mind remains a functional system, but one that is understood mechanistically. This account remains a sort of functionalism because functional relations are still essential to [[Cognitive psychology|mental states]], but it is mechanistic because the functional relations are always manifestations of concrete structures—albeit structures understood at a certain level of abstraction. Functions are individuated and explained either in terms of the contributions they make to the given system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Craver C. F. | year = 2001 | title = Role functions, mechanisms, and hierarchy | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 53–74 | doi=10.1086/392866}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[teleological]] terms. If the functions are understood in teleological terms, then they may be characterized either [[etiological]]ly or non-etiologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maley C. J. | author2 = Piccinini G. | year = 2013 | title = Get the Latest Upgrade: Functionalism 6.3.1 | url = | journal = Philosophia Scientiae | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 135–149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Mechanistic functionalism leads functionalism away from the traditional functionalist autonomy of psychology from neuroscience and towards integrating psychology and neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Piccinini G. | author2 = Craver C. F. | year = 2011 | title = Integrating psychology and neuroscience: Functional analyses as mechanism sketches | url = | journal = Synthese | volume = 183 | issue = 3| pages = 283–311 | doi = 10.1007/s11229-011-9898-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing an applicable framework for merging traditional psychological models with neurological data, mechanistic functionalism may be understood as reconciling the functionalist theory of mind with neurological accounts of how the brain actually works. This is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states (mental states) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms.

==Physicalism==
There is much confusion about the sort of relationship that is claimed to exist (or not exist) between the general thesis of functionalism and [[physicalism]]. It has often been claimed that functionalism somehow "disproves" or falsifies physicalism ''[[tout court]]'' (i.e. without further explanation or description). On the other hand, most philosophers of mind who are functionalists claim to be physicalists—indeed, some of them, such as David Lewis, have claimed to be strict reductionist-type physicalists.

Functionalism is fundamentally what Ned Block has called a broadly metaphysical thesis as opposed to a narrowly [[ontological]] one.  That is, functionalism is not so much concerned with ''what there is'' than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state, e.g. pain, as the type of state that it is. Previous attempts to answer the mind-body problem have all tried to resolve it by answering ''both'' questions: dualism says there are two substances and that mental states are characterized by their immateriality; behaviorism claimed that there was one substance and that mental states were behavioral disposition; physicalism asserted the existence of just one substance and characterized the mental states as physical states (as in "pain = C-fiber firings").

On this understanding, '''type physicalism''' can be seen as incompatible with functionalism, since it claims that what characterizes mental states (e.g. pain) is that they are physical in nature, while functionalism says that what characterizes pain is its functional/causal role and its relationship with yelling "ouch", etc. However, any weaker sort of physicalism which makes the simple ontological claim that everything that exists is made up of physical matter is perfectly compatible with functionalism. Moreover,  most functionalists who are physicalists require that the properties that are quantified over in functional definitions be physical properties. Hence, they ''are'' physicalists, even though the general thesis of functionalism itself does not commit them to being so.

In the case of David Lewis, there is a distinction in the concepts of "having pain" (a [[rigid designator]] true of the same things in all possible worlds) and just "pain" (a non-rigid designator). Pain, for Lewis, stands for something like the definite description "the state with the causal role x". The referent of the description in humans is a type of brain state to be determined by science. The referent among silicon-based life forms is something else. The referent of the description among angels is some immaterial, non-physical state. For Lewis, therefore, ''local'' type-physical reductions are possible and compatible with conceptual functionalism. (See also Lewis's [[mad pain and Martian pain]].) There seems to be some confusion between types and tokens that needs to be cleared up in the functionalist analysis.

==Criticism==

=== China brain ===
{{Main|China brain}}
Ned Block&lt;ref name="Block1980b"&gt;Block, Ned. (1980b). "Troubles With Functionalism", in (1980a).&lt;/ref&gt; argues against the functionalist proposal of [[multiple realizability]], where hardware implementation is irrelevant because only the functional level is important.  The "China brain" or "Chinese nation" thought experiment involves supposing that the entire nation of China systematically organizes itself to operate just like a brain, with each individual acting as a neuron.  (The tremendous difference in speed of operation of each unit is not addressed.). According to functionalism, so long as the people are performing the proper functional roles, with the proper causal relations between inputs and outputs, the system will be a real mind, with mental states, consciousness, and so on. However, Block argues, this is patently absurd, so there must be something wrong with the thesis of functionalism since it would allow this to be a legitimate description of a mind.

Some functionalists believe China would have qualia but that due to the size it is impossible to imagine China being conscious.&lt;ref name="Lycan1987"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lycan | first = William | title = Consciousness | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780262121248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it may be the case that we are constrained by our [[theory of mind]]&lt;ref ="see, eg" name="BCLF1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20%26%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and will never be able to understand what Chinese-nation consciousness is like.

===The Chinese room===
{{Main|Chinese room}}

The [[Chinese room]] argument by [[John Searle]]&lt;ref name="Searle1980"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Searle, John |year=1980 |title=Minds, Brains and Programs |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=3 |url=http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.searle2.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221025515/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.searle2.html |archivedate=2001-02-21 |df= | doi = 10.1017/s0140525x00005756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. The thought experiment asserts that it is possible to mimic intelligent action without any interpretation or understanding through the use of a purely functional system. In short, Searle describes a person who only speaks English who is in a room with only Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around.  The person is then ordered by people outside of the room to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. Further suppose that the people outside of the room are Chinese speakers and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols.  According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside knows Chinese simply based on these syntactic processes.  This thought experiment attempts to show that systems which operate merely on syntactic processes (inputs and outputs, based on algorithms) cannot realize any semantics (meaning) or intentionality (aboutness).  Thus, Searle attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules; that is, functionalism is an insufficient theory of the mind.

As noted above, in connection with Block's Chinese nation, many functionalists responded to Searle's [[thought experiment]] by suggesting that there was a form of mental activity going on at a higher level than the man in the Chinese room could comprehend (the so-called "system reply"); that is, the system does know Chinese. Of course, Searle responds that there is nothing more than syntax going on at the higher-level as well, so this reply is subject to the same initial problems. Furthermore, Searle suggests the man in the room could simply memorize the rules and symbol relations. Again, though he would convincingly mimic communication, he would be aware only of the symbols and rules, not of the meaning behind them.

===Inverted spectrum===
{{Main|Inverted spectrum}}

Another main criticism of functionalism is the [[inverted spectrum]] or inverted [[qualia]] scenario, most specifically proposed as an objection to functionalism by Ned Block.&lt;ref name=Block1980b/&gt;&lt;ref name="BF1972"&gt;Block, Ned and Fodor, J. (1972). "What Psychological States Are Not". ''Philosophical Review'' 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This thought experiment involves supposing that there is a person, call her Jane, that is born with a condition which makes her see the opposite spectrum of light that is normally perceived. Unlike normal people, Jane sees the color violet as yellow, orange as blue, and so forth. So, suppose, for example, that you and Jane are looking at the same orange.  While you perceive the fruit as colored orange, Jane sees it as colored blue.  However, when asked what color the piece of fruit is, both you and Jane will report "orange".  In fact, one can see that all of your behavioral as well as functional relations to colors will be the same.  Jane will, for example, properly obey traffic signs just as any other person would, even though this involves the color perception. Therefore, the argument goes, since there can be two people who are functionally identical, yet have different mental states (differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects), functionalism is not robust enough to explain individual differences in qualia.&lt;ref name="Block1994"&gt;Block, Ned. (1994). Qualia. In S. Guttenplan (ed), ''A Companion to Philosophy of Mind''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Chalmers]] tries to show&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1996"&gt;Chalmers, David. (1996). ''The Conscious Mind''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that even though mental content cannot be fully accounted for in functional terms, there is nevertheless a ''nomological correlation'' between mental states and functional states in this world. A silicon-based robot, for example, whose functional profile matched our own, would ''have'' to be fully conscious. His argument for this claim takes the form of a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''. The general idea is that since it would be very unlikely for a conscious human being to experience a change in its qualia which it utterly fails to notice, mental content and functional profile appear to be inextricably bound together, at least in the human case. If the subject's qualia were to change, we would expect the subject to notice, and therefore his functional profile to follow suit. A similar argument is applied to the notion of [[Absent qualia|''absent'' qualia]]. In this case, Chalmers argues that it would be very unlikely for a subject to experience a fading of his qualia which he fails to notice and respond to. This, coupled with the independent assertion that a conscious being's functional profile just could be maintained, irrespective of its experiential state, leads to the conclusion that the subject of these experiments would remain fully conscious. The problem with this argument, however, as Brian G. Crabb (2005) has observed, is that it begs the central question: How could Chalmers ''know'' that functional profile can be preserved, for example while the conscious subject's brain is being supplanted with a silicon substitute, unless he already assumes that the subject's possibly changing qualia would not be a determining factor? And while changing or fading qualia in a conscious subject might force changes in its functional profile, this tells us nothing about the case of a permanently inverted or unconscious robot. A subject with inverted qualia from birth would have nothing to notice or adjust to. Similarly, an unconscious functional simulacrum of ourselves (a zombie) would have no experiential changes to notice or adjust to. Consequently, Crabb argues, Chalmers' "fading qualia" and "dancing qualia" arguments fail to establish that cases of permanently inverted or absent qualia are nomologically impossible.

A related critique of the inverted spectrum argument is that it assumes that mental states (differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects) can be independent of the functional relations in the brain. Thus, it [[begs the question]] of functional mental states: its assumption denies the possibility of functionalism itself, without offering any independent justification for doing so. (Functionalism says that mental states are produced by the functional relations in the brain.) This same type of problem—that there is no argument, just an antithetical assumption at their base—can also be said of both the Chinese room and the Chinese nation arguments. Notice, however, that Crabb's response to Chalmers does not commit this fallacy: His point is the more restricted observation that ''even if'' inverted or absent qualia turn out to be nomologically impossible, and it is perfectly possible that we might subsequently discover this fact by other means, Chalmers' argument fails to demonstrate that they are impossible.

"The Meaning of 'Meaning{{'"}}, reprinted in Putnam (1975a).([http://internalism.googlegroups.com/web/Putnam%20-%20The%20meaning%20of%20%27meaning%27.pdf?gda=twdJY1oAAABFSTngQf24Sy1RD7yNn1iVgy3Odg0ZctAT1N_Bh2qhdGG1qiJ7UbTIup-M2XPURDQe1sJTwbuelxnpaL6JzH4yeFMfiRQRvg6UTOJgQe0faGtRc9Sp7hcxNJ_gjwZr8bQ PDF online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618031552/http://internalism.googlegroups.com/web/Putnam%20-%20The%20meaning%20of%20%27meaning%27.pdf?gda=twdJY1oAAABFSTngQf24Sy1RD7yNn1iVgy3Odg0ZctAT1N_Bh2qhdGG1qiJ7UbTIup-M2XPURDQe1sJTwbuelxnpaL6JzH4yeFMfiRQRvg6UTOJgQe0faGtRc9Sp7hcxNJ_gjwZr8bQ |date=June 18, 2013 }})&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for one of the main arguments used against functionalism, although it was originally intended as an argument against [[internalism and externalism|semantic internalism]]. The thought experiment is simple and runs as follows. Imagine a Twin Earth which is identical to Earth in every way but one: water does not have the chemical structure H₂O, but rather some other structure, say XYZ. It is critical, however, to note that XYZ on Twin Earth is still called "water" and exhibits all the same macro-level properties that H₂O exhibits on Earth (i.e., XYZ is also a clear drinkable liquid that is in lakes, rivers, and so on). Since these worlds are identical in every way except in the underlying chemical structure of water, you and your Twin Earth [[doppelgänger]] see exactly the same things, meet exactly the same people, have exactly the same jobs, behave exactly the same way, and so on. In other words, since you share the same inputs, outputs, and relations between other mental states, you are functional duplicates. So, for example, you both believe that water is wet. However, the content of your mental state of believing that water is wet differs from your duplicate's because your belief is of H₂O, while your duplicate's is of XYZ. Therefore, so the argument goes, since two people can be functionally identical, yet have different mental states, functionalism cannot sufficiently account for all mental states.

Most defenders of functionalism initially responded to this argument by attempting to maintain a sharp distinction between internal and external content. The internal contents of propositional attitudes, for example, would consist exclusively in those aspects of them which have no relation with the external world ''and'' which bear the necessary functional/causal properties that allow for relations with other internal mental states. Since no one has yet been able to formulate a clear basis or justification for the existence of such a distinction in mental contents, however, this idea has generally been abandoned in favor of externalist ''causal theories of mental contents'' (also known as [[informational semantics]]). Such a position is represented, for example, by [[Jerry Fodor]]'s account of an "asymmetric causal theory" of mental content. This view simply entails the modification of functionalism to include within its scope a very broad interpretation of input and outputs to include the objects that are the causes of mental representations in the external world.

The twin earth argument hinges on the assumption that experience with an imitation water would cause a different mental state than experience with natural water. However, since no one would notice the difference between the two waters, this assumption is likely false. Further, this basic assumption is directly antithetical to functionalism; and, thereby, the twin earth argument does not constitute a genuine argument: as this assumption entails a flat denial of functionalism itself (which would say that the two waters would not produce different mental states, because the functional relationships would remain unchanged).

===Meaning holism===
Another common criticism of functionalism is that it implies a radical form of [[semantic holism]]. Block and Fodor&lt;ref name="BF1972"/&gt; referred to this as the ''damn/darn problem''. The difference between saying "damn" or "darn" when one smashes one's finger with a hammer can be mentally significant. But since these outputs are, according to functionalism, related to many (if not all) internal mental states, two people who experience the same pain and react with different outputs must share little (perhaps nothing) in common in any of their mental states. But this is counterintuitive; it seems clear that two people share something significant in their mental states of being in pain if they both smash their finger with a hammer, whether or not they utter the same word when they cry out in pain.

Another possible solution to this problem is to adopt a moderate (or molecularist) form of holism. But even if this succeeds in the case of pain, in the case of beliefs and meaning, it faces the difficulty of formulating a distinction between relevant and non-relevant contents (which can be difficult to do without invoking an [[analytic–synthetic distinction]], as many seek to avoid).

===Triviality arguments===

According to Ned Block, if functionalism is to avoid the chauvinism of type-physicalism, it becomes overly liberal in "ascribing mental properties to things that do not in fact have them".&lt;ref name=Block1980b/&gt; As an example, he proposes that the economy of Bolivia might be organized such that the economic states, inputs, and outputs would be isomorphic to a person under some bizarre mapping from mental to economic variables.&lt;ref name=Block1980b/&gt;

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Searle]],&lt;ref name="Searle1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Searle J | year = 1990 | title = Is the brain a digital computer? | url = | journal = Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 21–37 | doi=10.2307/3130074}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chalmers D | year = 1996 | title = Does a rock implement every finite-state automaton? | url = | journal = Synthese | volume = 108 | issue = | pages = 309–333 | doi=10.1007/bf00413692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Copeland1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Copeland J | year = 1996 | title = What is computation? | url = | journal = Synthese | volume = 108 | issue = | pages = 335–359 | doi=10.1007/bf00413693}}&lt;/ref&gt; have offered further arguments that functionalism is trivial, i.e. that the internal structures functionalism tries to discuss turn out to be present everywhere, so that either functionalism turns out to reduce to [[behaviorism]], or to complete triviality and therefore a form of [[panpsychism]]. These arguments typically use the assumption that physics leads to a progression of unique states, and that functionalist realization is present whenever there is a mapping from the proposed set of mental states to physical states of the system. Given that the states of a physical system are always at least slightly unique, such a mapping will always exist, so any system is a mind. Formulations of functionalism which stipulate absolute requirements on interaction with external objects (external to the functional account, meaning not defined functionally) are reduced to behaviorism instead of absolute triviality, because the input-output behavior is still required.

[[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] has argued further&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith2009"&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith, "Triviality Arguments against Functionalism". 2009. Philosophical studies 145 (2). [http://philpapers.org/rec/GODTAA]/{{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~pgs/TrivArgtsFnm-08-Zweb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522022444/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~pgs/TrivArgtsFnm-08-Zweb.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that such formulations can still be reduced to triviality if they accept a somewhat innocent-seeming additional assumption. The assumption is that adding a ''transducer layer'', that is, an input-output system, to an object should not change whether that object has mental states. The transducer layer is restricted to producing behavior according to a simple mapping, such as a lookup table, from inputs to actions on the system, and from the state of the system to outputs. However, since the system will be in unique states at each moment and at each possible input, such a mapping will always exist so there will be a transducer layer which will produce whatever physical behavior is desired.

Godfrey-Smith believes that these problems can be addressed using [[causality#Theories|causality]], but that it may be necessary to posit a continuum between objects being minds and not being minds rather than an absolute distinction. Furthermore, constraining the mappings seems to require either consideration of the external behavior as in behaviorism, or discussion of the internal structure of the realization as in identity theory; and though multiple realizability does not seem to be lost, the functionalist claim of the autonomy of high-level functional description becomes questionable.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith2009"/&gt;

The '''ISO/IEC 15288''' is a [[systems engineering]] standard covering processes and lifecycle stages. Initial planning for the ISO/IEC 15288:2002(E) standard started in 1994 when the need for a common systems engineering process framework was recognized. The previously accepted standard MIL STD 499A (1974) was cancelled after a memo from SECDEF prohibited the use of most [[United States Military Standard]]s without a waiver. The first edition was issued on 1 November 2002. [[Stuart Arnold]] was the editor and [[Harold Lawson]] was the architect of the standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incose.org/?attach_external_tab&amp;217&amp;3&amp;50&amp;50&amp;784&amp;530&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;IE Systems Engineering – Guide for ISO/IEC 15288 (System Life Cycle Processes)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 this standard was adopted as IEEE 15288. ISO/IEC 15288 has been updated 1 February 2008 as well as on 15 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=63711 ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 Systems and software engineering -- System life cycle processes]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO/IEC 15288 is managed by [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7|ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7]], which is the ISO committee responsible for developing ISO standards in the area of Software and Systems Engineering. ISO/IEC 15288 is part of the SC 7 Integrated set of Standards, and other standards in this domain include:
* ISO/IEC TR 15504 which addresses capability
* ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288 which address lifecycle and
* ISO 9001 &amp; ISO 9000-3 which address quality

==History==
* ISO/IEC 15288:2015
* Revises: ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (harmonized with ISO/IEC 12207:2008)
* Revises: ISO/IEC 15288:2002 (first edition)

==Processes==
The standard defines processes divided into four categories:
* Technical
* Project
* Agreement, and
* Enterprise

Each process is defined by a purpose, outcomes, and activities. ISO 15288 comprises 25 processes which have 123 outcomes derived from 403 activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incose.se/old/images/Roedler%20Abstract%20ISO%20IEC%2015288.pdf What is ISO/IEC 15288 and Why Should I Care?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Instituto Carlos III-Juan March''' ('''IC3JM'''), formerly the Advanced Center for Social Science Studies (CEACS), is a research and postgraduate institute for the [[social sciences]]. It is based in the [[Getafe]] campus of [[Carlos III University]] in the [[Madrid metropolitan area]], [[Spain]], and receives funding from both the university and the [[Fundación Juan March]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==History ==

The predecessor organization of IC3JM, the Advanced Center for Social Science Studies (CEACS), opened in 1987 as part of the [[Fundación Juan March]], which supports [[social science]] research along with other cultural objectives.  The Fundation is based in the [[Salamanca (Madrid)|Salamanca]] district of central Madrid. 
CEACS offered master's degrees in social science for Spanish students as well as a programme of four-year grants for students to undertake a master’s and write a doctoral thesis. In 2007, CEACS decided to focus on [[postdoctoral research]] as well, and it offered a three-year research grant to top professors worldwide.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://ic3jm.es/historia.aspx?l=2|website=IC3JM|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the [[Juan March Foundation]] and the [[Carlos III University]] decided to jointly support CEACS, and turned CEACS into the Instituto Carlos III-Juan March (IC3JM), and relocated the campus from [[Salamanca (Madrid)|Salamanca]] in central Madrid to [[Getafe]]; the academic staff, activities, programmes, and library of the former CEACS were absorbed by IC3JM. The two organizations collaborated together to found the institute in its current incarnation; it is located on Carlos III University campus but both organizations contribute funding.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; [[Ignacio Sánchez-Cuenca]] has served as IC3JM's Director since its inception in 2013.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ignacio Sánchez-Cuenca CV|url=http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/dpto_ciencias_sociales/home/faculty/Ignacio%20S%E1nchez-Cuenca/S%C1NCHEZ-CUENCA%20CURRICULUM%20VITAE%20wp.pdf|website=Carlos III University|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic focus==
The '''Instituto Juan March de Estudios e Investigaciones''' is devoted to research in [[social science]] with a focus on [[political economy]], [[voting]] and [[Competition#Competition in politics|party competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan March Institute [http://www.march.es/ceacs/ingles/ceacs.asp website]. Accessed January 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The main lines of research are the study of the social structure and processes of change in advanced contemporary societies, their political and economic systems and cultural and historical roots. The research carried out in the institute focuses above all, on the geographic and cultural area of [[Europe]]. [[Sociology]] and [[Political Science]] are the core disciplines within the institute.

Both teaching and research in the institute are orientated towards methodological issues and comparative approaches in the social sciences. Besides its own research activity, the institute encourages social science research, publishes collections of ''estudios'' (working papers and doctoral theses), runs a specialist library and organizes courses, seminars and other activities for faculty, researchers and students.

==Scientific committee==
The director is [[Ignacio Sánchez-Cuenca]]. 
The institute's scientific committee&lt;ref&gt;Juan March Institute's [http://www.march.es/ceacs/consejo/consejo.asp Scientific Committee] website. Accessed January 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for the supervision of students' research assisting the Instituto Juan March in the definition of the center's academic and [[research policy]], and advising on the development of the teaching curriculum and the library's holdings and services. 
The scientific committee is formed by a number of leading Spanish and international scholars. Members of the scientific committee have included:

* Richard Breen, Fellow of [[Nuffield College]], [[Oxford University]] (2000–09)
*[[Gøsta Esping-Andersen]], Professor of Sociology, [[Pompeu Fabra University]]
*[[José María Maravall]], Professor of Sociology, [[Complutense University of Madrid]]
*[[Jose Ramon Montero|José Ramón Montero]], Professor of Political Science, [[Autonomous University of Madrid]]
*[[Adam Przeworski]], Professor of Political Science and Economics, [[New York University]]
*[[Andrew Richards]], Ph.D. at [[Princeton University]]
*[[Yasemin Soysal]], Professor of Sociology, [[University of Essex]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5609">The '''ischemic (ischaemic) cascade''' is a series of biochemical reactions that are initiated in the [[brain]] and other aerobic tissues after seconds to minutes of [[ischemia]] (inadequate blood supply).&lt;ref name="Becker "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/EMERG/topic558.htm |title=eMedicine - Stroke, Ischemic : Article by Joseph U Becker |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically secondary to [[stroke]], injury, or [[cardiac arrest]] due to [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Most ischemic [[neuron]]s that die do so due to the activation of chemicals produced during and after ischemia.&lt;ref name="Internet Stroke Center"&gt;[http://www.strokecenter.org/ Stroke Center] of the Washington University School of Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; The ischemic cascade usually goes on for two to three hours but can last for days, even after normal blood flow returns.&lt;ref name="NINDS, 1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/stroke/detail_stroke.htm |title=Stroke: Hope Through Research: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[biochemical cascade|cascade]] is a series of events in which one event triggers the next, in a linear fashion. Thus "ischemic cascade" is actually a misnomer, since the events are not always linear: in some cases they are circular, and sometimes one event can cause or be caused by multiple events.&lt;ref name="Hinkle and Bowman, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hinkle JL, Bowman L |title=Neuroprotection for ischemic stroke |journal=J Neurosci Nurs |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=114–8 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12795039 |doi= 10.1097/01376517-200304000-00008|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, cells receiving different amounts of blood may go through different chemical processes. Despite these facts, the ischemic cascade can be generally characterized as follows:

# Lack of oxygen causes the neuron's normal process for making [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for energy to fail.
# The cell switches to [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]], producing [[lactic acid]].
# ATP-reliant [[Ion pump (biology)|ion transport pumps]] fail, causing the cell to become [[action potential|depolarized]], allowing [[ion]]s, including [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), to flow into the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. 
# The ion pumps can no longer transport calcium out of the cell, and intracellular calcium levels get too high. 
# The presence of calcium triggers the release of the excitatory [[amino acid]] [[neurotransmitter]] [[glutamate]]. 
# Glutamate stimulates [[AMPA receptor]]s and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable [[NMDA receptor]]s, which open to allow more calcium into cells. 
# Excess calcium entry overexcites cells and causes the generation of harmful chemicals like [[free radical]]s, [[reactive oxygen species]] and calcium-dependent [[enzyme]]s such as [[calpain]], [[endonuclease]]s, [[ATPase]]s, and [[phospholipase]]s in a process called [[excitotoxicity]].&lt;ref name="conway"&gt;Jill Conway. 2000. "[http://www.med.uiuc.edu/m2/Pathology/DCL.htm Diseases at the Cellular Level Lecture Handout] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050710080912/http://www.med.uiuc.edu/m2/Pathology/DCL.htm |date=2005-07-10 }}" and [http://www.med.uiuc.edu/m2/Pathology/Inflammation%20and%20Repair%20Lecture%20Handout.htm Inflammation and Repair Lecture Handout]" University of Illinois College of Medicine.

# As the cell's membrane is broken down by phospholipases, it becomes more permeable, and more ions and harmful chemicals flow into the cell. 
# [[mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] break down, releasing toxins and [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] factors into the cell. 
# The [[caspase]]-dependent [[apoptosis]] cascade is initiated, causing cells to "commit suicide."
# If the cell dies through [[necrosis]], it releases glutamate and toxic chemicals into the environment around it. Toxins poison nearby [[neuron]]s, and glutamate can overexcite them. 
# If and when the brain is reperfused, a number of factors lead to [[reperfusion injury]]. 
# An [[inflammation|inflammatory]] response is mounted, and [[phagocytosis|phagocytic]] cells engulf damaged but still viable tissue.  
# Harmful chemicals damage the [[blood–brain barrier]].
# [[Cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain) occurs due to leakage of large [[molecule]]s like [[albumins]] from blood vessels through the damaged [[blood brain barrier]]. These large molecules pull water into the brain tissue after them by [[osmosis]]. This "[[vasogenic edema]]" causes compression of and damage to brain tissue (Freye 2011; Acquired Mitochondropathy-A New Paradigm in Western Medicine Explaining Chronic Diseases).

==Mitigation of effects==
The fact that the ischemic cascade involves a number of steps has led doctors to suspect that [[Neuroprotection|neuroprotectants]] such as [[calcium channel blocker]]s or [[Glutamate receptor|glutamate]] antagonists could be produced to interrupt the cascade at a single one of the steps, blocking the downstream effects.  Though initial trials for such neuroprotective drugs led many to be hopeful, until recently, human [[clinical trial]]s with neuroprotectants such as [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s were unsuccessful.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The '''Donald E. Knuth Prize''' is a prize for outstanding contributions to the foundations of [[computer science]], named after [[Donald Knuth|Donald E. Knuth]].

==History==
The Knuth Prize has been awarded since 1996 and includes an award of $5000. The prize is awarded by [[ACM SIGACT]] and by [[IEEE Computer Society]]'s Technical Committee on the Mathematical Foundations of Computing. Prizes are awarded in alternation at the ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]] and at the IEEE [[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]], which are among the most prestigious conferences in [[theoretical computer science]].

In contrast with the [[Gödel Prize]], which recognizes outstanding papers, the Knuth Prize is awarded to individuals for their overall impact in the field.

==Winners==
Since the prize was instituted in 1996, it has been awarded to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sigact.org/Prizes/Knuth/ | title = Knuth Prize | publisher = ACM SIGACT | date = February 17, 2014 | accessdate = September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list is limited to programs which teach four or more languages. There are many others which teach one language.

'''Alphabetical Lists of Languages''' show the courses available to learn each language, at Lang1234, Martindale, Omniglot, Rüdiger Köppe, and UCLA. For the thousands of languages not listed on those sites, for which no course exists, [[Global Recordings Network]] has recorded a standard set of Bible stories in 6,000 languages. With effort, learners can study any language by comparing its recordings to the same story in a language they know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographic Language Museum|url=http://foreignlanguageexpertise.com/museum2.html|publisher=[[Alexander Argüelles]] |accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The list below''' shows the number of languages taught by each program, the name of the program, and the number of different languages used for instruction. Multiple languages of instruction may be available for some but not all courses. For example [[Reise Know-How]] uses 6 languages to teach German, but only German to teach the other languages. On the other hand [[Eurotalk]], [[Pronunciator]] and [[50Languages]] use all languages to teach all the other languages.

It forecasts the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD)'s share of the [[Direct election|popular vote]] based on the size of crude steel production in Western Germany:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundestag.de/mdbhome/miersja0/mierscheid_gesetz.pdf |title=19 Jahre Mierscheid-Gesetz – ein ungerades Jubiläum und die Aussichten der SPD bei der Bundestagswahl (19 Years of the Mierscheid Law   an odd numbered anniversary and the chances of the SPD in the national parliamentary elections) |accessdate=2007-05-26 |author=Jakob Mierscheid, Mitglied des Deutschen Bundestages |authorlink=Jakob Maria Mierscheid |date=2002-03-20 |format=pdf |publisher=German Parliament,  Platz der Republik, 11011 Berlin |language=German |quote=Die Formulierung des Mierscheid-Gesetzes selber lautet: "Der Stimmenanteil der SPD richtet sich nach dem Index der deutschen Rohstahlproduktion – gemessen in Mio.

| author = Yassin Musharbash| date = 2005-06-29| work = Spiegel Online| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the West German crude steel production was 38.6 million tonnes, and the vote share of the SPD 38.5%. For the early election in 2005 the vote share was 38.4%, with a mean crude steel value of 40.0 million tonnes.  Over the last ten elections, the two values were within two units nine times, and within one unit seven times.

==Possible refutation of the hypothesis in 2005==

In the [[German federal election, 2005|German federal elections]] of 18 September 2005 (which were originally due to be held in 2006), the law appeared not to hold, since the SPD obtained 34.3% of the relevant votes while the crude steel production of the "old" ''Länder'' (i.e. those states that belonged to the Federal Republic of Germany before reunification) in the previous year was 39.9 million [[tonnes]].

However, an article attributed to Jakob Mierscheid, published on the [[Bundestag|German Federal Parliament's]] website provided a correction to the hypothesis, to take account of the special situation. Since the elections had been brought forward, it was argued that the last months of the year should be discounted, yielding a steel production figure of 33.5 million tonnes. The graph included in the article showed a good match, thus supporting the (corrected) hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bundestag.de/mdb/mierscheid/2005_12_05_hypothese.pdf| title = Vorläufige Hypothese zum Mierscheid-Gesetz (Preliminary hypothesis on the Mierscheid Law)| accessdate = 2007-01-11| author = The legendary Jakob Mierscheid, MdB| authorlink = Jakob Maria Mierscheid| date = 2005-12-13| format = pdf| work = | publisher = Official Web site of the German Bundestag| language = German| quote = | deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080911012233/http://www.bundestag.de/mdb/mierscheid/2005_12_05_hypothese.pdf| archivedate = 2008-09-11| df = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This ''[[ad hoc]]'' hypothesis alteration might be considered an example of the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]].

Following the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 elections]], an article was published by the statistical office of the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] attempting to further refine the model in the form of the Mierscheid-Walla law. This article also mentions promising but inconclusive attempts to replace steel production with other measures that exhibited a degree of apparent [[correlation]], such as the export value of automobiles, employment levels in the field of legal advice, the price of coffee, and the number of accidents on town roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statistik-portal.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/PDF/Beitrag06_03_09.pdf | title = Das Mierscheid-Walla-Gesetz (The Mierscheid-Walla Law) | accessdate = 2007-01-11 | author = Jakob Maria Mierscheid (the legend) | authorlink = Jakob Maria Mierscheid | author2 = Wolfgang Walla | date = March 2006 | format = pdf | work = Statistisches Monatsheft Baden-Württemberg 3/2006 | publisher = Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder (Statistical offices of the German federal government and the states) | language = German | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080911012231/http://www.statistik-portal.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/PDF/Beitrag06_03_09.pdf | archivedate = 2008-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo''' ({{lang-pt|Instituto Oceanográfico da Universidade de São Paulo}}, '''IO-USP'''), due to its name in Portuguese, was founded in 1946. It began as an independent institute, sponsored by the government, but was later incorporated into the [[University of São Paulo]], in 1951. It founded because its creators needed scientific basis to [[fishery]] and exploitation of all the available [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[natural resource|resources]] along the [[Brazil]]ian [[coast]], especially in the state of [[São Paulo]].

IO-USP was transformed into a University Unit in 1972, and started to offer post-graduate Masters courses in biological and [[physical oceanography]] in 1973. It offers an undergraduate course as well, and performs many different researches. Now, the institute has two departments - [[Biological Oceanography]] and Physical, Chemical and Geological Oceanography. The institute has 34 teachers and around 150 general non-teaching workers.

Its current director is [[Michel Michaelovitch de Mahiques]].

== Research vessels ==
[[Image:Profwbesnard.jpg|right|thumb|210px|The W. Besnard Oceanographic Ship out in the ocean.]]
The institution has the support of three major vessels - the W. Besnard Oceanographic Ship, as well as the Albacora and the Veliger, used mostly by the graduation students in their field research.

== Research bases ==

The institute has two research bases - Dr. João de Paiva Carvalho base, in the estuarine city of [[Cananéia]], and the Clarimundo de Jesus base, in the coastal city of [[Ubatuba]]. Both are equipped with advanced laboratories and sufficient research vessels, with the fundamental support of the main vessel, the W. Besnard Oceanographip Ship.

'''PICRUSt'''&lt;ref name="LangilleZaneveld2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langille|first1=Morgan G I|last2=Zaneveld|first2=Jesse|last3=Caporaso|first3=J Gregory|last4=McDonald|first4=Daniel|last5=Knights|first5=Dan|last6=Reyes|first6=Joshua A|last7=Clemente|first7=Jose C|last8=Burkepile|first8=Deron E|last9=Vega Thurber|first9=Rebecca L|last10=Knight|first10=Rob|last11=Beiko|first11=Robert G|last12=Huttenhower|first12=Curtis|title=Predictive functional profiling of microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker gene sequences|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=31|issue=9|year=2013|pages=814–821|issn=1087-0156|doi=10.1038/nbt.2676|pmid=23975157|pmc=3819121|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12064405/3819121.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is a [[bioinformatics]] software package. The name is an abbreviation for ''Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction
of Unobserved States''.

The tool serves in the field of [[metagenomic]] analysis where it allows inference of the functional profile of a [[microbial]]
community based on [[marker gene]] survey along one or more samples. In essence, PICRUSt takes a user supplied [[Operational taxonomic unit|OTU]] table, representing the marker gene sequences (most commonly a [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] [[Cluster analysis|cluster]]) accompanied with its relative abundance in each of the samples. The output of PICRUSt is a sample by functional-gene-count matrix, telling the count of each functional-gene in each of the samples surveyed. The ability of PICRUSt to estimate the functional-gene profile for a given sample relies on a set of known sequenced [[genomes]].  This could also be thought of as an automated alternative to manually researching the gene families likely to be present in organisms whose sequences are found in a [[16S ribosomal RNA]] [[amplicon library]].

==Genome prediction algorithm==

In an initial preprocessing phase, PICRUSt constructs [[confidence intervals]] and point predictions for the number of copies of each gene family in each bacterial and archaeal strain in a reference tree, using organisms with sequenced genomes as a reference. More specifically, for each gene family, PICRUSt maps known gene copy numbers (from complete sequenced genomes) onto a reference tree of life.  These gene family [[copy numbers]] are treated as [[continuous traits]], and an [[evolutionary model]] constructed under the assumption of [[Brownian Motion]]. These evolutionary models can be constructed with either [[Maximum Likelihood]], [[Relaxed Maximum Likelihood]] or [[Wagner Parsimony]]  This evolutionary model is then used to predict both a point estimate and a confidence interval for the copy number of microorganisms without sequenced genomes.  This 'genome prediction' step produces a large table of bacterial types (specifically [[operational taxonomic units]] or OTUs) vs. gene family copy numbers. This table is distributed to end users. It is important to note that this prediction method is not the same as a nearest neighbor approach (i.e. just looking up the nearest sequenced genome), and was shown to give a small but significant improvement in accuracy over that strategy.  However, [[nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor]] prediction is available as an option in PICRUSt.

Notably, while this functionality is typically used for prediction of gene copy numbers in bacteria, it could, in principle, be used for prediction of any other [[continuous trait]] given trait data for diverse organisms and a reference [[phylogeny]].

Langille et al&lt;ref name="LangilleZaneveld2013" /&gt; tested the accuracy of this genome prediction step using leave-one-out cross validation on the input set of sequenced genomes.  Additional tests examined sensitivity to errors in [[phylogenetic inference]], [[lack of genomic data]], and the accuracy of the [[confidence intervals]] on gene content.

A similar step predicts the copy number of [[16S rRNA]] genes.

==Metagenome prediction algorithm==

When applying PICRUSt to a [[16S rRNA]] gene library, PICRUSt matches reference [[operational taxonomic units]] against the tables, and retrieves a predicted 16S rRNA copy number and gene copy number for each gene family.  The abundance of each OTU is divided by its predicted copy number (if a bacterium has multiple 16S copies, its apparent abundance in 16S rRNA data will be inflated), and then multiplied by the copy number of the gene family.  This gives a prediction for the contribution of each OTU to the overall gene content of the sample (the [[metagenome]]). Finally, these individual contributions are summed together to produce an estimate of the genes present in the [[metagenome]].

Langille et al., 2013&lt;ref name="LangilleZaneveld2013" /&gt; tested the accuracy of this genome prediction step by using previously reported datasets in which the same biological sample was subjected to [[16S rRNA gene]] amplification and [[shotgun metagenomics]].  In these cases, the shotgun metagenomic results were taken as a representation of the 'true' community, and the 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries fed into PICRUSt to attempt to predict those data. Test datasets included [[human microbiome]] samples from the [[Human Microbiome Project]], soil samples, diverse mammalian samples, and samples from the [[Guerrero Negro]] [[microbial mats]]

==The Nearest Sequenced Taxon Index==

Because PICRUSt, and [[evolutionary comparative genomics]] in general, depends on sequenced genomes, biological samples from well-studied environments (many sequenced genomes) will be better predicted than poorly studied environments.  In order to assess how many genomes are available, PICRUSt optionally allows users to calculate a Nearest Sequenced Taxon Index (NSTI) for their samples.  This index reflects the average [[phylogenetic distance]] between each [[16S rRNA]] gene sequence in their sample, and a [[16S rRNA]] gene sequence from a fully [[sequenced genome]]. In general, the lower the NSTI score, the more accurate PICRUSt's predictions are expected to be. For example,&lt;ref name="LangilleZaneveld2013" /&gt; showed that PICRUSt was much more accurate on diverse soil samples and samples from the [[Human Microbiome Project]] than on microbial mat samples from  [[Guerrero Negro]], which contained many bacteria without any sequenced relatives.

==Related tools==

Okuda et al., 2012&lt;ref name="Okuda et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms2203 |title=Okuda et al., 2012 | volume=3 | journal=Nature Communications |page=1203|year=2012 |last1=Okuda |first1=Shujiro |last2=Tsuchiya |first2=Yuki |last3=Kiriyama |first3=Chiho |last4=Itoh |first4=Masumi |last5=Morisaki |first5=Hisao }}&lt;/ref&gt; published a similar method that used a bounded k-Nearest Neighbor approach to predict virtual metagenomes. They validated their approach using [[16S rRNA]] gene sequences extracted from [[shotgun metagenomes]], and compared the predictions of their method against the full metagenome.

Benchmarking showed highly similar performance to PICRUSt when compared on the same datasets. One advantage is that all OTUs, not just those in a reference phylogeny table can be used.  One disadvantage is that confidence intervals and evolutionary models are not constructed.

It consists of an array of antenna elements ''(A)'' powered by a [[transmitter]] ''(TX)''.  The feed current for each antenna passes through a [[phase shifter]] ''(φ)'' controlled by a computer ''(C)''.  The moving red lines show the wavefronts of the radio waves emitted by each element.  The individual wavefronts are spherical, but they combine ([[Superposition principle|superpose]]) in front of the antenna to create a [[plane wave]], a beam of radio waves travelling in a specific direction.  The phase shifters delay the radio waves progressively going up the line so each antenna emits its wavefront later than the one below it.  This causes the resulting plane wave to be directed at an angle ''θ'' to the antenna's axis.  By changing the phase shifts the computer can instantly change the angle ''θ'' of the beam.  Most phased arrays have two-dimensional arrays of antennas instead of the linear array shown here, and the beam can be steered in two dimensions.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an array antenna, the radio frequency current from the [[transmitter]] is fed to the individual antennas with the correct [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship so that the radio waves from the separate antennas add together to increase the radiation in a desired direction, while cancelling to suppress radiation in undesired directions.  In a phased array, the power from the transmitter is fed to the antennas through devices called ''[[phase shifter]]s'', controlled by a computer system, which can alter the phase electronically, thus steering the beam of radio waves to a different direction.  Since the array must consist of many small antennas (sometimes thousands) to achieve high gain, phased arrays are mainly practical at the high [[frequency]] end of the radio spectrum, in the [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] and [[microwave]] bands, in which the antenna elements are conveniently small.

Phased arrays were invented for use in military [[radar]] systems, to scan the radar beam quickly across the sky to detect planes and missiles.  These '''phased array radar''' systems are now widely used, and phased arrays are spreading to civilian applications.  The phased array principle is also used in [[acoustics]], and phased arrays of [[transducer|acoustic transducers]] are used in medical [[ultrasound imaging]] scanners ([[phased array ultrasonics]]), [[hydrocarbon exploration|oil and gas prospecting]] ([[reflection seismology]]), and military [[sonar]] systems.

The term is also used to a lesser extent for unsteered [[array antenna]]s in which the phase of the feed power and thus the radiation pattern of the antenna is fixed.&lt;ref name="Visser"&gt;{{cite book

== Types ==
A ''passive phased array'' or ''[[passive electronically scanned array]]'' (PESA) is a phased array in which the antenna elements are connected to a single [[transmitter]] and/or [[radio receiver|receiver]], as shown in the animation at top.  PESAs are the most common type of phased array. 

An ''active phased array'' or ''[[active electronically scanned array]]'' (AESA)  is a phased array in which each antenna element has its own transmitter/receiver unit, all controlled by the computer.  Active arrays are a more advanced, second-generation phased-array technology which are used in military applications; unlike PESAs they can radiate multiple beams of radio waves at multiple frequencies in different directions simultaneously.

A ''[[conformal antenna]]'' is a phased array in which the individual antennas, instead of being arranged in a flat plane, are mounted on a curved surface.  The phase shifters compensate for the different path lengths of the waves due to the antenna elements' varying position on the surface, allowing the array to radiate a plane wave.  Conformal antennas are used in aircraft and missiles, to integrate the antenna into the curving surface of the aircraft to reduce aerodynamic drag.

The relative [[amplitude]]s of—and constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects among—the signals radiated by the individual antennas determine the effective [[radiation pattern]] of the array. A phased array may be used to point a fixed radiation pattern, or to [[wikt:scan|scan]] rapidly in [[azimuth]] or elevation. Simultaneous electrical scanning in both azimuth and elevation was first demonstrated in a phased array antenna at [[Hughes Aircraft Company]], California in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph Spradley, "A Volumetric Electrically Scanned Two-Dimensional Microwave Antenna Array," IRE National Convention Record, Part I – Antennas and Propagation; Microwaves, New York: The Institute of Radio Engineers, 1958, 204–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Broadcasting ===
In [[broadcast engineering]], phased arrays are used by many [[AM broadcasting|AM broadcast]] [[radio stations]] to enhance [[signal strength]] and therefore coverage in the [[city of license]], while minimizing [[Interference (communication)|interference]] to other areas. Due to the differences between daytime and nighttime [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] [[radio propagation|propagation]] at [[mediumwave]] frequencies, it is common for AM broadcast stations to change between day ([[groundwave]]) and night ([[skywave]]) radiation patterns by switching the [[phase (waves)|phase]] and power levels supplied to the individual antenna elements ([[mast radiator]]s) daily at [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. For [[shortwave]] broadcasts many stations use arrays of horizontal dipoles. A common arrangement uses 16 dipoles in a 4×4 array. Usually this is in front of a wire grid reflector. The phasing is often switchable to allow [[Beam steering]] in azimuth and sometimes elevation.

More modest phased array longwire antenna systems may be employed by private radio enthusiasts to receive longwave, mediumwave (AM) and shortwave radio broadcasts from great distances.

On [[VHF]], phased arrays are used extensively for [[FM broadcasting]]. These greatly increase the [[antenna gain]], magnifying the emitted RF energy toward the [[horizon]], which in turn greatly increases a station's [[broadcast range]]. In these situations, the distance to each element from the transmitter is identical, or is one (or other [[integer]]) wavelength apart. Phasing the array such that the lower elements are slightly delayed (by making the distance to them longer) causes a downward [[beam tilt]], which is very useful if the antenna is quite high on a [[radio tower]].

Other phasing adjustments can increase the downward radiation in the [[far field]] without tilting the main [[Side lobe|lobe]], creating [[null fill]] to compensate for extremely high [[mountain]]top locations, or decrease it in the [[near and far field|near field]], to prevent excessive exposure to those workers or even nearby homeowners on the ground.  The latter effect is also achieved by half-wave spacing – inserting additional elements halfway between existing elements with full-wave spacing.  This phasing achieves roughly the same horizontal gain as the full-wave spacing; that is, a five-element full-wave-spaced array equals a nine- or ten-element half-wave-spaced array.

=== Radar ===
Phased array radar systems are also used by [[warships]] of many navies. Because of the rapidity with which the [[Beam steering|beam can be steered]], phased array radars allow a warship to use one [[radar]] system for surface detection and tracking (finding ships), air detection and tracking (finding aircraft and missiles) and missile uplink capabilities. Before using these systems, each [[surface-to-air missile]] in flight required a dedicated [[fire-control radar]], which meant that radar-guided weapons could only engage a small number of simultaneous targets. Phased array systems can be used to control missiles during the mid-course phase of the missile's flight. During the terminal portion of the flight, [[continuous-wave]] fire control directors provide the final guidance to the target. Because the radar beam is [[Beam steering|electronically steered]], phased array systems can direct radar beams fast enough to maintain a [[fire-control system|fire control quality]] track on many targets simultaneously while also controlling several in-flight missiles.

==Mathematical perspective and formulas==

[[File:Phase array sweep.webm|thumb|Radiation pattern of phased array containing 7 emitters spaced a quarter wavelength apart, showing the beam switching direction.  The phase shift between adjacent emitters is switched from 45 degrees to −45 degrees]]

[[File:Phased array radiation pattern.gif|thumb|483x483px|The radiation pattern of a phased array in polar coordinate system.]]
Mathematically a phased array is an example of ''N''-slit [[diffraction]], in which the radiation field at the receiving point is the result of the coherent addition of ''N'' point sources in a line.  Since each individual antenna acts as a slit, emitting radio waves, their diffraction pattern can be calculated by adding the phase shift φ to the fringing term.

We will begin from the ''N''-slit diffraction pattern derived on the [[diffraction formalism]] page, with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; slits of equal size &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and spacing &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
  \psi = \psi_0\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta \right)}
         {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{N}{2}  kd \sin\theta \right)}
         {\sin\left(\frac{kd}{2}    \sin\theta \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, adding a φ term to the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;kd\sin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; fringe effect in the second term yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \psi = \psi_0\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta\right)}
         {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{N}{2} \left(\frac{{2\pi d}}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \phi \right)\right)}
         {\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \phi \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the square of the wave function gives us the intensity of the wave.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I &amp;= I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta\right)}
                      {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}
           \right)^2
           \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{N}{2} \left(\frac{2\pi d}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \phi\right)\right)}
                      {\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \phi \right)}
           \right)^2 \\
  I &amp;= I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta\right)}
                                {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}
           \right)^2
           \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi  }{\lambda} Nd \sin\theta + \frac{N}{2} \phi\right)}
                      {\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda}    \sin\theta + \phi \right)}\right)^2  
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now space the emitters a distance &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d = \frac{\lambda}{4}&lt;/math&gt; apart.  This distance is chosen for simplicity of calculation but can be adjusted as any scalar fraction of the wavelength.

:&lt;math&gt;I = I_0{{\left(\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda } \sin\theta \right)}{\frac{\pi a}{\lambda }
\sin\theta }\right)}^2}{{\left(\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi }{4} N \sin\theta+\frac{N}{2} \phi \right)}{\sin \left(\frac{\pi }{4}
\sin\theta+ \phi \right)}\right)}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

As sine achieves its maximum at &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, we set the numerator of the second term = 1.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{\pi}{4}N\sin\theta + \frac{N}{2}\phi &amp;= \frac{\pi}{2} \\
                                  \sin\theta &amp;= \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{N}{2}\phi \right)\frac{4}{N\pi} \\
                                  \sin\theta &amp;= \frac{2}{N} - \frac{2\phi}{\pi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus as ''N'' gets large, the term will be dominated by the &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{2\phi}{\pi}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; term.  As sine can oscillate between −1 and 1, we can see that setting &lt;math&gt;\phi=-\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; will send the maximum energy on an angle given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \sin^{-1} 1 = \frac{\pi}{2} = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, we can see that if we wish to adjust the angle at which the maximum energy is emitted, we need only to adjust the phase shift φ between successive antennas.  Indeed, the phase shift corresponds to the negative angle of maximum signal.

A similar calculation will show that the denominator is minimized by the same factor.

== Different types of phased arrays ==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
{{Main|Beamforming}}
There are two main types of beamformers. These are [[time domain]] beamformers and [[frequency domain]] beamformers.

A graduated attenuation window is sometimes applied across the face of the array to improve side-lobe suppression performance, in addition to the phase shift.

Time domain beamformer works by introducing time delays. The basic operation is called "delay and sum". It delays the incoming signal from each array element by a certain amount of time, and then adds them together. The most common kind of time domain beam former is serpentine waveguide. Active phased array designs use individual delay lines that are switched on and off. [[Yttrium iron garnet]] phase shifters vary the phase delay using the strength of a magnetic field.

There are two different types of frequency domain beamformers.

The first type separates the different frequency components that are present in the received signal into multiple frequency bins (using either a [[Discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) or a [[filterbank]]). When different delay and sum beamformers are applied to each frequency bin, the result is that the main lobe simultaneously points in multiple different directions at each of the different frequencies. This can be an advantage for communication links, and is used with the [[SPS-48]] radar.

The other type of frequency domain beamformer makes use of Spatial Frequency. Discrete samples are taken from each of the individual array elements. The samples are processed using a DFT. The DFT introduces multiple different discrete phase shifts during processing. The outputs of the DFT are individual channels that correspond with evenly spaced beams formed simultaneously. A 1-dimensional DFT produces a fan of different beams. A 2-dimensional DFT produces beams with a [[pineapple]] configuration.

These techniques are used to create two kinds of phased array.
:* Dynamic – an array of variable phase shifters are used to move the beam
:* Fixed – the beam position is stationary with respect to the array face and the whole antenna is moved

There are two further sub-categories that modify the kind of dynamic array or fixed array.
:* Active – amplifiers or processors are in each phase shifter element
:* Passive – large central amplifier with attenuating phase shifters

=== Dynamic phased array ===
Each array element incorporates an adjustable phase shifter that are collectively used to move the beam with respect to the array face.

Dynamic phased array require no physical movement to aim the beam. The beam is moved electronically. This can produce antenna motion fast enough to use a small pencil-beam to simultaneously track multiple targets while searching for new targets using just one radar set (track while search).

As an example, an antenna with a 2 degree beam with a pulse rate of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz will require approximately 8 seconds to cover an entire hemisphere consisting of 8,000 pointing positions. This configuration provides 12 opportunities to detect a {{convert|1000|m/s|mph km/h|abbr=on}} vehicle over a range of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, which is suitable for military applications.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The position of mechanically steered antennas can be predicted, which can be used to create [[electronic countermeasures]] that interfere with radar operation. The flexibility resulting from phased array operation allows beams to be aimed at random locations, which eliminates this vulnerability. This is also desirable for military applications.

=== Fixed phased array ===
[[File:Antenna-tower-collinear-et-al.jpg|thumb|130px|An antenna tower consisting of a fixed phase collinear antenna array with four elements]]
Fixed phased array antennas are typically used to create an antenna with a more desirable form factor than the conventional [[parabolic reflector]] or [[cassegrain reflector]]. Fixed phased arrays incorporate fixed phase shifters. For example, most commercial FM Radio and TV antenna towers use a [[collinear antenna array]], which is a fixed phased array of dipole elements.

In radar applications, this kind of phased array is physically moved during the track and scan process. There are two configurations.
:* Multiple frequencies with a delay-line
:* Multiple adjacent beams

The [[SPS-48]] radar uses multiple transmit frequencies with a serpentine delay line along the left side of the array to produce vertical fan of stacked beams. Each frequency experiences a different phase shift as it propagates down the serpentine delay line, which forms different beams. A filter bank is used to split apart the individual receive beams. The antenna is mechanically rotated.

[[Semi-active radar homing]] uses [[monopulse radar]] that relies on a fixed phased array to produce multiple adjacent beams that measure angle errors. This form factor is suitable for [[gimbal]] mounting in missile seekers.

=== Active phased array ===
[[Active electronically scanned array|Active electronically-scanned array]]s (AESA) elements incorporate transmit amplification with [[phase shift]] in each [[Transceiver|antenna element]] (or group of elements). Each element also includes receive pre-amplification. The phase shifter setting is the same for transmit and receive.&lt;ref&gt;Active Electronically Steered Arrays – A Maturing Technology (ausairpower.net)&lt;/ref&gt;

Active phased array do not require phase reset after the end of the transmit pulse, which is compatible with [[Doppler radar]] and [[pulse-Doppler radar]].

=== Passive phased array ===
[[Passive phased array]]s typically use large amplifiers that produce all of the microwave transmit signal for the antenna. Phase shifters typically consist of waveguide elements controlled by magnetic field, voltage gradient, or equivalent technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5082&amp;context=etd_theses&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com|title=YIG-sphere-based phase shifter for X-band phased array applications|publisher=Scholarworks|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527212406/http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5082&amp;context=etd_theses&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com|archivedate=2014-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/phaseshifters_ferro.cfm|title=Ferroelectric Phase Shifters|publisher=Microwaves 101|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913014513/http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/phaseshifters_ferro.cfm|archivedate=2012-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase shift process used with passive phased arrays typically puts the receive beam and transmit beam into diagonally opposite quadrants. The sign of the phase shift must be inverted after the transmit pulse is finished and before the receive period begins to place the receive beam into the same location as the transmit beam. That requires a phase impulse that degrades sub-clutter visibility performance on Doppler radar and Pulse-Doppler radar. As an example, [[Yttrium iron garnet]] phase shifters must be changed after transmit pulse quench and before receiver processing starts to align transmit and receive beams. That impulse introduces FM noise that degrades clutter performance.

Passive phased array design is used in the AEGIS Combat System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a460426.pdf|title=Total Ownership Cost Reduction Case Study: AEGIS Radar Phase Shifters|publisher=Naval Postgraduate School|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234942/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a460426.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Direction of arrival|direction-of-arrival]] estimation.

[[File:2017 Gianna Nannini - by 2eight - DSC3677.jpg|thumb|Italian singer Gianna Nannini was 56 years old when she gave birth in 2010]]'''Pregnancy over age 50''' has, over recent years, become possible for more [[woman|women]], and more easily achieved for many, due to recent advances in [[assisted reproductive technology]], in particular [[egg donor|egg donation]]. Typically, a woman's [[fecundity]] ends with [[menopause]], which by definition is 12 consecutive months without having had any menstrual flow at all. During [[perimenopause]], the menstrual cycle and the periods become irregular and eventually stop altogether, but even when periods are still regular, the egg quality of women in their forties is lower than in younger women, making the likelihood of conceiving a healthy baby also reduced, particularly after age 42.&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Fertility Center of Chicago, Female Age, Fertility and Infertility [http://www.advancedfertility.com/age.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note, that the female biological clock can vary greatly from woman to woman. A woman's individual level of fertility can be tested through a variety of methods.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.essentialparent.com/lesson/fertility-tests-for-women-1747/&lt;/ref&gt;

Men also experience a decline in fertility as they age though in a very gradual and later process in contrast to women's fertility as men's biological clock declines simply by each age (loses 1 percent every age) in comparison to women's biological clock where it begins drop sharply and rapidly after 38 years of age; for example, the average time to pregnancy if a man is under 25 is just over 4.5 months but nearly two years if a man is over 40 (if the woman is under 25).&lt;ref&gt;A man’s age matters https://yourfertility.org.au/for-men/age/&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of genetic defects is greatly increased due to the [[paternal age effect]]. Children with fathers aged 40 or older are more than five times as likely to have an autism spectrum disorder than children fathered by men aged under 30.&lt;ref name="yourfertility.org.au"&gt;https://yourfertility.org.au/for-men/age/&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers estimate that compared to a male fathering a child in his early 20s, there is double the chance of the child getting schizophrenia when the father is age 40, and triple the risk of schizophrenia when the father is age 50 (though, for most people this means the risk goes from approximately 1 in 121 when a man is 29, to 1 in 47 when a man is age 50 to 54).&lt;ref&gt;http://schizophrenia.com/prevention/older.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Men's fertility declines throughout the lifespan, with the volume and fecundity of a man’s semen quality and sperm motility (the ability of sperm to move towards an egg) decrease continually between the ages of 20 and 80.&lt;ref name="yourfertility.org.au"/&gt; The incidence of dwarfism&lt;ref&gt;https://www.llnl.gov/news/study-shows-genetic-quality-sperm-deteriorates-men-age&lt;/ref&gt; and miscarriage also increases as men age &lt;ref name="yourfertility.org.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929275-500-mens-sperm-quality-decreases-at-age-35/&lt;/ref&gt;

She chose to act as a surrogate mother for her daughter, Tinna (age 28), who happened to be born without a uterus and had one of her ovaries removed at the age of 21. Aggie had been premenopausal for two years and could not produce the child herself, so she had to undergo fertilization hormone to boost her menstrual cycles so that the matrix can accommodate two to seven eggs retrieved by her daughter and fertilized in vitro with the sperm from her daughter's partner, Wilson Brown. One of the two implanted embryos happened to appear in a lateral position in Aggie's uterus as a result of which she conceived her granddaughter through caesarean section. The girl weighed 8.69&amp;nbsp;lb (3.94&amp;nbsp;kg) and did not breath on her own.

It is against the law in France for post-menopausal women to receive IVF so she went to the USA for treatment. The case caused some ethical debate because the two eggs donated to Jeanine by a Californian woman were inseminated with sperm from Jeanine's brother, Robert: one was brought to term by Jeanine, the other by the donor as surogate, who will give birth the week after, on May 22, 2001, to Marie-Cécile, her biological daughter promised to Jeanine. Their doctor was not informed that Jeanine and Robert were sister and brother; he thought that they were a married couple. The infants were reportedly born into a fraught family atmosphere in which Jeanine and Robert hate each other and are wrangling over a family inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1400061.stm |title=BBC News – EUROPE – Doctor hits back in IVF row |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeanine Salomone died on June 18, 2015, aged 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dansnoscoeurs.fr/jeanine-salomone/1442902/avis |title=Avis de décès - Madame  Jeanine  SALOMONE - Avis obsèques - Var (83)  - Dans nos coeurs |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The baby was delivered by Caesarean section, weighing 6&amp;nbsp;lb 10 oz (3.00&amp;nbsp;kg), and was conceived through in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Her doctor stated that, for women over 35, giving birth can have risks, but he agreed to oversee the procedure because Janise Wulf was in good health. She and her second husband, Scott, said that they decided to have children together because Scott had not had any children in his previous marriage, and because they did not want their other son, Ian, born late 2002, also conceived through IVF, to grow up an only child. Of the 10 children Janise Wulf had previously, before Ian, the oldest was 40 at the time of the birth, and the youngest was 24.

The babies were delivered prematurely by Caesarean section and weighed 3.5 [[pound (mass)|lb]] (1.6&amp;nbsp;kg) each. M.C. Bousada became pregnant after receiving IVF treatment with oocytes donation and two sperm donors selected from a catalog from a fertility clinic in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], California, which claims that Bousada informed them that she was 55 (their maximum age for IVF treatment). Her family was unaware that she had gone to the United States to undergo fertility treatment prior to the births, and thought she was joking when she told them she was pregnant. Manuel Bousada de Lara, Maria del Carmen's older brother, criticized her decision, expressing concern over whether she would be able to raise children at her age. In response to such concerns, Bousada stated, "My mum lived to be 101 and there's no reason I couldn't do the same".&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;Appel, Jacob M.

== Debate ==
Pregnancies among older women have been a subject of controversy and debate. Some argue against motherhood late in life on the basis of the health risks involved, or out of concern that an older mother might not be able to give proper care for a child as she ages, while others contend that having a child is a fundamental right and that it is commitment to a child's wellbeing, not the parents' ages, that matters.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wiki.edu-research.info/infertile Motherhood At Mid-Life—A Medical and Ethical Dilema] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130929223342/http://wiki.edu-research.info/infertile |date=2013-09-29 }}."

A survey of attitudes towards pregnancy over age 50 among Australians found that 54.6% believed it was acceptable for a postmenopausal woman to have her own eggs transferred and that 37.9% believed it was acceptable for a postmenopausal women to receive donated [[ovum|ova]] or [[embryo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, M.

Governments have sometimes taken actions to regulate or restrict later-in-life childbearing. In the 1990s, [[France]] approved a bill which prohibited postmenopausal pregnancy, which the French Minister of Health at the time, [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], said was "...immoral as well as dangerous to the health of mother and child". In [[Italy]], the Association of Medical Practitioners and Dentists prevented its members from providing women aged 50 and over with fertility treatment. [[UK|Britain's]] then-[[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Virginia Bottomley]], stated, "Women do not have the right to have a child; the child has a right to a suitable home".&lt;ref name="hinman" /&gt; However, in 2005, age restrictions on IVF in the United Kingdom were officially withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Louise.

Legal restrictions are only one of the barriers confronting women seeking IVF, as many fertility clinics and hospitals set age limits of their own.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost" /&gt;

A '''protected area mosaic''', or '''conservation mosaic''' is a collection of environmentally protected areas that are treated as a whole, either formally or informally.
The protected areas may be of different types, including strictly protected areas and sustainable use areas, which may be administered at different public levels or privately.
They may include areas assigned to indigenous people.
A mosaic may be more flexible and effective than an attempt to combine all the areas into a single conservation unit under one agency.
In practice, results with mosaics in different countries have been mixed.

==Definition==

A conservation mosaic may be defined as "a network of protected areas and complementary landscapes that include combinations of national parks (i.e. the core conservation areas), production landscapes and collectively-owned ethnic territories (i.e. the surrounding areas)".{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=x}}
Conservation mosaics are similar to the [[biosphere]]s promoted by [[UNESCO]] under the [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]].{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=4}}
The cooperative approach between different agencies and types of protected area avoids the conflicts and disagreements over land use and conservation that often result with a single agency and single type of conservation unit.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=247}}
The value of creating protected area mosaics has been the subject of intense debate among conservationists.{{sfn|Conservation International|2009|p=21}}
Protected areas are of great importance in protecting biodiversity, but conservation efforts must take into account the social and economic needs of the surrounding communities and the resulting pressure on land usage.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|pp=x–xi}}

==National examples==

===Brazil===
[[File:Amazonas BR-319.jpg|thumb|[[BR-319]]. A protected area mosaic has been defined in an effort to reduce deforestation when the road is paved.]]
{{main article|Protected area mosaic (Brazil)}}
A ''[[Protected area mosaic (Brazil)|mosaico de unidades de conservação]]'' is a legally recognized entity in Brazil, a collection of protected areas of the same or different categories that are near to each other, adjoin each other or overlap, and that should be managed as a whole. It may include conservation units, private lands and indigenous territories.{{sfn|Mosaicos de áreas protegidas – ISA}}
Brazil has created a mosaic of federal and state conservation units along the [[BR-319]] highway through the Amazon rainforest in an effort to better prevent deforestation when the highway is paved through more efficient management of a larger area. 
However, WWF-Brazil has pointed out that it is not enough to simply create the protected areas on paper. 
They must be staffed, delimited, legal owners compensated and so on.{{sfn|Six new protected areas created in Brazilian Amazonian state}}

The [[Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park]] in the state of [[Goiás]], Brazil, was expanded by Federal Decree in September 2001 and inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in December 2001.
In 2003 the expansion was successfully challenged and 72% of the national park lost its protection status.
The park is part of the [[Cerrado Biosphere Reserve]].
Brazil has outlined plans for a mosaic of new conservation units with different management categories covering an equivalent area to the expanded National Park, but [[UNESCO]] has questioned whether the mosaic will be sufficient to ensure the statutory protection required for the World Heritage properties.{{sfn|Cerrado Protected Areas ... UNESCO}}

===Colombia===

A 2015 World Bank report on national protected areas in Colombia covering at least {{convert|2000000|ha}} found that with the mosaic approach ecological connectivity had improved in eight of the mosaics, exceeding the target.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=2}}
The local farmers and fishing communities in seven of the conservation mosaics, which included protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones, benefited from sustainable provision and use of
environmental goods and services.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=3}}

===Kenya===

In northern Kenya the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) organisation covers 19 community conservancies with more than {{convert|3000000|acre}} of wildlife habitat.  
The NRT Council of Elders agreed in May 2010 to found the  Nakuprat – Gotu Community Conservancy beside the [[Shaba National Reserve]] and the [[Ewaso Ng'iro]] river to promote conflict resolution and conserve nature.
The conservancy is part of a protected area mosaic that is a vital habitat for species that include the [[African elephant]] and the endangered [[Grévy's zebra]].{{sfn|Nakuprat Conservancy – Tusk}}

===United Kingdom===

A mosaic of protected areas has evolved in the United Kingdom, with a growing number of types of protected area, some as a result of European Union directives.
The objectives of nature conservation and landscape protection are treated as distinct.
The mosaic has evolved in a manner that results in duplication of effort and funding.
It could benefit from rationalisation and more flexible administration.{{sfn|Bishop|Phillips|Warren}}

===United States===

The protected area mosaics of the [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]], [[El Malpais National Monument|El Malpais]], [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro]] and [[Las Cienegas National Conservation Area|Las Cienegas]] areas in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona have been assembled by a variety of government and non-government organisations to protect the environment while respecting land use demands of the southwest of the United States.
This broad approach to ecosystem planning and management seems more fair and effective than former single-agency approaches.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=245}}
The Great Sand Dunes Monument Area combined various type of protected area to satisfy the objectives of the [[National Park Service]], [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other organizations, and to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem.
The result was similar to the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the [[Yukon]] in Canada.
Implementation was staged, with many interactions and adaptations over time.{{sfn|Day|Nelson|Sportza|2003|p=142}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19872">'''Regulatory focus theory''' ('''RFT''') is a [[goal]] pursuit [[theory]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Cesario, J: "Regulatory fit and persuasion: Basic principles and remaining questions", Social and Personality Psychology Compass 2(1)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|444}} formulated by [[Columbia University]] [[psychology]] [[professor]] and [[researcher]] [[E. Tory Higgins]] regarding people's [[perceptions]] in the [[decision making]] process. RFT examines the relationship between the [[motivation]] of a person and the way in which they go about achieving their [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E: "Making a Good Decision: Value From Fit", ''American Psychologist'' 55(11):1217&lt;/ref&gt; RFT posits two separate and independent self-regulatory orientations: prevention and promotion (Higgins, 1997).

This psychological [[theory]], like many others, is applied in [[communication]], specifically in the subfields of [[nonverbal communication]] and [[persuasion]].Chronic regulatory focus is measured using the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (Higgins et al., 2001) or the Regulatory Strength measure. Momentary regulatory focus can be primed or induced.

==Background==

===Regulatory fit theory===
To understand RFT, it is important to understand another of [[E. Tory Higgins]]' [[theories]]: regulatory fit theory. When a person believes that there is "fit", they will involve themselves more in what they are doing and "feel right" about it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Higgins, E. T. (2005). Value From Regulatory Fit. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14(4), 209–213. {{doi|10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00366.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}  Regulatory fit should not directly affect the [[hedonic]] occurrence of a thing or occasion, but should influence a person's assurance in their reaction to the [[Object (philosophy)|object]] or event.

Regulatory fit theory suggests that a match between orientation to a goal and the means used to approach that goal produces a state of regulatory fit that both creates a feeling of rightness about the goal pursuit and increases task engagement (Higgins, 2001, 2005). Regulatory fit intensifies responses, such as the value of a chosen object, persuasion, and job satisfaction&lt;ref&gt;Kruglanski, A. W., Pierro, A., &amp; Higgins, E. T. (2007). Regulatory Mode and Preferred Leadership Styles: How Fit Increases Job Satisfaction. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 29(2), 137–149. {{doi|10.1080/01973530701331700}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Regulatory fit does not increase the assessment of a [[decision making|decision]]; instead when someone feels "right" about their decision, the [[experience]] of "correctness and importance" is transferred to the ensuing assessment of the chosen [[Object (philosophy)|object]], increasing its superficial worth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Avnet, T: "Locomotion, assessment, and regulatory fit: Value transfer from 'how' to 'what'", Journal of Experimental Psychology 39(5):525&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the "feeling right" [[experience]] can then sway [[retrospective]] or prospective evaluations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Regulatory fit can be manipulated incidentally (outside the context of interest) or integrally (within the context of interest).

===Definition===
RFT refers to when a person pursues a [[goal]] in a way that maintains the person's own personal [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[beliefs]], also known as ''regulatory orientation''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This [[theory]] operates on the basic [[principle]] that people embrace [[pleasure]] but avoid [[suffering|pain]], and they then maintain their regulatory fit based on this standard.

The ''regulatory focus'' is basically the way in which someone approaches pleasure but avoids pain. An individual's regulatory focus concentrates on desired end-states, and the approach [[motivation]] used to go from the current state to the desired end-state. This theory differentiates between a ''promotion-focus'' on [[hope]]s and accomplishments, also known as gains. This focus is more concerned with higher level gains such as advancement and accomplishment.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;Higgins, E: "Achievement orientations from subjective histories of success: promotion pride versus prevention pride", ''European Journal of Social Psychology''. 31(1):4&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus is the ''prevention-focus'' based on [[safety]] and [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]], also known as non-losses. This focus emphasizes security and safety by following the guidelines and the rules.&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt;

These two regulatory focuses regulate the influences that a person would be exposed to in the [[decision-making]] process, and determine the different ways they achieve their goal, as discussed by RFT. An individual's regulatory orientation is not necessarily fixed. While individuals have [[Habit (psychology)|chronic]] tendencies towards either promotion or prevention, these preferences may not hold for all situations. Furthermore, a specific regulatory focus can be [[wikt:induce|induced]].

The [[Value (ethics)|value]] taken from interaction and goal attainment can be either positive or negative. The decision has positive value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that fits their regulatory orientation and it will have negative value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that does not fit their regulatory orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Regulatory fit allows value to be created by intensifying the commitment, based on one of the regulatory focus orientations. Making [[choices]] and fulfilling [[objective (goal)|objective]]s are considered as activities, and with any activity, people can be more or less involved. When this involvement is strong, it can intensify the feelings and values about this activity, and the approach to the activity determines whether they are or are not satisfied with the outcome and method of achieving the outcome.

This theory has noteworthy implications for increasing the value of life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} For example, in [[interpersonal]] conflict, if each person experiences "fit", each one will be satisfied with and committed to the outcome. In the broad sense, for people to appreciate their own lives, they need to be satisfied and "feel right" about what they are doing, and the way they are doing it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|210}} If it is not satisfying, it is known as "non-fit", and they will not reach their desired goal.

===Goal attainment and motivation===
Regulatory focus theory, according to Higgins, views motivation in a way that allows an understanding of the foundational ways we approach a task or a [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. (1997, December) Beyond pleasure and pain. ''American Psychologist'', 52(12):1281&lt;/ref&gt; Different factors can motivate people during goal pursuit, and we self-regulate our methods and processes during our goal pursuit. RFT proposes that motivational strength is enhanced when the manner in which people work toward a goal sustains their regulatory orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel, S: "How regulatory fit enhances motivational strength during goal pursuit", European Journal of Social Psychology. 34(1):40&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving a goal in a way that is consistent to a person's regulatory orientation leads to an [[individual]] sense of importance to the event. The impact of [[motivation]] is considered calculated and this creates a greater sense of commitment to the goal. The more strongly an individual is engaged (i.e., involved, occupied, fully engrossed) in an activity, the more intense the motivational force experienced. Engagement is of great importance to attain and motivate in order to reach a goal. Engagement serves as intensifier of the directional component of the value experience. An individual who is strongly engaged in a goal pursuits will experience a positive target more positively and a negative target more negatively.

Individuals can pursue different goals with diverse regulatory orientations and in unlike ways. There are two different kinds of regulatory orientations that people use to obtain their goals: ''promotion-focus orientation'' and ''prevention-focus orientation''. These terms are derived from [[E. Tory Higgins]]'s Theory of Regulatory Focus. In which, he adds to the notion that people regulate their goal-oriented behavior in two very distinct ways, coined ''promotion-focus orientation'' and ''prevention-focus orientation''

[[E. Tory Higgins]] uses this example: there is Student A and Student B, and they both have the shared goal to make an ''A'' in a class they are both taking in college. Student A uses a ''promotion-focus orientation'' which slants them towards achieving their goal and towards advancement, growth and life accomplishment. This would cause Student A to view the goal as an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] that satisfies their need for accomplishment. Student B uses a ''prevention-focus orientation'' where the goal is something that should be realized because it fulfills their need for [[security]], [[Safety|protection]] and prevention of negative outcomes. Student A uses an eager approach where they read extra materials to obtain their goal of an ''A''. Student B uses a vigilant approach where they become more detail oriented and pay careful attention to completing all of the course requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, R., &amp; Buss, D. (2009). Personality psychology: domains of knowledge about human nature. (4th ed., p. 388).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Completed RFT flowchart 3.jpg]]

Both forms of regulatory orientation can work to fulfill goals, but the choice of [[orientation (mental)|orientation]] is based on individual [[preference]]s and style. When a person pursues their goal in the focus that fits their regulatory orientation, they are more likely to pursue their goal more eagerly and aggressively than if they were using the other focus.In this case each student has different styles. They both feel more comfortable in persuading their goal. The outcome in this experiment would have been different if the students were given an undesirable choice.

When people make decisions, they often envision the possible "[[pleasure]] or [[suffering|pain]]" of the possible outcomes that the focus orientation will produce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|209}} A person imagining making a pleasing choice is more likely to engage in promotion-focus orientation because envisioning the possible outcome of success maintains eagerness about the outcome but does not place importance on [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]]. A person imagining the possible [[suffering|pain]] by making an undesirable choice maintains more vigilance but less eagerness.

A person with promotion-focus orientation is more likely to remember the occasions where the goal is pursued by using eagerness approaches and less likely to remember occasions where the goal is pursued by vigilance approaches. A person with prevention-focus orientation is more likely to remember events where the goal is pursued by means of vigilance than if it was pursued using eagerness approaches.

==Application==

===Regulatory focus theory and persuasion===
When relating regulatory focus theory to [[persuasion]], it is important to remember that RFT is a [[goal]]-attainment [[theory]], and that RFT can spawn feelings of rightness/wrongness which in turn may produce formulations for [[judgment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, A: "'This story is right on': The impact of regulatory fit on narrative engagement and persuasion", European Journal of Social Psychology. 39:448&lt;/ref&gt;

The feelings of rightness give an [[individual]] more commitment to the [[information]] coming in and therefore can avoid endangering their regulatory fit which in turn changes their regulatory focus and accepting a probable motive to change. If a person experiences feelings of wrongness they will suffer negative [[emotion]]s and deem the [[experience]] 
and information as a [[threat]] to their regulatory fit and therefore a threat to their regulatory focus and their [[goal]].

Studies have been done where fit and focus have been applied to show their applicability to [[consumer]] [[purchasing]], health advisories, and [[social policy]] issues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|446}} To be persuaded is to change your prior feelings, actions, and/or beliefs on a matter to where you agree with the persuader.

The "fit" involved in RFT plays a large role in such issues and stories because it can be a device to help an [[individual]] receive and review the experience during a particular [[message]] delivery. [[Positive reinforcement]] and [[feeling]]s of rightness while decoding the [[message]] creates a stronger engagement and relationship with processing the [[message]], and [[negative reinforcement]] and feelings of wrongness lessens the engagement and [[Attachment theory|attachment]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|449}}

[[Researcher]]s found that targeting the two different regulatory focus orientations, and their coinciding types of fit, works as an effective process to aid in [[persuasive]] charm or pull when they introduced a manner of [[persuasion]] where the framing of the [[message]] was everything and the content was [[irrelevant]] to uphold or interrupt a person's regulatory fit and follow the pattern of logic used in regulatory orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|446}}

Lee and Aaker (2004) conducted an [[experiment]] that involved whether or not to give their information in a prevention-focus- or promotion-focus-concerning way. The study involved an [[advertisement]] for a grape juice drink, which they split into two to create prevention-focus concerns (disease-preventing) and then promotion-focus concerns (energy enhancement).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|449}} In doing so, they demonstrated that rather than trying to know each [[individual]] recipient's qualities, one needs only to start by nailing the focus (prevention/promotion) and then framing the [[message]] so that it creates that "rightness".

Some may confuse RFT with regulatory fit, regulatory relevance, message matching, and source attractiveness in such an example. The extent of similarities between closely related [[theories]] of RFT, such as ones stated above, make it hard to clarify when this theory is applicable or apparent in respect to the [[persuasion]] process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|444–5}}

===Regulatory focus theory and nonverbal communication===
RFT can be a useful outline for a better understanding of the effects of [[nonverbal]] cues in [[persuasion]] and [[impression formation]]. Regulatory Fit Theory suggests that the effect of a cue cannot be understood without remembering what the cue means given a recipient's focus orientation.&lt;ref name="Cesario 2008"&gt;Cesario, J., Higgins, E. (2008 May) Making Message Recipients "Feel Right": How Nonverbal Cues Can Increase Persuasion. Psychological Science, 19(5)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|419}}

[[Nonverbal]] cues can be used by the [[message]] source to vary delivery style, more specifically to convey eagerness or vigilance, of a given message in a way that will produce regulatory fit in message recipients of different focus orientations.

Advancement implies eager movement forward, so eagerness is conveyed by gestures that involve animated, broad opening movements such as hand movements projecting outward, forward leaning body positions, fast body movement, and fast [[speech]] rate. Caution implies vigilant carefulness, so vigilance should be conveyed by [[gesture]]s that show precision like slightly backward-leaning body positions, slower body movement, and slower speech rate.

An eager [[nonverbal]] delivery style will result in greater [[message]] effectiveness for promotion-focus recipients than for prevention-focus recipients, while the opposite is true for a vigilant [[nonverbal]] style.

There are various aspects, which may contribute to whether or not a [[message]]'s [[persuasive]] element is successful. One aspect is the effect of [[nonverbal]] cues and their association with [[persuasive]] appeals based on the [[message]] recipient's [[motivation]]al regulatory orientation. This determines the recipient's impression of the source during [[impression formation]].

Research has found that [[nonverbal]] cues are an essential element of most [[persuasive]] appeals. RFT creates the background that allows a [[prediction]] for when and for whom a [[nonverbal]] cue can have an effect on [[persuasion]]. When [[nonverbal]] cues and signals are used appropriately, they increase the effectiveness of [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name="Cesario 2008"/&gt;{{rp|415}}

The '''School Enterprise Challenge''' is an international competition for schools to establish profitable student-led businesses. 

It aims to develop young people’s business and soft skills to better prepare them for the world of work and to develop their capacities as socially responsible entrepreneurs. The income generated from these businesses moreover can provide a useful additional source of funds for less well-resourced schools in developing countries, or can be used to support social projects in the community by better resourced schools.

The competition since its launch in 2011 has benefited over 80,000 young people directly from over 90 countries and has been recognized internationally for its positive social impact, including as one of the [[World_Innovation_Summit_for_Education|WISE]] Awards 2014 finalists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6185">The '''Society of Les Voyageurs''' is a fraternal student organization at the [[University of Michigan]]. It is one of the oldest university [[List of university outing clubs|outing clubs]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umich.edu/~lvs/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1907, the Society of Les Voyageurs is the second oldest [[student organization]] on the University of Michigan campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.michigandaily.com/content/about-campus-les-voyageurs&lt;/ref&gt;  On Sunday evenings during the academic year, the Society hosts communal dinners known as "Sunday Feeds" along with educational programs and entertainment related to the outdoors.

==History==

The Society of Les Voyageurs was founded in 1907 by University of Michigan students Elmer "Lindy" Lehndorff, Lawrence "Larry" Lark, and Chester MacChesney.  They named the Society after the pioneering [[French-Canadian]] [[voyageurs]] of the [[Great Lakes]] [[North American fur trade|fur trade]], whom they admired as early adventurers and outdoorsmen.  Society membership was initially open only to male students at the University. The Society's Constitution was amended in 1972 to allow for the admission of women, and the Society has been co-ed since that time. The Society has published an annual [[yearbook]] since 1910 as well as several volumes of Society history.

After nearly two decades of renting space on the University of Michigan campus, the Society drew up plans in 1924 to construct a cabin on several acres of property along the Huron River in Ann Arbor.  "Pine Lodge", as it was originally named, was built almost entirely by Society members in the spring and summer of 1925, and has continually served since then as the home for the Society as well as a residence for student members. During the summer of 2012, the renamed Habe Mills Pine Lodge underwent an extensive renovation, including the installation of "Kay's Kitchen."  The new kitchen is named for Kay Lane, a University student in the late 1960s and early 1970s upon whom Society members bestowed the title "Queen of the Cabin," and who ultimately paved the way for the admission of women as full members of the Society.  After graduating from the University of Michigan, Kay remained active in the Society and was a well known friend and mentor to several generations of members.

==2012 Cabin Renovation==
Beginning in the summer of 2012, the cabin underwent a major renovation costing over $100,000. Plans for the renovation had been tossed around for years, and the final plans were made official in early January of that year. Most of the work was contracted out to By The River Carpentry, but many of the actives and alumni were around and gave a helping hand. The renovation consisted of expanding the dining room, adding an upstairs bathroom, re-doing the kitchen, adding in a hallway between the dining room and kitchen and expanding the upstairs lodge. The work was completed in August 2012, and was ready to welcome back students for the 2012 Fall semester. Potlucks continue as normal, but now there is more space to accommodate even more lovely guests.

'''''The Bible with Sources Revealed''''' (2003) is a book by American biblical scholar [[Richard Elliott Friedman]] dealing with the process by which the five books of the [[Torah]] or [[Pentateuch]] (the "Five Books of Moses") came to be written. Friedman follows the four-source [[Documentary Hypothesis]] model, but differs significantly from [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s model in several respects. 

Most notably, Friedman agrees with Wellhausen on the date of the [[Deuteronomist]] (the court of [[Josiah]], c. 621 or 622 BC), but places the [[Priestly source]] at the court of [[Hezekiah]]; his sequence of sources therefore runs [[Jahwist]]–[[Elohist]]–[[Priestly source|Priestly]]–[[Deuteronomist]] [JEPD] (while Wellhausen order it as [[Jahwist]]–[[Elohist]]–[[Deuteronomist]]–[[Priestly source|Priestly]] [JEDP] in his Documentary Hypothesis model). Like Wellhausen, he sees a final redaction in the time of [[Ezra]], c. 450 BC.

The core of the book, taking up almost 300 of its approximately 380 pages in the paperback edition, is Friedman's own translation of the five Pentateuchal books, in which the four sources plus the contributions of the two [[Redactor]]s (of the combined JE source and the later redactor of the final document) are indicated typographically. The remaining sections include a short Introduction outlining Friedman's thesis, a "Collection of Evidence," and a bibliography.

Friedman's version of the documentary hypothesis can be summarised as follows: The first source to be written down was the Jahwist, or J. This occurred in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], the southern of the two Israelite kingdoms, in the period between 922-722 BC. (Friedman's arguments are dealt with below). The Elohist, or E, was composed in roughly the same period, but probably a little later than J, in the northern kingdom of Israel. In 722 BC the Assyrian conquest of Israel brought E to Judah with refugees from the northern kingdom.

Shortly after this a redactor combined the two into a standard text, JE, the redactor himself being known as RJE. Then in the reign of [[Hezekiah]], c.715-687 BC, the Jerusalem priesthood produced a text which they saw as a replacement for JE, the theology of which was objectionable to their project of religious reform: this was the Priestly source, or P. Hezekiah's reform program failed, but was revived in the reign of his great-grandson [[Josiah]], c. 640-609 BC, producing the last source, the [[Deuteronomist]], or D. The three sources (JE now counting as a single source) existed independently until the return from the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]], when a final redactor, R, combined them. 

The "Collection of Evidence" section sets out Friedman's arguments for the documentary hypothesis in general and for his own version of it in particular. He notes seven arguments:
* Linguistic: each source (treating JE as a single source) reflects the Hebrew of its period.
* Terminology: Certain words and phrases appear disproportionately, or exclusively, in certain sources.
* Consistent content: Certain concepts, objects, and practices are specific to certain sources.
* Continuity of texts: When separated into sources following linguistic, terminological and contextual clues, each source constitutes a coherent, self-contained narrative.
* Connections with other parts of the Bible: Each source has direct, non-indiscriminate affinities with other specific parts of the Bible.
* Relationships of sources to each other and to history: The sources each have connections to specific circumstances in the history of Israel/Judah, and to each other.

== Comparison with Wellhausen ==

As Friedman himself says in his ''Who Wrote the Bible?'', when a scholar agrees with the documentary hypothesis, he agrees with Wellhausen; when he wishes to propose a new model of the hypothesis, he compares it with Wellhausen.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrase from Friedman's "Who Wrote the Bible?", pp. 26-27 of 1997 edition (original edition 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman agrees with Wellhausen on the identity of the four sources, and on the identification of certain possible or probable authors: [[Jeremiah]] and/or his scribe, [[Baruch ben Neriah]], as the author of D, [[Ezra]] as the Redactor. (These identifications in fact were made long before Wellhausen: the identification of the Redactor with Ezra can be traced to [[Spinoza]] in the 17th century or even [[Jerome]] in the 4th). Where he departs most radically from Wellhausen is in dating P to the time of Hezekiah, almost a century before Josiah and the D source. Wellhausen's placing of P after D, so that the sequence of sources was JEDP, was crucial to the view of the development of Israelite religion from original polytheism to Judaic monotheism; Friedman's reordering of the sources is thus his major challenge to Wellhausen's model, as it undermines Wellhausen's thesis that the [[Priestly Code]] represents the final development of a priest-centred religious practice. Friedman's dating of J to the time of the divided kingdom - Wellhausen put it in the 10th century BC rather than the 8th - is also novel, but less so than his ordering of the sources.

== Critical assessment ==

The documentary hypothesis as defined by Wellhausen, having dominated critical thinking on the origin of the Pentateuch, came into increasing question from the late 1960s onwards as alternative models - supplementary and fragmentary rather than the discrete documents of the DH paradigm - were put forward. Friedman's book is thus in one sense an answer to these critics, and perhaps especially to [[R. N. Whybray]], whose 1987 ''[[The Making of the Pentateuch]]'' had concluded that the tools by which the documentary model distinguished its supposed documents were fundamentally faulty: how could they suppose, he asked, that the authors of each of the four so-called source documents had not tolerated inconsistency, but that the two redactors had had no problems with it? 

Scholars as eminent as [[Baruch Halpern]] and [[Michael D. Coogan]] (editor of ''[[The New Oxford Annotated Bible]]'') welcomed ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'' as an indispensable teaching tool; nevertheless, Friedman's departures from Wellhausen have been criticised by his professional colleagues on several grounds, not least for ignoring all other models and all advances in scholarship outside his preferred documentary model.

For example, the review in the [[Review of Biblical Literature]] noted:

"It is basic for the understanding of biblical literary history that the [[Supplementary hypothesis|Supplementary Hypothesis]] is the 'normal hypothesis' (even within the Pentateuch) and that the Documentary Hypothesis (i.e., the fusion of two literary sources) is only a notable exception."

Also, some scholars advocated 'the Fragmentary hypothesis' for another major text-critical approach to the Pentateuch's authorship''.

Moreover, Friedman was criticised for ignoring evidence that P did not precede Deuteronomy, for an arbitrary approach to his assignment of sources, and for failing to note or argue with scholarship that does not support his argument.

On the other hand, his close examination of R (and RJE) was welcomed as innovative and useful, as was his schematisation of the arguments in favour of the documentary model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/5126_5394.pdf Review by Christof Levin, ''Review of Biblical Literature'', RBL06/2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">'''The Science of Aliens''' is a touring exhibition that launched at the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]] in October 2005. It was developed by a company called [[The Science of...]] set up by The Science Museum and Fleming Media. Two versions of the exhibition are touring venues around the world.

==Exhibition content==
The Science of Aliens asks the question "are we alone in the Universe?" through a combination through the artifacts, interactive and audiovisual exhibits. The exhibition has an introduction section looking at science fiction archetypes before going on to look at what scientists can tell us about the real possibilities for alien life. The second section explores the variety of life on Earth and the extreme conditions in which it can survive. It looks at recent missions to moons and planets in the [[Solar System]] and what they can tell us about alien life before going on to examine some extra-solar planets.

The next section presents two fictional planets, [[Extraterrestrial (TV program)|Aurelia and Blue Moon]] and their ecosystems as imagined by scientists. These are used to explore the factors and parameters governing life on other planets and are presented as two large interactive landscapes.

The exhibition concludes by looking at the chances of communication with alien intelligence. This includes a look at the efforts of SETI and various messages sent out by humans into the Universe and a chance for visitors to compose a message to extraterrestrial intelligence. The Science of Aliens was also made into a best selling book by Jack Challoner.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1557919,00.html They're aliens ... but not as we know them | Science | The Observer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigwavetv.com/programs/alienworlds.html Big Wave/Programs/Alien Worlds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828185441/http://www.bigwavetv.com/programs/alienworlds.html |date=2009-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcom.de/en/projects/project/detail/the-science-of-aliens/ ART+COM - The Science of Aliens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620042243/http://www.artcom.de/en/projects/project/detail/the-science-of-aliens/ |date=2013-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development ==
A variety of experts gave advice on the exhibition development including [[Simon Conway Morris]], [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)]], [[Jack Cohen (scientist)]], [[John Clute]], [[Dougal Dixon]], and [[Mark Brake]].

'''Thigmonasty''' or '''seismonasty''' is the [[nastic movement|nastic]] response of a [[plant]] or [[fungus]] to touch or vibration.&lt;ref name="Stiles1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Stiles|title=Principles of Plant Physiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1nItopug4_YC&amp;pg=PA520|year=1994|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7141-247-1|pages=520–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WereleySater2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norman M.

==Distinctive aspects of thigmonasty==

Thigmonasty differs from [[thigmotropism]] in that nastic motion is independent of the direction of the stimulus.  For example, tendrils from a climbing plant are thigmotropic because they twine around any support they touch, responding in whichever direction the stimulus came from.  However, the shutting of a [[venus fly trap]] is thigmonastic; no matter what the direction of the stimulus, the trap simply shuts (and later possibly opens).

The time scales of thigmonastic responses tend to be shorter than those of thigmotropic movements because many examples of thigmonasty depend on pre-accumulated [[turgor]] or on [[Bistability|bistable]] mechanisms rather than growth or cell division. Certain dramatic examples of [[rapid plant movement]] such as the sudden drooping of ''[[Mimosa pudica]]'' or the trapping action of ''Dionaea'' or ''[[Utricularia]]'' are fast enough to observe without time lapse photography; some take less than a second. Speed is no clear distinction however; for example the re-erection of ''[[Sensitive plant|Mimosa]]'' leaves is nastic, but typically takes some 15 to 30 minutes, rather than a second or so. Similarly, re-opening of the ''Dionaea'' trap, though also nastic, typically takes days to complete.&lt;ref name="MohrSchopfer1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hans Mohr|author2=Peter Schopfer|title=Plant Physiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jTxfMQg38B4C&amp;pg=PA527|date=23 January 1995|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-58016-4|pages=527–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plant physiology|Botanical physiologists]] have discovered signalling [[molecule]]s called [[turgorin]]s, that help mediate the loss of turgor.&lt;ref name="MohrSchopfer1995"/&gt; In species with the fastest response time, vacuoles are believed to provide temporary, high speed storage for calcium ions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/(jw4laffrp2zx4xzespuhee45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,10,11;journal,50,458;linkingpublicationresults,1:107724,1]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of plants exhibiting thigmonasty ==

===Thigmonasty in the [[Asteraceae]]===
Thigmonasty other than leaf closure occurs in various species of [[thistle]]s. When an insect lands on a flower, the anthers shrink and rebound, loading the insect with pollen. The effect results from turgor changes in specialized, highly elastic cell walls of the anthers. Similar pollination strategy occurs in ''[[Rudbeckia hirta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nyflora.org/newsletters/newsletter_44.pdf |title=Black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta L.) |author=Knowlton Foote |work=NYFA Newsletter |publisher=New York Flora Association |pages=4 |volume=13 |issue=1 |date=March 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217172132/http://www.nyflora.org/newsletters/newsletter_44.pdf |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thigmonasty in the Droseraceae===
The [[Venus Flytrap]] (''[[Dionaea muscipula]]'') presents a spectacular example of thigmonasty; when an insect lands on a trap formed by two curved lobes of a single leaf, the trap rapidly switches from an open to a closed configuration. Investigators have observed an [[action potential]] and changes in leaf [[turgor]] that accompany the [[reflex]]; they trigger the rapid elongation of individual cells. The common term for the elongation is [[acid growth]] although the process does not involve [[cell division]].&lt;ref name="Williams 2002"&gt;{{cite conference |author=Williams SE  |title=Comparative physiology of the Droseraceae ''sensu stricto''—How do tentacles bend and traps close?  |booktitle=Proceedings of the 4th International Carnivorous Plant Society Conference  |pages=77–81  |publisher= |year=2002 |location=Tokyo |url=http://carnivorousplants.org/cpn/articles/ICPS2002confp77_81.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thigmonasty in the Fabaceae===
[[Image:pulvinus.png|frame|Pulvinus in extended and contracted position]]
''Mimosa pudica'' is a plant with [[compound leaves]] that droop abruptly when stimulated. This is a classic example of thigmonastic action and has attracted detailed investigation. Contact or injury that causes [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] to deform, will trigger an action potential. The action potential travels through the plant, initiating drooping of the leaflets as it passes. However, it does not pass the [[pulvinus]] at the base of a [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], and so a local disturbance will not cause all the leaves on the plant to collapse.

The [[pulvinus]] is a motor structure consisting of a rod of [[sclerenchyma]] surrounded by [[collenchyma]]. Such pulvini occur widely in the [[Fabaceae]]. In its extended position, the [[cell (biology)|cell]]s of the entire collar of collenchyma are distended with water. On receiving the action potential signal, the cells in the lower half of the pulvinus respond by expelling [[potassium]] and [[chlorine]] [[ions]] and taking up of [[calcium]] ions. This results in an [[osmosis|osmotic gradient]] that draws water out of the affected cells, so that they temporarily shrink. This pulls the entire structure downward like a folding [[fan (implement)|fan]].

Many other Fabaceae react to touch with the same rapid leaf closure motion.  The [[pea]] vine thigmonastically closes its leaves around a support. [[Catclaw Brier]], a prairie mimosa, native to North America, shuts its leaves on contact. The plant is attractive to [[herbivore]]s, and this behavior presumably provides [[plant defense against herbivory|protection against grazing]].

===Thigmonasty in the [[Oxalidaceae]]===

Sensitive leaves also occur in plants of the [[Oxalis|wood sorrel]] family. Examples include many species of ''[[Oxalis]]'',  ''[[Biophytum sensitivum]]'', and [[Averrhoa carambola]] (the plant which produces [[starfruit]]).

===Other forms===
Some [[fungi]] exhibit trap closure similar to the venus fly trap.  Mycologists have discovered action potentials in fungi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0005-2736(76)90138-3 |vauthors=Slayman CL, Long WS, Gradmann D |title="Action potentials" in ''Neurospora crassa'', a mycelial fungus |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=426 |issue=4 |pages=732–44 |date=April 1976 |pmid=130926 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not currently clear whether they have any significance to thigmonastic behavior.

'''Tuberous receptors''' are [[electroreceptor]]s that are specialized to respond to high-frequency electrical fields ([[Electric organ (biology)|electric organ discharge]]s or EODs), and hence are found only in [[fish]] with an active electrical sense that can generate their own electrical fields.  They are mostly found on weakly electric fishes such as [[gymnotiform]]s and [[mormyrid]]s. These receptors are particularly receptive to their own electrical fields, and can detect perturbations caused by foreign objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physiology of Tuberous Electrosensory Systems|url=http://www.web.pdx.edu/~zelickr/sensory-physiology/articles/2012-articles/wk10-electro-magneto-noci/electroreception/kawasaki-physiology-tuberous-systems.pdf|first1=Masashi|last1=Kawasaki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of tuberous receptors, t-type and p-type.

Species which use tuberous receptors include the [[Gymnotiformes|glass knife fish]] (''Eigenmannia virescens''), a gymnotiform.

{{Shia Islam}}
Ja'fari principles ({{lang-fa|علم اصول در مکتب جعفری}}) refers to regulations, history and eminent persons and scholars during the development of shia's [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence]].

==History and development==
===Imami jurists and early works===
Considering different stances in relation to Juridical rules and principles, there are some parties in the schools of Principles. These schools try to apply analytical approaches in their methodology. There are somebodies such as Zorarah Ibn Aayon, Muhammad Ibn Moslem, Abu Basir and also Hisham Ibn Salem.Among these individuals, Hisham Ibn Salem and His Pupils had eminent roles in development of principles among shia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/9844&lt;/ref&gt; In this period two problems are so important such as difference of hadith in one hand and the distinctions of Ijtihad or authority in other hand.There are two early scholars in principles of jurisprudence who were eminent including [[Hisham ibn Hakam]] and Yunes Ibn Abd Al Rahman.some scholars know Hisham ibn hakam and hisham ibn salem among the outstanding pupils of Imam Sadiq and Imam Kazim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Mansour Hashemi|Tashbih and tanzih|Daneshnameh Jahan Islami in Pesian|vol=1|p=3554|cite book=http://lib.eshia.ir/23019/1/3554/%D9%87%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%85_%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86_%D8%AD%DA%A9%D9%85}}&lt;/ref&gt; they wrote important books in the field of principles of jurisprudence such as "Kitab Al Akhbar" and " Kayfa Taseh" or "How it is correct?"

===Period of establishment===
It seems that the dominant current was the Adherents of Hadith during the fourth century of Lunar hijrah. They didn't any need to knowledge of principles and put it away.In other hand the relatives of Nobakhti begun a new movement in the sphere of theology and [[kalam]] among shia and Imamiyyah.Abu Sahl Nobakhti, the popular theologian of Shia schools, could presented a new and complete theological system along with Shia characters.In Fact Abu Sahl Nobakhti concerned with the principles through the theological works such a way that He referred to some questions in the field of the principles.According to Madlung this approach of Abu Sahl Nobakhti and his theological system was along with defending of Imami creeds and theological beliefs.Maybe the most important Abu Sahl's essay in the principles is the essay of "Naqz Al Shafe'ei or the refusing the shafe'ei which is written against Shafe'ei and also counted as the first completed work in the principles among imamiyyah.besided he written some books on the subjects of refusing Qyias in jurisprudence and ijtihad Al R'ay.Of course there is no track from these works and they are lost.During the fourth century of Hijrah, already one trend is very dominant which is indeed on the basis of refusing of Qiyas and R'ay in jurisprudence. Also there were many books concerned with these subjects among imami Theologians. for example Hasan ibn Mousa Nobakhti wrote a book by the name of "A book on the khabar Vahed and Amal".according to this works there is no appication for Qiyas and R'ay.Among The first Mutakalim Jurist in fourth century is Ibn Abi Aqil Ammani as some one who possessed a school which his method was similar to Twelve Imams of Shia and somehow like the Mutazilite schools of thought.

====Ibn Abi Aqil And his thought====
His complete name was Ibn Abi Aqil Ammani and he came from the [[Yemen]]. He was contemporary with Shaykh Koleini.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jafar sobhani|Al Vasit fi Feqh|vol=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Aqil counted as pioneer jurist in the principles. He could establishing an approach on which His juridical methodology was dependent on Quranic rules and known traditions.He is the author of a legal work entitled Mutamassak bi Habl Al Rasul, which was one of the most renowned legal sources during the 4th and 5thllOth and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Modarrsei TabaTabaei|1984|p=35|introduction to shi'i law}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the first one who arrange the knowledge of [[fiqh]] and give consistency ti it.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10257/15/6/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86_%D8%B9%D9%82%DB%8C%D9%84_%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ibn Jonayd Eskafi====
[[Ibn Jonayd Eskafi]]  was one of the first and eminent Shia jurists during the fourth century lunar hijrah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/1513&lt;/ref&gt; He had different approach in understanding of Shia's traditions. He believed that there is a theological basis for interpretation of Hadith on which the Juridical tradition of Imams is not according to Saying but to Ray or opinion.He was an eminent religious scholars among elites.Also Ibn Nadim knows him as great scholars among shia.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/27/200&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most important book in Fiqh is Tahzib Al Shia le Ahkam Al Shariah.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/27/207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period of development===
Needness to Usul becomes indispensable when Shia community far away from twelve periods. Also appearance of new subjects intensify this necessity.in development epoch we confronted with three eminent masters in the field of Usul and extending it namely [[Shaykh Mufid]], [[Sharif Murtaza]], [[Sallar Deylami]] and [[Shaykh Tusi]].

====Shaykh Mufid====

According to [[Ibn al-Nadim]], who knew al-Mufid personally, he was the head of the Shia ''Mutekallimun'' in the field of kalam, and [[Abū Hayyān al-Tawhīdī|al-Tawhidi]], who was also personally familiar with al-Mufid, described him as "eloquent and skillful at dialectic (''jadal'')". His skill in polemical debate was such that he was said to be capable of convincing his opponents "that a wooden column was actually gold".&lt;ref name="Kraemer1992" /&gt; He was taught the Islamic science of [[hadith]] by [[Ibn Babawayh|Al-Shaykh al-Saduq]].&lt;ref name="Christoph" /&gt;

===Period of flourishing===
this period begans from the end of Sixth into middle of eighth lunar hijrah.Scholars written many detailed books in the fielf of principles.They concerned with principles in detail and accuracy.Scholars such as Ibn Zohreh halabi,Sadid Al Din Hemsi,Najm Al Din Helli,Allameh Helli,Amid Al Din A'araji,Zia Al Din A'araji,Fakhr Al Mohaqeqin, Muhammad Ibn Makki known as first martyr,Shaykh Abdullah Soyouri,Zain Al DIn Ibn Nour Al Din Ali Ibn Ahmad known A Second Martyr, all of them lived in this period.

====Ibn Zohreh Halabi====
His whole name is Ezz Al Din A l Makarem Sayyed Hamzeh Ibn Ali Ibn Zohreh. According To Moreza Mutahhari he learened Tusi's Nihayah under Ibn Hajib.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.motahari.ir/Content/933/321&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 20th book attributed to him. diversity of them shows his all arounded.His eminent book in principle is Qanyat Al Nozu fi Elmi Al Usul Va foru.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/947&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allameh Helli====
{{main article|Al-Hilli}}
Al-Hilli also known as the sage of Hilla,&lt;ref name="jafri"&gt;Jafri, S.H.M. "al- Ḥillī , (1) Ḏj̲amāl al-Dīn Ḥasan b. Yūsuf b. ʿAlī b. Muṭahhar." [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-2867 Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition.] Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. Augustana. 13 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was born in the still existent town of [[Al Hillah]] (in what is now [[Iraq]]), commonly viewed as the [[Shi'a Islam in Iraq|centre of Shia Islam]] when [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] leaders were in control over [[Baghdad]] during his life.&lt;ref name="jafri"/&gt; He entered into a prominent family of [[Ulama|Shia jurists]] and theologians. His father, Sadid ul-Din al-Hilli, was a respected ''mujtahid'' and a leading figure in the Shia community. His maternal uncle [[Muhaqqiq al-Hilli]] was also a renowned scholar.He studied [[Islamic theology|theology]] and [[fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) in Hilla under the auspices of his father and his uncle, as well as other notable scholars, including: Ali bin Tawus and Ahmad bin Tawus.&lt;ref name="tehrani"&gt;Tehrani, Aga Buzurg, Tabaqat 'Alam il-Shi'ah, v.5 p.52 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent some time at the newly established [[Maragheh observatory]], where he studied [[Avicennism|Avicennan]] [[philosophy]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] under [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], and was also introduced to the works of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]]. Later, he travelled to Baghdad and became acquainted with the doctrines of [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref name="Schmidkte"&gt;Schmidkte, S. ḤELLI, ḤASAN B. YUSOF B. MOṬAHHAR. Encyclopaedia Iranica (www.iranicaonline.org, accessed: 28.09.09)&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hilli's role in shaping Twelver [[jurisprudence]] is of great importance. As well as several works and commentaries on [[usul al-fiqh]], he produced a voluminous legal corpus. Of this, two of the most important works are ''al-Mukhtalaf'' (''The Disagreement'') and ''al-Muntaha'' (''The End''). ''Mukhtalaf'' is a legal manual devoted to addressing legal questions in which the Shia jurists hold differing opinions, whereas the ''Muntaha'' is a systematic and detailed exposition of al-Hilli's own legal opinions. He also wrote a summarized legal manual, ''Qawa'id ul-Ahkam'', which was popular amongst later scholars, judging by the number of commentaries that would be written on it. Amongst his later legal works is ''Tadhkirat ul-Fuqaha'', which is a legal manual intended for use by lay persons. He also composed legal works on specific issues (for example, ''[[Hajj]]'' or ''[[Salat]]'').&lt;ref name="Schmidkte"/&gt;

====Fakhr Al Muhaqeqin====
Muhaqqiq was born in the city of [[al-Hilla]], [[Iraq]], where he would spend most of his life, to a family of prominent Shi'i jurists. He studied [[theology]], [[fiqh]] and [[usul al-fiqh]] under his father. Muhaqqiq later became the leader of the Shi'i seminary there.He has many credible books in principles like Mabadi Al Osul,Fakhryyah and others.

====First martyr====
{{main article|Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili}}
Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili al-[[Jezzine|Jizzini]]&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Phyllis G. Jestice|title=Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576073551|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1334–1385) also known as '''Shahid Awwal''' (Arabic: الشهيد الأول''ash-Shahid al-Awwal''  "The First Martyr"), is the author of Al-Lum'ah ad-Dimashqiya (Arabic: الدمشقية اللمعة, The Damascene Glitter") and was a [[Shi'a]] scholar. Although he is neither the first Muslim, nor the first Shi'te to die for his religion, he became known as "Shahid Awwal" because he was probably the first Shia scholar of such stature to have been killed in a brutal manner.When Mohammad bin Makki was 16 years old he went to study at al-[[Hilla]] in Iraq. He returned home when he was 21. He used [[taqiyya]] to establish himself as one of the religious scholars of Damascus, using Sunni law to judge Sunnis, while covertly judging the Shia using Shia law.&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO"/&gt;

====Second martyr====
{{main article|Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili}}
Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili (1506-1558) was a [[Shia Islam|Shia]] scholar. He was born in 911 AH. in Jabal Amel.His Magnum opus is the first commentary of ''The Damascene Glitter'' by [[Shahid Awwal]] called ''The Beautiful Garden in Interpreting the Damscene Glitter'' (Arabic: ''ar-Rawda-l-Bahiyah fi Sharh allam'a-d-Dimashqiya''   الروضة البهيّة في شرح اللمعة الدمشقيّة ).

===Period of Decline===
The appearance of Akhbari lies in this period.This school  "crystalized" as a distinct movement with the writings of [[Muhammad Amin al-Astarabadi]] (d. 1627 AD) and achieved its greatest influence in the late [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and early post-Safavid era.  However, shortly thereafter [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (d. 1792), along with other Usuli [[mujtahid]]s, crushed the Akhbari movement.&lt;ref name="momen222"&gt;{{Citation| last =Momen| first =Moojan| author-link =

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akhbārī ideology is that nothing but the aḥadīth of the Infallible can serve as authoritative evidence in Islam. Akhbārīs also differ from Usūlīs in their rejection of the ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists]]'', arguing that preachers of religion have no role in politics,  clerics should advise political leaders but not govern themselves. Akhbaris believe in separation of religion and state in absence of Twelfth Imam, they say that only an infallible ruling Imam has a right to combine religion and state; and which will be accomplished only after the arrival of awaited Shia Imam.

====Against akhbarism====
*According to the [[Akhbari]] view, the only sources of law are the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]], and any case not explicitly covered by one of these must be regarded as not having been provided for.
*According to the majority [[Usuli]] view, it is legitimate to seek general principles by induction, in order to provide for cases not expressly provided for.  This process is known as [[ijtihad]], and the [['Aql|intellect]] is recognised as a source of law.  It differs from the Sunni [[qiyas]] in that it does not simply extend existing laws on a test of factual resemblance: it is necessary to formulate a general principle that can be rationally supported.

==Contemporary periods==
[[Javadi Amoli]] wrote about source of revelation in Shiism:
# The most important source in [[Shiite]] law is the [[Quran]] itself, which interprets itself 
# The other source is the tradition of the infallibles (the family of Muhammad), according to the successive tradition (Saqalain) passed down by the family of Muhammad as well as according to the [[Quran]] itself: to accept one without the other is equivalent to rejecting both of them.
# A third source is theoretical wisdom where it is impossible to conceive the contrary, which proves the existence of God and the necessity of his unity, eternity, pre-existence, power, will and other exalted attributes: this cannot be denied with any verse.
# Although we cannot impose science upon the Quran, we can use verified scientific, experimental, historical, artistic, logical and other evidence to interpret the subject addressed in a given passage, rather than through another verse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tasnim]] ([[tafsir]]), Vol 1, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In doubtful cases the law is often derived not from substantive principles induced from existing rules, but from procedural presumptions (''usul 'amaliyyah'') concerning factual probability.  An example is the presumption of continuity: if one knows that a given state of affairs, such as ritual purity, existed at some point in the past but one has no evidence one way or the other whether it exists now, one can presume that the situation has not changed.&lt;ref&gt;One can compare, in Western legal systems, the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of possession.  Similarly Catholic moral theology distinguishes between "direct principles" and "reflex principles", the latter being the equivalent of [[Murtada al-Ansari]]'s ''usul 'amaliyyah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of probability forms a large part of the Shiite science of ''usul al-fiqh'', and was developed by [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (1706-1792) and Shaykh [[Murtada al-Ansari]] (died 1864). The only primary text on Shi'ite principles of jurisprudence in English is [[Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr]]'s ''Durus fi 'Ilm al-'Usul''.&lt;ref&gt;This has been translated into English twice: by [[Roy Mottahedeh]] as "Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence" (2005) {{ISBN|978-1-85168-393-2}} and anonymously as "The Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence according to Shi'i Law" (2003) {{ISBN|978-1-904063-12-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English version==
Uşūl al-Fiqh, the [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|methodology of jurisprudence]], which is usually – and inaccurately, if not incorrectly – translated “principles of jurisprudence,” is an Islamic science which is developed by Shiite scholars in two recent centuries into an unparalleled intellectual, logical system of thought and a comprehensive branch of knowledge which not only serves as the logic of jurisprudence but as an independent science dealing with some hermeneutical problems.

Lack of precise English equivalents to expressions and terms of this complicated science indicates the least difficulties of preparing the first English version of Shiite uşūl al-fiqh.

"[http://bayanbox.ir/download/6126480921220660060/USUL-AL-FIQH.pdf An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence (Uşūl al-Fiqh)-A Shiite Approach]" is the first English version of Shiite uşūl al-fiqh.[http://www.lib.ir/book/60869565/An-introduction-to-methodology-of-Islamic-Jurispru/]

This book is written by Alireza Hodaee, Professor of [[Fiqh|Jurisprudence]] and the Essentials of Islamic Law, University of Tehran.[http://usuli.ir/2016/07/04/usul-al-fiqh/]

It should be noted that most of complicated arguments of such profound science cannot be presented in an introductory work; they should be pursued in detailed books written by great Shiite Uşūlīs.
