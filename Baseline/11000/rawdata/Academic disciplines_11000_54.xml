'''Abd al-Aziz bin Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari''' ({{lang-ar|عبد العزيز بن الصديق}}; November 1920 in [[Tangier]] – November 6, 1997, in Tangier) was a [[Muslim]] scholar from [[Morocco]]. He is from the [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrissite]] branch of Moroccan Sayyids that trace themselves back to [[Idris I]], who led a [[Shiite]] revolt against the [[Abbasid]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;''Uloom al Hadith Review'', 2nd year, 3rd edition pg. 242&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al Ifaada, by Hassan Husayni, Tangier 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Among practitioners of [[Sufism]], he was sometimes referred to as "the [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] of the modern era."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deenislam.co.uk/sufinotes/qutb.html The Mujaddid of Sufism in this Time, The Qutb] at Deen Islam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Family===
Ben Sediq's father Sayyid Muhammad (b. 1887 d. November 6, 1935, in Tangier) was among prominent scholars such as his contemporary Sayyid [[Harrak|al-Harrak]]. He used to teach the works of [[Ibn Abi Zayd]] and the book [[Sahih al-Bukhari]]. Among the scholars who wrote about him are his oldest son Ahmad Ben Sediq in a book called Subhat al Aqeek (سبحة العقيق) and the scholar [[Sheikh]] Muhammad al Ayachi in a book called Nubthat al Tahqeek (نبذة التحقيق). He also has a biography in the prominent Moroccan scholars encyclopaedia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Uloom al Hadith Review'', 2nd year, 3rd edition P: 243&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
After a long life of research excellence, Sayyid Abdelaziz Ben Sediq died in [[Tangier]] on Friday November 6, 1997. He was buried after a funeral in which the number of mourners set a record in Tangier's biggest ever gatherings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Career==
It was not a coincidence that Abdelaziz Ben Sediq's mother as well comes from family of known scholars. Her grandfather indeed was Imam [[Ahmad ibn Ajiba]]. He started his early education in Tangier and traveled to [[Cairo]] and was a student of [[Al-Azhar Mosque|Azhar]] scholars such as [[Mahmoud Imam]] and [[Abdul Muuti Sharshimi]]. Among his works, the book Mujam al Shuyukh (معجم الشيوخ) and Fath al Aziz Bi Asaanid Sayyid Abdelaziz (فتح العزيز باسانيد لسيد عبد العزيز). He wrote several articles in the ''Khadra'' (الخضراء) and ''al-Balagh'' newspaper in Tangier and ''al-Islam'' magazine in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;''Uloom al Hadith Review'', 2nd year, 3rd edition P: 247&lt;/ref&gt; Ghumari was one of the teachers of Saudi Arabian Sufi leader [[Muhammad Alawi al-Maliki]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://soutilaahi.com/spiritual/15-ramadhan-the-day-we-remember-shaykh-muhammad-al-alawi-al-maliki-left-this-world/ 15 Ramadhan: The day we remember Shaykh Muhammad al Alawi Left this World] from Soutilaahi&lt;/ref&gt; as well as fellow Moroccan preacher [[Hassan al-Kattani]] and the famous muhadith and Islamic scholar and Sufi leader Shaykh Dr Muhammad bin Yahya al-Husayni al-Ninowy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cordobaacademy.com/about/faculty Cordoba Academy Faculty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126062931/http://cordobaacademy.com/about/faculty |date=2013-01-26 }}, © 2012 Cordoba Academy. Accessed February 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his older brothers Ahmad and Abdullah, Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari was famous for his intellectual sparring with fellow hadith scholar [[Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani]].&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Moin, [http://alsonnah.wordpress.com/2011/03/08/ahmed-al-ghumari-on-al-albani/ "Ahmed Al-Ghumari on Al-Albani"]. ''Al-Sunnah'': 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;gallery&gt;
File: Nov26_0001.jpg|His book adopting some Shia views with a preface on his biography
&lt;/gallery&gt;--&gt;

==Views==
Although Ghumari studied in a Sunni Islamic university, he registered his own critical thinking and came up with views that were unpopular with his teachers in the Azhar University. He used to adopt views based on research even if they were outside the sect or the popular religious culture. Among such views are the following:

* Unlike [[Sunni]] religious culture where all the companions of prophet [[Muhammad]] are venerated, Ghumari used to mention 6 of the companions without venerating them because they fought against [[Ali]]  &lt;ref&gt;''The 30th Hadith'', Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari,  International Patent{{Dubious|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- international patents do not exist, only international patent applications do--&gt; number -4-0-9872-9981 Al Bughaz Edition, P 44. Tangier ar.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He was among the scholars that rejected [[Islamic extremism]], which he termed [[Wahhabi]] philosophy, and the [[Jihadi]] school of thought by considering them most harmful ideas to Islamic culture and a cause of regression of the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref&gt;''al Arbaeen al Aziziya'', Preface, 1992 Tangier ar.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unlike Muslim scholars who prohibit the celebration of Muhammad's birthday, Ghumari declared such celebration to be an obligation and a duty regardless if the tradition of celebrating birth days originate from the west or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|0XNjHyidb6Y|Live lecture 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He agreed with [[Shia]] Islamic scholars on the supremacy of Ali over all people who came after Prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''Uloom al Hadith Review'', 2nd year, 3rd edition P: 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haddad&gt;[[Gibril Haddad]], [http://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/f/The%20Ghumari%20School.htm The Ghumari School]. 6 December 2002: Living Islam. Last updated 2 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his book al-Ifada or "The interest in the ways on which the Hadith - that looking at Ali is a worship- is based" (الافادة بطرق حديث النظر الى علي عبادة), he openly criticized the narrations of [[hadith]] that were registered under the [[Umayyad]] and the Abbasid rule, and accused some narrators to be manipulated by the political ruling institution of that time. That was repeated over so many pages of the book.
* In his book Al-Ittihad (الاتحاد) he supported re-introducing tougher penalties for [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and related misdeeds.

Also like the rest of his family, Ghumari's exact theological viewpoints were difficult to pin down. Although a practitioner of Sufism, he was also critical of other Sufis. Though a Sunni, he and his brothers also held views in juristprudence and dogmatics outside of the mainstream.&lt;ref name=haddad/&gt; It is most likely that the Ghumaris had a unique viewpoint of their own.

'''Anthrozoology''' (also known as '''human–non-human-animal studies''', or''' HAS''') is the subset of [[ethnobiology]] that deals with interactions between humans and other animals. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with other disciplines including [[anthropology]], [[ethnology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]]. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI 2010, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from fields such as anthropology, sociology, biology, history and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo. ''Teaching the Animal: Human–Animal Studies Across the Disciplines''. Lantern Books, 2010, p. xi. and Hurn, Samantha. ''Humans and Other Animals''. Pluto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 Animals &amp; Society Institute.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625044717/http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 |date=June 25, 2013 }} Accessed February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: the term should not be confused with "animal studies," which often refers to [[animal testing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthrozoology scholars, such as [[Pauleen Bennett]] recognize the lack of scholarly attention given to non-human animals in the past, and to the relationships between human and non-human animals, especially in the light of the magnitude of animal representations, symbols, stories and their actual physical presence in human societies. Rather than a unified approach, the field currently consists of several methods adapted from the several participating disciplines to encompass human-nonhuman animal relationships and occasional efforts to develop ''[[sui generis]]'' methods.

== Growth of the field ==
There are currently 23 college programs in HAS or a related field in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, Israel and the Netherlands, as well as an additional eight veterinary school programs in North America, and over thirty HAS organizations in the US, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Israel, Sweden, and Switzerland.

In the UK, the University of Exeter runs an MA in Anthrozoology which explores human-animal interactions from anthropological (cross-cultural) perspectives. Human animal interactions (HAI) involving companion animals are also studied by the [[Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition]], which partners with the US [[National Institutes of Health]] to research HAI in relation to child development and aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Processes in Social &amp; Affective Development: Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) Research|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/der/branches/cdbb/programs/psad/HAI|website=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)|accessdate=7 April 2018|date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now three primary lists for HAS scholars and students—H-Animal, the Human-Animal Studies listserv, and NILAS, as well as the Critical Animal Studies list.

There are now over a dozen journals covering HAS issues, many of them founded in the last decade, and hundreds of HAS books, most of them published in the last decade (see for example, ''Humanimalia''). Brill, Berg, Johns Hopkins, Purdue, Columbia, Reaktion, Palgrave-McMillan, University of Minnesota, University of Illinois, and Oxford all offer either a HAS series or a large number of HAS books.

In addition, in 2006, Animals and Society Institute (ASI) began hosting the Human-Animal Studies Fellowship, a six-week program in which pre- and post-doctoral scholars work on a HAS research project at a university under the guidance of host scholars and distance peer scholars. Beginning in 2011, ASI has partnered with Wesleyan Animal Studies, who will be hosting the fellowship in conjunction with ASI. There are also a handful of HAS conferences per year, including those organized by ISAZ and NILAS, and the Minding Animals conference, held in 2009 in Australia. Finally, there are more HAS courses being taught now than ever before. The ASI website lists over 300 courses (primarily in North America, but also including Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, and Poland) in twenty-nine disciplines at over 200 colleges and universities, not including over 100 law school courses.

'''Buy Nothing Day''' ('''BND''') is an international day of protest against [[consumerism]]. In North America, the United Kingdom, Finland and Sweden, Buy Nothing Day is held the day after U.S. [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], concurrent to [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]; elsewhere, it is held the following day, which is the last Saturday in November.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2000"&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/internetnews/story/0,7369,402170,00.html Buy Nothing Day]"''The Guardian.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adbusters BND"&gt;"[http://abillionpeople.org/buy-nothing-day/ Buy Nothing Day]"''Adbusters.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Buy Nothing Day was founded in [[Vancouver]] by artist Ted Dave&lt;ref&gt;Crook, Barbara. "Can you say bye to buying 1 day a year?" ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''. September 25, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently promoted by ''[[Adbusters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/11/40142 Click Here to Buy Nothing]. Joanna Glasner. [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']], November 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; based in Canada.

The first Buy Nothing Day was organized in Canada in September 1992 "as a day for society to examine the issue of overconsumption." In 1997, it was moved to the Friday after American Thanksgiving, also called [[Black Friday (shopping)|"Black Friday"]], which is one of the ten busiest shopping days in the United States. In 2000, some advertisements by ''Adbusters'' promoting Buy Nothing Day were denied advertising time by almost all major television networks except for [[CNN]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 2000"/&gt; Soon, campaigns started appearing in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Austria, Germany, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, France, Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enkopfridag.se/1998.php|title=1998, köp-inget-dagen|publisher=En köpfri dag|language=Swedish|author=Jonas Lindkvist|date=1998|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation now includes more than 65 nations.

==Activities==
[[File:Buy Nothing Day trolley (cropped).jpg|thumb|A Buy Nothing Day sign attached to a Walmart shopping trolley by an activist]]
Various gatherings and forms of protest have been used on Buy Nothing Day to draw attention to the problem of [[overconsumption]]:
* Credit card cut-up: Participants stand in a shopping mall, shopping center, or store with a pair of scissors and a poster that advertises help for people who want to put an end to mounting debt and extortionate interest rates with one simple cut. Namely, by destroying their credit card by cutting it with the scissors.
* Free, non-commercial street parties
* [[Sit-in]]
* [[Zombie walk]]: Participant "zombies" wander around shopping malls or other consumer havens with a blank stare. When asked what they are doing, participants describe Buy Nothing Day.
* Whirl-mart: Participants silently steer their shopping carts around a shopping mall or store in a long, baffling conga line without putting anything in the carts or actually making any purchases.
* Public protests
* Wildcat General Strike: A strategy used for the 2009 Buy Nothing Day where participants not only do not buy anything for twenty-four hours but also keep their lights, televisions, computers and other non-essential appliances turned off, their cars parked, and their phones turned off or unplugged from sunrise to sunset.&lt;ref name="Adbusters BND"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}}
* Buy Nothing Day hike: Rather than celebrating consumerism by shopping, participants celebrate The Earth and nature.
* Buy Nothing + [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]]: As the monthly Critical Mass bicycle ride often falls on this day or near, rides in some cities acknowledge and celebrate Buy Nothing Day.
* Buy Nothing Day paddle along the San Francisco waterfront: This event is promoted by the Bay Area Sea Kayakers to kayak along the notoriously consumptive San Francisco waterfront.
* The Buy Nothing Coat Exchange: began in Rhode Island and became part of the Buy Nothing Day some twenty years ago. Coupling the two events was the brainchild of Greg Gerritt, an expert in environmental studies and long term activist in consumerism and global warming. Similar Winter Coat Exchanges take place on Buy Nothing Day in Kentucky, Utah and Oregon. Coats are collected throughout the month of November from anyone who wants to donate and brought to various locations within each state. On the day after Thanksgiving, many opt out of the Black Friday madness to donate and/or volunteer. On that day, anyone who needs a winter coat is welcome to exchange one or just take one. The lines in Providence RI form early and are long which punctuates the need that is prevalent in many cities and towns. The combination of the two events has become a welcomed tradition in RI.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==Criticism==
While critics of the day charge that Buy Nothing Day simply causes participants to buy the next day,&lt;ref&gt;[https://thetyee.ca/Views/2006/11/24/BND/ Why I Shop on Buy Nothing Day], TheTyee.ca, November 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Adbusters states that it "isn't just about changing your habits for one day" but "about starting a lasting lifestyle commitment to consuming less and producing less [[waste]]."{{cite quote|date=November 2018}}

Other campaigns, such as Shift Your Shopping, attempt to redirect spending away from corporate chains and online giants toward locally owned, community-based businesses as a means to combat consumerism. Even some independent business advocates, such as the [[American Independent Business Alliance]], recognize "Black Friday" frenzy does little for independent businesses and instead encourage people to consider giving gifts but not necessarily "things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Gifts Don't Have to Be "Stuff"|url=http://www.amiba.net/news/2011/great-gifts-not-stuff|publisher=American Independent Business Alliance|archivedate=October 17, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017183448/http://www.amiba.net/news/2011/great-gifts-not-stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaming==
[[Adbusters]] in 2011 renamed the event Occupy Xmas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://occupyxmas.net/ Occupy Xmas], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231142336/http://www.occupyxmas.net/ |date=December 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the [[Occupy movement]].  Buy Nothing Day was first joined with Adbuster's [[Buy Nothing Christmas]] campaign.  Shortly thereafter, Lauren Bercovitch, the production manager at Adbusters Media Foundation publicly embraced the principles of Occupy Xmas, advocating "something as simple as buying locally—going out and putting money into your local economy—or making your Christmas presents".&lt;ref&gt;[https://thefulcrum.ca/news/an-occupied-christmas/ An interview with Lauren Bercovitch]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the central message of Occupy X-mas and Occupy Christmas differed in that Occupy X-Mas called for a "buy nothing Christmas" and Occupy Christmas called for support of local economy, artists, and craftspeople in holiday shopping.  The union of these ideologies calls for a Buy Nothing Day to kick off a season of supporting local economy and family.

'''Chicana feminism''', also called '''Xicanisma''',&lt;ref&gt;IRL
From Chicano to Xicanx: A brief history of a political and cultural identity&lt;/ref&gt; is a sociopolitical movement in the United States that analyzes the historical, cultural, spiritual, educational, and economic intersections of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women that identify as [[Chicano|Chicana]]. Chicana feminism challenges the stereotypes that Chicanas face across lines of gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality. Most importantly, Chicana feminism serves as a movement, theory and praxis that helps women reclaim their existence between and among the [[Chicano Movement]] and [[Feminism in the United States|American feminist movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings|last=Garcia|first=Alma|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1997|isbn=9780415918015|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Emerging out of the identity movements of the 1960s, Chicana feminists created a distinctive trajectory and mapping of feminist political thought and practice that centered their unique experiences with gender, race, class and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;"The Research Context", by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Since many feminist methodologies are similar in practice, Chicana feminists distinguished themselves from other feminists by centering their unique lived experiences with gender, race, class, sexuality and nationalism – offering critiques and responses to their exclusion from both the mainstream Chicano nationalist movement and the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist movement]]. One important way they were able to do this was through the inclusion of different varieties of the Spanish language, a vital component to the preservation of Chicano/a culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurtado|first=Aída|title=Sitios y lenguas: Chicanas theorize feminisms|journal=Hypatia|volume=13|issue=2|pages=134–161|doi=10.2979/HYP.1998.13.2.134|issn=0887-5367|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminism maintains that throughout history, women have been oppressed, and sometimes even abused, in many different societies. In Latin America, just as in Europe, Asia and Africa, many women were, for centuries, treated by their fathers, brothers and husbands with discrimination. Women in Latin America, Mexico included, were seen as child-bearers, homemakers, and caregivers. These women had to watch their children, perform household chores, and cook for their husbands. Many men did not consider women to be capable of working outside the home, which is part of the reason why the term "weaker sex" was coined.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In Latin America, women at those times had to act according to some social standards. In many Latin American cities, for example, women were not seen with good eyes if they spoke to men they did not know. Meanwhile, [[prostitution]], for example, was legal in many Latin American areas, and men were not criticized, but rather seen as heroic, if they had several girlfriends, even if the man was married.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1848, with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, Mexico ceded to the US: Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and part of Colorado and Wyoming.  Former citizens of Mexico living in those territories became US citizens.

During the twentieth century, Hispanic [[immigration]] to the United States began to slowly but steadily change American demographics. By 1940, [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] was one of the cities with the largest group of Chicanos in the United States.

Euro-American women also had their own problems: they were also stereotyped as homemakers, caregivers, and child-bearers. Unlike women of minority races, however, white women largely evaded dealing with [[racism]], unless they or their husbands befriended people of Black or Hispanic background. Euro-American women combated this with the emergence of waves of feminism, the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] addressed suffrage while the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]] discussed issues of sexuality, private vs. the public sphere, reproductive rights, and marital rape.

=== Origin ===
Chicana feminists challenged their prescribed role in ''la familia'', and demanded to have the [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] experiences that they faced recognized. Chicanas identify as being consciously aware, self-determined, proud of their roots, heritage, and experience while prioritizing [[La Raza]]. With the emergence of the Chicano Movement, the structure of Chicano families saw dramatic changes. Specifically, women began to question the role that they were assigned within the family and where their place was within the Chicano national struggle.&lt;ref name="garcia217-238"&gt;Garcia, A. M. (June 1, 1989). The Development of Chicana Feminist Discourse, 1970-1980. Gender and Society, 3, 2, 217-238.&lt;/ref&gt; In the seminal text, La Chicana by Elizabeth Martinez, Martinez writes: “She [La Chicana]  is oppressed by the forces of racism, [[imperialism]], and sexism. This can be said of all non-white women in the United States. Her oppression by the forces of racism and imperialism is similar to that endured by our men. Oppression by sexism, however, is hers alone.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings|last=Garcia|first=Alma|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=32–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women  also sought out to battle the internalized struggles of self-hatred rooted in the colonization of their people. This included breaking the mujer buena/mujer mala myth, in which the domestic Spanish Woman is viewed as good and the Indigenous Woman that is a part of the community is viewed as bad. Chicana feminist thought emerged as a response to patriarchy, racism, classism, and colonialism as well as a response to all the ways that these legacies of oppression have become internalized.&lt;ref&gt;'''''Review of Part I: Implications for Feminist Theorizing''''', by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What are the issues happening in Chicana feminism now and then?'''

Chicana feminism have many different movements within the culture and ethnicities, according to Garcia (1989) the Chicana feminist movement was created to adhere to the specific issues which have had on Chicana women of colour which has originated from the Chicano movement because women desired to be treated equally and have the acceptance and motivation to what the Chicanos were doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=A. M|date=1989|title=The development of Chicana feminist discourse|url=|journal=Gender and Society|volume=1|pages=217–238|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicana feminist movement has certainly influenced many Chicana women to be more active and to defend their rights not just as single women but women in solidarity who come together forming a society with equal contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gomez|first=A.N|date=1997|title=Garcia, Chicana feminist thought: the basic historical writings|url=|journal=Chicana feminism|volume=1|pages=52–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminist Garcia (1989) has noted that awareness is only the start such awareness becomes the catalyst for change which is what Chicana feminism is about Chicana feminism is also about creating intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzales|first=S|date=1980|title=Toward a feminist pedagogy|url=|journal=A Journal of Women Studies|volume=5|pages=48–51|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political organization (1940s – 1970s)  ===
Beginning in the 1940s, Mexican-Americans led a civil rights movement with a goal of achieving Mexican-American empowerment. By the 1960s, the [[Chicano Movement]], also known as ''El Movimiento'', became a prominent campaign in the lives of many Mexican-American workers and youth.&lt;ref&gt;Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, The [[United Farm Workers]] (UFW) organization was founded by [[Cesar Chavez|César Chávez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = UFW Chronology|url =http://ufw.org/research/history/ufw-chronology/|publisher=United Farm Workers|accessdate = 2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dolores Huerta]], and [[Philip Vera Cruz]].

Between the late 1960s through the 1970s, The Chicano Student Movement began in which students fought and organized for better quality education.&lt;ref name="What is the Chicana Movement"&gt;{{cite web|title = What is the Chicana Movement?|url = http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|website = umich.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first efforts of organizing the Chicana Feminist Movement began in the later part of the 1960s. During the Chicano Movement,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, O. C. (2002, Fall). [http://postcolonialstudies.emory.edu/chicanafeminism/ Chicana Feminism]. Retrieved May 11, 2014, from Emory University website.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicana women formed committees within Chicano organizations. Similar to the organization of other groups in the Women's Movement, the Chicana feminists organized consciousness-raising groups and held conferences specific to the issues that Chicana women faced.&lt;ref name="segura69-92"&gt;Segura, D. A., and Pesquera, B. M. (January 1, 1992). Beyond Indifference and Antipathy: The Chicana Movement and Chicana Feminist Discourse. Aztlan: a Journal of Chicano Studies, 19, 2, 69-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although community organizers were working toward empowering the Mexican-American community, the narrative of the Chicano Movement largely ignored the women that were involved with organizing during this time of civil disobedience.

Chicana Feminism serves to highlight a much greater movement than generally perceived; a variety of minority groups are given a platform to confront their oppressors whether that be racism, homophobia, and multiple other forms of social injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects05/cf/|title=Chicana Feminism|website=www.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana liberation unshackles individuals, as well as the broader group as a whole, allowing them to live lives as they desire – commanding cultural respect and equality.&lt;ref&gt;Blea, Irene I. 1992. La Chicana and the Intersection of Race, Class, and Gender. New York , NY : Praeger Publishers. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminists collectively realized the importance of connecting the issues of gender with need for improvement with respect to other civil liberties such as socioeconomic background, heritage, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Benita. 2004. Separate Roads to Feminism. New York , NY : Cambridge University Press. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chicanas in the Brown Berets ====
The [[Brown Berets]] were a youth group that took on a more militant approach to organizing for the Mexican-American community formed in California in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="kcet.org"&gt;{{cite web|title = ¡La Lucha Continua!

==== Chicana feminist organization ====
The 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference began the Chicano Movement and eventually, [[MEChA]]. At the conference women began to get involved in the male-dominated dialogue to address feminist concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement|url=http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|publisher=The University of Michigan|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first [[Conferencia de Mujeres por la Raza|National Chicana Conference]] held in Houston, Texas in May 1971, over 600 women organized to discuss issues surrounding regarding equal access to education, reproductive justice, formation of childcare centers, and more (Smith, 2002).  While the event was the first major gathering of its kind, the conference itself was fraught with discord as Chicanas from geographically and ideologically divergent positions sparred over the role of feminism within the Chicano movement. These conflicts led to a walkout on the final day of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=¡Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement|last=Blackwell|first=Maylei|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2016|isbn=1477312668|location=Austin, TX|pages=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutionary chicanas during this time period while critiquing the inability of the mainstream Chicano nationalist movements to address sexism and misogyny, simultaneously renounced the mainstream Second Wave feminist movement for its inability to include racism and classism in their politics. Chicanas during this time felt excluded from mainstream feminist movements because they had different needs, concerns and demands. Through persistent objections to their exclusions women have gone from being called Chicano women to Chicanas to introducing the adoption of a/o or o/a as a way of acknowledging both genders when discussing the community. Chicanas demanded free day-care centers and a reform of the welfare system, they sought to fight against all three structures of oppression they faced, including sexism, but also prioritizing racism and imperialism.

One of the First Chicana organizations was the [[Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional]] (CFMN), founded in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yo Soy Chicana: A Chicana Feminist Movement|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/departures/yo-soy-chicana-a-chicana-feminist-movement|publisher=KCET|accessdate=24 March 2018|language=en|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept for the CFMN originated during the National Chicano Issues Conference when a group of attending Chicanas noticed that their concerns were not adequately addressed at the Chicano conference. The women met outside of the conference and drafted a framework for the CFMN that established them as active and knowledgeable community leaders of a people's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, K. (2013). La Hermandad and Chicanas Organizing: The Community Rhetoric of the Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional. Community Literacy Journal, 7(2), 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female archetypes ===
Central to much of Chicana feminism is a reclaiming of the female archetypes [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|La Virgen de Guadalupe]], [[La Llorona]], and [[La Malinche]].&lt;ref&gt;'''''The Research Context''''', by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado&lt;/ref&gt; These archetypes have prevented Chicanas from achieving sexual and bodily agency due to the ways they have been historically constructed as negative categories through the lenses of patriarchy and colonialism.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Women in Early Mexico|last=Schroeder|first=Susan|last2=Wood|first2=Stephanie|last3=Haskett|first3=Robert|publisher=Norman : University of Oklahoma Press|year=1997|isbn=9780806129709|location=|pages=292–312|chapter=14|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting the discourse from a traditional (patriarchal) representation of these archetypes to a de-colonial feminist understanding of them is a crucial element of contemporary Chicana feminism, and represents the starting point for a reclamation of Chicana female power, sexuality, and spirituality.

[[La Virgin de Guadalupe|La Virgen de Guadalupe]] and [[La Malinche]] have become symbolic means of suppressing Chicana women's sexuality through the patriarchal dichotomy of puta/virgin, the positive role model and the negative one, historically and continuously held up before Mexican women as icons and mirrors in which to examine their own self-image and define their self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gloria Anzaldúa's canonical text addresses the subversive power of reclaiming indigenous spirituality to unlearn colonial and patriarchal constructions and restrictions on women, their sexuality, and understandings of motherhood. Anzaldúa writes, "I will no longer be made to feel ashamed of existing. I will have my voice: Indian, Spanish, white".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; La Malinche is a victim of centuries of patriarchal myths that permeate the Mexican woman's consciousness, often without her awareness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Malintzin (also known as Doña Marina by the Spaniards or "La Malinche" post-Mexican independence from Spain) was born around 1505 to noble Indigenous parents in rural Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Marina
MEXICAN NATIVE AMERICAN PRINCESS&lt;/ref&gt; Since Indigenous women were often used as pawns for political alliances at this time, she was betrayed by her parents and sold into slavery between the ages of 12–14, traded to Hernan Cortés as a concubine, and because of her intelligence and fluency in multiple languages, was promoted to his "wife" and diplomat. She served as Cortés's translator, playing a key role in the Spaniard's conquest of Tenochtitlan and, by extension, the conquest of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mexican history : a primary source reader|publisher=Westview Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Jaffary|editor-first=Nora E.|location=|pages=72|chapter=12. The Nahua Interpreter Malintzin Translates for Hernan Cortés and Moteucçoma (1580)|quote=|editor-last2=Osowski|editor-first2=Edward W.|editor-last3=Porter|editor-first3=Susie S.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She bore Cortés a son, Martín, who is considered to be the first mestizo and the beginning of the "Mexican" race.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, a scapegoat was needed to justify centuries of colonial rule. Because of Malintzin's relationship with Cortés and her role as translator and informant in Spain's conquest of Mexico, she was seen as a traitor to her race. By contrast, Chicana feminism calls for a different understanding. Since nationalism was a concept unknown to Indigenous people in the 16th century, Malintzin had no sense of herself as "Indian", making it impossible for her to show ethnic loyalty or  conscientiously act as a traitor. Malintzin was one of millions of women who were traded and sold in Mexico pre-colonization. With no way to escape a group of men, and inevitably rape, Malintzin showed loyalty to Cortés to ensure her survival.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

La Malinche has become the representative of a female sexuality that is passive, "rape-able", and always guilty of betrayal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rather than a traitor or a "whore", Chicana feminism calls for an understanding of her as an agent within her limited means, resisting rape and torture (as was common among her peers) by becoming a partner and translator to Cortés. Placing the blame for Mexico's conquest on Malintzin creates a foundation for placing upon women the responsibility to be the moral compasses of society and blames them for their sexuality, which is counterintuitive. It is important to understand Malintzin as a victim not of Cortés, but of myth. Chicana feminism calls for an understanding in which she should be praised for the adaptive resistance she exhibited that ultimately led to her survival.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By challenging patriarchal and colonial representations, Chicana writers re-construct their relationship to the figure of La Malinche and these other powerful archetypes, and reclaim them in order to re-frame a spirituality and identity that is both decolonizing and empowering.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Cristina.

===Criticism===
One critique of Chicana feminism was that it was a separatist movement that would divide the Chicano Movement. Loyalist Chicanas felt that the creation of a separate Chicana feminist movement was a dangerous and divisive political tactic, influenced too heavily by the Anglo women's movement. Loyalists believed that racism was the most important issue Chicanos and Chicanas were facing. They felt that the sexual oppression Chicanas faced from Chicanos was the fault of the system rather than the men, and breaking down the racial oppression affecting both Chicanos and Chicanas would resolve the sexual inequality the women experienced.

Similarly, Chicana feminists have been blamed for tearing at the values of Chicano culture. The first reason for this is that loyalists believed Chicana feminists were anti-family, anti-culture, and anti-man, thus pitting them against the Chicano movement. Furthermore, feminism itself was viewed by many as individualistic and as something that was taking away from other issues, such as racism.&lt;ref name="garcia217-238" /&gt;

However, following the contributions of Chicana feminist writers, including [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] and [[Cherríe Moraga]], Chicana feminism has gained the support of feminists of diverse backgrounds. The emergence of queer theory and intersectionality in feminist movements has challenged the misogyny of the Chicano movement and has broadened and strengthened the Chicana/o movement to be in solidarity with other people of color in the United States.

== Cultural identities and spirituality ==
The term "Chicano" originates from Aztec indigenous peoples who pronounced it "meshicano" in the native Nahuatl language. However, historically the Spaniards had no "sh" in their vocabulary and pronounced it "mexicano" (spelled mexicano), a pronunciation that has been carried into the present. Historically, the term Chicano has not always been positive and empowering. The term Chicano was for a long time used in a demeaning manner, and was associated with newly arrived Mexican immigrants in the early twentieth century until it was later reclaimed by Chicana feminists with the emergence of the [[Chicano Movement|Chicano Nationalist Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/2014/06/20/chicana-feminism/|title=Postcolonial Studies {{!}} Chicana Feminism|website=scholarblogs.emory.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many white Americans used the word Chicano to describe Mexican immigrants as poor, unskilled, and ignorant people. Later, the term was used to distinguish first-generation, American-born Mexican-Americans from the older generations of Mexican immigrants; two groups that were often separated by a language barrier. Most first-generation American Chicanos adopted English as their first language, with some Chicanos blending both English and Spanish to create a hybrid dialect or slang argot called [[Caló (Chicano)|caló]] (also called pachuco). The U.S. media, not being able to fully understand these emerging American identities, stigmatized Chicanos and Mexican in propagating the notion that came from a country of corruption, and that they were criminals, thieves, and immoral people.

The definitions of Chicana/o in the United States are contested. Because many Chicana/os are born to parents who are immigrants from Mexico, one definition of Chicana/o is rooted in the idea that this identity straddles two different worlds. The first world is that of the country of origin from which their families descended from, such as Mexico, Guatemala, or El Salvador. Many Chicanos today, for example, continue to practice the religion, language, and culture of their respective family's countries of origin. Another definition of Chicano is rooted in the identity being completely embedded within the "American" culture. Many Chicana/os have assimilated into "American" culture and use English as their primary language. Despite these two distinctions in definition, some might argue that Chicanos are stigmatized by both cultures because they don't fit into either one completely. For this reason, one view of Chicano identity is that a new culture is created in order to resist oppression and navigate both worlds.

Contemporary renditions of the word Chicano have been to replace the “C-H” beginning with the letter X, making the word Xicano. This is significant because it recenters the Nahua language and pronunciation of the sound “ch”, tying the Xicana/o to indigenous roots and decentering Eurocentric ties to identity.

Chicana feminism has also created another linguistic change, there is another “x” at the end of Xicanx, and it is being used to be inclusive of others gender identities and move away from a colonial imposed binary and gendered language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodríguez|first=Richard T|date=October 2017|title=X marks the spot|url=https://doi-org.libproxy.nau.edu/10.1177/0921374017727880|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume= 29| issue = 3, 2017|pages=203–212|via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been resistance to this change in language and there is discussions of whether or not this is useful from academics and community members, Feminists and queer folk are fighting for this change in language be inclusive as well as creating a new formation of history. The usage of Xicanx is powerful due to trying to move back to indigenous roots as well as trying to create more space for Queer folk who have been marginalized by previous Chicano/a movements.  

=== Duality and "The New Mestiza" ===
The concept of "The New Mestiza" comes from feminist author, Gloria Anzaldúa. In her book, ''Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza'', she writes: "In a constant state of mental nepantilism, an Aztec word meaning torn between ways, la mestiza is a product of the transfer of the cultural and spiritual values of one group to another. Being tricultural, monolingual, bilingual or multilingual, speaking a patois, and in a state of perpetual transition, the mestiza faces the dilemma of the mixed breed: which collectivity does the daughter of a dark-skinned mother listen to? [...] Within us and within la Cultura Chicana, commonly held beliefs of the white culture attack commonly held beliefs of the Mexican culture, and both attack commonly held beliefs of the indigenous culture. Subconsciously, we see an attack on ourselves and our beliefs as a treat and we attempt to block with a counterstance."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza|last=Anzaldúa|first=Gloria|publisher=|year=1987|isbn=9781879960749|location=|pages=40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anzaldua presents a mode of being for Chicanas, that honors their unique standpoint and lived experience. This theory of embodiment offers a mode of being for Chicanas who are constantly negotiating hybridity and cultural collision, and the ways that inform the way they are continuously making new knowledge and understandings of self, often time in relation to intersecting and various forms of oppression. This theory discloses how a counter-stance cannot be a way of life because it depends on hegemonic constructions of domination, in terms of race, nationality, and culture. A counter-stance locks one into a duel of oppressor and oppressed; locked in mortal combat, like the cop and the criminal, both are reduced to a common denominator of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anzaldua|first1=Gloria|title=Borderlans/La frontera|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|isbn=978-1-879960-12-1|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being solely reactionary means nothing is being created, revived or renewed in place of the dominant culture and that the dominant culture must remain dominant for counterstance to exist. For Anzaldua and this theory of embodiment, there must be space to create something new. The “new mestiza” was a canonical text that redefined what it meant to be Chicana. In this theory, being Chicana entails hybridity, contradictions, tolerance for ambiguity and plurality, nothing is rejected or excluded from histories and legacies of oppression. Further, this theory of embodiment calls for synthesizing all aspects of identity and creating new meanings, not simply balancing or coming together of different aspects of identity.

=== Mujerista ===
Mujerista was largely influenced by the African American women's "Womanist" approach proposed by Alice Walker. Mujerista was defined by Ada María Isasi-Díaz in 1996. This Latina feminist identity draws from the main ideas of womanism by combating inequality and oppression through participation in social justice movements within the Latina/o community.&lt;ref&gt;Tijerina-Revilla, A.

New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to redefine the Latina/o identity.

=== Nepantla spirituality ===
[[Nepantla]] is a [[Nahuatl|Nahua]] word which translates to "in the middle of it" or "middle". Nepantla can be described as a concept or spirituality in which multiple realities are experienced at the same time (Duality). As a Chicana, understanding and having indigenous ancestral knowledge of spirituality plays an instrumental role in the path to healing, decolonization, cultural appreciation, self-understanding, and self-love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nepantla Spirituality: My Path to the Source(s) of Healing|last = Medina|first = Lara|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |page = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepantla is often associated with author Chicana feminist Gloria Anzaldúa, who coined the term, "Nepantlera". "Nepantleras are threshold people; they move within and among multiple, often conflicting, worlds and refuse to align themselves exclusively with any single individual, group, or belief system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20IV%20Special/AnaLouiseKeating-FM.pdf|title = From Borderlands and New Mestizas to Nepantlas and Nepantleras Anzaldúan Theories for Social Change|date = 2006|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Keating|first = AnaLouise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepantla is a mode of being for the Chicana and informs the way she experiences the world and various systems of oppression.

=== Body Politics ===
Suzanne Bost discuss in ''Encarnacion : Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature,'' about how body politics has shifted in the way it used to be looked at by Chicana feminism. It has moved beyond just looking at identity politics, it now looks at how “[...]the intersections between particular bodies, cultural contexts, and political needs”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encarnacion : Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature|last=Bost|first=Suzanne|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780823230846|location=|pages=193–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now looking beyond just looking at race, but incorporating intersectionality and how mobility, accessibility, mental and physical abilities, caregivers and their roles in lives, work with the body of Chicana's. Examples of Frida Kahlo and her abilities are discussed, as well as Gloria Anzaldua’s diabetes, to illustrated how abilities must be discussed when talking about identities. “Since there is no single or constant locus of identification, our analyses must adapt to different cultural frameworks, shifting feelings, and matter that is fluid.[...] our thinking about bodies, identities, and politics must keep moving.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chicana feminism needs to move beyond just looking at singular aspects of identities, but using all of them and contextualizing it’s effects on what is going on in time. Identifying as Chicana/o/x means to be political and the body that you inhabit will be politicized as well, to understand how it is being politicized along with your identities is to look at how it is done. Bost uses examples of contemporary Chicana artists and literature to illustrate this, Chicana feminism hasn’t ended it is just manifesting in different ways now.

=== Queer Interventions ===
Chicana feminist theory evolved as a theory of embodiment and a theory of flesh due to the canonical works of Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga, both of whom identify as queer. Queer interventions in Chicana feminist thought called for an inclusion and honoring of the cultures’ joteria. In La conciencia de la mestiza, Gloria Anzaldua wrote, “the mestizo and the queer exist at this time and point on the evolutionary continuum for a purpose. We are blending that proves that all blood is intricately woven together and that we are spawned out of similar souls”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands La Frontera The New Mestiza, 4th Edition|last=Anzaldua|first=Gloria|publisher=aunt lute|year=1987|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=99–114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This intervention centers queerness as a focal part of liberation, a lived experience that cannot be ignored or excluded.

In Queer Aztlan: the Reformation of Chicano Tribe,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Latino/a Thought : Culture, Politics, and Society|last=Vázquez|first=Francisco H|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2009|isbn=9780742563544|location=|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherrie Moraga interrogates the construction of Chicano identity in relation with queerness. Offering a critique of the exclusion of people of color from mainstream gay movements as well as the homophobia rampant in Chicano nationalist movements. Moraga also discusses Aztlan, the metaphysical land and nation that belongs to Chicano ideologies, how this communidad and ideas need to move forward into making new forms of culture and community in order to survive. "Feminist critics are committed to the preservation of Chicano culture, but we know that our culture will not survive marital rape, battering, incest, drug and alcohol abuse, AIDS, and the marginalization of lesbian daughters and gay sons".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Moraga brings up criticisms of the Chicano movement and how it has been ignoring the issues within the movement itself, and that need to be addressed in order for the culture to be preserved rightfully.

In "Chicana Lesbians: Fear and Loathing in the Chicano Community," &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Carla Trujillo discusses how being a Chicana lesbian is incredibly difficult due to their culture's expectations on family and heterosexuality. Chicana lesbians who do become mothers break this expectation and become liberated from the social norms of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maythee|first1=Rojas|title=Women of Color and Feminism|date=2009|publisher=Seal Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-58005-272-6|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Carla Trujillo edited and compiled, the anthology ''Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About''&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About|last=Trujillo|first=Carla|publisher=Third Woman Press|year=1991|isbn=9780943219066|location=|pages=186–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1991) was published by Third Woman Press. This anthology was controversial and banned because of its cover art which was a piece by Ester Hernandez titled ''La Ofrenda''. Since its original publication, the book has been re-published however, the cover art has changed. This anthology includes poetry and essays by Chicana women creating new understandings of self through their sexuality and race. This book brings visibility to Lesbian Chicana writers and artists whose work hasn't been as mainstream as other feminist artists. The contributions pages gives information about the writers and their histories, this also makes the book transparent about who is writing and bringing visibility to various different names.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''ECOFEMINISM IN CHICANA FEMINIST MOVEMENT'''

Chicana environmentalism combines the notion of ecofeminism and environmental justice whilst also providing a critique on the westernised view of ecofeminism and the toxicity caused by disregarding a certain race and the knowledge and history that they possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmes|first=C.M|date=2010|title=Chicana Environmentalisms: Deterritorialization as a Practice of Decolonization|url=|journal=The Ohio State University Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest terms, Ecofeminism can be defined as the significant connection between the oppression of women and nature, and the ways in which the two can coincide harmoniously.

After the term ‘ecofeminism’ was derived in the 70’s, there has been a significant increase in the amount of recognition women have received regarding creating positive alternatives for sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buckingham|first=S|date=2004|title=Ecofeminism in the twenty-first century|url=|journal=The Geographical Journal|volume=170|pages=146–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to environmental sustainability being predominately of a western, patriarchal mindset its important for women, specifically indigenous women, to reject these premises and follow more nurturing, traditional practices. Environmental conservation in Chicana culture can be interpreted in many different ways. Firstly, it can be seen as empowerment of ones’ culture, i.e. rejecting Eurocentric ideologies and believing in the “womanness” of curandera. Curandera in Mexican American culture is believed to have healing powers. Unpacking the notion of spirituality, the practise of curandera are often observed from the view point of the patriarchal spirituality as being the creation of witchcraft. Derived from European Christianity, curandera’s "earth-based healing and nature-based spirituality" was something to be feared by those who disregarded its importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng-Levine|first=J|date=1997|title=Neocolonialism, postcolonial ecology, and ecofeminism in the works of Native American, Chicano/a, and international writers|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco feminism is not just a birth right in Chicana history, but it is also strategic. Eco feminism allows for the empowerment of women and provides an authority position for women in society.  This power comes from an association of being nature goddesses and creates a sense of privilege that would otherwise cease to exist.

Some of the ways in which Chicana women take back their ecological and ontological power can be seen through the use of literature and art. For example, murals in the San Francisco Bay area. Juana Alicia’s La Llorona’s Sacred Waters (2004) and MaestraPeace (1994), a collaboration among Juana Alicia, Miranda Bergman, Edith Boone, Susan Kelk Cervantes, Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton, and Irene Pérez. La Llorana’s Sacred Waters murals exhibits many aspects of ecofeminism in the ways in which it draws to the devastation of colonialism and the ways in which it destroyed both the natural environment and the people that inhabited it. The mural also signifies the clear links between the relationship of women and nature. Chalchiuhtlicue is an indigenous goddess of the lakes and rivers, whilst also being associated with strong fertility. She served as having the power to both give life and take it away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=H|date=2003|title=The Handbook of Mesoamerican Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs of Mexico and Central America|url=|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=14|pages=365–366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murals in the San Francisco bay area serve as a political statement of the duty of women’s social justice struggle and the constant resistance against colonialism and environmental depredation. In La llorana’s mural, Chalchiuhtlicue has a scroll rendering from her mouth with the message that she is speaking out against the horrid social conditions of her peoples.

Ecofeminism has always been a dominant part of the Chicana history, although very poorly documented. The diversity in the movement accounts for pushing towards an epistemological and ontological form of decolonization. The movement has been amplified through the reorienting of representation and by unpacking the way individuals absorbs the relationships between nature and spiritual relations.

=== Chicana art ===
Through different art mediums both past and contemporary, Chicana artists have continued to push the boundaries traditional Mexican-American values.

=== Chicana literature ===
{{See also|Xicana literature}}
Since the 1970s, many Chicana writers (such as [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] and [[Ana Castillo]]) have expressed their own definitions of Chicana feminism through their books. Moraga and Anzaldúa edited an anthology of writing by [[women of color]] titled ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]'' (published by [[Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press]]) in the early 1980s. Cherríe Moraga, along with [[Ana Castillo]] and [[Norma Alarcón]], adapted this anthology into a Spanish-language text titled ''Esta Puente, Mi Espalda: Voces de Mujeres Tercermundistas en los Estados Unidos''. Anzaldúa also published the [[bilingual]] (Spanish/English) anthology, ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]''. Mariana Roma-Carmona, Alma Gómez, and Cherríe Moraga published a collection of stories titled ''Cuentos: Stories by Latinas'', also published by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press.

The first Chicana Feminist Journal was published in 1973, called the Encuentro Feminil: The First Chicana Feminist Journal, which was published by Anna Nieto Gomez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Massacre of the Dreamers : Essays on Xicanisma. 20th Anniversary Updated Edition.|last=Castillo|first=Anna|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2014|isbn=9780826353580|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juanita Ramos and the [[Latina Lesbian History Project]] compiled an anthology including [[tatiana de la tierra]]'s first published poem, "De ambiente",&lt;ref&gt;De La Tierra, Tatiana. "Activist Latina Lesbian Publishing: esto no tiene nombre and conmoción." ''I am Aztldn: The Personal Essay in Chicano Studies, ed. Chon A. Noriega and Wendy Belcher (Los Angeles: UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center Press, 2004)'' 172.&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[oral history|oral histories]] of Latina lesbians called ''Compañeras: Latina Lesbians'' (1987).

Chicana lesbian-feminist poet Gloria Anzaldua points out that labeling a writer based on their [[social position]] allows for readers to understand the writers' location in society. However, while it is important to recognize that identity characteristics situate the writer, they do not necessarily reflect their writing. Anzaldua notes that this type of labeling has the potential to marginalize those writers who do not conform to the dominant culture.&lt;ref&gt;Anzaldua, Gloria. (1994).

=== Chicana music ===
Continually left absent from Chicano music history, many Chicana musical artists, such as [[Rita Vidaurri]] and María de Luz Flores Aceves, more commonly known as [[Lucha Reyes (Mexican singer)|Lucha Reyes]], from the 1940s and 50s, can be credited with many of strides that Chicana Feminist movements have made in the past century. For example, Vidaurri and Aceves were among the first [[Mexican people|mexicana]] women to wear [[charro]] pants while performing rancheras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas|first1=Deborah|title=Dissonant Divas in Chicana Music: The Limits of la Onda|date=2012|publisher=The University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7316-2|page=vii|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Qx00pQIkclMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=chicana+feminist+music+artists+girl+in+a+coma&amp;ots=oq8eGGUewA&amp;sig=ccwFFqLmIqTLyiM40FGZT1qlHio#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By challenging their own conflicting backgrounds and ideologies, Chicana musicians have continually broken the gender norms of their culture, and therefore created a space for conversation and change in the Latino communities.

There are many important figures in Chicana music history, each one giving a new social identity to Chicanas through their music. An important example of a Chicana musician is [[Rosita Fernández]], an artist from San Antonio, Texas. Popular in the mid 20th century, she was called "San Antonio's First Lady of Song" by [[Lady Bird Johnson]], the [[Tejano]] singer is a symbol of Chicana feminism for many Mexican Americans still today. She was described as "larger than life", repeatedly performing in [[china poblana]] dresses, throughout her career, which last more than 60 years. However, she never received a great deal of fame outside of the San Antonio, despite her long reign as one of the most active Mexican American woman public performers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas|first1=Deborah|title=Dissonant Divas in Chicana Music: The Limits of la Onda|date=2012|publisher=The University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7316-2|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Qx00pQIkclMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=chicana+feminist+music+artists+girl+in+a+coma&amp;ots=oq8eGGUewA&amp;sig=ccwFFqLmIqTLyiM40FGZT1qlHio#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49581">The '''Conservation and restoration of photographs''' is the study of the physical care and treatment of photographic materials. It covers both efforts undertaken by [[photograph conservator]]s, [[librarian]]s, [[archivist]]s, and museum [[curator]]s who manage photograph collections at a variety of [[cultural heritage]] institutions, as well as steps taken to preserve collections of personal and family photographs. It is an umbrella term that includes both preventative preservation activities such as environmental control and conservation techniques that involve treating individual items. Both preservation and conservation require an in-depth understanding of how photographs are made, and the causes and prevention of deterioration. Conservator-restorers use this knowledge to treat photographic materials, stabilizing them from further deterioration, and sometimes restoring them for aesthetic purposes.

While conservation can improve the appearance of a photograph, image quality is not the primary purpose of conservation. Conservators will try to improve the visual appearance of a photograph as much as possible, while also ensuring its long-term survival and adhering the profession's ethical standards. Photograph conservators also play a role in the field of connoisseurship. Their understanding of the physical object and its structure makes them uniquely suited to a technical examination of the photograph, which can reveal clues about how, when, and where it was made.

Photograph preservation is distinguished from [[Digital photograph restoration|''digital'' or ''optical restoration'']], which is concerned with creating and editing a digital copy of the original image rather than treating the original photographic material. Photograph preservation does not normally include moving image materials, which by their nature require a very different approach. [[Film preservation]] concerns itself with these materials.

==Overview of Photographs and Photographic Processes==
Physical photographs usually consist of three components: the final image material (e.g. silver, platinum, dyes, or pigments), the transparent binder layer (e.g. albumen, collodion, or gelatin) in which the final image material is suspended, and the primary support (e.g. paper, glass, metal, or plastic). These components affect the susceptibility of photos to damage and the preservation and conservation methods required.&lt;ref&gt;American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), ''Caring for Your Treasures'', accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.conservation-us.org/_data/n_0001/resources/live/photographs.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Photograph preservation and conservation are also concerned with the negatives from which photographic prints are made. There are two basic types of negatives: glass plate and film-based.

{{Main|List of photographic processes}}

'''1816: [[Heliography]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
The first person who succeeded in producing a paper negative of the camera image was [[Nicéphore Niépce|Joseph Nicephore Niepce]]. He coated pewter plates with bitumen (an asphaltic varnish that hardens with exposure to light) and put them in a [[Camera Obscura]]. After exposure to sunlight for a long time, the parts that were exposed to light became hard and the parts that were not could be washed off with lavender oil.

'''1837: [[Daguerreotype]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
The daguerreotype process (named after [[Louis Daguerre|Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre]]) produces a unique image, as there is no negative created. After coating a copper plate with light-sensitive silver iodide, the plate is exposed to an image for over 20 minutes and then treated with fumes from heated mercury. The longer the exposure to light, the more mercury fumes are adsorbed by the silver iodide. After the plate is washed with salt water, the image appears, reversed. This was the earliest photographic process to gain popularity in America.&lt;ref&gt;Debbie Hess Norris, "The Proper Storage and Display of a Photographic Collection," ''The Book and Paper Annual'' 2 (1983), accessed August 12, 2011, http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v02/bp02-08.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used until around 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Albright and Monique Fischer, ''Types of Photographs'', Preservation Leaflets (Northeast Document Conservation Center), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/5Photographs/02TypesOfPhotos.php.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1839: [[Salt print]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
This was the dominant form of paper print until Albumen prints were introduced in 1850. Salt prints were made using both paper and glass negatives.

'''1841: [[Calotype]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Henry Fox Talbot|William Henry Fox Talbot]] invented the negative-positive system of photography commonly used today. He first developed the Talbotype, which used silver chloride to sensitize paper. After improving the process by using silver iodide, he renamed it Calotype. The process could produce many positive images, but they were not as sharp because they were printed on fibrous paper rather than glass.

'''1842: [[Cyanotype]] (Ferro-plusiate, Blue process)'''&lt;br /&gt;
This process forms blue-colored images through a reaction to iron salts. [[John Herschel]] studied it in order to reproduce his complicated math formulas and memos. Other processes that fall into this category include Kallitype, Vandyketype, and Platinum printing.

'''1850: [[Albumen print]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
This process, introduced by [[Louis Désiré Blanquart-Evrard]], was the most common kind of print in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Beautiful sepia gradation images were created by using albumen and silver chloride. The surfaces of prints made with this process were glossy because of the egg whites which were layered heavily to prevent the originally thin prints from curling, cracking, or tearing easily. This type of print was especially common for studio portraits and landscape or stereoviews.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, "Proper Storage and Display."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1851: [[Collodion process|Wet collodion process]] and [[Ambrotype]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Frederick Scott Archer]] developed the wet collodion processes, which used a thick glass plate unevenly hand-coated with a collodion-based, light-sensitive emulsion. Collodion, which means ‘glue’ in Greek, is nitrocellulose dissolved in ether and ethanol. The [[Ambrotype]], an adaptation of the wet collodion process, was developed by Archer and Peter W. Fry. It involved placing a dark background behind the glass so that the negative image would look positive, and was popular in America until around 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Types of Photographs.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1855: [[Gum printing]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
Orange colored dichromate has photosensitivity when it is mixed with colloids such as gum arabic, albumen, or gelatin. Using that feature, [[Alphonse Poitevin]] invented the gum printing process. It gained in popularity after 1898, and again in 1960s and 1970s because of its unique look.

'''1858: [[Tintype]] (also called Ferrotype and Melainotype)'''&lt;br /&gt;
In this photographic process the emulsion was painted directly onto a japanned (varnish finish) iron plate. it was much cheaper and sturdier than the Ambrotype and Daguerreotype.

'''1861: [[RGB color model|RGB Additive Color Model]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
Applied physician [[James Clerk Maxwell]] made the first color photo by mixing red, green, and blue light.

'''1871: [[Dry plate|Gelatin dry plate]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Richard Leach Maddox|Richard L. Maddox]] discovered that gelatin could be a carrier for silver salts. By 1879, the gelatin dry plate had replaced the collodion wet plate. It was a revolutionary innovation in photography since it needed less light exposure, was usable when dry, meaning photographers no longer needed to pack and carry dangerous liquids, and could be standardized because it could be factory produced.

'''1873: [[Platinum print|Platinum Printing (Platinotype)]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[William Willis (inventor)|William Willis]] patented platinum printing in Britain. The process rapidly spread and became a dominant method in Europe and America by 1894 since it had a visibly different color tone compared to albumen and gelatin silver prints.

'''Late 1880s: [[Gelatin silver print]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
This has been the major photograph printing process since the late 1880s up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, “Proper Storage and Display.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Prints consist of paper coated with an emulsion of silver halide in gelatin. The surface is generally smooth; under magnification, the print appears to sparkle.&lt;ref&gt;Diane DeCesare Ross, "An Overview of the Care of Silver-Based Photographic Prints and Negatives," ''Mississippi Libraries'' 65, no. 2 (Summer 2001): 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1889: [[Kallitype]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. W. W. J. Nicol invented and revined the Kallitype. Vandyketype, or Single Kalliitype, is the simplest type of Kalltype and creates beautiful brown images.

'''1889: Film Negatives'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|Cellulose nitrate film]] was developed by [[Eastman Kodak]] in 1889 and refined in 1903. It is made of silver gelatin on a cellulose nitrate base. The negatives are flammable and therefore can be dangerous. Nitrate sheet film was used widely though the 1930s, while nitrate roll film was used through the 1950s. The nitrate base was replaced with [[Cellulose acetate film|cellulose acetate]] in 1923. By 1937, Cellulose diacetate was used as the base, and beginning in 1947 Cellulose triacetate was used.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Messier, "Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Negatives" (Rocky Mountain Conservation Center, 1993), accessed August 12, 2011, http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/messier/negrmcc.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Polyester film was introduced around 1960.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Core Programme Preservation and Conservation, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet'', (1992, revised and updated 2002), accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/care/photolea.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1935: [[Color photography|Color Photographs]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
Kodak introduced color film and transparencies in 1935. The first process was called [[Kodachrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Wilhelm, "Monitoring the Fading and Staining of Color Photographic Prints," ''Journal of the American Institute for Conservation'' 21, no. 1 (1981), accessed August 12, 2011, http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic21-01-003.html.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ektachrome]], introduced in the late 1940s, became equally popular. There are now a variety of color processes that use different materials; most consist of dyes (cyan, magenta, and yellow, each of which have different absorption peaks) suspended in a gelatin layer.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Fahey, ''The Care and Preservation of Photographic Prints'' (Dearborn, MI: The Henry Ford), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.thehenryford.org/research/caring/prints.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photograph Stability===
Photograph stability refers to the ability of [[photographic print|prints]] and [[photographic film|film]] to remain visibly unchanged over periods of time. Different photographic processes yield varying degrees of stability. In addition, different materials may have dark-storage stability which differs from their stability in light. An extreme case with slides was stability under the intense light of projection. For example, when stored in darkness, Kodachrome's long-term stability under suitable conditions is superior to other types of color film. Images on Kodachrome slides over fifty years old retain accurate color and density. Kodachrome film stored in darkness is largely responsible for excellent color footage of World War II, for example. It has been calculated that the yellow dye in Kodachrome, the least stable, would suffer a 20% loss of dye in 185 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs (Chapter5) |publisher=[[Wilhelm Imaging Research]] |isbn= |page=164 |url=http://www.wilhelm-research.com/pdf/HW_Book_05_of_20_HiRes_v1a.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230141550/http://www.wilhelm-research.com/pdf/HW_Book_05_of_20_HiRes_v1a.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because developed Kodachrome does not retain unused color couplers.

However, Kodachrome's color stability under bright light, especially during [[slide projector|projection]], is inferior to substantive slide films. Kodachrome's fade time under projection is about one hour, compared to Fujichrome's two and a half hours.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wilhelm-research.com/pdf/HW_Book_05_of_20_HiRes_v1a.pdf |title=The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs (Chapter 6) |publisher=Wilhelm Imaging Research |accessdate=December 27, 2006 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230141550/http://www.wilhelm-research.com/pdf/HW_Book_05_of_20_HiRes_v1a.pdf |archivedate=December 30, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, old Kodachrome slides should be exposed to light only when copying to another medium.

'''Silver halide'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Black-and-white]] negatives and prints made by the [[silver halide]] process are stable so long as the photographic substrate is stable. Some papers may yellow with age, or the [[gelatin]] matrix may yellow and crack with age. If not developed properly, small amounts of [[silver halide]] remaining in the gelatin will darken when exposed to light. In some prints, the black silver oxide is reduced to metallic silver with time, and the image takes on a metallic sheen as the dark areas reflect light instead of absorbing it. [[Silver]] can also react with [[sulfur]] in the air and form [[silver sulfide]]. A correctly processed and stored silver print or negative probably has the greatest stability of any photographic medium, as attested by the wealth of surviving historical black-and-white photographs.

'''Chromogenic'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Chromogenic]] dye color processes include Type "R" and [[RA-4 process|process RA-4]] (also known as "type C prints"),  [[C-41 process|process C-41]] color negatives. and [[E-6 process|process E-6]] color reversal ([[Ektachrome]]) film. Chromogenic processes yield organic dyes that are less stable than silver, and can also leave unreacted dye couplers behind during developing. Both factors may lead to color changes over time. The three dyes, cyan, magenta, and yellow, which make up the print may fade at different rates, causing a color shift in the print. Modern chromogenic papers such as [[Kodak]] Endura have achieved excellent stability, however, and are rated for 100 years in home display.

'''Dye destruction'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Dye destruction]] prints are the most archival color prints, at least among the wet chemical processes, and arguably among all processes. The most well-known kind of [[dye destruction]] print is the [[Cibachrome]], now known as [[Ilfochrome]].

'''Ink jet'''&lt;br /&gt;
Some [[ink jet]] prints are now considered to have excellent stability, while others are not. [[Ink jet]] prints using [[dye]]-[[pigment]] mixtures are now common in photography, and often claim stability on par with [[chromogenic]] prints. However, these claims are based on [[accelerated aging]] studies rather than historical experience, because the technology is still relatively young.

==Types and Causes of Deterioration==
There are two main types of deterioration found in photographic materials. Chemical deterioration occurs when the chemicals in the photograph or negative undergo reactions (either through contact with outside catalysts, or because the chemicals are inherently unstable) that damage the material. Physical or structural deterioration occurs when chemical reactions are not involved, and include abrasion and tearing.

Both types of deterioration are caused by three main factors: environmental storage conditions, inappropriate storage enclosures and repair attempts, and human use and handling. Chemical damage can also be caused by improper chemical processing.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet.''&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of photographic materials are particularly susceptible to different types and causes of deterioration.

===Environmental Factors===
* '''Temperature and Humidity''' interact with one another and cause chemical and physical deterioration. High temperature and [[relative humidity]], along with pollution, can cause fading and discoloration of silver images and color dyes. Higher temperatures cause faster deterioration: the rate of deterioration is approximately doubled with every temperature increase of 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity are particularly damaging, as they also speed up chemical deterioration and can cause structural damage such as cracked emulsions and warped support layers.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet''; Gary Albright and Monique Fischer, ''Care of Photographs'', Preservation Leaflets (Northeast Document Conservation Center), accessed August 12, 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/5Photographs/03CareOfPhotos.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415191029/http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/5Photographs/03CareOfPhotos.php |archivedate=2008-04-15 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Too-high relative humidity can cause fading, discoloration and silver mirroring,&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''.&lt;/ref&gt; and can cause binders to soften and become sticky, making photographs susceptible to physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet''&lt;/ref&gt; It can also cause photographs to adhere to frames and other enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;AIC, ''Caring for Your Treasures.''&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Too-low relative humidity can cause physical damage including desiccation, embrittlement, and curling.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Pollution''' can include oxidant and aciding/sulfiding gases that cause chemical deterioration, as well as dust and particulates that can cause abrasion."&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''; IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet''; Ross, "Silver-Based Photographic Prints and Negatives," 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of indoor pollution that affect photographs include paint fumes, plywood, cardboard, and cleaning supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Hamill, ''Preserving Your Family Photographs'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Library Department of Preservation and Conservation, 2001): 3, accessed August 12, 2001, http://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/brochure/Family%20Photos%20Text%2001.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exposure to '''light''' causes embrittlement, fading, and yellowing. The damage is cumulative and usually irreversible. UV light (including from sunlight and fluorescent light) and visible light in the blue part of the spectrum are especially harmful to photographs, but all forms of light, including incandescent and tungsten, are damaging.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''; IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mold''' growth is fostered by high temperatures and humidity&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as dust particles.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, "Silver-Based Photographic Prints and Negatives," 40.&lt;/ref&gt; They cause damage to the surface of photographs and help break down binder layers.&lt;ref&gt;AIC, ''Caring for Your Treasures.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The presence of '''Insects''' and '''rodents''' is also fostered by high temperatures and humidity&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''.&lt;/ref&gt; They eat paper fiber, albumen, and gelatin binders,&lt;ref&gt;AIC, ''Caring for Your Treasures.''&lt;/ref&gt; leaving chew marks and droppings. Species likely to cause problems include [[cockroach]]es and [[silverfish]].&lt;ref&gt;John H. Slate, “Not Fade Away: Understanding the Definition, Preservation and Conservation Issues of Visual Ephemera,” Collection Management 25, no. 4 (2001): 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Factors===
'''Inappropriate storage containers and repair attempts:'''  Cabinets made of inferior materials can give off harmful gases,&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet.''&lt;/ref&gt; while other reactive materials such as acidic paper sleeves, rubber bands, paper clips, [[pressure sensitive tape]], and glues and adhesives commonly used for storage and repairs in the past can also cause chemical deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''.&lt;/ref&gt; Storing items too loosely, too tightly, or in enclosures that do not provide adequate physical protection can all cause physical damage such as curling and breakage.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human handling and use,''' including by researchers and staff, can also cause both chemical and physical deterioration.  Oils, dirt, lotions, and perspiration transmitted through fingerprints can destroy emulsion and cause bleaching, staining, and silver mirroring.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''; James L. Bagget, “Handle With Care: Photos,” The Alabama Librarian 54, no. 1 (2004): 5; Hamill, ''Preserving Your Family Photographs'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Physical damage caused by human handling includes abrasion, scratches, tears, breakage, and cracks.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''; Hamill, ''Preserving Your Family Photographs'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Improper chemical processing,''' including use of exhausted fixer, insufficient length of fixing, and residual fixer left behind by inadequate washing can cause fading and discoloration. Heat, humidity, and light can accelerate such damage. Adherence to ISO standards at the time of processing can help avoid this type of deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Threats to Specific Photographic Materials===
Glass plate negatives and ambrotypes are prone to breakage.&lt;ref&gt;AIC, ''Caring for Your Treasures.''&lt;/ref&gt; Deterioration of film negatives, regardless of type, is humidity and temperature dependent. Nitrate film will first fade, then become brittle and sticky. It will then soften, adhere to paper enclosures, and produce an odor. Finally, it will disintegrate into a brown, acrid powder.&lt;ref&gt;Messier, "Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Negatives".&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its flammability, it must be handled with particular care. Cellulose aetate, diacetate, and triacetate film produce acetic acid, which smells like vinegar. The deterioration process is therefore known as "[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the .22vinegar syndrome.22|vinegar syndrome]]." The negatives become very brittle and, in diacetate and triacetate film, the base shrinks, causing grooves (“channeling”).&lt;ref&gt;Messier, "Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Negatives".&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to fading, silver-based images are prone to silver mirroring, which presents as a bluish metallic sheen on the surface of the photograph or negative and is caused by oxidation, which causes the silver to migrate to the surface of the emulsion.&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Australia, Care and handling guidelines for digitization of Library materials, accessed August 17, 2011, http://www.nla.gov.au/digital/care_handling.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Color photographs are inherently unstable medium, and are more susceptible to light and fading than black and white photographic processes. They are composed of various dyes, all of which eventually fade, albeit at different rates (causing discoloration along with fading).&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Photographic Collections Management."&lt;/ref&gt; Many color photographic processes are also susceptible to fading even in the dark (known as "dark-fading").&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, "Fading and Staining of Color Photographic Prints."&lt;/ref&gt; There is little that can be done to restore faded images, and even under ideal conditions, most color photographs will not survive undamaged for more than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Photographic Collections Management."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation Strategies==

===Temperature and Relative Humidity Control===
Maintenance of a proper environment such as control of temperature and relative humidity (RH; a measure of how saturated the air is with moisture)&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet.''&lt;/ref&gt; is extremely important to the preservation of photographic materials.

Temperature should be maintained at or below 70&amp;nbsp;°F (the lower the better); an “often-recommended” compromise between preservation needs and human comfort is 65-70&amp;nbsp;°F (storage-only areas should be kept cooler).&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature is the controlling factor in the stability of contemporary color photographs. For color photographs, storage at low temperatures (40&amp;nbsp;°F or below) is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections’’, accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/photo.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative humidity should be maintained between 30-50% without cycling more than +/- 5% a day.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA ,''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet’’.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower part of that range is best for “long term stability of several photographic processes”.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do relative humidity levels above 60% cause deterioration, but also low and fluctuating humidity may also damage them.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections’’&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate control equipment can be used to control temperatures and humidity. Air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and humidifiers can be helpful, but it’s important to make sure they help instead of hurt (for example, air conditioning raises humidity).&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold Storage===
Cold storage is recommended for especially vulnerable materials.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Original prints, negatives, and transparencies (not glass plates, daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes, or other images on glass or metal) should be placed in packaging (archival folders in board boxes in double freezer weight Ziplock bags) in cold storage, and temperatures should be maintained at 1.7-4.4”C (35-40&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines,” Conserve-O-Gram 14, no. 4 (June 1997), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/conserveogram/14-04.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the guideline of National Archives facilities, clear plastic bags such as Zip-locks or flush-cut bags with twist-ties (polyethylene or polypropylene plastic bags) and cotton gloves are needed.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah S. Wagner, ‘’Cold Storage Handling Guidelines for Photographs’’ (1991), accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/cold-storage-photos.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Removing items from cold storage requires letting them acclimate to room conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs must be allowed to warm up slowly in a cool, dry place, such as an office or processing area.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ‘’Cold Storage Handling Guidelines for Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Original items should be retrieved from the storage only in an emergency and no more than once a year.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Without cold storage, temperature-sensitive materials will deteriorate in a matter of a few decades; with cold storage they can remain unchanged for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light Control===
Photographs should not be hung near light.  Hanging photographs on a wall can cause damage from the exposure to direct sunlight, or to fluorescent lights. Displays of photographs should be changed periodically because most photographs will deteriorate in light over time.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

UV-absorbing sleeves can be used to filter out damaging rays from fluorescent tubes and UV- absorbing sheets can be placed over windows or in frames. Low UV-emitting bulbs are available.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Light levels should be kept at 50- 100 Lux (5-10 footcandles) for most photographs when in use for research as well as exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure of color slides to the light in the projector should be kept to a minimum&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections’’&lt;/ref&gt; and photographs should be stored in dark storage.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to preserve a photograph is to display a facsimile.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution Control===
Controlling air quality is difficult. Ideally, air entering a storage or exhibition area should be filtered and purified. Gaseous pollution should be removed with chemical filters or wet scrubbers. Exterior windows should be kept when possible. Interior sources of harmful gases should be minimized. Metal cabinets are preferable to wooden cabinets, which can produce harmful peroxides.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

Air can be filtered to keep out gaseous pollutants and particulates such as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and ozone&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt; Air filters must be changed regularly to be effective. Air circulation should also be checked periodically.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling Control===
Handling and use policies should be established and staff should be trained in policies and policy enforcement and telling users the policies when they arrive. Policies for processing, handling for loaned or exhibited items, and disaster prevention and recovery should also be created and followed.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Work spaces should be clean and uncluttered.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt; Clean gloves or clean, dry hands should be used whenever photographs are handled.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Foods, drink, dirt, cleaning chemicals, and photocopy machines should be kept away from photo storage, exhibit, or work spaces.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt;

For precious materials, users should be provided with duplicates, not originals.

===Storage Systems Control===
Proper storage materials are essential for the long-term stability of photographs and  negatives. Enclosures keep away dirt and pollutants. All enclosures used to house photographs and those should meet the specifications provided in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Most photographs can be safely kept in paper enclosures; some can also be safely stored in some types of plastic enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, ‘’Care and conservation of photographic materials’’ (2006), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.conservationregister.com/carephotographs.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper enclosures protect objects from light, but may result in increased handling for viewing.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Paper enclosures must be acid-free, lignin-free, and are available in both buffered (alkaline, pH 8.5) and unbuffered (neutral, pH 7) stock. Storage materials must pass the ANSI Photographic Activity Test (PAT) which is noted in suppliers’ catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections’’&lt;/ref&gt; Paper enclosures also protects the photographs from the accumulation of moisture and detrimental gases&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; and are relatively inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections.’’&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic enclosures include uncoated polyester film, uncoated cellulose triacetate, polyethylene, and polypropylene.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections’’&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic enclosures are transparent. Photographs can be viewed without removal from the enclosure, thus it can reduce handling. However, plastic enclosures can trap moisture and cause ferrotyping (sticking, with a resultant glossy area).&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plastic is not suitable for prints with surface damage, glass or metal-based photographs, nor for film-based negatives and transparencies from the 1950s, unless the latter are in cold storage.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, ‘’Care and conservation of photographic materials.’’&lt;/ref&gt; It should not to be used to store older safety film negatives as this may hasten their deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal storage is preferable for many photographic prints and oversize photographs.  It provides overall support to the images and prevents mechanical damage such as bending. Vertical storage is often more efficient and may make access to a collection easier. Materials of similar size should be stored together. Boxes and files should not be overcrowded.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction and Digitization===
Unlike the [[digital photography|born-digital photographs]] that are widely produced and consumed these days, historical photographs such as old slides, films, and printed photos are not easy to preserve.  An important component of long-term photograph preservation is making reproductions (by photocopying, photographing, or scanning and digitizing) of photographs for use in exhibitions and by researchers, which reduces the damage caused by non-controlled environments and handling.&lt;ref&gt;AIC, ''Caring for Your Treasures''&lt;/ref&gt;

Digitizing photographs also allows access by a much wider public, especially where the images have intrinsic historic value. Digital scans, however, are not replacements for the original, as digital file formats may become obsolete. Originals should always be preserved, even if they have been digitized. Born-digital photographs also require preservation, using [[digital preservation]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Bagget, “Handle With Care: Photos,” 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/external/safeguarding-european-photographic-images-access-sepia/ Safeguarding European Photographic Images for Access (SEPIA)] lists ten principles for digitization of historical photograph.&lt;ref&gt;SEPIA (Safeguarding European Photographic Images for Access), ''Preservation issues in digitizing historical photographs'' (200 ), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.ica.org/?lid=5668&amp;bid=744.&lt;/ref&gt; Summarized, they are:
# Photographs are an essential part of our cultural heritage, which contain our past, documentary and artistic value and the history of photographic processes; 
# Digitizing photographs that deteriorate quickly is urgent matter to facilitate access for a large audience; 
# Since digitization is not an end itself but a tool, selection of photographs to digitize should be based on an understanding of the nature and potential use of the collection; 
# It's essential to define the aims, priorities, technical requirements, procedures and future use for investments; 
# The creation of a digital image is a sophisticated activity which requires photographic expertise with ethical judgment; 
# Digital images need regular maintenance in order to keep pace with changing technologies; 
# A good digitization project requires teamwork, combining expertise on imaging, collection management, IT, conservation, descriptive methods and preservation strategies; 
# The input of specialists in every project is essential to integrate preservation measures in the work-flow, handle fragile materials and avoid damage to the originals; 
# Preservation specialists need to manage of digital assets in line with the overall preservation policy of the organization; and 
# Museums, archives and libraries actively involve to develop international standards for the preservation of digital collections in the long-term view.

====Examples====
[[Image:Original Tay Bridge before the 1879 collapse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Original Tay Bridge from the north]]
[[Image:Tay bridge down.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Fallen Tay Bridge from the north]]
An example of digitization as part of a photograph preservation strategy is the photographic collection of the [[Tay Bridge disaster]] of 1879. These photographs have been digitized and disseminated more widely. Only the positive prints survive, owing to the widespread practice of recycling the original glass negatives to reclaim the [[silver]] content. Even when carefully preserved and kept in the dark, damage can occur through intermittent exposure to light, as shown by damage to the image of the intact bridge (at left).

An example of a larger digitization project is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131203101946/http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/casedphotos/project.html Cased Photographs Project], which provides access to digital images and detailed descriptions of daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes, and related photographs in the collections of the [[Bancroft Library]] and the [[California State Library]].

==Conservation Treatments==
Photograph conservation involves the physical treatment of individual photographs. As defined by the [[American Institute for Conservation]], treatment is “the deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence. Treatment may consist of stabilization and/or restoration.” Stabilization treatments aim to maintain photographs in their current condition, minimizing further deterioration, while restoration treatments aim to return photographs to their original state.&lt;ref&gt;American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), ''Definitions of Conservation Terminology'', accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=620&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation treatments range from very simple tear repairs or flattening to more complex treatments such as stain removal. Treatments vary widely depending on the type of photograph and its intended use. Therefore, conservators must by knowledgeable regarding both of these issues. Guides for the preservation of personal and family photograph collections, such as Cornell University's [https://web.archive.org/web/20130606191040/http://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/brochure/Family%20Photos%20Text%2001.pdf ''Preserving Your Family Photographs''] and the AIC’s [http://www.conservation-us.org/_data/n_0001/resources/live/photographs.pdf/ ''Caring for Your Treasures''], recommend that people contact a trained conservator if they have rapidly deteriorating negatives or photographs with active mold growth, staining from pressure sensitive tape, severe tears, adhesion to enclosures, and other types of damage requiring conservation treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, Preserving Your Family Photographs, 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional Organizations==
There are a number of international organizations concerned with conservation of photographs along with other subjects, including the [http://www.ica.org/ International Council on Archives (ICA)], the [http://www.iiconservation.org/ International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC)] , and the [http://www.icom-cc.org/ International Council of Museums - Committee for Conservation (ICOM-CC)]. The [http://icom-cc.icom.museum/WG/PhotographicRecords/ Photographic Records Working Group] is a specialty group within the ICOM-CC.

In the United States, the national membership organization of conservation professionals is the [http://www.conservation-us.org/ American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic works(AIC)] to which the [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/pmg/ Photographic Materials Group (PMG)] belongs. The [http://www.nedcc.org/ Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC)] and the [http://www.ccaha.org/ Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (CCAHA)] also play an important role in the field of conservation. The [https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/ Image Permanence Institute (IPI)] at Rochester Institute of Technology is one of the leaders in preservation research of images in particular.

===Codes and Standards===
Photograph conservators and preservation managers are guided in their work by codes of ethics and technical standards. The [[International Council on Archives]] publishes a [http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&amp;pageID=858&amp;nodeID=1 ''Code of Ethics''] and [http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=1026 ''Guidelines for Practice'']. Additionally, members of other professions (such as archivists and librarians) who deal with preservation of photographs do so in accordance with their professional organization’s codes of ethics. For example, the [[Society of American Archivists]] [http://www2.archivists.org/code-of-ethics ''Code of Ethics''] states that "Archivists protect all documentary materials for which they are responsible and guard them against defacement, physical damage, deterioration, and theft."&lt;ref&gt;SAA, ''Code of Ethics for Archivists'' (2005), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www2.archivists.org/code-of-ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) both publish technical standards that govern the materials and procedures used in photograph preservation and conservation. The [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] has published a [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/care/photostn.html list of ANSI standards] pertaining to the care and handling of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Core Programme Preservation and Conservation, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Standards, accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/care/photostn.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and Training==
Photograph conservators can be found in museums, archives, and libraries, as well as in private practice. Conservators often have earned their master's degrees in [[art conservation and restoration|art conservation]], though many have also been trained through [[apprenticeship]]. They often have backgrounds in [[art history]], chemistry, or photography.

'''Cubism''' is an early-20th-century [[art movement]] which brought European [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] historically forward toward 20th century [[Modern art]]. Cubism in its various forms inspired related movements in [[literature]] and [[architecture]]. Cubism has been considered to be among the most influential art movements of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, MoMA collection, ''Cubism, Introduction'', from Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813112047/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1 |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2014/cubism-the-leonard-lauder-collection ''Cubism: The Leonard A.

The movement was pioneered by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], joined by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], and [[Fernand Léger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, MoMA collection ''Cubism, Origins and application of the term'', from Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613022945/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541 |date=2014-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] form in the late works of [[Paul Cézanne]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813112047/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1 |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press 1985, pp. 34-42&lt;/ref&gt; In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of Cubism was far-reaching and wide-ranging. In other countries [[Futurism]], [[Suprematism]], [[Dada]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[De Stijl]] and [[Art Deco]] developed in response to Cubism. Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time, also called multiple perspective, [[simultaneity]] or multiplicity,&lt;ref name="MoMA, Meanings and interpretations"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702090838/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544 |date=2015-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10955&amp;section_id=T019195#skipToContent Christina Lodder, 2009, ''Constructivism, Formation, 1914–21'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024234226/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10955&amp;section_id=T019195 |date=2008-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.

==History==
Historians have divided the history of Cubism into phases. In one scheme, the first phase of Cubism, known as ''Analytic Cubism'', a phrase coined by Juan Gris a posteriori,&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 784. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in France. A second phase, ''Synthetic Cubism'', remained vital until around 1919, when the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movement gained popularity. English [[art historian]] [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]] proposed another scheme, describing three phases of Cubism in his book, ''The Cubist Epoch''. According to Cooper there was "Early Cubism", (from 1906 to 1908) when the movement was initially developed in the studios of Picasso and Braque; the second phase being called "High Cubism", (from 1909 to 1914) during which time [[Juan Gris]] emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and finally Cooper referred to "Late Cubism" (from 1914 to 1921) as the last phase of Cubism as a radical [[avant-garde]] movement.&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch"&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up "The Cubist Epoch"], pp. 11–221, 232, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Cooper's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris (from 1911) and Léger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

===Proto-Cubism: 1907-1908===
{{main|Proto-Cubism}}
Cubism burgeoned between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' has often been considered a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] work. Georges Braque's 1908 ''[[Houses at L’Estaque]]'' (and related works) prompted the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]], in ''Gil Blas'', 25 March 1909, to refer to ''bizarreries cubiques'' (cubic oddities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gertrude Stein]] referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as ''Reservoir at Horta de Ebro'', as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] in [[Paris]] during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'Salle 41'; it included works by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

By 1911 Picasso was recognized as the inventor of Cubism, while Braque’s importance and precedence was argued later, with respect to his treatment of space, volume and mass in the L’Estaque landscapes. But "this view of Cubism is associated with a distinctly restrictive definition of which artists are properly to be called Cubists," wrote the art historian Christopher Green: "Marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1911 [...]"&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The assertion that the Cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the flatness of the canvas was made by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] as early as 1920,&lt;ref&gt;D.-H. Kahnweiler. Der Weg zum Kubismus (Munich, 1920; Eng. trans., New York, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Greenberg. ‘The Pasted-paper Revolution’, ARTnews, 57 (1958), pp. 46–9, 60–61; repr. as ‘Collage’ in Art and Culture (Boston, 1961), pp. 70–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary views of Cubism are complex, formed to some extent in response to the "Salle 41" Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them. Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed. Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the "Salle 41" artists, e.g., [[Francis Picabia]]; the brothers [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the [[Section d'Or]] (or the [[Puteaux Group]]); the sculptors [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] as well as [[Jacques Lipchitz]] and [[Henri Laurens]]; and painters such as [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[František Kupka]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Léopold Survage]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[André Lhote]], [[Gino Severini]] (after 1916), [[María Blanchard]] (after 1916) and [[Georges Valmier]] (after 1918). More fundamentally, Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper's terms were "later undermined by interpretations of the work of Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation."&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

[[John Berger]] identifies the essence of Cubism with the mechanical diagram. "The metaphorical model of Cubism is the diagram: The diagram being a visible symbolic representation of invisible processes, forces, structures. A diagram need not eschew certain aspects of appearance but these too will be treated as signs not as imitations or recreations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=John|title=The Moment of Cubism|year=1969|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780297177098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Cubism: 1909-1914 ===
[[File:Albert Gleizes, l'Homme au Balcon, 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Albert Gleizes]], ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|L'Homme au Balcon, Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]'', 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm (77 x 45 1/4 in.), [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Completed the same year that Albert Gleizes co-authored the book ''Du "Cubisme"'' with Jean Metzinger. Exhibited at Salon d'Automne, Paris, 1912, [[Armory show]], New York, Chicago, Boston, 1913]]
There was a distinct difference between Kahnweiler’s Cubists and the Salon Cubists. Prior to 1914, Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) gained the support of a single committed art dealer in Paris, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who guaranteed them an annual income for the exclusive right to buy their works. Kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of connoisseurs. His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy. Picasso worked in Montmartre until 1912, while Braque and Gris remained there until after the First World War. Léger was based in Montparnasse.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

In contrast, the Salon Cubists built their reputation primarily by exhibiting regularly at the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Indépendants, both major non-academic Salons in Paris. They were inevitably more aware of public response and the need to communicate.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; Already in 1910 a group began to form which included Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Léger. They met regularly at Henri le Fauconnier's studio near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. These soirées often included writers such as Guillaume Apollinaire and [[André Salmon]]. Together with other young artists, the group wanted to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the Neo-Impressionist emphasis on color.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie"&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie (in French)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112092816/http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf |date=November 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1910 Salon d'Automne, a few months later, Metzinger exhibited his highly fractured ''[[Nu à la cheminée|Nu à la cheminée (Nude)]]'', which was subsequently reproduced in both ''Du "Cubisme"'' (1912) and ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' (1913).&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

The first public controversy generated by Cubism resulted from Salon showings at the Indépendants during the spring of 1911. This showing by Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, le Fauconnier and Léger brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the first time. Amongst the Cubist works presented, Robert Delaunay exhibited his ''Eiffel Tower, Tour Eiffel'' (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1022 Robert Delaunay, Eiffel Tower (Tour Eiffel), 1911 (dated 1910 by the artist).

At the Salon d'Automne of the same year, in addition to the Indépendants group of ''Salle 41'', were exhibited works by [[André Lhote]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], Jacques Villon, [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]] and [[František Kupka]]. The exhibition was reviewed in the October 8, 1911 issue of ''The New York Times''. This article was published a year after [[Gelett Burgess]]' ''The Wild Men of Paris'',&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, ''The Wild Men of Paris: Matisse, Picasso, and Les Fauves'', Architectural Record, May 1910] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424182236/http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris |date=2016-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years prior to the [[Armory Show]], which introduced astonished Americans, accustomed to realistic art, to the experimental styles of the European avant garde, including Fauvism, Cubism, and Futurism. The 1911 ''New York Times'' article portrayed works by Picasso, Matisse, Derain, Metzinger and others dated before 1909; not exhibited at the 1911 Salon.

:"Among all the paintings on exhibition at the Paris Fall Salon none is attracting so much attention as the extraordinary productions of the so-called "Cubist" school. In fact, dispatches from Paris suggest that these works are easily the main feature of the exhibition. [...]

:In spite of the crazy nature of the "Cubist" theories the number of those professing them is fairly respectable. Georges Braque, André Derain, Picasso, Czobel, Othon Friesz, Herbin, Metzinger—these are a few of the names signed to canvases before which Paris has stood and now again stands in blank amazement.

:What do they mean? Have those responsible for them taken leave of their senses? Is it art or madness? Who knows?"&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt;

The subsequent 1912 Salon des Indépendants was marked by the presentation of Marcel Duchamp's ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'', which itself caused a scandal, even amongst the Cubists. It was in fact rejected by the hanging committee, which included his brothers and other Cubists. Although the work was shown in the Salon de la Section d'Or in October 1912 and the 1913 Armory Show in New York, Duchamp never forgave his brothers and former colleagues for censoring his work.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51449.html?mulR=24120|3 Philadelphia Museum of Art, Marcel Duchamp, Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063503/http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51449.html?mulR=24120%7C3 |date=2017-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Gris, a new addition to the Salon scene, exhibited his ''Portrait of Picasso'' (Art Institute of Chicago), while Metzinger's two showings included ''[[La Femme au Cheval|La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)]]'' 1911-1912 ([[National Gallery of Denmark]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/french-art-1900-1930/highlights/jean-metzinger-woman-with-a-horse/ Statens Museum for Kunst, National Gallery of Denmark, Jean Metzinger, ''Woman with a Horse'', 1911–1912, oil on canvas, 162 x 130 cm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115151153/http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/french-art-1900-1930/highlights/jean-metzinger-woman-with-a-horse/ |date=January 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaunay's monumental ''La Ville de Paris'' (Musée d'art moderne de la Ville de Paris) and Léger's ''La Noce, The Wedding'' (Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris) were also exhibited.

The Cubist contribution to the [[Salon d'Automne#1912.2C political ramifications|1912 Salon d'Automne]] created scandal regarding the use of government owned buildings, such as the [[Grand Palais]], to exhibit such artwork. The indignation of the politician [[Jean Pierre Philippe Lampué]] made the front page of ''Le Journal'', 5 October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7625001c/f1.image ''M.

Barrer: ''Quand l'art du XXe siècle était conçu par les inconnus'', pp. 93-101, gives an account of the debate.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953''] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E8g1DoyE?url=http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/chronology |date=2013-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was against this background of public anger that Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes wrote ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (published by Eugène Figuière in 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070918235710/http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/albert-gleizes-oeuvre.html Fondation Gleizes, Son Oeuvre]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works exhibited were [[Henri Le Fauconnier|Le Fauconnier]]'s vast composition ''Les Montagnards attaqués par des ours (Mountaineers Attacked by Bears)'' now at Rhode Island School of Design Museum, [[Joseph Csaky]]'s ''Deux Femme, Two Women'' (a sculpture now lost), in addition to the highly abstract paintings by Kupka, ''Amorpha'' (The National Gallery, Prague), and [[Picabia]], ''La Source, The Spring'' (Museum of Modern Art, New York).

====Abstraction and the ready-made====
[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1912, Les Fenêtres simultanée sur la ville (Simultaneous Windows on the City), 40 x 46 cm, Kunsthalle Hamburg.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], ''Simultaneous Windows on the City'', 1912, 46 x 40 cm, [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]], an example of ''Abstract Cubism'']]
The most extreme forms of Cubism were not those practiced by Picasso and Braque, who resisted total abstraction. Other Cubists, by contrast, especially [[František Kupka]], and those considered [[Orphism (art)|Orphists]] by [[Apollinaire]] (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka’s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, ''Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs'' and ''Amorpha chromatique chaude'', were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled ''Simultaneous Windows'', followed by a series entitled ''Formes Circulaires'', in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled ''Contrasts of Forms'', giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in ''Les Peintres cubistes'' (1913),&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt; writing of a new "pure" painting in which the subject was vacated. But in spite of his use of the term Orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was responsible for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-made]] arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next logical step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

====Section d'Or====

The ''Section d'Or'', also known as ''Groupe de Puteaux'', founded by some of the most conspicuous Cubists, was a collective of painters, sculptors and critics associated with Cubism and Orphism, active from 1911 through about 1914, coming to prominence in the wake of their controversial showing at the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. The ''Salon de la Section d'Or'' at the ''Galerie La Boétie'' in Paris, October 1912, was arguably the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition; exposing Cubism to a wide audience. Over 200 works were displayed, and the fact that many of the artists showed artworks representative of their development from 1909 to 1912 gave the exhibition the allure of a Cubist retrospective.&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism"&gt;[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism, p. 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314010756/http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm |date=2013-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group seems to have adopted the name Section d'Or to distinguish themselves from the narrower definition of Cubism developed in parallel by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] in the [[Montmartre]] quarter of Paris, and to show that Cubism, rather than being an isolated art-form, represented the continuation of a grand tradition (indeed, the [[golden ratio]] had fascinated Western intellectuals of diverse interests for at least 2,400 years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+numéro+spécial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg La Section d'Or, Numéro spécial, 9 Octobre 1912] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403151309/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+num%C3%A9ro+sp%C3%A9cial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg |date=2017-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the Section d'Or originated in the course of conversations between Metzinger, Gleizes and Jacques Villon. The group's title was suggested by Villon, after reading a 1910 translation of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Codex Urbinas|Trattato della Pittura]]'' by [[Joséphin Péladan]].

The fact that the 1912 exhibition had been curated to show the successive stages through which Cubism had developed, and that ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' had been published for the occasion, indicates the artists' intention of making their work comprehensible to a wide audience (art critics, art collectors, art dealers and the general public). Undoubtedly, due to the great success of the exhibition, Cubism became recognized as a tendency, genre or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal.&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism" /&gt;

===Late Cubism: 1914-1921===
{{main|Crystal Cubism}}

====Crystal Cubism: 1914-1918====

A significant modification of Cubism between 1914 and 1916 was signaled by a shift towards a strong emphasis on large overlapping geometric planes and flat surface activity. This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic [[Maurice Raynal]] as 'crystal' Cubism. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of [[World War I]]—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, the occult, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7ZuQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Christopher+Green,+%27%27Cubism+and+Its+Enemies:+Modern+Movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gliFVJKzJcizUe3AghA&amp;redir_esc=y Christopher Green, ''Cubism and Its Enemies: Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=e7ZuQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Christopher+Green,+%27%27Cubism+and+Its+Enemies:+Modern+Movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gliFVJKzJcizUe3AghA&amp;redir_esc=y |date=2016-01-01 }}'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, {{ISBN|0300034687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal Cubism, and its associative ''rappel à l’ordre'', has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict. The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader [[Ideology|ideological]] transformation towards [[conservatism]] in both French society and [[Culture of France|French culture]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

====Cubism after 1918====
[[File:Picasso three musicians moma 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[Three Musicians]]'' (1921), [[Museum of Modern Art]].

The most innovative period of Cubism was before 1914. After World War I, with the support given by the dealer [[Léonce Rosenberg]], Cubism returned as a central issue for artists, and continued as such until the mid-1920s when its avant-garde status was rendered questionable by the emergence of [[geometric abstraction]] and [[Surrealism]] in [[Paris]]. Many Cubists, including Picasso, Braque, Gris, Léger, Gleizes, and Metzinger, while developing other styles, returned periodically to Cubism, even well after 1925. Cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s in the work of the American [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and the Englishman [[Ben Nicholson]]. In France, however, Cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925. Léonce Rosenberg exhibited not only the artists stranded by Kahnweiler’s exile but others including Laurens, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Gleizes, Csaky, Herbin and Severini. In 1918 Rosenberg presented a series of Cubist exhibitions at his Galerie de l’Effort Moderne in Paris. Attempts were made by Louis Vauxcelles to claim that Cubism was dead, but these exhibitions, along with a well-organized Cubist show at the 1920 Salon des Indépendants and a revival of the Salon de la Section d’Or in the same year, demonstrated it was still alive.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The reemergence of Cubism coincided with the appearance from about 1917–24 of a coherent body of theoretical writing by Pierre Reverdy, Maurice Raynal and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and, among the artists, by Gris, Léger and Gleizes. The occasional return to classicism—figurative work either exclusively or alongside Cubist work—experienced by many artists during this period (called [[Neoclassicism]]) has been linked to the tendency to evade the realities of the war and also to the cultural dominance of a classical or Latin image of France during and immediately following the war. Cubism after 1918 can be seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards [[conservatism]] in both [[French culture|French]] society and culture. Yet, Cubism itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as Gris and Metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as Braque, Léger and Gleizes. Cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition. Its theoretical purity made it a gauge against which such diverse tendencies as [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] or [[Realism (arts)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealizing|Naturalism]], [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] and abstraction could be compared.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

==Interpretation==
===Intentions and criticism===
[[File:Juan Gris - Portrait of Pablo Picasso - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|[[Juan Gris]], ''Portrait of Picasso'', 1912, oil on canvas, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
The Cubism of Picasso, Braque and Gris had more than a technical or formal significance, and the distinct attitudes and intentions of the Salon Cubists produced different kinds of Cubism, rather than a derivative of their work. "It is by no means clear, in any case," wrote Christopher Green, "to what extent these other Cubists depended on Picasso and Braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, 'passage' and multiple perspective; they could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of 'true' Cubism in its early stages, guided above all by their own understanding of Cézanne." The works exhibited by these Cubists at the 1911 and 1912 Salons extended beyond the conventional Cézanne-like subjects—the posed model, still-life and landscape—favored by Picasso and Braque to include large-scale modern-life subjects. Aimed at a large public, these works stressed the use of multiple perspective and complex planar faceting for expressive effect while preserving the eloquence of subjects endowed with literary and philosophical connotations.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

In ''Du "Cubisme"'' Metzinger and Gleizes explicitly related the sense of time to multiple perspective, giving symbolic expression to the notion of ‘duration’ proposed by the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuum, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. The Salon Cubists used the faceted treatment of solid and space and effects of multiple viewpoints to convey a physical and psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness, blurring the distinctions between past, present and future. One of the major theoretical innovations made by the Salon Cubists, independently of Picasso and Braque, was that of ''simultaneity'',&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]], [[Maurice Princet]], and Henri Bergson. With simultaneity, the concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions was comprehensively challenged. [[Perspective (graphical)|Linear perspective]] developed during [[the Renaissance]] was vacated. The subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at a moment in time, but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other.&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;

This technique of representing simultaneity, multiple viewpoints (or [[relative motion]]) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in Gleizes' monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing|Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)]]'', exhibited at the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or, Le Fauconnier’s ''Abundance'' shown at the Indépendants of 1911, and Delaunay's ''City of Paris'', shown at the Indépendants in 1912. These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. Léger’s ''The Wedding'', also shown at the Salon des Indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force. The conjunction of such subject matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early Futurist paintings by [[Umberto Boccioni]], Gino Severini and [[Carlo Carrà]]; themselves made in response to early Cubism.&lt;ref name="MoMA, Meanings and interpretations" /&gt;

Cubism and [[modern art|modern European art]] was introduced into the United States at the now legendary 1913 [[Armory Show]] in [[New York City]], which then traveled to [[Chicago]] and [[Boston]]. In the Armory show [[Pablo Picasso]] exhibited ''La Femme au pot de moutarde'' (1910), the sculpture ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'' (1909–10), ''Les Arbres'' (1907) amongst other cubist works. [[Jacques Villon]] exhibited seven important and large drypoints, while his brother [[Marcel Duchamp]] shocked the American public with his painting ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' (1912). [[Francis Picabia]] exhibited his abstractions ''La Danse à la source'' and ''La Procession, Seville'' (both of 1912). [[Albert Gleizes]] exhibited ''[[La Femme aux Phlox (Gleizes)|La Femme aux phlox]]'' (1910) and ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|L'Homme au balcon]]'' (1912), two highly stylized and faceted cubist works. [[Georges Braque]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] and [[Alexander Archipenko]] also contributed examples of their cubist works.

===Stylistic interpretation===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Europeans were discovering [[African culture|African]], Polynesian, [[Micronesia]]n and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], and Pablo Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those foreign cultures. Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through [[Gertrude Stein]], at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in [[primitivism]], [[Iberians|Iberian]] sculpture, [[African art]] and [[African tribal masks]]. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of Greek, Iberian and African art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as [[Proto-Cubism|Protocubism]], as notably seen in ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24" /&gt;

[[File:Paul Cézanne 163.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Quarry Bibémus'', 1898-1900, [[Museum Folkwang]], [[Essen]], [[Germany]]]]
The art historian Douglas Cooper states that [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] "were particularly influential to the formation of Cubism and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907".&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper goes on to say: "The ''Demoiselles'' is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, [[expressionist]] element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the ''Demoiselles'' is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it."&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"/&gt;

The most serious objection to regarding the ''Demoiselles'' as the origin of Cubism, with its evident influence of primitive art, is that "such deductions are unhistorical", wrote the art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]]. This familiar explanation "fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when Picasso's new painting developed."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1905 and 1908, a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Russia. The Impressionists had used a double point of view, and both [[Les Nabis]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] (who also admired Cézanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms. [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] structure and subject matter, most notably to be seen in the works of [[Georges Seurat]] (e.g., ''Parade de Cirque'', ''[[Le Chahut]]'' and ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Le Cirque]]''), was another important influence. There were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

In addition to Seurat, the roots of cubism are to be found in the two distinct tendencies of Cézanne's later work: first his breaking of the painted surface into small multifaceted areas of paint, thereby emphasizing the plural viewpoint given by [[binocular vision]], and second his interest in the simplification of natural forms into cylinders, spheres, and cones. However, the cubists explored this concept further than Cézanne. They represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time. This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.

Exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants, and published in Apollinaire's 1913 ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations]]''. Provenance: Jacques Nayral, [[Niels Bohr]]]]
The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from sources of limited data, namely the opinions of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. It came to rely heavily on [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s book ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'' (published in 1920), which centered on the developments of Picasso, Braque, Léger, and Gris. The terms "analytical" and "synthetic" which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s. Both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify. Neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created. "If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque," wrote Daniel Robbins, "our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists' works to the rigors of that limited definition."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The traditional interpretation of "Cubism", formulated ''post facto'' as a means of understanding the works of Braque and Picasso, has affected our appreciation of other twentieth-century artists. It is difficult to apply to painters such as [[Jean Metzinger]], Albert Gleizes, [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], whose fundamental differences from traditional Cubism compelled Kahnweiler to question whether to call them Cubists at all. According to [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "To suggest that merely because these artists developed differently or varied from the traditional pattern they deserved to be relegated to a secondary or satellite role in Cubism is a profound mistake."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The history of the term "Cubism" usually stresses the fact that Matisse referred to "cubes" in connection with a painting by Braque in 1908, and that the term was published twice by the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in a similar context. However, the word "cube" was used in 1906 by another critic, Louis Chassevent, with reference not to Picasso or Braque but rather to Metzinger and Delaunay:

::"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. [[Paul Signac|Signac]] but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]".&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent, ''Les Artistes Indépendants, 1906'', Quelques Petits Salons. Paris, 1908. Chassevent discussed Delaunay and Metzinger in terms of Signac's influence, referring to Metzinger's "precision in the cut of his cubes..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical use of the word "cube" goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing the work of [[Henri-Edmond Cross]] at the Indépendants in ''Art et Littérature'', commented that he "uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments." (Robert Herbert, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;221)&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The term Cubism did not come into general usage until 1911, mainly with reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, and Léger.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; In 1911, the poet and critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants. The following year, in preparation for the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]''&lt;ref&gt;A. Gleizes and J. Metzinger. Du "Cubisme", Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (Eng. trans., London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word, and as a major defence of Cubism (which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k201712x/f1.image Fritz-R.

{{main|Cubist sculpture}}

Just as in painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in Paul Cézanne's reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids (cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones). And just as in painting, it became a pervasive influence and contributed fundamentally to [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Futurism]].

Cubist sculpture developed in parallel to Cubist painting. During the autumn of 1909 Picasso sculpted ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'' with positive features depicted by negative space and vice versa. According to Douglas Cooper: "The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso's impressive ''Woman's Head'', modeled in 1909–10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time."&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch" /&gt; These positive/negative reversals were ambitiously exploited by [[Alexander Archipenko]] in 1912–13, for example in ''Woman Walking''.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; [[Joseph Csaky]], after Archipenko, was the first sculptor in Paris to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onwards. They were followed by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and then in 1914 by [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henri Laurens]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Cubism," Readings in Art History 2 (1976), Seuphor, Sculpture of this Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;q=csaky#v=onepage&amp;q=csaky&amp;f=false Edith Balas, 1998, Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture, American Philosophical Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;q=csaky |date=2016-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Cubist construction was as influential as any pictorial Cubist innovation. It was the stimulus behind the proto-Constructivist work of both [[Naum Gabo]] and [[Vladimir Tatlin]] and thus the starting-point for the entire constructive tendency in 20th-century modernist sculpture.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

Cubism formed an important link between early-20th-century art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Blau &amp; Troy"&gt;[http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/projects/architecture-and-cubism-1.html Architecture and Cubism, Eve Blau, Nancy J. Troy, MIT Press/Canadian Centre for Architecture, 1997, pbk. 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509184139/http://gsd.harvard.edu/ |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical, theoretical, and socio-political relationships between avant-garde practices in painting, sculpture and architecture had early ramifications in [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. Though there are many points of intersection between Cubism and architecture, only a few direct links between them can be drawn. Most often the connections are made by reference to shared formal characteristics: faceting of form, spatial ambiguity, transparency, and multiplicity.&lt;ref name="Blau &amp; Troy" /&gt;

Architectural interest in Cubism centered on the dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form, using simple geometric shapes, juxtaposed without the illusions of classical perspective. Diverse elements could be superimposed, made transparent or penetrate one another, while retaining their spatial relationships. Cubism had become an influential factor in the development of modern architecture from 1912 (''La Maison Cubiste'', by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[André Mare]]) onwards, developing in parallel with architects such as [[Peter Behrens]] and [[Walter Gropius]], with the simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020551#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, II.

Cubism was relevant to an architecture seeking a style that needed not refer to the past. Thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and sculpture was applied as part of "a profound reorientation towards a changed world".&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. R. Banham. Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (London, 1960), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubo-Futurist ideas of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] influenced attitudes in avant-garde architecture. The influential [[De Stijl]] movement embraced the aesthetic principles of Neo-plasticism developed by [[Piet Mondrian]] under the influence of Cubism in Paris. De Stijl was also linked by [[Gino Severini]] to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of [[Purism (arts)|Purism]], [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as [[Le Corbusier]],) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published ''Après le cubisme'' in 1918.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture" /&gt; Le Corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture. Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier concentrated his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, Le Corbusier and his cousin Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres. His theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects.&lt;ref&gt;Choay, Françoise, ''le corbusier'' (1960), pp. 10-11.

At the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as ''Maison Cubiste'' (Cubist House), signed [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[André Mare]] along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written during the assemblage of the "Maison Cubiste", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the "antithesis of the picture". "The true picture" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, "bears its ''raison d'être'' within itself. It can be moved from a church to a [[drawing-room]], from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinge, except from ''Du Cubisme'', 1912] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602141918/http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf |date=2013-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%22maison+cubiste%22+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jv-hGOpwJc&amp;sig=0m8pM6Oi2mPGtmB6uB0Fe3s9YAQ&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22maison%20cubiste%22%201912&amp;f=false Christopher Green, ''Art in France: 1900-1940, Chapter 8, Modern Spaces; Modern Objects; Modern People, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130140743/https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%22maison+cubiste%22+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jv-hGOpwJc&amp;sig=0m8pM6Oi2mPGtmB6uB0Fe3s9YAQ&amp;hl=en |date=2016-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Maison Cubiste'' was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the ''Salon Bourgeois'', where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (''Woman with a Fan''), Gleizes, Laurencin and Léger were hung—and a bedroom.

===Czech Cubist architecture===
[[File:Dům U černé Matky Boží 02.JPG|thumb|[[House of the Black Madonna]] in Prague, built by [[Josef Gočár]] in 1912]]
The original Cubist architecture is very rare. There is only one country in the world where Cubism was really applied to architecture – namely [[Bohemia]] (today [[Czech Republic]]) and especially its capital, [[Prague]].&lt;ref name=bonek&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boněk|first1=Jan|title=Cubist Prague|date=2014|publisher=Eminent|location=Prague|isbn=978-80-7281-469-5|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cztourism&gt;{{cite web|title=Cubism|url=https://www.czechtourism.com/p/cubism-editorial/|website=www.czechtourism.com|publisher=CzechTourism|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016060851/https://www.czechtourism.com/p/cubism-editorial/|archivedate=16 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech architects were the first and only ones in the world to ever design original Cubist buildings.&lt;ref name=radioprague&gt;{{cite web|title=Cubist architecture|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/static/inventors/cubism|website=www.radio.cz|publisher=Radio Prague|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911055421/http://www.radio.cz/en/static/inventors/cubism|archivedate=11 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubist architecture flourished for the most part between 1910–1914, but the Cubist or Cubism-influenced buildings were also built after the [[World War I]]. After the war, the architectural style called ''Rondo-Cubism'' was developed in Prague fusing the Cubist architecture with round shapes.&lt;ref name=czkubista&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech Cubism|url=http://www.kubista.cz/en/cubism/profiles.html#|website=www.kubista.cz|publisher=Kubista|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008123014/http://www.kubista.cz/en/cubism/profiles.html|archivedate=8 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:104 Vil·la Kovařovic (casa cubista), façana de Rašínovo Nábřeží.jpg|thumb|Villa Kovařovic in Prague by [[Josef Chochol]]]]
In their theoretical rules, the Cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer. This should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called [[diamond cut]], or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late [[Gothic architecture]]. In this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. The grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form. Thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. [[hexagonal window]]s.&lt;ref name=czkubista/&gt; Czech Cubist architects also designed Cubist furniture.

The leading Cubist architects were [[Pavel Janák]], [[Josef Gočár]], [[Vlastislav Hofman]], [[Emil Králíček]] and [[Josef Chochol]].&lt;ref name=czkubista/&gt; They worked mostly in Prague but also in other Bohemian towns. The best-known Cubist building is the [[House of the Black Madonna]] in the [[Old Town of Prague]] built in 1912 by Josef Gočár with the only Cubist café in the world, Grand Café Orient.&lt;ref name=bonek/&gt; Vlastislav Hofman built the entrance pavilions of [[Ďáblice cemetery|Ďáblice Cemetery]] in 1912–1914, Josef Chochol designed several residential houses under [[Vyšehrad]]. A Cubist streetlamp has also been preserved near the [[Wenceslas Square]], designed by Emil Králíček in 1912, who also built the Diamond House in the [[New Town of Prague]] around 1913.

==Cubism in other fields==
The influence of cubism extended to other artistic fields, outside painting and sculpture. In literature, the written works of [[Gertrude Stein]] employ repetition and repetitive phrases as building blocks in both passages and whole chapters. Most of Stein's important works utilize this technique, including the novel ''[[The Making of Americans]]'' (1906–08). Not only were they the first important patrons of Cubism, Gertrude Stein and her brother [[Leo Stein|Leo]] were also important influences on Cubism as well. Picasso in turn was an important influence on Stein's writing.

In the field of American fiction, [[William Faulkner]]'s 1930 novel ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' can be read as an interaction with the cubist mode. The novel features narratives of the diverse experiences of 15 characters which, when taken together, produce a single cohesive body.

The poets generally associated with Cubism are [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Max Jacob]], [[André Salmon]] and [[Pierre Reverdy]]. As American poet [[Kenneth Rexroth]] explains, Cubism in poetry "is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made self-sufficient by its rigorous architecture. This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kenneth Rexroth |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/reverdy.htm |title=The Cubist Poetry of Pierre Reverdy (Rexroth) |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519035242/http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/reverdy.htm |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] was profound; [[Louis Aragon]], founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was "our immediate elder, the exemplary poet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reverdy |first=Pierre |url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |title=Title Page &gt; Pierre Reverdy: Selected Poems |publisher=Bloodaxe Books |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527200900/http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets [[John Ashbery]] and [[Ron Padgett]] have recently produced new translations of [[Pierre Reverdy|Reverdy's]] work. [[Wallace Stevens]]' "[[Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird]]" is also said to demonstrate how cubism's multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070813070622/http://titan.iwu.edu/~wchapman/americanpoetryweb/stevthir.html Illinois Wesleyan University - The American Poetry Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CAT-D10N-at-work-01.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Caterpillar D10]] [[bulldozer]] at work]]
'''Earthworks''' are [[engineering]] works created through the processing of parts of the earth's surface involving quantities of [[soil]] or unformed [[rock (geology)|rock]].

==Types of excavation==
[[File:Bell telephone magazine (1922) (14569641579).jpg|thumb|300px|Earth moving equipment (circa 1922)]]
[[File:Construction site near Yass site cleared and bull dozed cleared steam roller in background.JPG|thumb|Flattened and leveled construction site. [[Road roller]] in the background.]]
'''Excavation''' may be classified by type of material:&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;Frederick S. Merritt, M. Kent Loftin, Jonathan T. Ricketts, ''Standard Handbook for Civil Engineers, Fourth Edition'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13.1}}
* [[Topsoil]] excavation
* Earth excavation
* Rock excavation
* Muck excavation – this usually contains excess water and unsuitable soil
* Unclassified excavation – this is any combination of material types
Excavation may be classified by the purpose:&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;{{rp|13.1, 13.2}}
* [[wikt:strip#Verb|Stripping]]
* [[road construction|Roadway]] excavation
* [[Drainage]] or structure excavation
* [[bridge building|Bridge]] excavation
* Channel excavation
* Footing excavation
* Borrow excavation
* [[Dredge]] excavation
* Underground excavation

==Civil engineering use==
Typical earthworks include [[road#Construction|roads]], [[railway]] beds, [[causeways]], [[dam#Earth dams|dams]], [[levee]]s, [[canal]]s, and [[berm]]s. Other common earthworks are [[land grading]] to reconfigure the topography of a site, or to stabilize slopes.

[[File:Geofoam bridge overpass.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Geofoam]] is a new lightweight earthworks technique used to build a bridge overpass on weak soil near [[Montreal]]]]

==Military use==
[[File:Ipf Wall.jpg|thumb|Earthworks ditch and rampart in Germany - age prehistorical prior to 300 BC]]
In [[military engineer]]ing, earthworks are, more specifically, types of [[fortification]]s constructed from soil. Although soil is not very strong, it is cheap enough that huge quantities can be used, generating formidable structures. Examples of older earthwork fortifications include  [[moat]]s, [[sod]] [[defensive wall|walls]], [[motte-and-bailey]] castles, and [[hill fort]]s. Modern examples include [[trench warfare|trenches]] and [[berm]]s.

==Equipment==
[[Heavy equipment (construction)|Heavy construction equipment]] is usually used due to the amounts of material to be moved — up to millions of cubic metres. Earthwork construction was revolutionized by the development of the ([[Fresno Scraper|Fresno]]) [[Wheel tractor-scraper|scraper]] and other [[engineering vehicle|earth-moving machines]] such as the [[loader (equipment)|loader]], the [[dump truck]], the [[grader]], the [[bulldozer]], the [[backhoe]], and the [[dragline excavator]].

==Mass haul planning==
[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|Excavation of over 76 million cubic metres (23 million cubic metres of which was additional to the planned amount due to landslides) for the Culebra Cut, Panama canal construction photo taken circa 1907]]
Engineers need to concern themselves with issues of [[geotechnical engineering]] (such as soil density and strength) and with quantity estimation to ensure that soil volumes in the [[Cut (earthmoving)|cuts]] match those of the [[Fill dirt|fills]], while minimizing the distance of movement. In the past, these calculations were done by hand using a [[slide rule]] and with methods such as [[Simpson's rule]]. Earthworks cost is a function of hauled amount x hauled distance. The goal of mass haul planning is to determine these amounts and the goal of mass haul optimization is to minimize either or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earthworks cost optimization through mass haul planning|url=http://topconplanning.com/kb/article/125/earthworks-cost-optimization-through-mass-haul-planning|publisher=www.topconplanning.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now they can be performed with a [[computer]] and specialized [[Civil engineering software|software]], including optimisation on haul cost and not haul distance (as haul cost is not proportional to haul distance).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3541">'''Environmental hermeneutics''' is a term for a wide range of scholarship that applies the techniques and resources of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] field of [[hermeneutics]] to environmental issues. That is to say it addresses issues of interpretation as they relate to [[nature]] and environmental issues broadly conceived to include [[wilderness]], [[ecosystems]], [[landscapes]], [[ecology]], the built environment ([[architecture]]), [[life]], embodiment, and more. Work in [[environmental philosophy]], [[ecocriticism]], [[environmental theology]], [[ecotheology]], and similar disciplines may overlap the field of environmental hermeneutics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the public sphere, much of the focus on “the environment” is concerned with discovering scientific facts and then reporting how policy can act on these facts.  On its face, philosophical hermeneutics might appear to be an unrelated enterprise. But... even the facts of the sciences are given meaning by how humans interpret them. Of course this does not mean that there are no facts, or that all facts must come from scientific discourse. Rather... [it calls] for mediation—the ''mediation that grounds the interpretive task of connecting fact and meaning'' through a number of different structures and forms. &lt;small&gt;(Clingerman, et al. 2013, emphasis added)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clingerman, F. |author2=Treanor, B. |author3=Drenthen, M. |author4= Utsler, D. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Interpreting Nature: The Emerging Field of Environmental Hermeneutics|year=2013|page=1|publisher=Fordham University Press|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/26563}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Everybody Draw Mohammed Day.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Cartoon, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!"]]

'''Everybody Draw Mohammed Day''' (or '''Draw Mohammed Day''') was a 2010 event in support of artists threatened with violence for drawing [[Depictions of Muhammad|representations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad]]. It stemmed from a protest against [[censorship]] of the American television show ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", led by the show's distributor [[Comedy Central]], in response to death threats that had been made against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. A drawing representing [[Mohammed]] was posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, with a message suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing depicting Mohammad on May 20 in support of free speech.

U.S. [[cartoon]]ist Molly Norris of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] created the artwork in reaction to Internet death threats that had been made against animators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] for depicting Muhammad in an episode of ''[[South Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4674864.stm |title =Q&amp;A: Depicting the Prophet Muhammad |publisher =BBC News |date =February 2, 2006 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postings on RevolutionMuslim.com (under the pen name  Abu Talha al-Amrikee; later identified as [[Zachary Adam Chesser]]) had said that Parker and Stone could wind up like [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], a Dutch filmmaker who was stabbed and shot to death.&lt;ref name="Theo van Gogh murder"&gt;{{cite news|title=Life of slain Dutch film-maker|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3975211.stm|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=November 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris claimed that, if people draw pictures of Muhammad, [[Islamic terrorism|radical Islamist terrorists]] would not be able to murder them all, and threats to do so would become unrealistic. Within a week, Norris' idea became popular on [[Facebook]], was supported by numerous [[bloggers]], and generated coverage on the blog websites of major U.S. newspapers. As the publicity mounted, Norris and the man who created the first Facebook page promoting the May 20 event disassociated themselves from it. Nonetheless, planning for the protest continued with others "taking up the cause".&lt;ref name="erases"/&gt; Facebook had an "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" page, which grew to over 100,000 participants (101,870 members by May 20). A protest page on Facebook against the initiative named "Against ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'" attracted slightly more supporters (106,000 by May 20).&lt;ref name=figure/&gt; Subsequently, Facebook was temporarily blocked by Pakistan; the ban was lifted after Facebook agreed to block the page for users in India and Pakistan.

In the media, Everybody Draw Mohammed Day attracted support from commentators who felt that the campaign represented important issues of freedom of speech, and the need to stand up for this freedom.

===Background===
''[[South Park]]'' episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", broadcast in April 2010, featured a character in a bear costume, who various other characters stated was Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =James | first = Frank |author2=Mark Memmott | title = Facebook Blocked By Pakistani Court For 'Draw Muhammad' Day | work =[[National Public Radio]]: The two-way | publisher = www.npr.org | date = May 19, 2010 | url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/05/facebook_blocked_by_pakistani.html | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''South Park'' episode sparked statements from the extremist website [[Revolution Muslim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bates | first = Theunis | title = Pakistan Bans Facebook Over Muhammad Cartoons | work = AOL News | language =  | publisher = www.aolnews.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | accessdate = May 19, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100520033044/http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | archivedate = May 20, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Rodriguez | first =Alex | title = Facebook dark in Pakistan amid uproar over Muhammad caricatures|work=Los Angeles Times | publisher = www.latimes.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-facebook-20100520,0,4071401.story | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which posted a picture of the partially decapitated body of the Dutch filmmaker, [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], with a statement declaring that Parker and Stone could meet a similar fate. The group running the website said it was not threatening Parker and Stone, however, it also posted the addresses of Comedy Central's New York office and the California production studio where ''South Park'' is made.&lt;ref name=jgscl&gt;{{Cite news| last = Griswold | first =Jamie ([[Associated Press]]) | title =Seattle cartoonist launches 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' | work =MyNorthwest.com | publisher = Bonneville International | date = April 25, 2010 | url = http://www.mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=313170# | accessdate =May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy Central]] [[self-censored]] the episode when it was broadcast by removing the word "Muhammad" and a speech about intimidation and fear from the ''South Park'' episode.&lt;ref name=jgscl/&gt;

===Molly Norris cartoon===
Molly Norris drew the original, poster-like cartoon on April 20, 2010, which declared May 20, 2010, to be the first annual "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". The drawing showed various [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] objects, including a coffee cup, a cherry and a box of pasta, each claiming to be the likeness of Muhammad. Norris used an alternate [[transliteration]] of "Mohammed" on her poster.&lt;ref name=jotcoelat&gt;Orr, Jimmy, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/04/creators-of-everybody-draw-muhammad-day-abandon-effort-after-it-becomes-controversial.html "Creators of 'Everybody Draw Muhammad Day' drop gag after everybody gets angry"], April 26, 2010, "Top of the Ticket" blog, ''Los Angeles Times''. Retrieved April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the top of the illustration she wrote: {{quote|text=In light of the recent veiled (ha!) threats aimed at the creators of the television show South Park ... by bloggers on Revolution Muslim's website, we hereby deem May 20, 2010 as the first 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!'

Comedy Central cooperated with terrorists and pulled the episode) the first amendment.|sign=Molly Norris (April 20, 2010)|source=Molly.Norris.com}} The poster included a claim of sponsorship by an organization named "Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor or CACAH (pronounced ca-ca)", which Norris later said was purely fictional.&lt;ref name=posterdescribed&gt;[http://www.mollynorris.com/posterdescribed.html Poster described] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514103827/http://www.mollynorris.com/posterdescribed.html# |date=May 14, 2010 }}, MollyNorris.com, May 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Norris dedicated the cartoon to the creators of ''[[South Park]]'', [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = South Park Generates Anger over M | journal = The Layalina Review | volume = VI | issue = 9 | publisher = Layalina Productions, Inc | date = May 6, 2010 | url = http://www.layalina.tv/publications/review/PR_VI.9/article1.html | accessdate = May 6, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100510225548/http://www.layalina.tv/publications/review/PR_VI.9/article1.html | archivedate = May 10, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April, after she had rejected the idea for the May 20 protest, Norris stated on her website: "This was always a drawing about rights, never MEANT to disrespect religion. Alas – if we don't have rights, we will not be able to practice the religion of our choice. [...] None of these little characters ARE the likeness of Mohammed, they are just CLAIMING to be!" She also wrote, "I, the cartoonist, NEVER launched a draw Mohammed day. It is, in this FICTIONAL poster sponsored by this FICTIONAL GROUP", referring to the "Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor" wording in the cartoon. "SATIRE about a CURRENT EVENT, people!!! (That's what {{sic|cartoonist|'s}} do!)"&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Mollie, Web page titled [http://www.mollynorris.com/posterdescribed.html "Lighten up!

===Early publicity===
Norris circulated the cartoon to bloggers based in [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref name="gosalvez"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Gosalvez | first = Patricia | title =La 'bloguera', el profeta y Facebook – El temor obliga a una dibujante a retirar una campaña para pintar a Mahoma | work =[[El País]] |language=Spanish| publisher =www.elpais.com | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Pantallas/bloguera/profeta/Facebook/elpepirtv/20100504elpepirtv_4/Tes| accessdate =May 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She sent a copy of her illustration to [[Dan Savage]], who posted it on his blog on April 22. On April 23, she was interviewed by Dave Ross of [[KIRO-FM|KIRO]], a local Seattle radio station. Norris responded to a question "Are you sure you want to do this?", and said "Yeah, I want to water down the targets ... as a cartoonist I just felt so much passion about what had happened, I wanted to counter Comedy Central’s message about feeling afraid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Perkins| first = Mary | title = Seattle Cartoonist’s "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" Goes Viral | work =[[Seattlest]] | location = [[Seattle, Washington]] | publisher =[[Gothamist]] | date = April 27, 2010 | url = http://seattlest.com/2010/04/27/seattle_cartoonists_everybody_draw.php | accessdate = May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motivation for the protest was not simply to defend the ''South Park'' creators, but also to support the right to [[free speech]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Pries | first =Steve | title ='Everyone draw Mohammed day' challenges South Park censorship | work =The Depaulia | publisher =media.www.depauliaonline.com, [[DePaul University]] | date =May 17, 2010 | url =http://media.www.depauliaonline.com/media/storage/paper1414/news/2010/05/17/News/everyone.Draw.Mohammed.Day.Challenges.South.Park.Censorship-3919751.shtml | accessdate =May 17, 2010 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100521235514/http://media.www.depauliaonline.com/media/storage/paper1414/news/2010/05/17/News/everyone.Draw.Mohammed.Day.Challenges.South.Park.Censorship-3919751.shtml | archivedate =May 21, 2010 | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said, "it's a cartoonist's job to be [[Political correctness|non-PC]]."&lt;ref name=ross&gt;[http://www.mynorthwest.com/resources/audio_headlines/audio_player.php?a=16801&amp;f=/kiro/2010/04/04232010140224.mp3 Dave Ross Interviews Molly Norris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428224744/http://www.mynorthwest.com/resources/audio_headlines/audio_player.php?a=16801&amp;f=%2Fkiro%2F2010%2F04%2F04232010140224.mp3 |date=April 28, 2010 }}, MyNorthwest.com, April 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On her website, Norris stated that the idea was not to disrespect Islam, but to support everybody's freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=mnwco&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Associated Press]] | title = Cartoonist overwhelmed by response to "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" | date = April 27, 2010 | url = http://www.mynorthwest.com/?sid=313601&amp;nid=11 | work = MyNorthwest.com | accessdate = May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" Facebook page was created by Jon Wellington. By the morning of April 26, the page had almost 6,000 confirmed guests. By April 25, someone (whose identity is unknown) had started a "Ban Everybody Draw Muhammad Day" counter-protest page on Facebook, which had 800 confirmed guests.&lt;ref name=mcpspc&gt;Cavna, Michael, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/04/everybody_draw_mohammed_day_ga.html "Post-'South Park': Cartoonist retreats from 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!'

===Cartoonist and Facebook page creator end involvement===
On April 25, Norris wrote on her website that the response to her idea had surprised and shocked her: "I did not intend for my cartoon to go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]]. I did not intend to be the focus of any 'group'. I practice the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by drawing what I wish. This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, something I was totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!"&lt;ref name=mnwco/&gt;&lt;ref name="howardfriedman" /&gt; On April 26, she wrote on her website: "I am NOT involved in "Everybody Draw Mohammd [''[[sic]]'' ] Day! I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it. Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff".&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt; She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused. Asked why she initially publicized it, she replied, "Because I'm an idiot."&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;

Norris said the campaign had grown much bigger than she initially intended, and that her cartoon was being used in ways she couldn't control. "I just want to go back to my quiet life", she told the writer of a blog about comics at ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=mcpspc/&gt; Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement. "I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet," he wrote.&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;&lt;ref name="rickmoran" /&gt; "Y'all go ahead if that's your bag, but count me out."&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;&lt;ref name="rickmoran"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Moran | first =Rick | title = A Lesson for our Post-Modern Media Environment | work = The Moderate Voice | publisher = Newstex | date = April 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris acknowledged, "I said that I wanted to counter fear and then I got afraid."&lt;ref name="erases" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =The PM wrestles with greatest non-core moral issue of the election after next |work=The Australian | publisher = www.theaustralian.com.au | date = April 27, 2010 | url =http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/the-pm-wrestles-with-greatest-non-core-moral-issue-of-the-election-after-next/story-e6frg6zo-1225859056591 | accessdate =May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 29, Norris suggested that "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" be called off: "Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead. Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across. At this juncture, such drawings are only hurtful to more liberal and moderate Muslims who have not done anything to endanger our first amendment rights."&lt;ref&gt;Cavna, Michael, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/04/apologetic_draw_muhammad_carto.html "Apologetic 'Draw Muhammad' cartoonist urges 'Draw Al Gore' instead [VIDEO&amp;#93;"], 8:38 a.m. update of a 1 a.m. post, April 30, 2010, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, Norris posted a marked up version of her original cartoon, apologizing to Muslims.&lt;ref name=posterdescribed/&gt;

Norris' change in position received varying reactions from commentators. [[Kathleen Parker]], an opinion columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote, "Norris's cartoon was a fine idea, but she should be relieved of further duty or responsibility."&lt;ref name=kpfos&gt;Parker, Kathleen, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042703813.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 "Freedom of sketch"], opinion article, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 27, 2010. Retrieved April 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Alex Spillius commented, "No one should blame Norris for withdrawing from the fray, for this kind of case throws up lingering and insidious uncertainties. Any threat could blow over quickly or endure, [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Rushdie-style]], for decades. The row over the cartoons depicting Mohammed in the Danish paper Jyllands-Posten percolated for months before bubbling over into violent protests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Spillius | first = Alex | title =America's disappointing reaction to South Park censorship |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | publisher = Telegraph Media Group Limited | date = May 1, 2010| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/7663598/Americas-disappointing-reaction-to-South-Park-censorship.html| accessdate = May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Wei of ''[[The Business Insider]]'' was more critical of the decision by the cartoonist to withdraw from the protest movement, with an article titled, "Artist Who Proposed 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!'

Second, each of the images forces the viewer to actively participate not simply in the creation of meaning but of actually constructing the image itself."&lt;ref name="andthewinneris" /&gt; There were two images in the position of [[runner-up]] – one was an artistic rendition of a [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|tobacco smoking pipe]].&lt;ref name="andthewinneris"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Gillespie | first =Nick|authorlink=Nick Gillespie |author2=[[Matt Welch]]  | title =And The Winner of The Everybody Draw Mohammad Contest is... | work =[[Reason (magazine)|Reason.com]]| publisher = Reason Magazine | date = May 20, 2010 | url =http://reason-contest.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html | accessdate = May 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction references [[surrealist]] artist [[René Magritte]], and includes the text, "This is not a pipe.

==Reception==

===Support===
The idea for the May 20 protest received support from [[Kathleen Parker]], an opinion columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "Americans love their free speech and have had enough of those who think they can dictate the limits of that fundamental right. [...] Draw to any heart's discontent. It's a free country. For now."&lt;ref name=kpfos/&gt; The idea also received support from prominent bloggers and bloggers on prominent websites, such as [[Michael C. Moynihan]] at ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]'' magazine's "Hit &amp; Run" blog, who encouraged his readers to send him their drawings.&lt;ref name="moynihan423"&gt;Moynihan, Michael C., [http://reason.com/blog/2010/04/23/first-annual-everybody-draw-mo "First Annual Everybody Draw Mohammad Day"], blog post, April 23, 2010, "Hit &amp; Run" blog, ''Reason'' magazine website.

Yet there is one religious figure we can't make fun of. The point of the episode that started the controversy is that celebrities wanted Muhammad's power not to be ridiculed. How come non-Muslims aren't allowed to make jokes?"&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt; Moynihan posited that the decision of Comedy Central to enact [[self-censorship]] of the ''South Park'' episode would have the impact of worsening the situation.&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt;

"Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion is as important as the indignation that comes from the Muslim side," he told the  [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]] (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). "I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [[Vebjørn Selbekk]], a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Danish cartoons of Mohammed]] in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. "I think maybe this is the right way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Vold, Henrik Brattli, [http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/kultur/1.7097202 "Alle skal tegne Muhammed"], article, NRK (Norsk Rikskringkasting AS—[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]), April 26, 2010, in Norwegian (Selbekk: "og jeg synes kanskje dette er den riktige måten å reagere på – med humor, og også å spre dette på flere, så det ikke bare er noen få som blir sittende med alle truslene "; Rønning: "Jeg mener nok at indignasjonen fra dem som hevder retten til å drive religionskritikk er like viktig som den indignasjonen som kommer fra den muslimske siden.

Franz Kruger, writing for the ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'', called Everybody Draw Mohammed Day a "silly Facebook initiative" and found "the undertone of a 'clash of civilisations'" in it "disturbing", noting that "it is clear that some feel great satisfaction at what they see as 'sticking it to the Muslims'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =  Kruger| first =Franz | title = Why draw the Prophet? | work =  [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] | date =May 28, 2010  | url =http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-05-28-why-draw-the-prophet | accessdate = May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', which had itself published a controversial cartoon of Mohammed in its pages, distanced itself from the group, noting that it "claimed to be a protest against restrictions on freedom of speech and religious fanaticism, but had seemingly become a forum for venting Islamophobic sentiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sapa | title = M&amp;G regrets cartoon offence over prophet | work = [[The Daily Dispatch]] | date = May 31, 2010 | url = http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=405490 | accessdate = June 11, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615142819/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=405490 | archivedate = June 15, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugo Rifkind]], writing for ''[[The Times]]'', called the Facebook initiative a "grubby project": "... there’s something here that makes me twitch.

In Pakistan, an editorial in ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', the country's oldest English-language newspaper, said that there was no doubt that the Facebook initiative "was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation," adding that it was "debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities." However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a "knee-jerk reaction," saying that, "many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs," and that the block might "have played right into the hands of those who think nothing of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting the way we do we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Staff |title=Facebook furore |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=May 21, 2010 |url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 |accessdate=May 30, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524012334/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 |archivedate=May 24, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
The protest movement and incidents surrounding the [[censorship]] of the ''South Park'' episode were discussed on the [[National Public Radio]] program, ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'', where commentators including [[Ross Douthat]] analyzed the phenomenon of Norris withdrawing from the cartoon.&lt;ref name="douthat"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Douthat  | first = Ross |authorlink=Ross Douthat | title =  You Can't Portray Muhammad On TV| work = [[Talk of the Nation]]  | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] | date =April 26, 2010  | url =https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126283217  | accessdate = May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Gutmann of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that she had joined the Facebook group, and commented that if the [[2010 Times Square car bomb attempt]] was found to be related to the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[200 (South Park)|200]]", "this sort of protest will be more important than ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Gutmann | first =  Stephanie   | title = Facebook group says make May 20 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'  |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/stephaniegutmann/100037736/facebook-group-says-make-may-20-everybody-draw-mohammed-day/ | accessdate = May 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Faster Times]]'', journalist Noah Lederman noted that Norris' cartoon, "was her way of supporting the show’s creators and the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lederman | first = Noah  | title =South Park, Mohammed, and the First Amendment  | work =[[The Faster Times]] | publisher = thefastertimes.com | date = May 4, 2010 | url =http://www.isisiraq.com/south-park-mohammed-and-the-first-amendment/  | accessdate =May 5, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for ''[[Financial Times]]'', John Lloyd commented on the decision by Norris to withdraw from the protest movement and noted, "Molly Norris proposed a 'let’s everyone draw Mohammed day' – then, apparently appalled by her own audacity, backed quickly away."&lt;ref name="johnlloyd"&gt;{{Cite news| last =  Lloyd| first =John | title = Hard men and high drama: life imitating art? | work =  [[Financial Times]] | date =May 8, 2010  | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bbd083d6-595c-11df-99ba-00144feab49a.html  | accessdate = May 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'', Austin Dacey compared the protest movement to [[Martin Luther]], stating, "Forget the ''South Park'' dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. If you want to see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons, you have to go back to the sixteenth century. Near the end of Luther’s life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent."&lt;ref name="austindacey"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Dacey  | first = Austin  | title =  Satire is Religion – The debate over cartoons and prophets is not just about free of speech; it’s about freedom of religion.| work = Religion Dispatches | publisher =www.religiondispatches.org | date = May 12, 2010 | url = http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/culture/2561/satire_is_religion/ | accessdate = May 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dacey argued, "The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. But it is just as much a clash between ''conflicting'' religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy."&lt;ref name="austindacey" /&gt;

In an analysis of the protest movement for the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', journalist Jordan Manalastas commented, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day is a chance to reinstate offense and sincerity to their proper place, freed from terror or silence. ... The proper (and, at the risk of looking [[jingoistic]], American) way to combat bad speech is with better speech. To silence and be silenced are the refuge of cowards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Manalastas | first = Jordan  | title =Cartoonist criticized for creating ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day’ should have defended her right to First Amendment  | work = [[Daily Bruin]]  |publisher = www.dailybruin.com, [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date = May 17, 2010 | url =http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2010/5/17/cartoonist-criticized-creating-everybody-draw-moha/  | accessdate = May 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an analysis of the protest movement for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] was critical of the concept of "mocking Muhammad," writing, "... these two camps – the Muhammad-knockers and the Muslim offence-takers – are locked in a deadly embrace. Islamic extremists need Western depictions of Muhammad as evidence that there is a new crusade against Islam, while the Muhammad-knockers need the [[flag-burning]], street-stomping antics of the extremists as evidence that their defence of the Enlightenment is a risky, important business."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = O'Neill | first = Brendan | title =Mocking Muhammad: a shallow Enlightenment  | work =[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked magazine]] | publisher = www.spiked-online.com | date =May 19, 2010  | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/8894#.WDk70orQeUk | accessdate = November 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[editorial cartoonist]]s quoted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blogger Michael Cavna were critical of the Draw Mohammed Day idea or declined to participate, although all supported the right of cartoonists to depict Mohammed if they chose to.&lt;ref name=Cavna20May&gt;Michael Cavna, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/05/their_turn_12_top_cartoonists.html THEIR TURN: 12 top cartoonists offer their take on 'Draw Muhammad Day'], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blog ''Comics Riff'' (May 20, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The president of the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]] opposed involvement because, "something like that can be too easily co-opted by interest groups who, I suspect, have an agenda that goes beyond a simple defense of free expression."&lt;ref name=Cavna20May/&gt;  Other cartoonists quoted in the article called the event, "childish and needlessly provocative," or demurred because they dislike, "choreographed punditry."&lt;ref name=Cavna20May/&gt;

He also defended [[The First Amendment|the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution]] in the way that it's an important right of all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalexperts.org/comment-analysis/drawing-the-prophet-muhammad-should-not-be-an-issue|title=Drawing the Prophet Muhammad is not the issue|author=Tarek Kahlaoui|date=May 17, 2010|publisher=Global Expert Finder|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threat on Molly Norris's life, forced into hiding==
On July 11, 2010, it was reported that the Yemeni-American al-Qaeda cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] had put Molly Norris on a hitlist. In the English version of the [[al-Qaeda]] magazine  ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]],'' Al-Awlaki wrote, "The medicine prescribed by the Messenger of Allah is the execution of those involved," and was quoted as saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;The large number of participants makes it easier for us because there are more targets to choose from in addition to the difficulty of the government offering all of them special protection ...

[[FBI]] officials reportedly notified Norris warning her that they considered it a "very serious threat."&lt;ref name="hitlist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="threat" /&gt;

Norris has since changed her name and gone into hiding.

A '''Faqeeh''' (plural ''Fuqahā'', {{lang-ar|[[wikt:فقيه|فقيه]], pl. فقهاء}}) is an ''Islamic jurist'', an expert in [[fiqh]], or [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]] and [[Islamic Law]].

==Definition==
{{main article|fiqh}}

[[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/207723/fiqh Fiqh] Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; or fiqh is the human understanding of the [[Sharia]] (believed by Muslims to represent divine law as revealed in the [[Quran]] and the ''[[Sunnah]]'' (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]))&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Frank E.|title=Islamic Law and the Legal System of Saudí: Studies of Saudi Arabia|date=2000|publisher=Brill|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-PfDuvnHMGoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=vogel+islamic+law#v=onepage&amp;q=vogel%20islamic%20law&amp;f=false|isbn=9004110623}}&lt;/ref&gt; —sharia expanded and developed by interpretation (''[[ijtihad]]'') of the Quran and ''Sunnah'' by Islamic jurists (''[[Ulema]]'')&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; and implemented by the rulings (''[[Fatwa]]'') of jurists on questions presented to them.

''Fiqh'' deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. In the modern era there are four prominent schools (''[[madh'hab]]'') of ''fiqh'' within [[Sunni]] practice and two (or three) within [[Shi'a]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;Glasse, Cyril, ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Altamira, 2001, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] describes ''fiqh'' as "knowledge of the rules of God which concern the actions of persons who own themselves bound to obey the law respecting what is required (''[[wajib]]''), sinful (''[[haraam]]''), recommended (''[[mustahab|mandūb]]''), disapproved (''[[makrūh]]'') or neutral (''[[mubah]]'')".&lt;ref&gt;Levy (1957). Page 150.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is consistent amongst the jurists.

Another definition of ''Fiqh'' is "Knowledge of legislative rulings, pertaining to the actions of man, as derived from their detailed evidences."&lt;ref name=Kulseth-440&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kulseth|first1=P. M.|title=Redeemed: The Saga of Eyja's Family in Iceland and the Muslim World|date=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|page=440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PqkZp1ElMmcC&amp;pg=PA440&amp;dq=fiqh+Knowledge+of+legislative+rulings,+pertaining+to+the+actions+of+man,+as+derived+from+their+detailed+evidences&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIiP3lg9XqxwIVTwWSCh21vwQf#v=onepage&amp;q=fiqh%20Knowledge%20of%20legislative%20rulings%2C%20pertaining%20to%20the%20actions%20of%20man%2C%20as%20derived%20from%20their%20detailed%20evidences&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

*"Legislative rulings..." here excludes rulings that are purely theoretical in nature, such as those found in the science of ''Usul Al Fiqh'', as well as those theological in nature, generally discussed in the books of [[Aqidah]] or [[Kalam]].
*"derived from their detailed evidences" here connotes two things:
#that there is a method of derivation; and,
#that the source for such derivation are the various evidences considered valid Islamically.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Methods of derivation==
Methods of derivation are laid out in the books of ''Usul Al Fiqh'' (principles of fiqh), and those evidences which are deemed valid for deriving rulings from are many in number. Four of them are agreed upon by the vast Majority of Jurists, they are:
* The [[Qur'an]]
* The [[Hadith|Sunnah]]
* [[Ijma']] or Consensus
* [[Qiyas]] or Analogy

These four types of evidence are seen as acceptable by the vast majority of Jurists from both the schools of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Jurists (the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]] and sometimes the [[Zahiriyah]]), as well as [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] Jurists.  However, [[Zahiriyah]] or Literalists do not see [[Qiyas]] as valid.

While Twelver Shia see edicts of the [[Twelvers|Twelve]] Imams as holding the same weight as the Quran and Sunnah, this is unacceptable by Sunni Jurists.

==Conditions for being a Faqeeh==
The Faqeeh is one who has fulfilled the conditions for [[Ijtihad]] either in their entirety or in piecemeal.  In the Sunni point of view it is generally held that there are either no (or very few) Jurists or Fuqaha that have reached the level of Mujtahid Mutlaq in our day and age. In the [[Twelver]] (Ithna Asheri) Shia view, each of their [[Marja']] have reached this level.

The Faqeeh who fulfills all conditions of Ijtihad is sometimes referred to as a ''Mujtahid Mutlaq'' or Unrestricted Jurist-Scholar, while he who has not reached that level generally will master of the methodology (''Usul'') used by one or more of the prominent ''madhhab'' and then able to apply this methodology to arrive at the traditional legal rulings of his/her respective madhhab. According to the Sunni Muslim website Living Islam, "There is no mujtahid mutlaq today nor even a claimant to that title."&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haddad|first1=GF|title=What is the definition of a mujtahid mutlaq, and are there any today.|url=http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e60.html|website=livingislam.org|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the level of Mujtahid Mutlaq is the ''Mujtahid Muqayyad'' or a Restricted Jurist-Scholar.  A ''Mujtahid Muqayyad'' must pass rulings according to the confines of his particular [[madhhab]] (school of jurisprudence), or particular area of specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sunni Path|publisher=Hakikat Kitapevi.|page=33|edition=15th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RsuasOoNH0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%27%27%27Mujtahid+Muqayyad%27%27%27&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI2Jr359nqxwIV0X-SCh3DFwEP#v=onepage&amp;q=%27%27%27Mujtahid%20Muqayyad%27%27%27&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is according to the view that Ijtihad or the ability of legal deduction can be achieved in specified areas, and does not require a holistic grasp of the [[Shariah]] and its entailing Laws and legal theory.

'''Film preservation''', or '''film restoration''', describes a series of ongoing efforts among film historians, archivists, museums, [[cinematheque]]s, and [[non-profit organization]]s to rescue decaying [[film stock]] and preserve the images which they contain. In the widest sense, preservation nowadays assures that a movie will continue to exist in as close to its original form as possible.&lt;ref name="McGreevey, Tom 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeck|first=Joanne L.|title=Our Movie Heritage|year=1997|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0813524318|author2=Tom McGreevey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the term "preservation" was synonymous with "duplication" of film. The goal of a preservationist was to create a durable copy without any significant loss of [[image quality|quality]]. In more modern terms, film preservation now includes the concepts of handling, duplication, storage, and access. The archivist seeks to protect the film and share the content with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums|year=2004|publisher=National Film Preservation Foundation|location=[[San Francisco]]|isbn=0974709905|url=http://www.filmpreservation.org/preservation-basics/the-film-preservation-guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film preservation is not to be confused with film [[Revisionism (fictional)|revisionism]], in which long-completed films are subjected to [[outtake]]s never previously seen being inserted, newly inserted music scores or sound effects being added, black-and-white film being [[Film colorization|colorized]] or converted to [[Dolby]] stereo, or minor [[film editing|edits]] and other cosmetic changes being made.

By the 1980s, it was becoming apparent that the collections of motion picture heritage were at risk of becoming lost. Not only was the preservation of [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]] an ongoing problem, but the discovery that safety film, used as a replacement for the more volatile nitrate stock, was beginning to be affected by a unique form of decay known as "[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|vinegar syndrome]]", and color film manufactured, in particular, by [[Eastman Kodak]], was found to be at risk of fading. At that time, the best known solution was to duplicate the original film onto a more secure medium.

90 percent of all American [[silent films]] made before 1929 and 50 percent of American [[sound film]]s made before 1950 are [[lost films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Dave Kehr|Kehr, Dave]]|title=Film Riches, Cleaned Up for Posterity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/movies/15restore.html|quote=It’s bad enough, to cite a common estimate, that 90 percent of all American silent films and 50 percent of American sound films made before 1950 appear to have vanished forever.|work=[[New York Times]]|date=14 October 2010|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although institutional practices of film preservation date back to the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Houston, P. (1994). Keepers of the frame: the film archives. British Film Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; the field received an official status only in 1980, when UNESCO recognized "moving images" as an integral part of the world's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13139&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO, Recommendation for the Safeguarding and Preservation of Moving Images] at UNESCO.org, 27 October 1980.

==Film decay==
{{see also|Lost film}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nitratedecomp.png|thumb|320px|An extreme example of nitrate decomposition.]] --&gt;
The great majority of films made in the [[silent film|silent]] era are now considered [[lost films|lost]] forever. Movies of the first half of the 20th century were filmed on an unstable, highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] [[film base]], which required careful storage to slow its inevitable process of decomposition over time. Most films made on nitrate stock were not preserved; over the years, their negatives and prints crumbled into powder or dust. Many of them were recycled for their silver content, or destroyed in studio or vault fires. The largest cause, however, was intentional destruction. As film preservationist Robert A. Harris explains, "Most of the early films did not survive because of wholesale junking by the studios. There was no thought of ever saving these films. They simply needed vault space and the materials were expensive to house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=Martin|title=Robert A. Harris Presentation on Film Preservation|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/rah.htm|publisher=American WideScreen Museum|date=February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silent film]]s had little or no commercial value after the advent of sound films in the 1930s, and as such, they were not kept. As a result, preserving the now rare silent films has been a high priority amongst [[History of film|film historians]].

Because of the fragility of [[film stock]], proper preservation of film usually involves storing the original negatives (if they have survived) and prints in climate-controlled facilities. The vast majority of films were not stored in this manner, which resulted in the widespread decay of film stocks.

The problem of film decay is not limited to films made on [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]]. Film industry researchers and specialists have found that color films (those made in the processes which replaced [[Technicolor]]) are also decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. A number of well-known films only exist as copies of original [[film production]]s or exhibition elements because the originals have decomposed beyond use. [[Cellulose acetate film]], which was the initial replacement for nitrate, has been found to suffer from "[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|vinegar syndrome]]". The ongoing preservation of color films is now presented with an issue, as low temperatures, which inhibit color fading, actually increase the effects of vinegar syndrome, while higher (normal room) temperatures cause color fading.{{dubious | August 2018 |reason=Vinegar syndrome article says the opposite.|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Film decay as an art form===
In 2002, filmmaker [[Bill Morrison (director)|Bill Morrison]] produced ''[[Decasia]]'', a film solely based on fragments of old unrestored nitrate-based films in various states of decay and disrepair, providing a somewhat eerie aesthetic to the film. The film was paired together with a soundtrack composed by [[Michael Gordon (composer)|Michael Gordon]], and performed by his orchestra.  The footage used was from old newsreel &amp; archive film, and was obtained by Morrison from several sources, such as the [http://www.sc.edu/library/newsfilm/ Fox Movietone Newsfilm Archives] at the [[University of South Carolina]], and the archives of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

==Preservation through careful storage==
[[File:PackardHumanities Institute, Santa Clarita.jpg|thumb|right|[[Packard Humanities Institute]], Santa Clarita, [[Nitrate film]] Film Vault]]
The "preservation" of film usually refers to physical storage of the film in a [[HVAC|climate-controlled]] vault, and sometimes to the actual repair and copying of the film element. Preservation is different from "restoration", as restoration is the act of returning the film to a version most faithful to its initial release to the public and often involves combining various fragments of film elements.

Film is best preserved by proper protection from external forces while in storage along with being under controlled temperatures.&lt;ref name="McGreevey, Tom 1997"/&gt; For most film materials, the [[Image Permanence Institute]] finds that storing film media in frozen temperatures, with RH between 30% and 50%, greatly extends its useful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums|last=|first=|publisher=The National Film Preservation Foundation|year=2004|isbn=0974709905|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures inhibit deterioration better than any other methods and is a cheaper solution than replicating deteriorating films.

==Preparing a film for preservation and restoration==

In most cases, when a film is chosen for preservation or restoration work, new prints are created from the [[original camera negative]] or the ''composite restoration negative'' which is often made from a combination of elements for general screening.

The composite restoration negative is a compilation of duplicated sections of the best remaining material, recombined to approximate the original configuration of the original camera negative at some time in the film's release cycle, while the [[original camera negative]] is the remaining, edited, film negative that passed through the camera on the set. This original camera negative may, or may not, remain in original release form, depending upon number of subsequent re-releases after the initial release for theatrical exhibition.

In traditional photochemical restorations, image polarity considerations must be observed when recombining surviving materials and the final, lowest generation restoration master may be either a duplicate negative or a [[fine grain master positive]].

Preservation elements, such as fine-grain master positives and duplicate printing negatives, are generated from this restoration master element to make both duplication masters and access projection prints available for future generations.

==Film as archival medium==

Film preservationists would prefer that the film images, whether restored through photochemical or digital processes, be eventually transferred to other film stock, because no digital media exists that has proven truly archival because of rapidly evolving and shifting data formats, while a well-developed and stored, modern film print can last upwards of 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://twitchfilm.com/2012/09/jason-gorbers-cineruminations-70mm-4k-and-the-master-split-personality.html |title=twitchfilm.com. Jason Gorber's Cineruminations: 70mm, 4K, and THE MASTER's Split Personality Jason Gorber |access-date=2014-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217215841/http://twitchfilm.com/2012/09/jason-gorbers-cineruminations-70mm-4k-and-the-master-split-personality.html |archive-date=2014-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some in the archival community feel that conversion from film to a digital image results in a loss of quality that can make it more difficult to create a high-quality print based upon the digital image, digital imaging technology has become increasingly advanced to the point where 8K scanners can capture the full resolution of images filmed at as high as 65mm.&lt;ref name="postmagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2012/November-1-2012/Sound-Picture-Restoration.aspx postmagazine.com, Issue: November 1, 2012, Sound &amp; Picture Restoration, By: Christine Bunish]&lt;/ref&gt; 70mm IMAX has a resolution of 18K, which is the upper necessary limit for film capture in full resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Image resolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, having an intermediate digital stage, followed by forming a new film master by lasering the digital results onto new film stock does represent an extra generation. So would an intermediate film master that was restored frame-by-frame by hand. The choice of film vs. digital restoration will be driven by the amount, if any, of restoration required, the taste and skill set of the restorer, and the economics of film restoration vs. digital restoration.

==Digital as archival medium==

Digital scanners {{as of|2014|lc=y}} can capture images as large as 65mm in full resolution.&lt;ref name="postmagazine.com"/&gt; That is the typical image size on a traditional (as opposed to the IMAX process) 70mm film which used a portion of the film surface for its multitrack magnetic sound stripe. A 70mm print of a two and a half hour film {{as of|2012|lc=y}} ran upwards of $170,000. A hard disk capable of storing such a movie is a few hundred dollars. An archival optical disk will be less. The problem of having to transfer the data as new generations of equipment come along will continue, however, until true archival standards are put in place.

==Digital film preservation==

In the context of film preservation the term "[[digital preservation]]" highlights the use of digital technology for the transfer of films from 8mm to 70mm in size to digital [[digital media|carriers]], as well as all practices for ensuring the longevity and access to [[Digitizing|digitized]] or [[Born-digital|digitally born]] film materials. On purely technical and practical terms, digital film preservation stands for a domain specific subset of [[digital curation]] practices. Extensive technical literature on the subject can be found at the online library of the Presto Centre Project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prestocentre.org/ Presto Centre Project web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aesthetic]] and [[ethical]] implications of the use of digital technology for film preservation are major subjects of debate. For instance, the senior curator of [[George Eastman House]] Paolo Cherchi Usai has decried the shift from analogue to digital preservation of film as ethically unacceptable, arguing, on philosophical terms, that the medium of film is an essential ontological precondition for the existence of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Usai, Paolo Cherchi (2001) "The death of cinema: history, cultural memory and the digital dark age" British Film Institute&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the senior curator of [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]] Giovanna Fossati has discussed the use of digital technologies for the restoration and preservation of film in a more optimistic way as a form of [[Remediation (Marxist theory)|remediation]] of the cinematic medium, and has positively reflected on digital technologies' ability to broaden restoration possibilities, improve quality, and reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;Fossati, Giovanna (2009) "From grain to pixel: the archival life of film in transition." Amsterdam University Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to the cinema scholar Leo Enticknap, the views held by Usai and Fossati could be seen as representative of the two poles of the digital debate in film preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Enticknap, Leo (2012). "Dossier: Materiality and the Archive." The Velvet Light Trap, (70), 63-64&lt;/ref&gt; It should be kept in mind, however, that both Usai and Fossati's arguments are highly complex and nuanced, and likewise, the debate about the utility of digital technologies in film preservation is complex and continually evolving.

==Advancements==
In 1935, New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] began one of the earliest institutional attempts to collect and preserve motion pictures, obtaining original negatives of the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]] and Edison companies, and the world's largest collection of [[D. W. Griffith]] films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA.org {{!}} The Collection {{!}} Film and Media |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/depts/film_media/ |work=[[The Museum of Modern Art]] |accessdate=23 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207232551/http://www.moma.org/collection/depts/film_media/ |archivedate=February 7, 2006 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Henri Langlois]] founded the [[Cinémathèque Française]] in Paris, which would become the world's largest international film collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/data/document/expositionpermanente.pdf |title=Passion Cinéma |access-date=2006-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627162200/http://www.cinematheque.fr/data/document/expositionpermanente.pdf |archive-date=2006-06-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For thousands of early silent films stored in the [[Library of Congress]], mostly between 1894 and 1912, the only existing copies were printed on [[paper print|rolls of paper]] submitted as copyright registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/earlymps.html#pape |title=Early Motion Pictures Free of Copyright Restrictions in the Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |date=31 August 2010|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these, an [[optical printer]] was used to copy these images onto safety film stock, a project that began in 1947 and continues today.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Library hosts the National Film Preservation Board, whose National Film Registry annually selects 25 U.S. films "showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/about-this-program Library of Congress-LOC Film preservation]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film]] was chartered in 1947 to collect, preserve and present the history of photography and film, and in 1996 opened the Louis B. Mayer Conservation Center, one of only four film conservation centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastmanhouse.org/inc/the_museum/history.php |title=Museum History · George Eastman House |publisher=Eastmanhouse.org |accessdate=14 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006120017/http://eastmanhouse.org/inc/the_museum/history.php |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Film Institute]] was founded in 1967 to train the next generation of filmmakers and preserve the American film heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Film Institute|url=http://www.afi.com/about/history.aspx|title=History of AFI|publisher=Afi.com|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its collection now includes over 27,500 titles.

In 1978, [[Dawson City]], [[Yukon Territory]], Canada, a construction excavation inadvertently found a forgotten collection of more than 500 discarded films from the early 20th century that were buried in and preserved in the [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;Kula, S. (1979). Rescued from the Permafrost: The Dawson Collection of Motion Pictures. ''Archivaria,'' No. 8, Summer 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  This fortunate discovery was shared and moved to the United States' [[Library of Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, R. (1990, Sept. 3). Expanding Archives: Library of Congress Is Not Just Books. ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Library and Archives Canada]] for transfer to safety stock and archiving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/about-us/preservation/Pages/preservation.aspx The Library and Archives Canada Preservation Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; However, to move such highly flammable material such a distance ultimately required assistance from the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] to make the delivery to [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=Bill|title=Dawson City: Frozen Time|date=2016|publisher=KinoLorber|page=1:53:45|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of this discovery as well as excerpts of these films can be seen in the 2016 [[documentary film]], ''[[Dawson City: Frozen Time]]''.

Another high-profile restoration by staff at the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[National Film and Television Archive]] is the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] collection, which consists almost entirely of [[actuality film]]s commissioned by traveling fairground operators for showing at local fairgrounds or other venues across the UK in the early part of the twentieth century. The collection was stored for many decades in two large barrels following the winding-up of the firm, and was discovered in [[Blackburn]] in the early 1990s. The restored films now offer a unique social record of early 20th-century British life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/archive-collections/about-bfi-national-archive About the BFI National Archive] at British Film Institute official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual preservationists who have contributed to the cause include [[Robert A. Harris]] and [[James Katz]] (''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'', and several [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films), Michael Thau (''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''), and [[Kevin Brownlow]] (''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' and ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoleon]]'').  Other organizations, such as the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]], have also preserved and restored films; a major part of UCLA's work includes such projects as ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' and select [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]/[[Famous Studios]] and [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons whose credits were once altered due to rights taken over by different entities.

==Studio efforts==
In 1926 [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] asked for [[film studio]]s to preserve their films by storing them at 40 degrees at low humidity in an [[Eastman Kodak]] process, so that "schoolboys in the year 3,000 and 4,000 A.D. may learn about us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Alva| authorlink = Alva Johnston|title=Films Put on Ice for Fans yet Unborn|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 October 1926|quote=Will Hays has sent a call to the motion-picture companies to search their vaults for ancient films of all kinds and for news reels of possible historic interest. The most important of these are to be treated by a process developed in the Eastman laboratories for making films immortal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], aware that the original negatives to many of its Golden Age films had been destroyed in a fire, began a preservation program to restore and preserve all of its films by using whatever negatives survived, or, in many cases, the next best available elements (whether it be a fine-grain master positive or mint archival print). From the onset, it was determined that if some films had to be preserved, then it would have to be ''all'' of them.  In 1986, when [[Ted Turner]] acquired MGM's library (which by then had included [[Warner Bros.]]' pre-1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schickel|first=Richard| authorlink = Richard Schickel|title=You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story|year=2008|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=076243418X|author2=Perry, George}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Warner Bros. retained a pair of features from 1949 that they merely distributed, and all short subjects released on or after September 1, 1948, in addition to all cartoons released in August 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; MGM's pre-May 1986, and a majority of the [[RKO Radio Pictures]] catalogs), he vowed to continue the preservation work MGM had started. [[Time Warner]], the current owner of [[Turner Entertainment]], continues this work today.

The cause for film preservation came to the forefront in the 1980s and early 1990s when such famous and influential film directors as [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] contributed to the cause. Spielberg became interested in film preservation when he went to view the master of his film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]],'' only to find that it had badly decomposed and deteriorated—a mere fifteen years after it had been filmed. Scorsese drew attention to the film industry's use of color-fading film stock through his use of black-and-white film stock in his 1980 film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  His film, ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'' included a key scene in which many of film pioneer [[Georges Méliès]]' silent films are melted down and the raw material recycled as shoes; this was seen by many movie critics as "a passionate brief for film preservation wrapped in a fanciful tale of childhood intrigue and adventure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Todd| authorlink =Todd McCarthy|title=Hugo: Film Review |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/hugo/review/263209|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scorsese's concern about the need to save motion pictures of the past led him to create [[The Film Foundation]], a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 1990. He was joined in this effort by fellow film makers who served on the foundation's board of directors—[[Woody Allen]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[George Lucas]], [[Sydney Pollack]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]. In 2006, [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Wes Anderson]], [[Curtis Hanson]], [[Peter Jackson]], [[Ang Lee]], and [[Alexander Payne]] were added to the board of directors of The Film Foundation, which is aligned with the [[Directors Guild of America]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

By working in partnership with the leading film archives and studios, The Film Foundation has saved nearly 600 films, often restoring them to pristine condition. In many cases, original footage that had been excised—or [[censorship|censored]] by the [[Production Code]] in the U.S.—from the original negative, has been reinstated. In addition to the preservation, restoration, and presentation of classic cinema, the foundation teaches young people about film language and history through ''The Story of Movies'', an educational program claimed to be "used by over 100,000 educators nationwide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storyofmovies.org/common/11041/aboutFoundation.cfm?clientID=11041 About the Foundation] at storyofmovies.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In the age of [[digital television]], [[high definition television]] and [[DVD]], film preservation and restoration has taken on commercial as well as historical importance, since audiences demand the highest possible picture quality from digital formats.  Meanwhile, the dominance of [[home video]] and ever-present need for [[television broadcasting]] content, especially on [[specialty channel]]s, has meant that films have proven a source of long-term revenue to a degree that the original artists and studio management before the rise of these media never imagined. Thus media companies have a strong financial incentive to carefully archive and preserve their complete library of films.

==Video Aids to Film Preservation==
The group Video Aids to Film Preservation (VAFP) became active on the Internet in 2005.

The VAFP site was funded as part of a 2005 [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] (IMLS) grant to the [[Folkstreams]] project. The purpose of the site is to supplement already existing film preservation guides provided by the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] with video demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Aids to Film Preservation|url=http://www.folkstreams.net/vafp/#content|work=Folkstreams|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preservation guides provided by the origination, while thoroughly depicting accurate methods of preservation, are mostly text-based. The films and clips are copyrighted under the [[Creative Commons]] license, which allows anyone to use these clips with attribution—in this case, attribution to the VAFP site and to the author of the clip and his company.

==Obstacles in restoration==
Regardless of the age of the print itself, damage may occur if stored improperly. Damage to the film (caused by tears on the print, curling of the film base due to intense light exposure, temperature, humidity, etc.) all significantly raise the difficulty of the preservation process. Many films simply do not have enough information left on the film to piece together a new master, although careful digital restoration can produce stunning results by gathering bits and pieces of buildings from adjacent frames for restoration on a damaged frame, predicting entire frames based on the characters' movements in prior and subsequent frames, etc. As time goes on, this digital capability will only improve, but it will ultimately require sufficient information from the original film to make proper restorations and predictions.

Cost is another obstacle. In 2014, Martin Scorsese's non-profit The Film Foundation, dedicated to film presentation, estimated the average cost of photochemical restoration of a color feature with sound at $50,000 to $100,000 dollars, with digital 2K or 4K restoration at "several hundred thousand dollars."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film-foundation.org film-foundation.org FAQ http://www.film-foundation.org/faq]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of physical and chemical damage of film influences the incentive to preserve, i.e. as the business perspective states that once a film is no longer "commercially" viable, it stops generating profit and becomes a financial liability. While few films would not benefit from digital restoration, the high cost of restoring films digitally still prevents the method from being as broadly applied as it might be.

Demand for new media, digital cinema, and constantly-evolving consumer digital formats keeps evolving and shifting. Film restoration facilities must keep pace to maintain audience acceptance. Classic films today must be in near-mint condition if they are to be reshown or resold, with the demand for perfection only rising as theaters move from 2K to 4K projection and consumer media continues its shift from SD to HD to UltraHD and beyond.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Digital restoration steps==

Once a film is inspected and cleaned it is transferred via [[telecine]] or a [[motion picture film scanner]] to a [[magnetic tape data storage|digital tape]] or [[hard disk drive|disk]], and the audio is synced to create a new [[audio mastering|master]].

The main defects needing restoration:
* Dirt/dust
* Scratches, tears/[[movie projector#Light source|burned frames]]
* Color fade, color change
* Excessive [[film grain]] (a copy of an existing film has all of the film grain from the original as well as the film grain in the copy)
* Missing scenes and sound (censored or edited out for re-release)
* Shrinkage&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Linear and "across the web" (width), as well as localized puckering around large (1 to 2) perforation film cement splices, most common in silent and very early sound films. Highly shrunken film (1.5% or higher), must be copied on modified equipment or the film will most likely be damaged. In the case of inflammable nitrate film, this could prove to be dangerous, as the film can jam in the duplicator and become idle. Some methods of duplication have illumination sources with enough heat to ignite the film if exposed to the light source for a long period of time.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern, digital film restoration takes the following steps:
&lt;ol type+"1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertly clean the film of dirt and dust.
&lt;li&gt;Repair all film tears with clear polyester tape or splicing cement.
&lt;li&gt;Scan each frame into a digital file.
&lt;li&gt;Restore the film frame by frame by comparing each frame to adjacent frames. This can be done somewhat by computer algorithms with human checking of the result.
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix frame alignment ("jitter" and "weave"), or the misalignment of adjacent film frames due to movement of film within the sprockets. This corrects the issue where the holes on each side of a frame are distorted over time. This causes frames to slightly be off center.
&lt;li&gt;Fix color and lighting changes. This corrects flickering and slight color changes from one frame to another due to aging of the film.
&lt;li&gt;Restore areas blocked by dirt and dust by using parts of images in other frames.
&lt;li&gt;Restore scratches by using parts of images in other frames.
&lt;li&gt;Enhance frames by reducing film grain noise. Film foreground/background detail about the same size as the film grain or smaller is blurred or lost in making the film. Comparing a frame with adjacent frames allows detail information to be reconstructed since a given small detail may be split between more film grains from one frame to another.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Photochemical restoration steps ==

Modern, photochemical restoration follows roughly the same path as digital:
# Extensive research is done to determine what version of the film can be restored from the existing material. Often, extensive efforts are taken to search out alternative material in film archives located around the world.
# A comprehensive restoration plan is mapped that allows preservationists to designate elements as "key" elements upon which to base the polarity map for the ensuing photochemical work. Since many alternative elements are actually salvaged from release prints and duplication masters (foreign and domestic). Care must be taken to plot the course at which negative, master positive and release print elements arrive back at a common polarity (i.e., negative or positive) for assembly and subsequent printing.
# Test prints are struck from existing elements to evaluate contrast, resolution, color (if color) and sound quality (if audio element exists).
# Elements are duplicated using the shortest possible duplication path to minimize analog [[generation loss|duplication artifacts]], such as the build-up of contrast, grain and loss of resolution.
# All sources are assembled into a single master restoration element (most often a duplicate negative).
# From this master restoration element, duplication masters, such as composite fine grain masters, are generated to be used to generate additional printing negatives from which actual release prints can be struck for festival screenings and DVD mastering.
&lt;!-- (This paragraph is practically commentary, please reword to meet Wikipedia standards or remove altogether.)
Another important issue presented is that films of the nineteenth century are deteriorating. Negating internal processes, external factors such as wars and floods could destroy these collections permanently. The argument presented is that if films can be restored and made accessible for public consumption, then active efforts to take advantage of this extraordinary invention should continue. The fact is that at the risk of sounding technology determinist, there will be a solution to the preservation of film and digital format. Cyberspace is developing exponentially one must place it in the context where it is constant to changes in society. For every different medium there has been an exposure of meeting the demands of the audience. If the demands of the audience are to be met then surely a backup of this success is needed and will be sought i.e. an appropriate storage medium. In the next century, film archives may not exist.--&gt;

==Education==

The practice of film preservation is more craft than science. Until the early 1990s there were no dedicated academic programs in film preservation. Practitioners had often entered the field through related education (e.g. library or archival science), related technical experience (e.g. film lab work), or driven by sheer passion for working with film.&lt;ref&gt;Lukow, Gregory. [http://www.amianet.org/sites/all/files/ed_training_careers.pdf "Education Training and Careers in Moving Image Preservation"]. (AMIA, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last two decades universities globally began offering graduate degrees in film preservation and film archiving, which are often taught conjointly (the latter focusing more on skills related to the description, cataloguing, indexing and broadly speaking management of film and media collections).

The recent years rapid incursion of digital technologies in the field has somewhat redefined the vocational scope of film preservation. In response, the majority of graduate programs in film preservation have begun offering courses on digital film preservation and digital film and media collection management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3135">[[Image:Flux Transfer Event.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of a flux transfer event.]]A '''flux transfer event (FTE)''' occurs when a magnetic portal opens in the [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]] through which high-energy particles flow from the [[Sun]]. This connection, while previously thought to be permanent, has been found to be brief and very dynamic. The [[European Space Agency]]'s four [[Cluster mission|Cluster spacecraft]] and [[NASA]]'s five [[THEMIS]] probes have flown through and surrounded these FTEs, measuring their dimensions and identifying the particles that are transferred between the magnetic fields.

==Formation==
Earth's magnetosphere and the [[Sun#Magnetic field|Sun's magnetic field]] are constantly pressed against one another on the [[Daytime (astronomy)|dayside]] of Earth. Approximately every eight minutes, these fields briefly merge, forming a temporary "portal" between the Earth and the Sun through which high-energy particles such as [[solar wind]] can flow. The portal takes the shape of a magnetic cylinder about the width of Earth. Current observations place the portal at up to 4 times the size of Earth.

==Simulations==
Since Cluster and THEMIS have directly sampled FTEs, scientists can [[simulation|simulate]] FTEs on computers to predict how they might behave. Jimmy Raeder of the [[University of New Hampshire]] told his colleagues simulations show that the cylindrical portals tend to form above Earth's [[equator]] and then roll over Earth's winter pole. In December, FTEs roll over the [[north pole]]; in July they roll over the [[south pole]].

== Flux transfer events beyond Earth ==

Magnetic fields similar to Earth's are common throughout known space and many undergo similar flux transfer events.  During its second flyby of the planet on October 6, 2008, the NASA probe [[MESSENGER]] discovered that [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]’s magnetic field shows a magnetic reconnection rate ten times higher than Earth's. Mercury's proximity to the Sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by MESSENGER and the cause of this discrepancy is not currently known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/multimedia/magnetic_tornadoes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, it has been found that the same phenomenon, also known as a 'magnetic rope', can be observed at [[Saturn]]. The findings prove that at times Saturn "behaves and interacts with the Sun in much the same way as Earth". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/maps-news-publication/saturn-sun-magnetic-rope&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''rotation curve''' of a [[disc galaxy]] (also called a '''velocity curve''') is a plot of the orbital speeds of visible [[star]]s or gas in that galaxy versus their [[radial distance]] from that galaxy's centre. It is typically rendered graphically as a [[Plot (graphics)|plot]], and the data observed from each side of a spiral galaxy are generally asymmetric, so that data from each side are averaged to create the curve. A significant discrepancy exists between the experimental curves observed, and a curve derived from theory. The theory of [[dark matter]] is currently postulated to account for the variance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unknown Universe: The Origin of the Universe, Quantum Gravity, Wormholes, and Other Things Science Still Can't Explain |last=Hammond|first=Richard|publisher=Career Press|publication-date = May 1, 2008|isbn=|location=Franklin Lakes, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The rotation curve of a [[disc galaxy]] (also called a velocity curve) is a [[Plot (graphics)|plot]] of the orbital speeds of visible [[star]]s or gas in that galaxy versus their [[radial distance]] from that galaxy's centre. The rotation curves of spiral galaxies are asymmetric, so the observational data from each side of a galaxy are generally averaged. Rotation curve asymmetry appears to be normal rather than exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jog |first1=C. J. |year=2002  |title=Large-scale asymmetry of rotation curves in lopsided spiral galaxies |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2002/32/aa2266.pdf |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=391 |issue=2 |pages=471–479 |arxiv=astro-ph/0207055 |bibcode=2002A&amp;A...391..471J |bibcode-access=free |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20020832 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rotational/orbital speeds of galaxies/stars do not follow the rules found in other orbital systems such as stars/planets and planets/moons that have most of their mass at the centre. Stars revolve around their galaxy's centre at equal or increasing speed over a large range of distances. In contrast, the orbital velocities of planets in planetary systems and moons orbiting planets decline with distance. In the latter cases, this reflects the [[mass distribution]]s within those systems. The mass estimations for galaxies based on the light they emit are far too low to explain the velocity observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Bosma |first=A. |date=1978 |title=The Distribution and Kinematics of Neutral Hydrogen in Spiral Galaxies of Various Morphological Types |type=PhD |publisher=[[Rijksuniversiteit Groningen]] |url=http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March05/Bosma/frames.html |access-date=December 30, 2016 |via=[[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The galaxy rotation problem is the discrepancy between observed galaxy rotation curves and the theoretical prediction, assuming a centrally dominated mass associated with the observed luminous material. When mass profiles of galaxies are calculated from the [[Spiral galaxy#Distribution of stars in spirals|distribution of stars in spirals]] and [[mass-to-light ratio]]s in the stellar disks, they do not match with the masses derived from the observed rotation curves and the [[law of gravity]]. A solution to this conundrum is to hypothesize the existence of [[dark matter]] and to assume its distribution from the galaxy's center out to its [[Dark matter halo|halo]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Though dark matter is by far the most accepted explanation of the rotation problem, other proposals have been offered with varying degrees of success. Of the [[Galaxy rotation curve#Alternatives to dark matter|possible alternatives]], the most notable is [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]] (MOND), which involves modifying the laws of gravity.&lt;ref name=Milgrom_Review&gt;For an extensive discussion of the data and its fit to MOND see {{cite arXiv |last=Milgrom |first=M. |year=2007 |title=The MOND Paradigm |eprint=0801.3133 |class=astro-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:Rubin vera f1.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Vera (Cooper) Rubin (born July 23, 1928) is an American astronomer who pioneered work on galaxy rotation curves. She uncovered what we call "Dark Matter".]] --&gt;

In 1932, [[Jan Oort|Jan Hendrik Oort]] became the first to report that measurements of the stars in the [[Solar neighborhood]] indicated that they moved faster than expected when a mass distribution based upon visible matter was assumed, but these measurements were later determined to be essentially erroneous.&lt;ref name="Oxford1999"&gt;{{cite book

Babcock's measurements turned out to disagree substantially with those found later, and the first measurement of an extended rotation curve in good agreement with modern data was published in 1957 by Henk van de Hulst and collaborators, who studied M31 with the newly commissioned Dwingeloo 25 meter telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van de Hulst |first=H.C et al|year=1957 |title=Rotation and density distribution of the Andromeda nebula derived from observations of the 21-cm line |journal=[[Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands]] |volume=14 |page=1 |bibcode=1957BAN....14....1V |bibcode-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A companion paper by Maarten Schmidt showed that this rotation curve could be fit by a flattened mass distribution more extensive than the light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmidt |first=M|year=1957 |title=Rotation and density distribution of the Andromeda nebula derived from observations of the 21-cm line |journal=[[Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands]] |volume=14 |page=17 |bibcode=1957BAN....14...17S |bibcode-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Louise Volders used the same telescope to demonstrate that the spiral galaxy [[Triangulum Galaxy|M33]] also does not spin as expected according to [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Volders |first=L. |year=1959 |title=Neutral hydrogen in M 33 and M 101 |journal=[[Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands]] |volume=14 |issue=492 |page=323 |bibcode=1959BAN....14..323V |bibcode-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on [[NGC 3115]], [[Jan Oort]] wrote that "the distribution of mass in the system appears to bear almost no relation to that of light... one finds the ratio of mass to light in the outer parts of NGC 3115 to be about 250".&lt;ref&gt;Oort, J.H.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[Vera Rubin]], an astronomer at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], worked with a new sensitive [[spectrograph]] that could measure the velocity curve of edge-on [[spiral galaxies]] to a greater degree of accuracy than had ever before been achieved.&lt;ref name="Rubin1970"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rubin |first=V. |last2=Ford |first2=W.

Rubin presented her results in an influential paper in 1980.&lt;ref name="Rubin1980"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rubin  |first=V. |last2=Thonnard |first2=N. |last3=Ford  |first3=W. K.

Although initially met with skepticism, Rubin's results have been confirmed over the subsequent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Persic |first=M. |last2=Salucci |first2=P. |last3=Stel |first3=F. |year=1996 |title=The universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies - I.

If [[Newtonian mechanics]] is assumed to be correct, it would follow that most of the mass of the galaxy had to be in the [[galactic bulge]] near the center and that the stars and gas in the disk portion should orbit the center at decreasing velocities with radial distance from the galactic center (the dashed line in Fig. 1).

Observations of the rotation curve of spirals, however, do not bear this out. Rather, the curves do not decrease in the expected inverse square root relationship but are "flat", i.e. outside of the central bulge the speed is nearly a constant (the solid line in Fig. 1). It is also observed that galaxies with a uniform distribution of luminous matter have a rotation curve that rises from the center to the edge, and most [[Low-surface-brightness galaxy|low-surface-brightness galaxies]] (LSB galaxies) have the same anomalous rotation curve.

The rotation curves might be explained by hypothesizing the existence of a substantial amount of matter permeating the galaxy that is not emitting light in the [[Mass-to-light ratio|mass-to-light]] ratio of the central bulge. The material responsible for the extra mass was dubbed "[[dark matter]]", the existence of which was first posited in the 1930s by Jan Oort in his measurements of the [[Oort constants]] and [[Fritz Zwicky]] in his studies of the masses of [[galaxy cluster]]s. The existence of [[cold dark matter|non-baryonic cold dark matter]] (CDM) is today a major feature of the [[Lambda-CDM model]] that describes the [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] of the [[universe]].

==Halo density profiles==
In order to accommodate a flat rotation curve, a density profile for a galaxy and its environs must be different than one that is centrally concentrated. Newton's version of [[Kepler's Third Law]] implies that the spherically symmetric, radial density profile {{math|''ρ''(''r'')}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(r) = \frac{v(r)^2 }{4 \pi G r^2}\left(1+2~ \frac{d\log~ v(r)}{d\log~ r}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''(''r'')}} is the radial orbital velocity profile and {{math|''G''}} is the [[gravitational constant]]. This profile closely matches the expectations of a [[singular isothermal sphere profile]] where if {{math|''v''(''r'')}} is approximately constant then the density {{math|''ρ'' ∝ ''r''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to some inner "core radius" where the density is then assumed constant. Observations do not comport with such a simple profile, as reported by Navarro, Frenk, and White in a seminal 1996 paper.&lt;ref name="NAVARROETAL1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Navarro |first1=J. F. |last2=Frenk |first2=C. S. |last3=White |first3=S. D. M. |year=1996 |title=The Structure of Cold Dark Matter Halos |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=463 |page=563 |arxiv=astro-ph/9508025 |bibcode=1996ApJ...462..563N |bibcode-access=free |doi=10.1086/177173 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors then remarked, that a "gently changing logarithmic slope" for a density profile function could also accommodate approximately flat rotation curves over large scales. They found the famous [[Navarro–Frenk–White profile]] which is consistent both with [[N-body simulations]] and observations given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho (r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{R_s}\left(1~+~\frac{r}{R_s}\right)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the central density, {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the scale radius, {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, are parameters that vary from halo to halo. Because the slope of the density profile diverges at the center, other alternative profiles have been proposed, for example, the [[Einasto profile]] which has exhibited better agreement with certain dark matter halo simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merritt |first1=D. |last2=Graham |first2=A. |last3=Moore |first3=B. |last4=Diemand |first4=J. |last5=Terzić |first5=B. |year=2006 |title=Empirical Models for Dark Matter Halos.

Observations of orbit velocities in spiral galaxies suggest a mass structure according to:  
:&lt;math&gt;v(r)= (r \, d\Phi/dr)^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;
with {{math|Φ}} the galaxy [[gravitational potential]].

Since observations of galaxy rotation do not match the distribution expected from application of Kepler's laws, they do not match the distribution of luminous matter.&lt;ref name=Rubin1980/&gt; This implies that spiral galaxies contain large amounts of dark matter or, in alternative, the existence of exotic physics in action on galactic scales. The additional invisible component becomes progressively more conspicuous in each galaxy at outer radii and among galaxies in the less luminous ones.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

Cosmology tells us that about 26% of the mass of the Universe is composed of [[dark matter]], a [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] type of [[matter]] which does not emit or interact with [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Dark matter dominates the gravitational potential of galaxies and cluster of galaxies. Galaxies are baryonic condensations of stars and gas (namely H and He) that lie at the centers of much larger dark haloes of dark matter, affected by a gravitational instability caused by primordial density fluctuations.

The main goal has become to understand the nature and the history of these ubiquitous dark haloes by investigating the properties of the  galaxies they contain (i.e. their luminosities, kinematics, sizes, and morphologies). The measurement of the kinematics (their positions, velocities and accelerations) of the observable stars and gas has become a tool to investigate the nature of dark matter, as to its content and distribution relative to that of the various baryonic components of those galaxies.

The rotational dynamics of galaxies are well characterized by their position on the [[Tully–Fisher relation]], which shows that for spiral galaxies the rotational velocity is uniquely related to its total luminosity. A consistent way to predict the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy is to measure its [[bolometric luminosity]] and then read its rotation rate from its location on the Tully–Fisher diagram. Conversely, knowing the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy gives its luminosity. Thus the magnitude of the galaxy rotation is related to the galaxy's visible mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yegorova |first1=I.

== Alternatives to dark matter ==

There have been a number of attempts to solve the problem of galaxy rotation by modifying gravity without invoking dark matter. One of the most discussed is [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]] (MOND), originally proposed by [[Mordehai Milgrom]] in 1983, which modifies the Newtonian force law at low accelerations to enhance the effective gravitational attraction. MOND has had a considerable amount of success in predicting the rotation curves of low-surface-brightness galaxies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S. S. McGaugh |author2=W. J.

Using data from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database, a group has found the radial acceleration traced by rotation curves could be predicted just from the observed baryon distribution (that is, including stars and gas but not dark matter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stacy McGaugh |author2=Federico Lelli |author3=Jim Schombert | title=The Radial Acceleration Relation in Rotationally Supported Galaxies  | date=2016 | arxiv=1609.05917 | journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=117 |issue=20 |pages=201101 | doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.117.201101 |pmid=27886485 |bibcode=2016PhRvL.117t1101M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same relation provided a good fit for 2693 samples in 153 rotating galaxies, with diverse shapes, masses, sizes, and gas fractions. Brightness in the near IR, where the more stable light from red giants dominates, was used to estimate the density contribution due to stars more consistently.  The results are consistent with MOND, and place limits on alternative explanations involving dark matter alone. However, cosmological simulations within a Lambda-CDM framework that include baryonic feedback effects reproduce the same relation, without the need to invoke new dynamics (such as MOND).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keller|first1=B. W.|last2=Wadsley|first2=J. W.|title=Λ                            is Consistent with SPARC Radial Acceleration Relation|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=23 January 2017|volume=835|issue=1|pages=L17|doi=10.3847/2041-8213/835/1/L17|bibcode=2017ApJ...835L..17K|arxiv = 1610.06183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a contribution due to dark matter itself can be fully predictable from that of the baryons, once the feedback effects due to the dissipative collapse of baryons is taken into account.

[[File:Club Bathbohouse.jpg|thumb|Gay bathhouse in the U.S.]]
A '''gay bathhouse''', also known as a '''gay sauna''' or a '''gay steambath''', is a commercial space for [[men who have sex with men|men to have sex with other men]]. In [[gay slang]], a bathhouse may be called just "the baths," "the sauna" or "the tubs". In general, a gay bath is mainly used for having [[sexual activity]] rather than only [[bathing]].&lt;ref name="Prior2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |date=2007 |page=121 |chapter=Baths, Public: III.&amp;#160;West, Middle Ages–Present |last=Prior |first=Jason |editor1-last=Malti‑Douglas |editor1-first=Fedwa |editor2-last=Choksy |editor2-first=Jamsheed K. |editor3-last=Roof |editor3-first=Judith |editor4-last=Sautman |editor4-first=Francesca Canadé |editor5-last=Jones |editor5-first=Sumie |editor6-last=Zhou |editor6-first=Liana |publisher=Thomson Gale |location=Farmington Hills, Michigan |volume=1:&amp;#160;A–C |isbn=978-0-02-865961-9 |lccn=2007020796 |oclc=894526708}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colker1994"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-10/local/me-32240_1_gay-bathhouse |title=Within the Walls of Gay Bathhouse Lies a World of Their Own |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1994-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222212010/http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-10/local/me-32240_1_gay-bathhouse |archive-date=2014-12-22 |dead-url=no |last=Colker |first=David |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all men who visit a gay bathhouse are considered [[homosexuality|gay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Woods|Binson|2003|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Gremore, "Straight guys in gay bathhouses? Yep, it happens. Former employee tells all," ''[[Quora]]'', August 10, 2017, https://www.queerty.com/straight-guys-gay-bathhouses-yep-happens-former-employee-tells-20170810.&lt;/ref&gt; Bathhouses offering similar services for women are rare, but some men's bathhouses occasionally have a "[[lesbian]]" or "women only" night.

Bathhouses vary considerably in size and amenities{{spnd}}from small establishments with 10 or 20 rooms and a handful of lockers to multi-story saunas with a variety of room styles or sizes and several steam baths, [[Jacuzzi]] tubs, and sometimes [[swimming pool]]s. Most have a steam room (or wet sauna), dry sauna, showers, lockers, and small private rooms.

Many bathhouses are, for legal reasons, "membership only", though membership is generally open to any [[Age of consent|adult]] who seeks it, usually after paying a small fee. Unlike [[brothel]]s, customers pay only for the use of the facilities. Sexual activity, if it occurs, is not provided by staff of the establishment but is between customers, and no money is exchanged. Many gay bathhouses, for legal reasons, explicitly prohibit or discourage [[prostitution]] and ban known prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Let's emphasize 'safe' part of safe sex |work=Plain Dealer (Cleveland) |date=July 21, 2006 |author=Regina Brett |quote=The Flex club opens in August.

Records of men meeting for sex with other men in bathhouses date back to the 15th century. A tradition of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records of [[Homosexuality in ancient Greece|homosexual activity in Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|De Bonneville|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western world|West]], gay men have been using bathhouses for sex since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when homosexual acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in homosexual acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, adult theaters, public lavatories ([[cottaging|cottages or tearooms]]), and gym changing rooms where they could meet other men for sex. Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex between patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet homosexual activity.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

===Early records===
; 1492 Florence
: In [[Florence]], [[Italy]], in 1492 there was a purge against the "vice of sodomy". The places used for homosexual acts were to be taverns, baths, and ''casini'' (sheds or houses used for illicit sex and gambling). The ''Eight of Watch'' (the city's leading criminal court) issued several [[decree]]s associated with [[sodomy]] and on April 11, 1492 they warned the managers of bathhouses to keep out "suspect boys" on penalty of a fine. In the short period from April 1492 to February 1494 they convicted 44 men for homosexual relations not involving violence or aggravating circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rocke|1998|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; 1876 Paris
: In France the first recorded [[police raid]] on a [[Paris]]ian bathhouse was in 1876 in the ''Bains de Gymnase'' on the ''Rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière''. Six men aged 14 to 22 were prosecuted for an ''offence against public decency'' and the manager and two employees for ''facilitating [[pederasty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Higgs|1999|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1903 New York
: In the [[United States]] on February 21, 1903, [[New York City Police|New York police]] conducted the first recorded raid on a gay bathhouse, the ''Ariston Hotel Baths''. 26 men were arrested and 12 brought to trial on sodomy charges; 7 men received sentences ranging from 4 to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref name=Chauncey&gt;{{harv|Chauncey|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- "Early" and "Modern" is the structure used by "Gay Bathhouses and Public Health Policy", see ref below --&gt;

In [[New York City]], the ''[[Everard Baths|Everard]]'' (nicknamed the ''Everhard'')&lt;ref name=Stein2004&gt;{{harv|Stein|2004|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; was converted from a church to a bathhouse in 1888 and was patronized by gay men before the 1920s and by the 1930s had a reputation as the "classiest, safest, and best known of the baths".&lt;ref name=neilmiller/&gt; It was damaged by fire on May 25, 1977, when nine men died and several others were seriously injured. The Everard closed in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/nyregion/4-new-york-bathhouses-still-operate-under-city-s-program-of-inspections.html |title=4 New York Bathhouses still operate under city's program of inspections |work=The New York Times |date=May 3, 1987 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |last=Bronstein |first=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also popular in the 1910s were the ''Produce Exchange Baths'' and the ''Lafayette Baths'' (403–405 Lafayette Street, which from 1916 was managed by [[Ira Gershwin|Ira]] &amp; [[George Gershwin]]). American [[:Category:Precisionism|precisionist]] painter [[Charles Demuth]] used the Lafayette Baths as his favourite haunt. His 1918 homoerotic self-portrait set in a [[Turkish bath]] is likely to have been inspired by it.&lt;ref name=neilmiller/&gt; The ''Penn Post Baths'' in a hotel basement (the  [[Penn Post Hotel]], 304 West 31st Street) was a popular gay location in the 1920s despite a seedy condition and the lack of private rooms.&lt;ref name=neilmiller&gt;{{harv|Miller|1995|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American composer [[Charles Griffes]] (1884–1920) wrote in his diaries about visits to the [[New York City]] bathhouses and the [[YMCA]]. His biography states: "So great was his need to be with boys, that though his home contained two pianos, he chose to practice at an instrument at the Y, and his favourite time was when the players were coming and going from their games."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gustav-Wrathall|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|When a friend with "little experience but great desire" confided his homosexual longings to Charles Griffes in 1916, Griffes took him to the Lafayette so that he could meet other gay men and explore his sexual interests in a supportive environment: the friend was "astounded and fascinated" by what he saw there. The baths also encouraged more advanced forms of sexual experimentation. Griffes himself had had his first encounter with a man interested in sadomasochism at the Lafayette two years earlier (he found the man "interesting" but the experience unappealing), and several men interviewed in the mid-1930s referred to experimenting in the baths and learning of new pleasures.&lt;ref name=Chauncey/&gt;|George Chauncey|Gay New York 1995}}

In [[London]], the Savoy Turkish Baths at 92 Jermyn Street became a favourite spot (opening in 1910 and remaining open until September 1975).&lt;ref name=Potvin2008&gt;{{citation |year=2008 |title=Material and visual cultures beyond male bonding, 1870–1914: bodies, boundaries and intimacy |first1=John |last1=Potvin |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=9780754656654 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KCxAAAAIAAJ |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist A.J. Langguth wrote: "...[The baths at Jermyn Street] represented a twilight arena for elderly men who came to sweat poisons from their systems and youths who came to strike beguiling poses in Turkish towels... although they were closely overseen by attendants, they provided a discreet place to inspect a young man before offering a cup of tea at [[J.

In the 1950s the [[Bermondsey]] Turkish Baths were rated by [[Kenneth Williams]] as "quite fabulous" in his diaries.&lt;ref name=houlbrook/&gt;
{{Quotation|''Steambaths in the 1930s: ''The steambaths that had been well known to me were those of East Ham, Greenwich and Bermondsey. In the first two it was frequently possible to indulge in what the Spartacus Guide coyly describes as 'action', but behaviour at all times had to be reasonably cautious.

===Modern gay bathhouses===
[[File:Crew Club - Washington, D.C..JPG|thumb|Crew Club, in the [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In the 1950s exclusively gay bathhouses began to open in the United States. Though subject to [[Vice squad|vice raids]], these bathhouses were "oases of homosexual camaraderie"&lt;ref name=History/&gt; and were, as they remain today, "places where it was safe to be gay",&lt;ref name=History/&gt; whether or not patrons themselves identified as homosexual. The gay baths offered a much safer alternative to [[public sex|sex in other public places]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In the late 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhouses{{spnd}}now primarily gay-owned and operated{{spnd}}became fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions. These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet and relax. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for [[Gay pride|Pride Day]] and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]], when some gay men, particularly those who had been rejected by their families due to their [[sexual orientation]], had nowhere else to go. The American writer [[Truman Capote]] was a regular at New York City baths in the 1970s, in particular the sauna at West 58th Street.&lt;ref name=TGM&gt;{{harv|Kaiser|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another service offered by the baths was [[voting|voter registration]]. In the run-up to the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 election]], the [[New St. Mark's Baths]] in New York City, with the assistance of the [[League of Women Voters]], conducted a voter registration drive on its premises.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In Australia, the first gay steam bath was opened in [[Sydney]] in 1967.

Gay [[saunas]], as they are more commonly known in Australia and New Zealand, were present in most large cities in those countries by the late 1980s. As homosexuality was [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986|decriminalised in New Zealand]] and [[LGBT rights in Australia#The gay rights movement|most Australian states]] during the 1970s and 1980s, there was no criminal conduct occurring on the premises of such "sex on site venues".

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] gay saunas were routinely raided by police up until the end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in [[Streatham]], the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Policing Gay Sex |journal=Gay Times |issue=138 |publisher=Millivres |date=March 1990 |issn=0950-6101}} 'The draconian sentence (six months jail and a £5,000 fine) on the owner and manager of Brownies sauna for keeping a [[disorderly house]] is a case in point'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sauna owner appeals against prison sentence |journal=Gay Times |issue=127 |publisher=Millivres |date=April 1989 |issn=0950-6101 |quote=‘There was also’, he said, an ‘element of corruption’. ‘Anyone who came off the street merely to take a sauna&amp;#160;... would be able to see what was going on and be invited to take part. The possibilities are quite devastating and the sentence must demonstrate society’s shock and horror at what was going on.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in [[Manchester]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Christian sect joins police attack on gay sauna |journal=Gay Times |issue=117 |publisher=Millivres |date=June 1988 |issn=0950-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CS286621807"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/keywordsearch.arc?queryKeywords=Raids+on+sauna+clubs |title=Raids on sauna clubs |work=The Times |date=15 March 1977 |last=Caswell |first=W.H. |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of [[Decency|gross indecency]] in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as [[homophobic]], and little [[public interest]] in [[victimless crime]], gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of [[Labouchere Amendment|gross indecency]], until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].

==Bathhouses today==
[[File:Sailors health club.jpg|thumb|Sailors leaflet in 1998]]

Gay bathhouses today continue to fill a similar function as they did historically. The community aspect has lessened in some territories, particularly those where gay men increasingly tend to [[Coming out|come out]].

Some men still use bathhouses as a convenient, safe place to meet other men for sex.&lt;ref&gt;"Guys Reveal Best.and Worst Bathhouse Experiences," ''[[Queerty]]'', February 7, 2016, https://www.queerty.com/guys-reveal-their-best-and-worst-bathhouse-experiences-20160207.&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where homosexuality is more accepted, safety may no longer be a primary attraction.

Many bathhouses are open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. There is typically a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry to those who are visibly [[drunk|intoxicated]], as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.

Sexual encounters at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some feel that the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse ''for''. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not.&lt;ref name=Shneer2006&gt;{{citation |year=2006 |title=American queer, now and then |editor1=David Shneer |editor2=Caryn Aviv |publisher=Paradigm Publishers |isbn=9781594511714 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lATaAAAAMAAJ |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bathhouses are still used by [[men who have sex with men]] and do not identify as gay or [[bisexuality|bisexual]], including those that are closeted or in [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] relationships.

In many bathhouses the customer has a choice between renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement that facilitates easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), some or all of the rooms are freely available to all patrons.

Some bathhouses have areas designed to facilitate impersonal sex. These areas{{spnd}}rooms or hallways{{spnd}}are illuminated only by a (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the [[Continental Baths]] in New York or the [[Club Baths]] in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]] for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.

Some men use the baths as a cheaper alternative to hotels,&lt;ref name="KLYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Best Places To Get Serviced With Zeal And Abandon |work=LA Weekly (California) |date=October 8, 2004 |author1=Ron Athey |author2=Vaginal Davis |page=39 |quote=Have you noticed that besides the deluxe safe-sex kits, every sauna we've visited has an on-site clinic for counseling and disease testing? Hopefully, they'll survive the current wave of attacks. The real survivor is the KLYT, having stayed open for almost an entire century as the Palace Turkish Baths... Nowadays, the KLYT is sexual in the day and at night they rent all the rooms (which are really just cubicles) to the homeless, which at $11 is cheaper than a hotel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the limitations of being potentially crowded public venues with only rudimentary rooms and limited or non-existent pass out privileges.

Bathhouses are not always identifiable as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the [[Rainbow flag (gay movement)|rainbow flag]], which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the [[gay press]] and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first [[television]] advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] in Melbourne promoted ''Wet on Wellington'', a sauna in [[Wellington Street, Collingwood|Wellington Street]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]].

==Layout and typical amenities==
On being buzzed in, the customer receives a towel (to wear, around the waist) and the key for his room or locker. The customer undresses, storing his clothing in the locker provided, and is then free to wander throughout the public areas of the bathhouse, which typically include the amenities of a traditional bathhouse or [[steambath]] ([[:it:File:Il bagno turco.JPG|Picture from the movie ''Hamam'']]).

Many bathhouses also provide free [[condoms]] and [[lubricant]].&lt;ref name=KLYT/&gt; Some establishments require a piece of identification or an item of value to be left with the front desk on entry. ''Homosexualities''&lt;ref name=Bell1979&gt;{{harv|Bell|1979|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of a towel: {{Quotation|Visiting a downtown gay bath was in many ways like revisiting a high-school gym – everyone wearing the same towel, in the same color, on the same part of the body. There was no status consciousness in the social-stratification sense; the towel or loincloth created a sort of equal-status social group.|a paragraph|Homosexualities, p239, 1979}}

Bathhouses are often designed with imagery and/or music to create surroundings that are arousing to the visitors.

Bathhouses are usually dimly lit and play music, although an outdoors, enclosed rooftop or pool area is not uncommon. They are often laid out in a manner that allows or encourages customers to wander throughout the establishment; a space laid out in this way is often referred to as a "maze".&lt;ref name="Woods GB"&gt;{{cite book |last=Woods |first=William J. |author2=Diane Binson |title=Gay Bathhouses and Public Health Policy |publisher=Haworth Press, {{ISBN|1560232730}} |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2MsjlZT1LcC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bathhouses have a space where random, anonymous sex is all that can occur. These spaces{{spnd}}rooms, hallways, or [[maze]]s, sometimes with [[glory hole (sexual slang)|glory holes]]{{spnd}}have as their only illumination a (dim) red "Exit" sign, so one can have sex but one cannot see with whom. Other clubs, such as the Continental Baths or the Club Baths of Washington, D.C., would have two or more bunk beds placed near each other, in a public area, thus providing a place to have sex for those who can afford only to rent a locker, and also maximizing the chances of being watched, for the [[exhibitionism|exhibitionists]] so inclined. Rooms are usually grouped together, as are lockers. Bathhouses are frequently decorated with posters of nude or semi-nude men, and sometimes explicit depictions of sex. It is not uncommon to see [[pornographic movie]]s playing on wall-mounted televisions throughout the bathhouse.

Most men typically just wear the towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, it is perfectly acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, is the first step in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or [[Fetish clothes|fetish-wear]], but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear [[flip flops]] or [[sandals]], sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an [[Rubber band|elastic band]] which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.&lt;ref name="Reynolds GM"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Robert |author2=Gerard Sullivan |title=Gay Men's Sexual Stories: Getting It! |publisher=Haworth Press, {{ISBN|1560233192}} |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5-5kyZ94LgC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some bathhouses require customers to purchase yearly memberships and many offer special entry rates to members, students, military, or other groups.&lt;ref name="Woods GB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bedfellows PPS"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bedfellows |first=Dangerous |author2=Ephen Glenn Colter |author3=Wayne Hoffman |author4=Eva Pendleton |author5=Alison Redick |author6=David Serlin |title=Policing Public Sex: Queer Politics and the Future of AIDS Activism |publisher=South End Press Press, {{ISBN|089608549X}} |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FqMoLytiNlUC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, bathhouses can restrict entrance to men of certain age ranges (apart from the general requirement of being an adult) or physical types, although in other places this would be considered illegal [[discrimination]]. Some bathhouses hold occasional "leather", "underwear", or other theme nights.

In the 1970s bathhouses began to install "fantasy environments" which recreated erotic situations that were illegal or dangerous:&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |last=Coronado |first=Eddie |title=The history of gay bathhouses |publisher=Gaytubs.com |url=http://www.gaytubs.com/ahistory.htm |accessdate=23 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020010356/http://gaytubs.com/ahistory.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|Orgy rooms . . . encouraged group sex, while glory holes recreated (public) toilets, and mazes took the place of bushes and undergrowth (in public parks).

==Etiquette==
Customers typically divide their time between the showers/saunas/jacuzzis and the main areas of the establishment. Customers who have rented rooms have free access to their room.

Customers who have rooms may leave their room doors open to signal that they are available for sex. An open door can also be an invitation for others to watch or join in sexual activity that is already occurring.

When a room is occupied only by a single person, some men will position themselves to suggest what they might like from someone joining them in the room: those who would like to be [[anal sex|penetrated anally]] ("bottoms") will sometimes lie face down on the bed with the door open, while those who prefer to penetrate others ("tops") or to receive [[fellatio]] might lie face up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/08.29.96/gay-bath-9635.html Both Sides Now]; Richard Sine; Metro: Silicon Valley's Weekly Newspaper; August 29&amp;#160;– September 4, 1996 issue. Retrieved 4 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the baths served as community spaces for gay men. Even now, some men choose to go to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Chauncey|1995|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.

In this highly sexualized environment a look or nod is frequently enough to express interest. In darkened areas of the establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or hot tubs (but not generally in the showers, toilets, hallways, gyms, café areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed. A shake of the head, or pushing away the other's hand, means that the attention is not welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bathhouseblues.com/bathhouse_etiquette.html Bathhouse Etiquette].

Some establishments allow or encourage sex in specific group sex areas. In some jurisdictions such activity is prohibited, and sex must be confined to private rooms. Some forbid sex in pools for hygiene reasons. In the United Kingdom, the requirement is often set by the local authority's Environmental Health department{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

==High-risk behavior==

===Sexually transmitted diseases===
[[File:Pleasuredrome condoms.jpg|thumb|250px|Pleasuredrome condoms]]
From the mid-1980s onward there was lobbying against gay bathhouses blaming them for being a [[focus of infection]] encouraging the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), in particular [[HIV]], and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions (see Legal issues, below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/14/nyregion/bathhouses-reflect-aids-concerns.html |title=Bathhouses reflect AIDS concerns |work=The New York Times |date=October 14, 1985 |accessdate=26 December 2006 |last=Gross |first=Jane |quote=At the St. Marks Baths, for the price of a locker or a room, patrons now get a free condom, enclosed in a package that bears the legend ''the contents of this envelope could save your life.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Woods|Binson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, fears about the spread of STDs have prompted the closing of bathhouses{{spnd}}with their private rooms{{spnd}}in favour of [[sex club]]s, in which all sexual activity takes place in the open, and can be observed by monitors whose job it is to enforce safe-sex practices. However, proponents of bathhouses point out that closing these facilities does not prevent people from engaging in unsafe sex.&lt;ref name="Woods GB"/&gt;

Neither the claim that bathhouses are responsible for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, nor the claim that they are not, has been conclusively proved, but it is known that STDs are spread via [[unprotected sex]], and as part of their membership agreement, or as a condition of entry, some bathhouses now require customers to affirm in writing that they will only practice [[safe sex]] on the premises, and venues frequently provide free [[condom]]s, [[latex glove]]s, and [[sexual lubricant|lubrication]] (and/or have them available for purchase).&lt;ref name="Woods GB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard Sine"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sine |first=Richard |title=Both Sides Now: The South Bay's only gay bathhouse profits while promoting protected sex. Bathhouse opponents wonder if casual sex can really be safe. |publisher=Metro Active |date=August 29, 1996 |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/08.29.96/gay-bath-9635.html |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand and Australia, the [http://www.nzaf.org.nz/ New Zealand AIDS Foundation] and constituent members of the [http://www.afao.org.au/ Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations] provide safe sex information for sex on site venue users.

Some anti-bathhouse activists argue that these measures are not enough, especially given that it is virtually impossible to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, they point out that they may be less likely to engage in anal or multipartner sex{{spnd}}both of which put participants at risk for contracting STDs{{spnd}}in such situations.&lt;ref&gt;Santana, Hedimo and Richters, Juliet: ''Sites of Sexual Activities among Men. Sex-on-premises venues in Sydney'', Monograph 5/1998, National Centre in HIV [[Social research]], Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

Others counter these claims by pointing out that bathhouses are a major source of safer sex information{{spnd}}they provide pamphlets and post safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room as well as in the common areas), provide free condoms and lubricants, and often require patrons to affirm that they will only have safer sex on the premises. In cities with larger gay populations, STD and [[HIV test]]ing and counseling may be offered on-site for no charge.&lt;ref name="Alex Westerfelt "&gt;{{cite web|last=Westerfelt |first=Alex |title=Bathhouse Norms: What goes on in the Bathhouse? |publisher=Healthy Living |date=August 2005 |url=http://www.4healthyliving.org/05aug.htm |accessdate=10 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305045451/http://4healthyliving.org/05aug.htm/ |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharon Bernstein"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bernstein |first=Sharon |title=Rising Rate of HIV Infection Renews Bathhouse Debate |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 23, 2004 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/23/local/me-bathhouse23 |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-5752.html |title=NHS to hold STI testing in gay sauna |work=Pink News |date=October 15, 2007 |accessdate=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QX758"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://viewer.zmags.com/showmag.php?mid=rqqwpg#/page44 |title=QX Magazine London Issue 758 |journal=QX Magazine London |issue=758 |date=September 17, 2009 |publisher=QX |page=44 |accessdate=25 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126013815/http://viewer.zmags.com/showmag.php?mid=rqqwpg#/page44 |archivedate=26 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs and alcohol===
In some countries bathhouses are prohibited from selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license may be required to submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do not{{spnd}}or cannot{{spnd}}regulate the consumption of drugs (typically [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[poppers]], [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], [[cocaine]], and [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]]) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people more likely to engage in unsafe sex.&lt;ref name="Nichols MAA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=Eve K. |title=Mobilizing Against AIDS: The Authoritative Edition from the Institute of Medicine; Academy of Sciences |publisher=Harvard University Press; {{ISBN|0674577620}} |year=1989 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-h3_h0WK6QC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex clubs with no private areas potentially find it easier to regulate consumption of drugs on their premises.

The use of [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] is also known to lead to riskier sexual behaviour, but since gay crystal meth users tend to seek out other users to engage in sexual activity, they often prefer to make such arrangements via the internet.&lt;ref name="Honigsbaum2005"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/26/aids.usa |title=Special report: West Side story: a tale of unprotected sex which could be link to new HIV superbug |work=The Observer |date=26 March 2005 |last=Honigsbaum |first=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowe2007&gt;{{cite web |title=Meth Use Among Gay Men Decreasing; Other Drug Use Holding Steady |last=Rowe |first=Aaron |date=26 July 2007 |publisher=Wired News |accessdate=22 October 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/07/meth-and-gay-se/ |quote=Researchers from the [[San Francisco]] Department of Public Health report that meth use among men who have sex with men has decreased over the past three years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution===
In some countries straight and gay bathhouses are used by [[rent boy]]s to find customers by offering massage services, the "complete service" is often used as a euphemism for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Aggleton|1999|pp=116–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation |All interviewees were asked whether or not they used condoms, and all with the exception of Fabian, said they used them when having penetrative sex with clients.

; Toronto bathhouse raids of 1981
{{Main article|Operation Soap}}
: On February 5, 1981, 150 police raided four gay bathhouses in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]: the Club Baths, the ''Romans II Health and Recreation Spa'', the ''Richmond Street Health Emporium'', and ''The Barracks''. The ''Richmond Health Emporium'' was so badly damaged in the raid that it never reopened. Nicknamed ''Operation Soap'', the raid resulted in the arrests of 268 men. There was an immediate and angry response from both the gay and lesbian community and over 3,000 people gathered in protest. A second demonstration which took place on February 20, included over 4,000 people who gathered at Queen's Park and marched to Metro Toronto Police's 52 Division.&lt;ref name="Gulliver HA"/&gt;

===United States===
In [[California]] the "[[Consenting Adult Sex Bill]]", passed in January 1976, made gay bathhouses and the sex that took place within them legal for the first time. During the 1970s, the two most popular gay bathhouses in San Francisco, both located in the [[South of Market, San Francisco, California|SOMA]] neighborhood, were the ''Ritch Street Health Club'' at 330 Ritch St., the interior of which was designed like a [[Minoan palaces|Minoan palace]], and ''The Barracks'', a [[BDSM]] bathhouse at 72 Hallam near Folsom in which each room was designed to accommodate a different BDSM [[sexual fantasy]]. In 1978 a group of police officers raided the ''Liberty Baths'' in the [[Polk Gulch]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]] and arrested three patrons for "lewd conduct in a public place", but the District Attorney's office soon dropped the charges against them.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; In 1984, however, fear of [[AIDS]] caused the [[San Francisco]] [[Health department]], with the support of some gay activists such as [[Randy Shilts]], and against the opposition of other gay activists, to ask the courts to close gay bathhouses in the city. The court, under Judge Roy Wonder, instead issued a [[court order]] that limited sexual practices and disallowed renting of private rooms in bathhouses, so that sexual activity could be monitored, as a public health measure. Some of the bathhouses tried to live within the strict rules of this court order, but many of them felt they could not easily do business under the new rules and closed. Eventually, the few remaining actual bathhouses succumbed to either economic pressures or the continuing legal pressures of the city and finally closed. Several sex clubs, which were not officially bathhouses, continued to operate indefinitely and operate to this day, though following strict rules under the court order and city regulations. Bathhouses themselves, however, operate just outside the city, thus outside of their laws, such as in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

In 1985, the [[New York City]] Health Department ordered that the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, heterosexual sex clubs such as [[Plato's Retreat]] had to shut down as well because the city had just passed a [[gay rights]] ordinance, and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments would have been a violation of that ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wmob.com/artpages/platos1.html |title=Swinging doors shut: City probe KO's Plato's |work=Daily News |accessdate=8 November 2007 |last=Golubski |first=Suzanne |last2=Kappstatter |first2=Bob |location=New York |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043031/http://www.wmob.com/artpages/platos1.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2010 ten patrons and one employee were arrested during a [[police raid]] at Club Dallas in [[Texas]].  The patrons were charged with either [[public lewdness]] or [[indecent exposure]] while the employee was charged with interfering with the police. The [[Dallas Police Department]]'s liaison to the gay community stated that their actions were in response to a complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dallasvoice.com/11-arrested-raid-club-dallas-1048387.html|title=11 arrested in raid at Club Dallas|language=en-us|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- please check Continental Baths page before extending further --&gt;
Singer [[Bette Midler]] is well known for getting her start at the famous Continental Baths in New York City in the early 1970s, where she earned the nickname Bathhouse Betty. It was there, accompanied by pianist [[Barry Manilow]] (who, like the bathhouse patrons, sometimes wore only a white towel&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''The History of Gay Bathhouses.'' Online. Retrieved February 23, 2004. Available: {{cite web|url=http://www.gaytubs.com/ahistory.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 23, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020010356/http://gaytubs.com/ahistory.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=October 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), that she created her stage persona "the Divine Miss M."

On getting her start in bathhouses, Midler has remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days [when I got my start singing at the gay bathhouses]. I feel like I was at the forefront of the [[Gay Liberation|gay liberation movement]], and I hope I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.houstonvoice.com |title=Bette Midler |work=Houston Voice |date=October 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other famous performers who appeared at the Continental include [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Melba Moore]], [[Labelle]], [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]], and [[Wayland Flowers]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

There are '''grooves''' ({{lang-sv|sliprännor}}, {{lang|sv|slipskåror}}. Sw-En translation: ''sharpening grooves'') carved into rock in many places in Europe, and some of them appear on the [[Baltic Sea]] island of [[Gotland]]. They are common in France, where they were used to polish [[stone axe]]s.

In Sweden, there are also grooves in north-western [[Scania]] and [[Halland]]. In [[Gantofta]] located {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Helsingborg]] a face of sandstone rock is engraved with thousands of grooves. Local tradition says they were made as [[Sharpening stone|whetstones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1930talet/1936_129.pdf|first=Torsten|last=Mårtensson|title=Sliprännornas praktiska bruk|journal=[[Fornvännen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grooves in France date from the [[Neolithic]] and are called ''polissoirs''. Those in  [[Aube|l’Aube]] date from c. 2500 to 2000 BCE. People who built [[dolmen]]s, erected [[menhir]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and made grooves supported an [[archaeological culture]] known as [[Seine-Oise-Marne culture|Seine-Oise-Marne]]. The l’Aube district had more than 130 monuments from this period including 49 grooves before 1927. Today there are only 34 including 16 grooves. Many stones were cut into roadstones or building blocks for homes.

Grooves have also been found in [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]] in Finland and in Luxembourg, as well as at [[Fyfield Down]] in England.

Neolithic Grooves have been found in Tamil Nadu, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Subramanian |first=TS |date=21 July 2016 |title=Footprints of Neolithic age  |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/Footprints-of-Neolithic-age/article14500973.ece|newspaper=The Hindu |location= |access-date=21 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Subramanian |first=TS |date=3 April 2013 |title=Bedrock on which Neolithic man sharpened stone tools found in T.N.  |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bedrock-on-which-neolithic-man-sharpened-stone-tools-found-in-tn/article4575216.ece|newspaper=The Hindu |location= |access-date=21 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gotland ==
3,600 grooves have been discovered on [[Gotland]],&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gannholm|first=Sören|trans-title=The Gotlandic grinding grooves – Stone age calendars?|url=http://stavar.stavgard.com/gotlslipsk/slipskaror.html|title=Gotlands slipskåror|publisher=Sören Gannholm|date=1993|isbn=91-630-1845-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 700 are in [[limestone]] outcrops, while the remainder are on c. 800 boulders and slabs. The grooves are {{convert|50|–|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, c. {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep and c. {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}wide.&lt;ref name="HenrikssonAstro"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Fornvännen]]|author=Henriksson, Göran |title=Astronomisk tolkning av slipskåror på Gotland|year=1983|url=http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1980talet/1983_021.pdf|publisher=[[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grooves began to attract scholarly attention in the 1850s. At first they were called "sharpening stones", but later they received the name "sword sharpening stones". After some time, newspapers and scholarly publications began to dispute this, since the shape of the grooves makes them unfit for sharpening swords. Another reason was that by 1933, more than 500 sites with grooves had been identified on Gotland. They were evenly distributed across the island. It was also noted that they ran in different directions and often crossed each other.

The dates and function of the grooves on Gotland have seen debate in recent decades between archaeologists who argue for a [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval date]] and some industrial function,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swanström|first=Lennart|date=1995|title=Slipskåror och järnhantering på Gotland|journal=Gotländskt arkiv|issue=67|location=Visby|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindström|first=Jonathan|date=1997|chapter=Fornlämningarnas orientering på Gotland: en kritisk granskning av den arkeoastronomiska tolkningen av slipskåror samt en studie av riktningsfördelningen hos öns forntida gravar, hus och medeltida kyrkor|title=Till Gunborg: arkeologiska samtal|publisher=Dept of Archaeology, [[Stockholm University]]|pages=497–508|editor1-first=Gunborg O.|editor1-last=Janzon|editor2-first=Agneta|editor2-last=Åkerlund|location=Stockholm|series=SAR : Stockholm archaeological reports, 1101-3087 ; 33|isbn=91-630-6053-1|id={{LIBRIS|7452427}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proponents of an alternative theory who argue for a [[Neolithic]] date and a ritual calendar function. The latter support their view mainly with the idea that the direction of each groove might be given an astronomical interpretation, where each groove would mark a sightline towards a certain celestial phenomenon that may be reconstructed for a certain year during the [[Stone Age]].&lt;ref name="HenrikssonAstro" /&gt; The grooves under overhangs in Scania cannot have been used as sightlines in this suggested manner.

Certain late 1st-millennium [[picture stone]]s on Gotland carry grooves that have been made after the relief of the stones was carved, which show the grooves to be late. Likewise with the level above current sea surface of the lowest grooved outcrops on the island, that shows them to be no older than AD&amp;nbsp;1000 judging from post-glacial shoreline displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munthe|first=Henr|chapter=Om Gotlands s.k.

The '''Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis''' (1965 to 1991) pioneered early [[cartography|cartographic]] and architectural computer applications that led to integrated [[GIS|geographic information systems]] (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/81657/859797671-MIT.pdf?sequence=2 |format=PDF |title=Stratified, Destratified, and Hybrid GIS: Organizing a Cross-Disciplinary Territory for Design |publisher=Dspace.mit.edu |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the Laboratory's influential programs included SYMAP, SYMVU, GRID, CALFORM, and POLYVRT.  The Laboratory's Odyssey project created a [[geographic information system]] that served as a milestone in the development of integrated mapping systems.&lt;ref&gt;Chrisman, Nick, [http://downloads2.esri.com/ESRIpress/images/82/HarvardBLAD_screen.pdf "Charting the Unknown: How Computer Mapping At Harvard Became GIS"], ESRI (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory influenced numerous computer graphic, mapping and architectural systems such as [[Intergraph]], [[Computervision]], and [[Esri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cga-download.hmdc.harvard.edu/publish_web/CGA_Conferences/2015_Lab_Legacy/2015_CGA_Conference_Program.pdf |format=PDF |title=CGA Conference 2015 |publisher=Cga-download.hmdc.harvard.edu |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
In 1963, during a training session held at [[Northwestern University]], [[Chicago]] architect [[Howard T. Fisher]] encountered computer maps on [[urban planning]] and [[civil engineering]] produced by Edgar Horwood's group at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1979/1/26/howard-fisher-gsd-proffessor-dies-at/|title=Howard Fisher, GSD Proffessor, Dies at 75|work=thecrimson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fisher conceived a computer mapping software program, SYMAP (Synergistic Mapping), to produce conformant, proximal, and contour maps on a line printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Health Based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and their Applications | pmc=4315644 | pmid=25684850 | doi=10.5455/aim.2014.22.402-405 | volume=22 | year=2014 | journal=Acta Inform Med | pages=402–5 | last1 = Fradelos | first1 = EC | last2 = Papathanasiou | first2 = IV | last3 = Mitsi | first3 = D | last4 = Tsaras | first4 = K | last5 = Kleisiaris | first5 = CF | last6 = Kourkouta | first6 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fisher applied for a [[Ford Foundation]] grant to explore thematic mapping based on early SYMAP outputs, which was awarded in 1965.  In association with [[Harvard University|Harvard]] providing facilities in Robinson Hall in [[Harvard Yard]] as part of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Graduate School of Design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/projects/when-the-gsd-designed-software-experiments-in-computer-vision.html|title=Harvard Graduate School of Design  - Homepage|work=Harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ford Foundation provided $294,000 over three years to seed the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics.  Working with programmer Betty Benson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gisandscience.com/2009/11/17/charting-the-unknown-how-computer-mapping-at-harvard-became-gis/|title=Charting the Unknown: How Computer Mapping at Harvard Became GIS|work=GIS and Science|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher completed SYMAP for distribution in 1966.  Also under Fisher's direction, SYMVU and GRID programs were developed.  A 1968 reorganisation followed Fisher reaching Harvard's mandatory retirement age and led to renaming as the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis.  From 1972, the Laboratory was based in Graduate School's newly built Gund Hall.

The Laboratory's original and continuing goals were:
# To design and develop computer software for the analysis and graphic display of spatial data.
# To distribute the resulting software to governmental agencies, educational organizations and interested professionals.
# To conduct research concerning the definition and analysis of spatial structure and process."&lt;ref&gt;LAB-LOG 1978, Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard University (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major research outputs==
[[File:SYMAP - LAB-LOG 1980.png|thumb|SYMAP - comparison of conformant, contour, proximal, and trend surface outputs]]SYMAP's ability to print cheap, albeit low quality, maps using readily available technology led to rapid adoption in the late 1960s.  SYMVU software, developed in 1969 to illustrate surface displays, was another popular product.  GRID, CALFORM, and POLYVRT products further explored the raster versus vector approach to mapping.  The Laboratory gained a reputation for solid output leading to several commercially successful projects and significant budgetary independence for a [[research institute]].  Some struggles with restructuring Geographic Base Files - Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF-DIME files, an early vector and polygonal data structure) for the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau's]] Urban Atlas in 1975 inspired the Laboratory to develop an integrated suite of programs beneath by a common user interface and common data manipulation software.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Allan H, "Shareable Data Bases Key For Effective Mapmaking", Computerworld, 8 May 1978, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978 this suite became the Odyssey project.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Anne M, "A New ODYSSEY Begun", Context #10", Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard College (1979), pages 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Odyssey project's aim was to produce a vector GIS that provided [[spatial analysis]] of many different forms within a single system.

As of 1980, in addition to early Odyssey modules, the Laboratory sold the following programs for display and analysis of spatial data&lt;ref&gt;LAB-LOG 1980, Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard College (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ASPEX - 3d data perspectives;
* CALFORM - shaded vector maps;
* DOT.MAP - contour, shaded, and dot-distribution maps from gridded data;
* KWIC - key-word-in-context programs for indexing bibliographic references;
* POLYVRT - data conversion and analysis of polygonal data;
* SYMAP - line printer mapping producing conformant (areas), contour, trend surface, and proximal (also known as [[Voronoi diagram]] or Thiessan polygonal)
* GIMMS (Geographic Information Management and Mapping System) - a general purpose mapping system written by Tom Waugh at the [[University of Edinburgh]];
* MDS(X) - a multidimensional pattern detection and scaling system under the direction of Tony Coxon at the [[Cardiff University|University of Cardiff]].

The 1982 release of Odyssey included seven programs for geographical analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics:a Poster Exhibit|url= http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic39008.files/History_LCG.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Isites.harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the Laboratory's software, it was written in [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] and operated on several platforms. The POLYPS and PRISM modules could draw maps on a variety of vector display devices.
* PROTEUS - editing, projections, generalization, aggregation, simple display;
* CYCLONE - topological checking of nodes, error correction;
* CYCLOPS - topological checking of polygons, produce graphics shape files;
* WHIRLPOOL - planar enforcement: overlay, error detection of input;
* CALYPSO - attribute manipulations (areal interpolation);
* POLYPS - planar choropleth maps;
* PRISM - raised 3d prism maps.

==Activities==
The Laboratory distributed software, and later data, at cost, thus encouraging experimentation.  The Laboratory conducted correspondence courses, hosted numerous conferences, and worked on environmental planning and architectural projects with the Harvard Graduate School of Design.  From 1978 to 1983, the Laboratory hosted a popular annual Harvard Computer Graphics Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/ExhTWO/Harvard/general.pdf |format=PDF |title=Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis |publisher=Vasulka.org |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Geoffrey Dutton, a Research Associate at the Laboratory from 1969 through 1984, created the first holographic thematic map, "America Graph Fleeting" in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?term=holographic&amp;module=objects&amp;type=keyword&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;page=5&amp;kv=71277&amp;record=208&amp;module=objects|title=MIT Museum|work=Mit.edu|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rotating strip of 3,000 holograms depicted an animated sequence of 3d maps showing US population growth from 1790 to 1970, generated by the Laboratory's ASPEX program. Dutton also contributed the program DOT.MAP to the Laboratory's family of distributed software (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Extensible Approach to Imagery of Gridded Data|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/563858.563886|publisher = ACM|journal = SIGGRAPH '77 Proceedings|date = 1977|location = New York, NY, USA|pages = 159–169|doi = 10.1145/563858.563886|first = Geoffrey|last = Dutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1977 James Dougenik, Duane Niemeyer, and Nicholas Chrisman developed contiguous area cartograms.&lt;ref&gt;"Context 1982-83", Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard University Graduate School of Design, Harvard College (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bruce Donald]], working at the Laboratory from 1978 to 1984, wrote BUILDER, a program for computer-aided architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Bruce, "BUILDER: A Database and Display Program for Computer-aided Architectural Design" (a system for representation and display of design problems in architecture and urban design), Harvard Computer Graphics Conference, Session 17, Architectural Practice (27 July 27, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cs.duke.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.duke.edu/brd/Historical/hlcg/ |title=Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics |publisher=Cs.duke.edu |date=1982-07-27 |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BUILDER produced plan and shaded perspectives that popularised computer-aided-design in architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/brd/Historical/hlcg/|title=Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics|work=cs.duke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.duke.edu/brd/papers/index.html#Builder|title=Bruce R.

The early period of the Laboratory saw staff numbers grow to approximately 40 in 1970, but shrink to half a dozen by 1972 as grants expired.  The Odyssey project grew the Laboratory from about 12 people in 1977&lt;ref&gt;LAB-LOG 1977, Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard College (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; to forty people by 1981.  The Laboratory shrank significantly back to approximately half a dozen people from 1982 until its closure in June 1991.

==Later period and influence==
From 1979 the Laboratory was encouraged to develop external software sales and entered into licensing agreements for this purpose, most notably with Synercom and ISSCO Corporation (sold to [[Computer associates|Computer Associates]] in 1987) for Odyssey.  However, the licensing agreements had weak to non-existent technology exploitation and non-compete clauses, so potential purchasers were frustrated in attempting to license from a competitor often preferentially positioning its proprietary software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~gisteac/ilw/generic_resources/books_and_papers/Thx1ARTICLE.pdf |format=PDF |title=The History of GIS |publisher=Geos.ed.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Potential purchasers often redeveloped Odyssey functions rather than wait for licenses.  Meanwhile, having carved out the potential commercial interests, from 1981 the Harvard Graduate School of Design sought less commercial work and an increased focus on research, though with reduced budgets.

[[File:La Ritirata.jpg|thumb|280px|Performance on [[#Early instruments|period instrument]]s is a key aspect of HIP, such as this [[baroque orchestra]] (Photo: [[Josetxu Obregón]] and the Spanish ensemble La Ritirata)]]
'''Historically informed performance''' (also referred to as '''period performance''', '''authentic performance''', or '''HIP''') is an approach to the performance of [[Western classical music|classical music]], which aims to be faithful to the approach, manner and style of the [[musical era]] in which a work was originally conceived.

It is based on two key aspects: the application of the stylistic and technical aspects of performance, known as '''performance practice'''; and the use of '''[[#Early instruments|period instrument]]s''' which may be reproductions of historical instruments that were in use at the time of the original composition and which usually have different [[timbre]] and [[temperament (music)|temperament]].{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

Because no [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]]s exist of music before the modern era, historically informed performance is necessarily derived from academic [[Musicology|musicological research]]. Historical [[treatise]]s, as well as additional historical evidence, are used to gain insight into the performance practice of a historic era. HIP performers will normally base their interpretations on scholarly or [[urtext edition]]s of a musical score, unencumbered with suggestions or changes made by editors in later eras.{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

Historically informed performance can trace its roots to the late 19th century, but was principally developed in a number of Western countries in the late 20th century. Initially mainly concerned with the performance of [[Medieval music|Medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], and [[Baroque music]], it has since come to encompass music from the [[Classical music era|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] eras as well. The practice has been a crucial part of the [[Early music revival]] movement of the 20th and 21st centuries. Quite recently, the phenomenon has begun to affect the theatrical stage, for instance in the production of [[Baroque opera]], where historically informed approaches to acting and scenery are also used.&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Mary|editor1-last=Greenwald|editor1-first=Helen M.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Opera|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199714841|pages=606–8|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LOFvBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA608&amp;dq=Historically%20informed%20performance%20opera%20theatre&amp;pg=PA608#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 March 2018|language=en|chapter=27. Historically informed performance}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

There are some critics who contest the methodology of the HIP movement, contending that its selection of practices and aesthetics are a product of the 20th century and that it is ultimately impossible to know what performances of an earlier time sounded like. For this reason, the term "historically informed" is now preferred to "authentic", as it acknowledges the limitations of academic understanding, rather than implying absolute accuracy in recreating historical performance style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fabian|first1=Dorottya|title=The Meaning of Authenticity and The Early Music Movement: A Historical Review|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284522166_The_Meaning_of_Authenticity_and_The_Early_Music_Movement_A_Historical_Review|accessdate=3 March 2018|date=1 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter" /&gt;

[[File:Edinburgh St Cecilia's Hall.jpg|thumb|Historical collections of preserved instruments help researchers ([[St Cecilia's Hall]], [[Edinburgh]])]]
The choice of musical instruments is an important part of the principle of historically informed performance. Musical instruments have evolved over time, and instruments that were in use in earlier periods of history were often quite different to their modern equivalents. Many other instruments have fallen out of use, having been replaced by newer tools for creating music. For example, prior to the emergence of the modern [[violin]], other bowed stringed instruments such as the [[rebec]] or the [[viol]] were in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silvela|first1=Zdenko|title=A New History of Violin Playing: The Vibrato and Lambert Massart's Revolutionary Discovery|date=2001|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=9781581126679|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gXqBVbWm6tkC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=violin%20evolved%20from%20rebec&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of ancient instruments in museum collections has helped musicologists to understand how the different design, tuning and tone of instruments may have affected earlier performance practice.{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=18-19}}

As well as a research tool, historic instruments have an active role in the practice of historically informed performance. Modern instrumentalists who aim to recreate a historic sound often use modern reproductions of period instruments (and occasionally original instruments) on the basis that this will deliver a musical performance that is thought to be historically faithful to the original work, as the original composer would have heard it. For example, a modern music ensemble staging a performance of music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] may play reproduction [[Baroque violin]]s instead of modern instruments in an attempt to create the sound of a 17th-century [[Baroque orchestra]].{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=18-19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schippers|first1=Huib|title=Facing the Music: Shaping Music Education from a Global Perspective|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199701933|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yYzW0ujEsIC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=period%20instruments%20authentic%20performance&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led to the revival of musical instruments that had entirely fallen out of use, and to a reconsideration of the role and structure of instruments also used in current practice.{{Original research inline|date=March 2018}}

Orchestras and ensembles who are noted for their use of period instruments in performances include the [[Taverner Consort and Players]] (directed by [[Andrew Parrott]]), the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] ([[Christopher Hogwood]]), [[The English Concert]] ([[Trevor Pinnock]]), the [[English Baroque Soloists]] (Sir [[John Eliot Gardiner]]), [[Musica Antiqua Köln]] ([[Reinhard Goebel]]), the [[Australian Brandenburg Orchestra]] ([[Paul Dyer]]) and [[La Chapelle Royale]] ([[Philippe Herreweghe]]).&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Nick|title=The Art of Re-enchantment: Making Early Music in the Modern Age|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199939930|page=76|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fWgBAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=The%20Taverner%20Choir%2C%20Consort%20%26%20Players&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard-gardiner"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Waleson|first1=Heidi|title=Super-conductor: John Eliot Gardiner|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vgcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=English%20Baroque%20Soloists%20period%20instruments&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=7 September 1996|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knights|first1=F.|title=A farewell to Musica Antiqua Koln|journal=Early Music|date=1 February 2013|volume=41|issue=1|pages=173–174|doi=10.1093/em/cas166|url=https://academic.oup.com/em/article-abstract/41/1/173/353400|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en|issn=0306-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippe Herreweghe|url=https://www.concertgebouworkest.nl/en/philippe-herreweghe|website=www.concertgebouworkest.nl|publisher=Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the scope of historically informed performance has expanded to encompass the works of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]], the specific sound of 19th-century instruments has increasingly been recognised in the HIP movement, and period instruments orchestras such as Gardiner's [[Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique]] have emerged.&lt;ref name="npr-gardiner"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Eliot Gardiner's Historical Beethoven At Carnegie Hall|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/15/142340577/john-eliot-gardiners-historical-beethoven|website=NPR|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306121647/https://www.npr.org/2011/11/15/142340577/john-eliot-gardiners-historical-beethoven|archivedate=6 March 2018|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harpsichord===
[[File:Cembalo-Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg-2000.532+2.tif|thumb|Harpsichord by [[Pascal Taskin]], [[Paris]] (1780)  ([[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]])]]
A variety of once obsolete keyboard instruments such as the [[clavichord]] and the [[harpsichord]] have been revived as they have particular importance in the performance of Early music. Before the evolution of the symphony orchestra led by a [[Conductor (music)|conductor]], Renaissance and Baroque orchestras were commonly directed from the harpsichord; the director would lead by playing [[Basso continuo|continuo]], which would provide a steady, harmonic structure upon which the other instrumentalists would embellish their parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harpsichord - Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|url=http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/harpsichord/|website=Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306230901/http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/harpsichord/|archivedate=6 March 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kottick|first1=Edward L.|title=A History of the Harpsichord|date=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253341663|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uexrDtt7JKEC&amp;lpg=PA469&amp;dq=harpsichord%20baroque%20orchestra&amp;pg=PA469#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious works of the era made similar use of the [[pipe organ]], often in combination with a harpsichord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moses|first1=Don V.|last2=Jr|first2=Robert W.

Composers such as [[François Couperin]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] wrote for the harpsichord, clavichord, and organ.

Among the foremost modern players of the harpsichord are [[Robert Hill (musician)|Robert Hill]], [[Igor Kipnis]], [[Ton Koopman]], [[Wanda Landowska]], [[Gustav Leonhardt]], [[Trevor Pinnock]], [[Skip Sempé]], [[Andreas Staier]], and [[Colin Tilney]].

===Fortepiano===
During the second half of the 18th century, the harpsichord was gradually replaced by the [[fortepiano]], a precursor to the modern piano. As the harpsichord went out of fashion, many were destroyed; indeed, the Paris Conservatory is notorious for having used harpsichords for firewood during the [[French Revolution]] and Napoleonic times.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Boekelheide, "[http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/10982.html Making Way for Beautiful Music]", ''USC News'' (2 October 2005, accessed 20 January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th and 21st centuries, the fortepiano has enjoyed a revival as a result of the trend for historically informed performance, with the works of Beethoven and Schubert being played on fortepiano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haskell|first1=Harry|title=The Early Music Revival: A History|date=1988|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486291628|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bGG22O24ObAC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Historically%20informed%20performance%20fortepiano&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vast quantity of music for [[viol]]s, for both ensemble and solo performance, was written by composers of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras, including [[Diego Ortiz]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[William Byrd]], [[William Lawes]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe]], [[J.S. Bach]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Marin Marais]], [[Antoine Forqueray]], and [[Carl Frederick Abel]].

From largest to smallest, the viol family consists of:
*contrabass or [[violone]]
*bass viol (about the size of a [[cello]])
*tenor viol (about the size of a [[guitar]])
*alto viol (about the size of a [[viola]])
*treble or descant viol (about the size of a [[violin]]).

Among the foremost modern players of the viols are [[Paolo Pandolfo]], [[Wieland Kuijken]], [[Jordi Savall]], [[John Hsu]], and [[Vittorio Ghielmi]]. There are many modern [[viol consort]]s.

===Recorder===
{{Main|List of recorder players}}
[[Recorder (musical instrument)|Recorder]]s in multiple sizes (contra-bass, bass, tenor, alto, soprano, the sopranino, and the even smaller kleine sopranino or garklein) are often played today in consorts of mixed size. [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]], among others, wrote solo works for the recorder. [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] did much to revive the recorder as a serious concert instrument, reconstructing a "consort of recorders (descant, treble, tenor and bass) all at low pitch and based on historical originals".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Blood, "[http://www.dolmetsch.com/Dolworks.htm The Dolmetsch Story]", ''Dolmetsch Online'' (26 September 2013, accessed 20 January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singing==
[[File:Christina Pluhar, Philippe Jaroussky - Misteria Paschalia 2011 (1).JPG|thumb|[[Countertenor]] [[Philippe Jaroussky]], accompanied by [[Christina Pluhar]] ([[theorbo]])]]
As with instrumental technique, the approach to historically informed performance practice for singers has been shaped by musicological research and academic debate.  In particular, there was debate around the use of the technique of [[vibrato]] at the height of the Early music revival, and many advocates of HIP aimed to eliminate vibrato in favour of the "pure" sound of straight-tone singing. The difference in style may be demonstrated by the sound of a [[boy treble]] in contrast to the sound of a [[Grand opera]] singer such as [[Maria Callas]].&lt;ref name="malafronte"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malafronte|first1=Judith|title=Vibrato Wars|url=https://www.earlymusicamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VibratoWars-1.pdf|website=www.earlymusicamerica.org|publisher=Early Music America|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306103109/https://www.earlymusicamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VibratoWars-1.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2018|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain historic vocal techniques have gained in popularity, such as ''[[Trill (music)#Trillo|trillo]]'', a [[tremolo]]-like repetition of a single note that was used for ornamental effect in the early Baroque era. Academic understanding of these expressive devices is often subjective however, as many vocal techniques discussed by treatise writers in the 17th and 18th centuries have different meanings, depending on the author. Despite the fashion for straight tone, many prominent Early music singers make use of a subtle, gentle form of vibrato to add expression to their performance.&lt;ref name="malafronte" /&gt;&lt;ref name="start"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stark|first1=James|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802086143|page=150|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rVFQdViY7jAC&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=Historically%20informed%20performance%20singing%20technique&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en|chapter=Vocal Tremulousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the singers who have contributed to the historically informed performance movement are [[Emma Kirkby]], [[Max van Egmond]], [[Julianne Baird]], [[Nigel Rogers]], and [[David Thomas (singer)|David Thomas]].

The resurgence of interest in Early music, particularly in sacred renaissance polyphony and Baroque opera, has driven a revival of the [[countertenor]] voice. High-voice male singers are often cast in preference to female [[contralto]]s in HIP opera productions, partly as a substitute for [[castrato]] singers. [[Alfred Deller]] is considered to have been a pioneer of the modern revival of countertenor singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countertenor|url=http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/countertenor/|website=Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306145032/http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/countertenor/|archivedate=6 March 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading contemporary performers include [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]], [[David Daniels (countertenor)|David Daniels]], [[Derek Lee Ragin]], [[Andreas Scholl]], [[Michael Chance]], [[Drew Minter]], [[Daniel Taylor (countertenor)|Daniel Taylor]], [[Brian Asawa]], [[Yoshikazu Mera]], and [[Philippe Jaroussky]].

==Layout==
Standard practice concerning the layout of a group of performers, for example in a choir or an orchestra, has changed over time. Determining a historically appropriate layout of singers and instruments on a performance stage may be informed by historical research. In addition to documentary evidence, musicologists may also turn to [[Iconography|iconographic evidence]] — contemporary paintings and drawings of performing musicians — as a [[primary source]] for historic information. Pictorial sources may reveal various practices such as the size of an ensemble; the position of various types of instruments; their position in relation to a choir or keyboard instrument; the position or absence of a conductor; whether the performers are seated or standing; and the performance space (such as a concert hall, palace chamber, domestic house, church, or outdoors etc.).{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}} The German theorist [[Johann Mattheson]], in a 1739 treatise, states that the singers should stand in front of the instrumentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Mattheson 1739, {{Page needed|date=December 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main layouts are documented:{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}
* Circle (Renaissance)
* Choir in the front of the instruments (17th–19th century)
* Singers and instruments next to each other on the choir loft.

===Interpreting musical notation===
Some familiar difficult items are as follows:

*Early composers often wrote using the same symbols as today, yet in a different meaning, often context-dependent. For example, what is written as an [[appoggiatura]] is often meant to be longer or shorter than the notated length.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. E. Bach, ''Versuch über die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen'', Berlin 1753: Teil 1, Section 2 Par. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The notation may be partial. E.g., the note durations may be omitted altogether, such as in [[unmeasured prelude]]s, pieces written without [[Beats per minute|rhythm]] or [[Measure (music)|metre]] indications.
*The music may be written using alternative, non-modern notations, such as [[tablature]]. Some tablature notations are only partially decoded, such as the notation&lt;ref&gt;Peter Greenhill, ''The Robert ap Huw Manuscript: An Exploration of its Possible Solutions'', 5 vols. (all), Bangor: University of Wales, CAWMS dissertation, 1995-2000.&lt;/ref&gt; in the harp manuscript&lt;ref&gt;Thurston Dart, "Robert ap Huw's Manuscript of Welsh Harp Music", ''The Galpin Society Journal'', Vol 21 (1963). {{JSTOR|841428}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Robert ap Huw]].
*The reference [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of earlier music cannot generally be interpreted as designating the same pitch used today.
*Various tuning systems ([[Musical temperament|temperament]]s), are used. Composers always assume the player will choose the temperament, and never indicate it in the score.&lt;ref&gt;"Stimmung und Temperatur", in F. Zaminer, ed., ''Geschichte der Musiktheorie'', Vol. 6: "Hören, Messen und Rechnen in der Frühen Neuzeit", Darmstadt, Germany: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft (1987) {{ISBN|978-3534012060}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In most ensemble music up to the early Baroque, the actual musical instruments to be used are not indicated in the score, and must be partially or totally chosen by the performers. A well-discussed example can be found in Monteverdi's ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', where the indications on which instruments to use are partial and limited to critical sections only.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Glover, "Solving the Musical Problem" in John Whenham (ed.) ''Claudio Monteverdi: Orfeo'', 138-155. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-521-24148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Issues of pronunciation, that impact on musical accents, carry over to church [[Latin]], the language in which a large amount of early vocal music was written. The reason is that Latin was customarily pronounced using the speech sounds and patterns of the [[Latin regional pronunciation|local]] vernacular language.

Some information about how music sounded in the past can be obtained from contemporary mechanical instruments. For instance, the Dutch [[Museum Speelklok]] owns an 18th-century mechanical organ of which the music programme was composed and supervised by [[Joseph Haydn]].&lt;ref&gt;Rob van der Hilst, "[http://www.derecensent.nl/recensies/haydnh.htm Fluitekruid van Joseph Haydn]", review of Jan Jaap Haspels, Marije Hulleman, and Bob van Wely, ''Haydn herboren: 12 originele opnamen uit 1793'' (Utrecht: Nationaal Museum van Speelklok tot Pierement, 2004), {{ISBN|90-801699-3-5}}. ''De Recensent.nl'' (2004, accessed January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuning and pitch===
Until modern era, different tuning references have been used in different venues. The baroque oboist Bruce Haynes has extensively investigated surviving wind instruments and even documented a case of violinists having to retune by a minor third to play at neighboring churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Haynes, "Pitch Standards in the Baroque and Classical Periods" (diss., U. of Montreal, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2009}}

===Iconographic evidence===
The research of musicologists often overlaps with the work of [[art historian]]s; by examining paintings and drawings of performing musicians contemporary to a particular musical era, academics can infer details about performance practice of the day. In addition to showing the layout of an orchestra or ensemble, a work of art may reveal detail about contemporary playing techniques, for example the manner of [[Violin technique#Bowing techniques|holding a bow]] or a wind player's [[embouchure]]. However, just as an art historian must evaluate a work of art, a scholar of musicology must also assess the musical evidence of a painting or illustration in its historical context, taking into consideration the potential cultural and political motivations of the artist and allow for [[artistic license]]. An historic image of musicians may present an idealised or even fictional account of musical instruments, and there is as much a risk that it may give rise to a historically misinformed performance.{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

==Issues==
[[File:John Eliot Gardiner at rehearsal in Wroclaw.jpg|thumb|Many scholars and performers such as [[John Eliot Gardiner]] have questioned the terminology of "authentic performance"]]
Prior to audio and video recording, no direct record of performing arts survives. Opinions on the implications of these motivations and on how they should translate into criteria for historically informed performance vary.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Lawson and Robin Stowell (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Musical Performance'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2012):{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;!--If a parenthetical "all", now removed, was meant to say this entire book verifies the claim that informed opinion vary, this is an opinion about the book by someone else--i.e, Original Research, unless a specific source is named for the opinion.--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within the [[early music]] revival, awareness of the pitfalls was clear. Though championing the need (for example in his editorship of Scarlatti sonatas) for a thoroughly informed approach, not least in understanding as fully as possible a composer's actual wishes and intentions in their historical context, [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]], while pioneering the harpsichord rediscovery, highlights the risk of using historical exoterism to hide technical incompetence: "too often historical authenticity can be used as a means of escape from any potentially disquieting observance of esthetic values, and from the assumption of any genuine artistic responsibility. The abdication of esthetic values and artistic responsibilities can confer a certain illusion of simplicity on what the passage of history has presented to us, bleached as white as bones on the [[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Kirkpatrick, ''Interpreting Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2010}}

Classical recording producer Michael Sartorius writes: "While the debate on authenticity in baroque performance will continue, certain essential characteristics should be present, if the performance is to reflect the true baroque spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sartorius, "Baroque Music Performance: 'Authentic' or 'Traditional': A Discussion of the Essential Issues Involved", http://www.baroquemusic.org/barperf.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars see the HIP movement essentially as a 20th-century invention. Writing about the periodical ''Early Music'' (one of the leading periodicals about historically informed performance), Peter Hill noted "All the articles in ''Early Music'' noted in varying ways the (perhaps fatal) flaw in the 'authenticity' position. This is that the attempt to understand the past in terms of the past is—paradoxically—an absolutely contemporary phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hill, "'Authenticity in Contemporary Music," ''Tempo'' New Series no. 159 (December 1986), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents of the Early music revival have distanced themselves from the terminology of "authentic performance". Conductor John Eliot Gardiner has expressed the view that the term can be "misleading", and has stated, "My enthusiasm for period instruments is not antiquarian or in pursuit of a spurious and unattainable authenticity, but just simply as a refreshing alternative to the standard, monochrome qualities of the symphony orchestra."&lt;ref name="billboard-gardiner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube-gardniner"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Eliot Gardiner: Why the Word "Authentic" Bothers Him|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym9oxgr3EnU|website=YouTube|publisher=Carnegie Hall|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more skeptical voices of the historically informed performance movement has been [[Richard Taruskin]]. His thesis is that the practice of unearthing supposedly historically informed practices is actually a 20th-century practice influenced by modernism and, ultimately, we can never know what music sounded like or how it was played in previous centuries. "What we had been accustomed to regard as historically authentic performances, I began to see, represented neither any determinable historical prototype nor any coherent revival of practices coeval with the repertories they addressed. Rather, they embodied a whole wish list of modern(ist) values, validated in the academy and the marketplace alike by an eclectic, opportunistic reading of historical evidence."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Taruskin, "Last Thoughts First," ''Text and Act'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
"'Historical' performers who aim 'to get to the truth'...by using period instruments and reviving lost playing techniques actually pick and choose from history's wares. And they do so in a manner that says more about the values of the late twentieth century than about those of any earlier era."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Taruskin, "The Modern Sound of Early Music," ''Text and Act'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Leech-Wilkinson concedes that much of the HIP practice is based on invention: "Historical research may provide us with instruments, and sometimes even quite detailed information on how to use them; but the gap between such evidence and a sounding performance is still so great that it can be bridged only by a large amount of musicianship and invention. Exactly how much is required can easily be forgotten, precisely because the exercise of musical invention is so automatic to the performer."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, "'What we are doing with early music is genuinely authentic to such a small degree that the word loses most of its intended meaning'" ''Early Music,'' vol. 12, no. 1 (February 1984), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leech Wilkinson concludes that performance styles in early music "have as much to do with current taste as with accurate reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, "'What we are doing with early music is genuinely authentic to such a small degree that the word loses most of its intended meaning'" ''Early Music,'' vol.&amp;nbsp;12, no.&amp;nbsp;1 (February 1984), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'', [[Lydia Goehr]] discusses the aims and fallacies of both proponents and critics of the HIP movement.&lt;ref name="Lydia Goehr pp. 279"&gt;Lydia Goehr, ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press), pp.&amp;nbsp;279–84.&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that the HIP movement itself came about during the latter half of the 19th century as a reaction to the way modern techniques were being imposed upon music of earlier times. Thus performers were concerned with achieving an "authentic" manner of performing music—a 19th-century ideal that carries implications for all those involved with music. She distills the late 20th century arguments into two points of view, achieving either fidelity to the conditions of performance, or fidelity to the musical work.&lt;ref name="Lydia Goehr pp. 279"/&gt;

She succinctly summarizes the critics' arguments (for example, anachronistic, selectively imputing current performance ideas on early music), but then concludes that what the HIP movement has to offer is a different manner of looking at and listening to music: "It keeps our eyes open to the possibility of producing music in new ways under the regulation of new ideals. It keeps our eyes open to the inherently critical and revisable nature of our regulative concepts. Most importantly, it helps us overcome that deep‐rooted desire to hold the most dangerous of beliefs, that we have at any time got our practices absolutely right."&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Goehr, ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press), p.&amp;nbsp;284. Goehr acknowledges the following writings informed her arguments: Theodor Adorno, "Bach Defended Against his Devotees," ''Prisms'' (London: N. Spearman, 1967), p. 135-146; Lawrence Dreyfus, "Early Music Defended Against Its Devotees: A Theory of Historical Performance in the Twentieth Century", ''Musical Quarterly'' 69 (1983), 297–322; Harry Haskell, ''The Early Music Revival'' (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1988) {{ISBN|9780500014493}}; Nicholas Kenyon (ed.), ''Authenticity and Early Music: A Symposium'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|9780198161523}}); Joseph Kerman, ''Contemplating Music: Challenges to Musicology'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985 {{ISBN|9780674166776}}), chapter 6; Michael Morrow, "Musical Performance", ''Early Music'' 6 (1978), 233–46; Charles Rosen, "Should Music Be Played "Wrong"?", ''High Fidelity'' 21 (1971), 54–58; and Richard Taruskin, et al., "The Limits of Authenticity: A Discussion", ''Early Music'' 12 (1984), 3–25, 523–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In his book, ''The Aesthetics of Music'', the British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] wrote that "the effect [of HIP] has frequently been to cocoon the past in a wad of phoney scholarship, to elevate musicology over music, and to confine Bach and his contemporaries to an acoustic time-warp. The tired feeling which so many 'authentic' performances induce can be compared to the atmosphere of a modern museum.... [The works of early composers] are arranged behind the glass of authenticity, staring bleakly from the other side of an impassable screen".&lt;ref&gt;''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997), p. 448&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holartico.png|thumb|250px|Holarctic]]
The '''Holarctic''' is the name for the [[biogeographic realm]] that encompasses the majority of habitats found throughout the northern continents of the world, combining [[Alfred_Russel_Wallace | Wallace]]'s [[Palearctic]] [[Zoogeography | zoogeographical region]], consisting of [[North Africa]] and all of [[Eurasia]] (with the exception of the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]]), and the [[Nearctic]] zoogeographical region, consisting of [[North America]], north of [[Mexico]].  These regions are further subdivided into a variety of [[ecoregions]].  Many [[ecosystems]], and the animal and plant communities that depend on them, are found across multiple continents in large portions of this realm.  The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of the realm.  The [[Floristic kingdom|floristic]] [[Boreal Kingdom]] corresponds to the Holarctic realm.

== Major ecosystems ==
Within the Holarctic realm, there are a variety of ecosystems.  The type of ecosystem found in an area depends on the latitude and local geography.  In the far north, a band of arctic [[tundra]] circles the shore of the [[Arctic Ocean]].  The ground beneath this land is [[permafrost]], frozen year-round.  In these difficult growing conditions, few plants can survive.  South of the tundra, the [[boreal forest]] stretches across North America and Eurasia.  This land is characterized by coniferous trees.  South of here, the ecosystems become more diverse.  Some areas are covered in [[temperate grassland]], while others are covered in [[temperate forest]], dominated by deciduous trees.  The southern extent of the Holarctic typically reaches into the [[desert]], which is dominated by plants and animals adapted to the dry conditions (Schultz 2007).

== Species with a holarctic distribution ==
A variety of animal species are distributed across continents, throughout much of the Holarctic realm.  Some of these included the brown bear, grey wolf, red fox, wolverine,  moose, caribou, golden eagle and the common raven.

The [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') is found in mountainous and semi-open areas distributed throughout the Holarctic.  It once occupied much larger areas, but has been driven out by human development and the resulting habitat fragmentation.  Today it is only found in remaining wilderness areas.

The [[grey wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') is found in a wide variety of habitats from tundra to desert, with different populations adapted for each.  Its historical distribution encompasses the vast majority of the Holarctic realm, though human activities such as development and active extermination have extirpated the species from much of this range.

The [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'') is a highly adaptable predator.  It has the widest distribution of any terrestrial carnivore, and is adapted to a wide range of habitats, including areas of intense human development.  Like the wolf, it is distributed throughout the majority of the Holarctic, but it has avoided extirpation.

The [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo'') is a large member of the weasel family found primarily in the arctic and in boreal forests, ranging south in mountainous regions.  It is distributed in such areas throughout Eurasia and North America.

The [[moose]] (''Alces alces'') is the largest member of the deer family.  It is found throughout most of the boreal forest through continental Eurasia into Scandinavia, eastern North America, and boreal and montane regions of western North America.  In some areas it ranges south into the deciduous forest.  
 
The caribou, or [[reindeer]] (''Rangifer tarandus'') is found in boreal forest and tundra in the northern parts of the Holarctic.  In Eurasia it has been domesticated.  It is divided into several subspecies, which are adapted to different habitats and geographic areas.

The [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos'') is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey (mainly hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels).

The [[common raven]] (''Corvus corax'') is the most widespread of the corvids, and one of the largest.  It is found in a variety of habitats, but primarily wooded northern areas.  It has been known to adapt well to areas of human activity.  Their distribution also makes up most of the Holarctic realm.

''[[Leptothorax acervorum]]'' is a small red holarctic ant widely distributed across Eurasia, ranging from central Spain and Italy to the northernmost parts of Scandinavia and Siberia.

== Origin ==
The continuity of the northern parts of the holarctic results from their shared [[glacial]] history.  During the [[Pleistocene]], these areas were subjected to repeated glaciations.  Icecaps expanded, scouring the land of life and reshaping its topography.  During glacial periods, species survived in [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]], small areas that maintained a suitable climate due to local geography.  These areas are believed to have been primarily in southern regions, but some genetic and [[paleontological]] evidence points to additional refugia in the sheltered areas of the north (Stewart and Lister 2001).

Wherever these areas were found, they became source populations during interglacial periods.  When the glaciers receded, plants and animals spread rapidly into the newly opened areas.  Different taxa responded to these rapidly changing conditions in different ways.  Tree species spread outward from refugia during interglacial periods, but in varied patterns, with different trees dominating in different periods (Taberlet and Chedadi 2002).  [[Insects]], on the other hand, shifted their ranges with the climate, maintaining consistency in species for the most part throughout the period (Coope 1994).  Their high degree of mobility allowed them to move as the glaciers advanced or retreated, maintaining a constant habitat despite the climatic oscillations.  Despite their apparent lack of mobility, plants managed to colonize new areas rapidly as well.  Studies of fossil pollen indicate that trees recolonized these lands at an exponential rate (Bennet 1986).  Mammals recolonized at varying rates.  Brown bears, for instance, moved quickly from refugia with the receding glaciers, becoming one of the first large mammals to recolonize the land (Sommer and Benecke 2005).  The last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago, resulting in the present distribution of ecoregions.

Another factor contributing to the continuity of Holarctic ecosystems is the movement between continents allowed by the [[Bering land bridge]], which was exposed by the lowering of sea level due to the expansion of the ice caps.  The communities found in the Palearctic and the Nearctic are different, but have many species in common.  This is the result of several faunal interchanges that took place across the Bering land bridge.  However, these migrations were mostly limited to large, cold-tolerant species (Rodriguez et al. 2006).  Today it is mainly these species which are found throughout the realm.

== Threats ==
As the Holarctic is an enormous area, it is subject to environmental problems of international scale.  The primary threats throughout the region result from [[global warming]] and [[habitat fragmentation]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The former is of particular concern in the north, as these ecosystems are adapted to cold.  The latter is more of a concern in the south, where development is prevalent.

Global warming is a threat to all the Earth's ecosystems, but it is a more immediate threat to those found in cold climates.  The communities of species found at these latitudes are adapted to the cold, so any significant warming can upset the balance.  For instance, insects struggle to survive the cold winters typical of the boreal forest.  Many do not make it, especially in harsh winters.  However, recently the winters have grown milder, which has had a drastic effect on the forest.  Winter mortality of some insect species drastically decreased, allowing the population to build on itself in subsequent years.  In some areas the effects have been severe.  [[Spruce beetle]] outbreaks have wiped out up to ninety percent of the [[Kenai Peninsula]]'s spruce trees; this is blamed primarily on a series of unusually warm years since 1987 (Logan et al. 2003).

In this case a native species has caused massive disturbance of habitat as a result of climate change.  Warming temperatures may also allow pest species to enlarge their range, moving into habitats that were previously unsuitable.  Studies of potential areas for outbreaks of [[bark beetle]]s indicate that as the climate shifts, these beetles will expand to the north and to higher elevations than they have previously affected (Williams &amp; Liebhold 2002).  With warmer temperatures, insect infestation will become a greater problem throughout the northern parts of the Holarctic.

Another potential effect of global warming to norther ecosystems is the melting of [[permafrost]].  This can have significant effects on the plant communities that are adapted to the frozen soil, and may also have implications for further climate change.  As permafrost melts, any trees growing above it may die, and the land shifts from forest to peatland.  In the far north, shrubs may later take over what was formerly tundra.  The precise effect depends on whether the water that was locked up is able to drain off.  In either case, the habitat will undergo a shift.  Melting permafrost may also accelerate climate change in the future.  Within the permafrost, vast quantities of [[carbon]] are locked up.  If this soil melts, the carbon may be released into the air as either [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]].  Both of these are [[greenhouse gas]]es (Stokstad 2004).

Habitat fragmentation threatens a wide variety of habitats throughout the world, and the Holoarctic is no exception.  Fragmentation has a variety of negative effects on populations.  As populations become cut off, their genetic diversity suffers and they become susceptible to sudden disasters and extinction.   While the northern parts of the Holarctic represent some of the largest areas of wilderness left on Earth, the southern parts are in some places extensively developed. This realm contains most of the worlds [[developed countries]], including the [[United States]] and the nations of [[Western Europe]].  Temperate forests were the primary ecosystem in many of the most developed areas today.  These lands are now used for intensive agriculture or have become urbanized.  As lands have been developed for agricultural uses and human occupation, natural habitat has for the most part become limited to areas considered unsuitable for human use, such as slopes or rocky areas (Schultz 2007).  This pattern of development limits the ability of animals, especially large ones, to migrate from place to place.

Large carnivores are particularly affected by habitat fragmentation.  These mammals, such as brown bears and wolves, require large areas of land with relatively intact habitat to survive as individuals.  Much larger areas are required to maintain a sustainable population.  They may also serve as [[keystone species]], regulating the populations of the species they prey on.  Thus, their conservation has direct implications for a wide range of species, and is difficult to accomplish politically due to the large size of the areas they need (Paquet 1996).  With increasing development, these species in particular are at risk, which could have effects that carry down throughout the ecosystem.

== Conservation actions ==
The threats to the Holarctic realm are not going unrecognized.  Many efforts are being made to mitigate these threats, with the hope of preserving the biodiversity of the region.  International agreements to combat global warming may help to lessen the effects of climate change on this region.  Efforts are also underway to fight habitat fragmentation, both on local and regional scales.

The most comprehensive effort to combat global warming to date is the [[Kyoto Protocol]].  Developed countries who sign this protocol agree to cut their collective greenhouse gas emissions by five percent since 1990 by sometime between 2008 and 2012.  The vast majority of these nations are found within the Holarctic.  Each country is given a target for emission levels, and they may trade emissions credits in a market-based system that includes [[developing countries]] as well.  Once this period is ended, a new agreement will be written to further mitigate the effects of climate change.  The process of drafting a new agreement has already begun.  In late 2007, an international meeting in [[Bali]] was held to begin planning for the successor to the Kyoto Protocol.  This agreement will aim to build on the successes and failures of Kyoto to produce a more effective method of cutting greenhouse gas emissions ([[UNFCCC]]).  If these efforts are successful, the biodiversity of the Holarctic and the rest of the world will see fewer effects of climate change.

Fighting habitat fragmentation is a major challenge in conserving the wide-ranging species of the Holarctic.  Some efforts are limited to a local scale of protection, while others are regional in scope.  Local efforts include creating [[Nature reserve|reserves]] and establishing safe routes for animals to cross roads and other human-made barriers.  Regional efforts to combat habitat fragmentation take a broader scope.

One major such effort in the Holarctic is the [[Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative]].  This organization was started in 1997 to help establish a contiguous network of protection for the northern [[Rocky Mountains]], from mid [[Wyoming]] to the border between [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]]'s [[Yukon]].  It brings together a wide variety of environmental organizations for a shared purpose.  The goal of the Initiative is to create a core of protected areas, connected by corridors and surrounded by buffer zones.  This will build on the many existing protected areas in this region, with a focus on integrating existing and future human activities into the conservation plan rather than seeking to exclude them (Yellowstone to Yukon).  If these efforts are successful, they will be especially beneficial to wide-ranging species such as [[grizzly bear]]s.  If these species can survive, other members of the communities they live in will survive as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">The '''Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre''' ('''HEIC''') is a science communication office, established at the [[Space Telescope - European Coordinating Facility]] (ST-ECF) in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] late in 1999. This initiative was taken so as to fulfil the NASA/ESA [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) outreach and education tasks for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), as outlined in an agreement between [[NASA]] and [[ESA]].

Over the past few years HEIC has become a very distinguished communication office of experts using the newest software and techniques. The European Hubble office has produced large amounts of astronomical material suitable both for educational purposes and wider public consumption. HEIC provides a well-assorted archive that is publicly available on its web page.

The work is centred on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble science results and images. These are often European in origin, and so not only increase the awareness of ESA’s Hubble share (15%), but the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. Furthermore, the group produces video releases, innovative educational material, CD-ROMs, brochures, posters, as well as DVDs and museum information kiosks, and much more.

The Hubble Information Centre is headed by the science communication specialist [[Lars Lindberg Christensen]] and the lead graphic designer is [[Martin Kornmesser]].

'''Human Thermal Environments''' is a branch of the discipline [[Ergonomics]], concerned with the [[thermal comfort]] (i.e. whether a person feels too cold, hot, 'sticky' etc.) of human beings in any, but especially in their working environment.
Convective, conductive, radiative and insulating properties of the human body and the environment in which it finds itself are all variables whose effects are closely considered in this science.
The aim of the discipline is to manipulate these variables in the environment and/or the clothing of the individual to achieve 'thermal comfort', the state in which the individual is content with their perceived thermal state.

Laboratories at [[Loughborough University]], led by Prof. K.C. Parsons, are currently among the leading research centres of the discipline in the [[UK]].

This article will be expanded at a later date.

An '''integrated [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]/decoder''' ('''IRD''') is an electronic [[Integrated circuit|device]] used to pick up a radio-frequency [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] and convert [[Digital data|digital]] information transmitted in it.

==Consumer IRDs==
{{Main|Set-top box}}

Consumer IRDs, commonly called [[set-top box]]es, are used by end users and are much cheaper compared to professional IRDs. To curb content piracy, they also lack many features and [[Interface (computer science)|interface]]s found in professional IRDs such as outputting uncompressed [[Serial Digital Interface|SDI]] video or [[Asynchronous serial interface|ASI]] [[MPEG transport stream|transport stream]] dumps. They are also designed to be more aesthetically pleasing.

==Professional IRDs==
Commonly found in [[radio]], [[television]], [[Cable television|Cable]] and [[satellite]] broadcasting facilities, the IRD is generally used for the reception of contribution feeds that are intended for re-broadcasting. The IRD is the interface between a receiving [[satellite dish]] or [[Telecommunications company|Telco]] networks and a broadcasting facility video/audio infrastructure. 

Professional IRDs have various features that consumer IRDs lack such as:

* [[Serial Digital Interface|SDI]] outputs.
* [[Asynchronous serial interface|ASI]] inputs / outputs.
* [[Professional video over IP|TSoIP]] inputs.
* [[AES/EBU]] Audio decoding.
* [[Vertical blanking interval|VBI]] reinsertion.
* [[Widescreen signaling|WSS]] data and pass through.
* [[MPEG transport stream|Transport stream]] demultiplexing.
* [[Genlock]] input.
* [[Frame synchronization]] of digital video output to analogue input.
* [[Closed captioning|Closed captions]] and [[Video signal generator|VITS]]/[[Issue tracking system|ITS]]/[[Vertical interval timecode|VITC]] Insertion.
* Video [[Test card|test pattern]] generator.
* Remote management over [[Local area network|LAN]]/[[Wide area network|WAN]].
* [[General Purpose Input/Output|GPI]] interface - For sending external alarm triggers.
* [[19-inch rack|Rack]] mountable.

==Uses==
* [[direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS) [[television]] applications like [[DirecTV]], [[SES Astra|Astra]] or [[DishTV]]
* [[fixed service satellite]] (FSS) applications like [[VideoCipher]], [[DigiCipher]], or [[PowerVu]]
* [[digital audio radio satellite]] (DARS) applications like [[XM Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]
* [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) applications like [[Eureka 147]] and [[IBOC]]
* [[Digital Video Broadcasting|digital video broadcasting]] (DVB) applications like [[DVB-T]] and [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]]

'''''Kids Can Say No!''''', stylized as '''''Kids Can Say &lt;u&gt;No&lt;/u&gt;''','' is a 1985 [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[Short film|short]] [[educational film]] produced and directed by Jessica Skippon and written by Anita Bennett. It is intended to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be [[Sexual abuse|sexually abused]], how to escape such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. In the film, Australian celebrity [[Rolf Harris]] is in a park with a group of four children and tells them about proper and improper [[physical intimacy]], which he calls "yes" and "no" feelings. The film has four [[role-playing]] scenes in which children encounter [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]], with Harris and the children discussing each scene.

Harris said that he came up with the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw [[Vancouver]]'s [[Green Thumb Theatre]] production of ''[[Feeling Yes, Feeling No]]'', a play about [[child sexual abuse]]. ''Kids Can Say No!'', released in October 1985 on [[VHS]] in the United Kingdom, was the first British [[children's film]] about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, ''[[The Times]]'' obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using ''Kids Can Say No!'' or any other film to teach children about the subject. The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of ''Kids Can Say No!'' and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel ''Beyond the Scare'', which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of ''Kids Can Say No!'' eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.

''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014, when Harris was prosecuted for twelve counts of [[indecent assault|indecently assaulting]] young girls. The prosecutors found ''Kids Can Say No!'' on [[YouTube]] and wanted to show it at trial to illustrate its unintentional irony, but the film was not [[Admissible evidence|admitted as evidence]]. Harris was found guilty of all counts. During the trial, it was learned that, while Harris was filming ''Kids Can Say No!'', he was in the midst of a [[casual sex]]ual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend and, by its release, he had committed nine of the twelve assaults. According to Richard Guilliatt and [[Jacquelin Magnay]] in an article in ''[[The Australian]]'', Harris' campaign against paedophilia in ''Kids Can Say No!'' can "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

Harris, then host of ''[[Rolf's Cartoon Time]]'', approached the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] (NSPCC) and the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust|Tavistock Clinic]] with his idea about making a film on child [[sexual abuse]]. Both organisations were receptive.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use [[child actor]]s in ''Kids Can Say No!''&lt;ref name=Twomey&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Express]]|title=Hypocrisy: Rolf Harris Warned of Paedophiles in Children's Charity Video|author=Twomey, John|date=1 June 2014|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/485939/Rolf-Harris-warned-of-paedophiles-in-children-s-charity-video|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris approached [[Film director|director]] Jessica Skippon, with whom he had made a film about water safety,&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; and said that he wanted to make ''Kids Can Say No!'' to protect children.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

I have never betrayed the kids' trust".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

In April 1986, Harris met with [[Western Australia Police]] officials and members of several state-government departments in [[Mount Hawthorn, Western Australia|Mount Hawthorn]] to propose another film for children about how to handle [[sexual predator]]s. Despite Harris' offer to work for free, the officials declined and instead developed a broader campaign on the subject without Harris.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Sydney Opera House (9587195189).jpg|thumb|alt=Sydney Opera House|[[Child abuse|Child-abuse]] expert Carolyn Okell Jones presented ''Kids Can Say No!'' at the [[Sydney Opera House]] (''pictured'') in 1986 as part of the sixth [[International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect|International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect]].]]
''Kids Can Say No!'' was released in the United Kingdom in October 1985&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; on [[VHS]]&lt;ref name=Jefferson/&gt; with notes for teachers and two relevant books,&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; and was distributed by Skippon Video, Skippon's UK-based company.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; Although several other short children's educational films about sexual abuse were on the market in the UK including several also released that year, ''Kids Can Say No!'' was the only British film; the others were made in Australia, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

In August 1986, Jones presented the film at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in Australia as part of the sixth [[International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect|International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect]], the largest conference in the world on child abuse. The 56-year-old Harris, who was chosen to be [[master of ceremonies]] for the three-day conference's opening event because of his celebrity and involvement with the film, told the audience that paedophilia was finally "coming out from under its veil of secrecy".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Australian]]|title=The Dark Double Life of Rolf Harris|author=Guilliatt, Richard|author2=[[Jacquelin Magnay]]|date=12 July 2014|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/the-dark-double-life-of-rolf-harris/story-e6frg8h6-1226981773650|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequel===
After the release of ''Kids Can Say No!'', many teachers who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of how to deal with the disclosures,&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel&lt;ref name=Beal/&gt; ''Beyond the Scare''.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; ''Kids Can Say No!'' encourages children to report abuse they experience and ''Beyond the Scare'' advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

''Beyond the Scare'', filmed in a [[North London]] school, consists of role-playing scenes with actual teachers. The film instructs teachers to listen to the child, to discuss the incident with the child's parents and to contact the appropriate authorities. The Tavistock Clinic helped with the film's production, and an expert from the organisation appears on-camera to promote [[child protection]] projects in schools. Although Harris appears in ''Beyond the Scare'', his role is less prominent than in ''Kids Can Say No!''&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=The Importance of Listening: The Issue of Child Sex Abuse|date=7 October 1986|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=40GH-HB00-00VY-8177&amp;csi=270944,270077,11059,8411&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true|accessdate=25 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his activism against child abuse ended soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

==Harris' trial==
[[File:Rolf Harris.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Rolf Harris|In 2014, Harris was convicted of twelve counts of [[indecent assault]] against four young girls, having committed nine counts before the 1985 release of ''Kids Can Say No!'']]
''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014 when Harris, then 83 years old, was prosecuted for twelve counts of [[indecent assault]] between 1968 and 1986 against four young girls; the youngest was seven years old. The prosecutors found ''Kids Can Say No!'' on [[YouTube]] and wanted to show it at trial for its unintentional irony, but the film was ruled irrelevant to the case and not [[Admissible evidence|admitted as evidence]].&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt;

After the trial began, Skippon warned media outlets that it was illegal to use the film without written permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|title=Rolf Harris Starred in Video about Protecting Children in 1980s|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/rolf-harris-starred-in-video-about-protecting-children-in-1985-9573633.html|first=Paul|last=Cheston|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director wrote to ''[[The Independent]]'' that no complaints were made against Harris during the making of the film.&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; In an article about the allegations against Harris, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' noted that ''Kids Can Say No!'' was commissioned by the NSPCC;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|title=BBC Sex Scandal: A Gifted Entertainer who was Nervous of Groupies|author=Flint, John|date=21 April 2013|page=17|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=SUNTEL0020130421e94l00066&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=24 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; a NSPCC spokesperson responded, "The film was made independently by Rolf Harris and a film company nearly 30 years ago&amp;nbsp;...

[[Southwark Crown Court]] found Harris guilty of all twelve counts of indecent assault.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; During the trial, it was learned that, while making ''Kids Can Say No!'', Harris was involved in a [[casual sex]]ual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; the relationship began when the victim was 13 years old and lasted for 15 years.&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release,&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; including the assault of fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; The first complainant was about the age of the children in ''Kids Can Say No!,''&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; although the conviction related to this count was quashed in 2017.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42012064|title=Rolf Harris indecent assault conviction overturned|work=BBC News|date=16 November 2017|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last assault of which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after his meeting with officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt; A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in ''Kids Can Say No!'' said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt;

==Reception==
Reviews of ''Kids Can Say No!'' have generally been negative, with initial reviews doubting the benefit of showing the film to children and later reviews focusing on Harris' hypocrisy. In a 1985 ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review, Caroline Moorehead writes that the film's avoidance of an explicit discussion of sexual abuse was both a requirement and the film's greatest weakness. According to Moorehead, an explicit discussion might have terrified children and prevented parents from consenting to their children's viewing of the film; however, its oblique approach prevents children from understanding the issue. She calls the film's theme song "catchy, one of those irritating snatches of music that is hard to forget".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

''The Times'' obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using ''Kids Can Say No!'' or any other film to teach children about the subject. [[Northampton]] [[social work]]er Helen Kenward said that she would not show the film to children. [[Psychiatrist]] Brendan McCarthy called it simplistic. According to teacher Clare Rankin, children under five would not understand the film. [[Physician]] Paula Drummond was concerned that it might inspire children to falsely accuse adults they disliked, although McCarthy said that children were unlikely to make false abuse accusations. McCarthy was especially critical of the film, calling it "no clearer to a child than the Gorbachev-Reagan talks".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt; Moorehead summarised the experts' comments as suggesting that ''Kids Can Say No!'' is "muddling, evasive and pussy-footed, best not for children at all, but as&amp;nbsp;... aids for parents and professional workers to alert them to paedophilia and incest".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

In a 1988 ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]]'' review, Judith Whelan writes that Harris is more serious in the film than he was when performing "[[Jake the Peg]]". According to Whelan, the film "would best be seen by children in a group, with an adult (teacher or parent) nearby who could encourage discussion after the show or answer children's questions during it".&lt;ref name=Whelan&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|title=Saying 'No' is a Child's First Defence|author=Whelan, Judith|date=21 November 1988|page=6|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=smhh000020011117dkbl0214s&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=24 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014, Peter Walker wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the film "illustrates with grim eloquence, in retrospect, the prosecution notion that [Harris] was a man of two distinct sides: the avuncular and trustworthy public figure, and lurking behind, the groper and abuser".&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; Walker notes that the scene in which a man assaults his child's friend mirrors what Harris did to his daughter's best friend, and that the closing sequence has "an accidental resonance that would only emerge more than 25 years later" because of the two police officers behind Harris.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

According to Richard Guilliatt and [[Jacquelin Magnay]] in an article in ''[[The Australian]]'', Harris' campaign against paedophilia in ''Kids Can Say No!'' can "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; NSPCC chief executive officer [[Peter Wanless]] appeared on ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' saying that Harris' appearance in the film was hypocritical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Rolf Harris Guilty: Abuse Victim Wrote to the Queen to Warn Her as the Presenter Painted Monarch's Portrait|first=Jenn|last=Selby|date=1 July 2014|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rolf-harris-guilty-victim-wrote-to-the-queen-to-warn-her-as-the-presenter-painted-her-portrait-9575140.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'' article, Paul Bracchi writes that Harris' work on ''Kids Can Say No!'' at the same time that he was abusing girls was "one of the most sickening examples [of] hiding in plain sight".&lt;ref name=Bracchi/&gt; In 2014, theme composer Peter Alsop said that Harris may have used the film to [[Child grooming|groom children]] because it encouraged trust by parents.&lt;ref name=Beal/&gt;

'''Language for specific purposes''' ('''LSP''') has been primarily used to refer to two areas within applied linguistics:  
# One focusing on the needs in education and training
# One with a focus on research on language variation across a particular subject field

LSP can be used with any target language needed by the learners as a tool for specific purposes, and has often been applied to English ('''English for specific purposes''', or '''ESP'''). 

A third approach, content or theme-based language instruction (CBI) has also been confused with LSP.  These several uses of the label of LSP have caused some confusion internationally.

==Education and training==
LSP is a widely applied approach to second or foreign language teaching and training that addresses immediate and very specific needs of learners who need that language as a tool in their education, training or job. Needs analysis is the underlying "driver" for the development of LSP programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson &amp; Waters 1987, Robinson 1980, Swales, 185, 1992, Hyland 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, English native speaking nurses who work in hospitals with a high percentage patient whose native language is Spanish might have to study Spanish for the very specific purpose of communication between nurses and patients.
Students are encouraged to take active roles in their own learning and question what they have been taught. This is likened to negotiated syllabus about which Hyland (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, K. (2009). Specific purpose programs. In M. H. Long &amp; C. J. Doughty (eds.), The handbook of language teaching (pp. 201-217). Singapore:Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; writes, "A negotiated syllabus means that the content of a particular course is a matter of discussion between teacher and students, according to the wishes and needs of the learners in conjunction with the expertise, judgement, and advice of the teacher" (p. 208).

==Research==
"Language for specific purposes" has also been used to refer to a branch of [[applied linguistics]] which deals with a variety of language used by members of a particular subject field, concentrating on its [[genre]]s, [[stylistics (field of study)|stylistic]] features and technical [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]]. This research is relevant for such problem-based areas as [[language education]], [[translation]] and the [[lexicography|design of specialised dictionaries]]. Some in the training area consider such research on Professional Communications as LSP-related research when it is paired with or applied directly to an LSP training program.

==Relationship to content-based instruction==
[[Content-based instruction|Content-based language instruction]] (CBI) is also sometimes confused with ESP.  At the post-secondary level it is frequently used to motivate groups of learners who may be interested in the same professional field, providing meaningful communication opportunities.  However, as in their regular studies they are usually not studying through a foreign/second language (except for sheltered courses), they do not need English as a tool in their immediate studies. "Content-based instruction (CBI) is the integration of selected content with language teaching aims".&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, D. M., Snow, M. A., &amp; Wesche, M. B. (1989). ''Content-based second language instruction.'' New York: Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when trying to identify which approach being taken, the question is: "Is it English for Specific Purposes or English through specific content themes or content areas?"

The '''medieval popular Bible''' is a term used especially in literary studies, but also in art history and other disciplines, to encompass the wide variety of presentations of [[Bible|biblical material]] in medieval culture not directly recorded in the [[exegesis|exegetical tradition]].

The "exegetical tradition" means the vast corpus of Latin writings, often [[List of Bible commentaries|biblical commentaries]], [[sermon]]s or preaching handbooks, diatribes against doctrinal deviancy and philosophical explorations, in which scholars of the medieval [[Christian Church|Church]] present the Bible according to medieval orthodoxy. Its intended readership is, in the first instance, other theologians.

In contrast to this, the "medieval popular Bible" is aimed at the ordinary population of medieval Europe, and to some extent is also created by them. It ranges from very pious vernacular writings such as the Biblical Epic to scurrillous [[fabliau]]x in which biblical figures make an appearance. It includes most [[Liturgical drama|religious drama]], much [[stained glass]] and some wild and fanciful retellings of [[Bible story|Bible stories]].   

The [[forbidden fruit]] is a standard example. The [[Bible]] itself does not say what kind of fruit it was, but in the popular retelling, as opposed to the theological schools, it became an [[apple]].  Since the apple served well to communicate spiritual ideas, the exegetical tradition did not resist it. In the medieval understanding of biblical truth, there was no need for a modern style of debate on the accuracy of the motif.

Serious work on this area of [[medieval culture]] probably began with [[Beryl Smalley]] in the 1940s. The term "medieval popular Bible" became established in scholarship relatively recently as a result of the writings of [[Brian O. Murdoch]], though the phrase had been used before him, usually in a less clearly defined way.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Spencer,  "Review of Brian Murdoch. The Medieval Popular Bible: Expansions of Genesis in the Middle Ages," ''Review of English Studies'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4795">[[File:Megadiverse Countries.PNG|thumb|400px|right|The 17 countries identified as megadiverse by Conservation International]]

The term '''megadiverse country''' refers to any one of a group of nations that harbor the majority of Earth's species and high numbers of [[endemic species]]. [[Conservation International]] identified 17 megadiverse countries in 1998.&lt;ref name="AUSGOP"&gt;http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/theme-reports/biodiversity/biodiversity01-3.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208141905/http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/theme-reports/biodiversity/biodiversity01-3.html |date=2008-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/areas/26|title=Megadiverse Countries definition- Biodiversity A-Z |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are located in, or partially in, [[tropical]] or [[subtropical]] regions.

Mega diversity means exhibiting great diversity. The main criteria for megadiverse countries is endemism at the level of species, genera and families. A megadiverse country must have at least 5,000 species of endemic plants and must border marine ecosystems.

In 2002, [[Mexico]] formed a separate organisation focusing on Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries, consisting of countries rich in biological diversity and associated traditional knowledge. This organisation does not include all the megadiverse countries as identified by [[Conservation International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211011642/http://www.environment.gov.au/node/21579|title=Biodiversity, Australia State of the Environment Report 2001 (Theme Report): The meaning, significance and implications of biodiversity (Megadiverse countries)|date=2014-12-11|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cancún initiative and declaration of like-minded megadiverse countries ==
[[File:Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries.png|thumb|400px|The 20 current like-minded megadiverse countries]]
On 18 February 2002, the Ministers in charge of the Environment and the Delegates of [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kenya]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]] and [[Venezuela]] assembled in [[Cancún]], Mexico. These countries declared to set up a '''Group of Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries''' as a mechanism for consultation and cooperation so that their interests and priorities, related to the preservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, could be promoted. They also declared that they would call on those countries that had not become Parties to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], and the [[Kyoto Protocol]] on climate change to become parties to these agreements.

At the same time, they agreed to meet periodically, at the ministerial and expert levels, and decided that upon the conclusion of each annual Ministerial Meeting, the next rotating host country would take on the role of Secretary of the group, to ensure its continuity, the further development of cooperation among these countries, and to reach the various agreements and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unido.org/file-storage/download?file_id=11803|title=UNIDO – United Nations Industrial Development Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2010, Guatemala and Iran were also included in the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversidad.gob.mx/planeta/internacional/paises_megadiversos.html|title=Plataforma de monitoreo de las actividades de implementación de la Estratgeia Nacional sobre Especies Invasoras (Previene) – Biodiversidad Mexicana – Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad|first=|last=CONABIO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electrical engineering]], '''Millman's theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millman|first1=Jacob|title=A Useful Network Theorem|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|date=1940|volume=28|issue=9|pages=413–417|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1940.225885|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1687226|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or the '''parallel generator theorem''') is a method to simplify the solution of a [[electrical network|circuit]]. Specifically, Millman's theorem is used to compute the [[voltage]] at the ends of a circuit made up of only [[series and parallel circuits|branches in parallel]].

It is named after [[Jacob Millman]], who proved the theorem.

==Explanation==
[[Image:milman ex01.gif|frame|Figure 1]]

Let e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be the voltage [[Electrical generator|generators]] and a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; the current generators.

Let R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; be the [[electrical resistance|resistance]]s on the branches with no generator.

Let R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be the resistances on the branches with voltage generators.

Let R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; be the resistances on the branches with current generators.

Then Millman states that the voltage at the ends of the circuit is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{\sum_{}\frac{\pm e_{k}}{R_{k}}+\sum_{}\pm a_{m}}{\sum_{}\frac{1}{R_{k}}+\sum_{}\frac{1}{R_{i}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be proved by considering the circuit as a single [[supernode (circuit)|supernode]]. Then, according to [[Ohm's law|Ohm]] and [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff]], "the voltage between the ends of the circuit is equal to the total current entering the supernode divided by the total equivalent conductance of the supernode".{{Cite quote|date=June 2017}}

The total current is the sum of the currents in each branch.

The total equivalent [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] of the supernode is the sum of the conductance of each branch, since all the branches are in parallel. When computing the equivalent conductance all the generators have to be switched off, so all voltage generators become [[short circuit]]s and all current generators become [[wikt:open circuit|open circuit]]s. That is why the resistances on the branches with current generators do not appear in the expression of the total equivalent conductance.

At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]].

'''Modernism''' is a philosophical movement that, along with cultural trends and changes, arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in [[Western world|Western society]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern [[Industrial society|industrial societies]] and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions of horror to [[World War I]]. Modernism also rejected the certainty of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pericles Lewis]], ''Modernism, Nationalism, and the Novel'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2000). pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[James Joyce|[James] Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is a comedy not divine, ending, like Dante's, in the vision of a God whose will is our peace, but human all-too-human...."
Peter Faulkner, ''Modernism'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1990). p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernism, in general, includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, philosophy, social organization, activities of daily life, and sciences, were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic, social, and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world. The poet [[Ezra Pound]]'s 1934 injunction to "Make it new!" was the touchstone of the movement's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past. In this spirit, its innovations, like the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] novel, [[atonal]] (or pantonal) and [[twelve-tone]] music, [[divisionist]] painting and [[abstract art]], all had precursors in the 19th century.

A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions, which often led to experiments with form, along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting, poem, building, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Helen, Horst de la Croix, Richard G. Tansey, and Diane Kirkpatrick. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' (San Diego: [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]], 1991). {{ISBN|0155037706}}. p. 953.&lt;/ref&gt; Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of [[Realism (arts)|realism]]&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"/&gt; and makes use of the works of the past by the employment of [[reprise]], [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]], rewriting, [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], revision and [[parody]].&lt;ref name="Eco90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner98p489"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Childs2000p17"/&gt;

Some commentators define modernism as a mode of thinking—one or more philosophically defined characteristics, like self-consciousness or self-reference, that run across all the novelties in the arts and the disciplines.&lt;ref name="Everdell"&gt;Everdell, William, ''[[The First Moderns|The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought]]'', University of Chicago Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0226224805}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More common, especially in the West, are those who see it as a socially progressive trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;"In the twentieth century, the social processes that bring this maelstrom into being, and keep it in a state of perpetual becoming, have come to be called 'modernization'. These world-historical processes have nourished an amazing variety of visions and ideas that aim to make men and women the subjects as well as the objects of modernization, to give them the power to change the world that is changing them, to make their way through the maelstrom and make it their own. Over the past century, these visions and values have come to be loosely grouped together under the name of 'modernism'." (Berman 1988, 16)&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, modernism encouraged the re-examination of every aspect of existence, from commerce to philosophy, with the goal of finding that which was 'holding back' [[progress (history)|progress]], and replacing it with new ways of reaching the same end. Others focus on modernism as an aesthetic introspection. This facilitates consideration of specific reactions to the use of technology in the First World War, and anti-technological and nihilistic aspects of the works of diverse thinkers and artists spanning the period from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) to [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906–1989).&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee Oser]], ''The Ethics of Modernism: Moral Ideas in Yeats, Eliot, Joyce, Woolf and Beckett'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.J.

According to one critic, modernism developed out of [[Romanticism]]'s revolt against the effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[bourgeois]] values: "The ground motive of modernism, [[Gerald Graff|Graff]] asserts, was criticism of the nineteenth-century bourgeois social order and its world view [...] the modernists, carrying the torch of romanticism."&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"&gt;Barth (1979) quotation: {{quotation|The ground motive of modernism, Graff asserts, was criticism of the nineteenth-century bourgeois social order and its world view. Its artistic strategy was the self-conscious overturning of the conventions of bourgeois realism [...] the antirationalist, antirealist, antibourgeois program of modernism [...] the modernists, carrying the torch of romanticism, taught us that linearity, rationality, consciousness, cause and effect, naïve illusionism, transparent language, innocent anecdote, and middle-class moral conventions are not the whole story.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff73"&gt;Graff (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"&gt;Graff (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; While [[J. M. W. Turner]] (1775–1851), one of the greatest landscape painters of the 19th century, was a member of the [[Romantic movement]], as "a pioneer in the study of light, colour, and atmosphere", he "anticipated the [[French Impressionists]]" and therefore modernism "in breaking down conventional formulas of representation; [though] unlike them, he believed that his works should always express significant historical, mythological, literary, or other narrative themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/610274/J-M-W-Turner| title=J.M.W.

The dominant trends of industrial [[Victorian England]] were opposed, from about 1850, by the English poets and painters that constituted the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], because of their "opposition to technical skill without inspiration."&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne-Davies. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|815}} They were influenced by the writings of the art critic [[John Ruskin]] (1819–1900), who had strong feelings about the role of art in helping to improve the lives of the urban working classes, in the rapidly expanding industrial cities of Britain.&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury/&gt;{{rp|816}} Art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] describes the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood as proto-Modernists: "There the proto-Modernists were, of all people, the pre-Raphaelites (and even before them, as proto-proto-Modernists, the German [[Nazarene movement|Nazarenes]]). The Pre-Raphaelites actually foreshadowed [[Manet]] (1832–83), with whom Modernist painting most definitely begins. They acted on a dissatisfaction with painting as practiced in their time, holding that its realism wasn't truthful enough."&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Clement Greenberg, [http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html "Modern and Postmodern"], William Dobell Memorial Lecture, Sydney, Australia, Oct 31, 1979, Arts 54, No.6 (February 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rationalism]] has also had opponents in the philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–55)&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{Cite book| chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/| title=Søren Kierkegaard (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)| publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| chapter=Søren Kierkegaard| year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), both of whom had significant influence on [[existentialism]].&lt;ref name=Collinson&gt;Diané Collinson, ''Fifty Major Philosophers: A Reference Guide''. London: Routledge, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}}

However, the Industrial Revolution continued. Influential innovations included steam-powered industrialization, and especially the development of railways, starting in Britain in the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Hylton (2007). ''The Grand Experiment: The Birth of the Railway Age'' 1820–1845. Ian Allan Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent advancements in physics, engineering, and architecture associated with this. A major 19th-century engineering achievement was [[The Crystal Palace]], the huge cast-iron and plate glass exhibition hall built for [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851 in London. Glass and iron were used in a similar monumental style in the construction of major railway terminals in [[London]], such as [[Paddington Station]] (1854)&lt;ref&gt;R.V.J. Butt (1995). ''The Directory of Railway Stations''. Yeovil: Patrick Stephens. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] (1852).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lner.info/co/GNR/kingscross.shtml| title=LNER Encyclopedia: The Great Northern Railway: Kings Cross Station| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technological advances led to the building of later structures like the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] (1883) and the [[Eiffel Tower]] (1889). The latter broke all previous limitations on how tall man-made objects could be. These engineering marvels radically altered the 19th-century urban environment and the daily lives of people. The human experience of time itself was altered, with the development of the electric [[telegraph]] from 1837,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Hubbard (1965), ''Cooke and Wheatstone and the Invention of the Electric Telegraph'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and the adoption of [[standard time]] by British railway companies from 1845, and in the rest of the world over the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Ian R. Bartky (January 1989). "The adoption of standard time". ''Technology and Culture'' 30 (1): 25–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

But despite continuing technological advances the idea that history and civilization were inherently progressive, and that progress was always good, came under increasing attack in the nineteenth century. Arguments arose that the values of the artist and those of society were not merely different, but that Society was antithetical to Progress, and could not move forward in its present form.  Early in the century, the philosopher [[Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860) (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', 1819) had called into question the previous optimism, and his ideas had an important influence on later thinkers, including Nietzsche.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt; Two of the most significant thinkers of the mid nineteenth century were biologist [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), author of ''[[On the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]]'' (1859), and political scientist [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883), author of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867). Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] undermined religious certainty and the idea of human uniqueness. In particular, the notion that human beings were driven by the same impulses as "lower animals" proved to be difficult to reconcile with the idea of an ennobling spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', vol. 2 (7th edition). New York: Norton, 2000, pp. 1051–1052.&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx argued that there were fundamental contradictions within the [[capitalist]] system, and that the workers were anything but free.&lt;ref&gt;Craig J. Calhoun (2002). ''Classical Sociological Theory''. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beginnings in the late nineteenth century===
Historians, and writers in different disciplines, have suggested various dates as starting points for modernism. Historian [[William Everdell]], for example, has argued that modernism began in the 1870s, when metaphorical (or [[ontological]]) continuity began to yield to the discrete with mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]]'s (1831–1916) [[Dedekind cut]], and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s (1844–1906) [[statistical thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="Everdell" /&gt; Everdell also thinks modernism in painting began in 1885–1886 with [[Seurat]]'s [[Divisionism]], the "dots" used to paint ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]''. On the other hand, visual art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] called [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) "the first real Modernist",&lt;ref&gt;Frascina and Harrison 1982, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; though he also wrote, "What can be safely called Modernism emerged in the middle of the last century—and rather locally, in France, with [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] in literature and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] in painting, and perhaps with [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], too, in prose fiction. (It was a while later, and not so locally, that Modernism appeared in [[Modernism (music)|music]] and [[Modern architecture|architecture]])."&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt; The poet Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''The Flowers of Evil''), and Flaubert's novel ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' were both published in 1857.

In the arts and letters, two important approaches developed separately in France, beginning in the 1860s. The first was [[Impressionism]], a school of painting that initially focused on work done, not in studios, but outdoors (''[[en plein air]]''). Impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners, and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored [[Paris Salon]], the Impressionists organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon. A significant event of 1863 was the [[Salon des Refusés]], created by [[Napoleon III|Emperor Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III]] to display all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon. While most were in standard styles, but by inferior artists, the work of Manet attracted tremendous attention, and opened commercial doors to the movement. The second French school was [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], which literary historians see beginning with Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867), and including the later poets, [[Arthur Rimbaud]] (1854–1891) ''Une Saison en Enfer'' (''A Season in Hell'', 1873), [[Paul Verlaine]] (1844–1896), [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] (1842–1898), and [[Paul Valéry]] (1871–1945). The symbolists "stressed the priority of suggestion and evocation over direct description and explicit analogy," and were especially interested in "the musical properties of language."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. [[Margaret Drabble]], Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 966.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Cabaret]], which gave birth to so many of the arts of modernism, including the immediate precursors of film, may be said to have begun in France in 1881 with the opening of the [[Le Chat Noir|Black Cat]] in [[Montmartre]], the beginning of the ironic monologue, and the founding of the Society of Incoherent Arts.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Dennis Cate and Mary Shaw, eds., ''The Spirit of Montmartre: Cabarets, Humor, and the Avant-Garde, 1875–1905''. New Brunswick, NJ: [[Rutgers University]], 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his friends and colleagues, even fellow painters Henri Matisse and [[Georges Braque]], were upset when they saw this painting.]]
Influential in the early days of modernism were the theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939). Freud's first major work was ''[[Studies on Hysteria]]'' (with [[Josef Breuer]], 1895). Central to Freud's thinking is the idea "of the primacy of the unconscious mind in mental life," so that all subjective reality was based on the play of basic drives and instincts, through which the outside world was perceived. Freud's description of subjective states involved an unconscious mind full of primal impulses, and counterbalancing self-imposed restrictions derived from social values.&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury/&gt;{{rp|538}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) was another major precursor of modernism,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gooding-Williams, "Nietzsche's Pursuit of Modernism",
''New German Critique'', No. 41, Special Issue on the Critiques of the Enlightenment. (Spring–Summer, 1987), pp. 95–108.&lt;/ref&gt; with a philosophy in which psychological drives, specifically the "[[will to power]]" (''Wille zur Macht''), was of central importance: "Nietzsche often identified life itself with 'will to power', that is, with an instinct for growth and durability."&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Magnus, "Friedrich Nietzsche". ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 19 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/414670/Friedrich-Nietzsche| title=Friedrich Nietzsche| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), on the other hand, emphasized the difference between scientific, clock time and the direct, subjective, human experience of time.&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;{{rp|131}} His work on time and consciousness "had a great influence on twentieth-century novelists," especially those Modernists who used the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] technique, such as [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[James Joyce]], and [[Virginia Woolf]] (1882–1941).&lt;ref&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guides to English Literature: The Twentieth Century'', ed. Linda R. Williams. London: Bloomsbury, 1992, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important in Bergson's philosophy was the idea of ''élan vital'', the life force, which "brings about the creative evolution of everything."&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;{{rp|132}} His philosophy also placed a high value on [[intuition]], though without rejecting the importance of the intellect.&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;{{rp|132}}

Important literary precursors of modernism were [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] (1821–1881), who wrote the novels ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866) and ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880);&lt;ref&gt;David Denby, ''New Yorker'', 11 June 2012, "Can Dostoevsky Still Kick You in the Gut?"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Whitman]] (1819–1892), who published the poetry collection ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' (1855–1891); and [[August Strindberg]] (1849–1912), especially his later plays, including the trilogy ''To Damascus'' 1898–1901, ''A Dream Play'' (1902) and ''The Ghost Sonata'' (1907). [[Henry James]] has also been suggested as a significant precursor, in a work as early as ''[[The Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1881).&lt;ref&gt;[[M. H. Abrams]], ''A Glossary of Literary Terms''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1999), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the collision of ideals derived from Romanticism, and an attempt to find a way for knowledge to explain that which was as yet unknown, came the first wave of works in the first decade of the 20th century, which, while their authors considered them extensions of existing trends in art, broke the implicit contract with the general public that artists were the interpreters and representatives of bourgeois culture and ideas. These "Modernist" landmarks include the [[atonality|atonal]] ending of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[String quartets (Schoenberg)|Second String Quartet]] in 1908, the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] paintings of [[Wassily Kandinsky]] starting in 1903, and culminating with his first abstract painting and the founding of the [[Der Blaue Reiter|Blue Rider]] group in [[Munich]] in 1911, and the rise of [[fauvism]] and the inventions of [[cubism]] from the studios of [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], and others, in the years between 1900 and 1910.

An important aspect of modernism is how it relates to tradition through its adoption of techniques like reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody in new forms.&lt;ref name="Eco90"&gt;Eco (1990) p. 95 quote:{{quotation|Each of the types of repetition that we have examined is not limited to the mass media but belongs by right to the entire history of artistic creativity; [[plagiarism]], quotation, parody, the ironic retake are typical of the entire artistic-literary tradition.&lt;br&gt;Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the "modern" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of "creation from nothingness," with its techniques of [[collage]], mustachios on the [[Mona Lisa]], art about art, and so on.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner98p489"&gt;Steiner (1998) pp. 489–490 quote:{{quotation|(pp. 489–490) The Modernist movement which dominated art, music, letters during the first half of the century was, at critical points, a strategy of conservation, of custodianship. Stravinsky's genius developed through phases of recapitulation. He took from [[Guillaume de Machaut|Machaut]], [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]], [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]. He mimed [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], the [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] piano sonatas, the symphonies of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], the operas of [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]] and [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]. He incorporated [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]] into his own idiom. In each instance the listener was meant to recognize the source, to grasp the intent of a transformation which left salient aspects of the original intact. The history of Picasso is marked by retrospection. The explicit variations on classical pastoral themes, the citations from and ''pastiches'' of [[Rembrandt]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], Manet, are external products of a constant revision, a 'seeing again' in the light of technical and cultural shifts. Had we only Picasso's sculptures, graphics, and paintings, we could reconstruct a fair portion of the development of the arts from the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] to [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. In 20th-century literature, the elements of reprise have been obsessive, and they have organized precisely those texts which at first seemed most revolutionary. ''[[The Waste Land]]'', ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Pound's ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'' are deliberate assemblages, in-gatherings of a cultural past felt to be in danger of dissolution. The long sequence of imitations, translations, masked quotations, and explicit historical paintings in [[Robert Lowell]]'s ''History'' has carried the same technique into the 1970s. [...] In Modernism ''collage'' has been the representative device. The new, even at its most scandalous, has been set against an informing background and framework of tradition. Stravinsky, Picasso, Braque, [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound|Pound]]—the 'makers of the new'—have been neo-classics, often as observant of [[Western canon|canonic]] precedent as their 17th-century forebears.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. S. Eliot]] made significant comments on the relation of the artist to tradition, including: "[W]e shall often find that not only the best, but the most individual parts of [a poet's] work, may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously."&lt;ref name="Eliot19"&gt;[[T. S. Eliot]] "Tradition and the individual talent" (1919), in ''Selected Essays''. Paperback edition. (Faber &amp; Faber, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship of Modernism with tradition was complex, as literary scholar Peter Childs indicates: "There were paradoxical if not opposed trends towards revolutionary and reactionary positions, fear of the new and delight at the disappearance of the old, nihilism and fanatical enthusiasm, creativity and despair."&lt;ref name="Childs2000p17"&gt;Childs, Peter [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_WXXDeXqm4C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq ''Modernism''] (Routledge, 2000). {{ISBN|0415196477}}. p. 17. Accessed on 8 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of how Modernist art can be both revolutionary and yet be related to past tradition, is the music of the composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. On the one hand Schoenberg rejected traditional [[tonality|tonal harmony]], the hierarchical system of organizing works of music that had guided music making for at least a century and a half. He believed he had discovered a wholly new way of organizing sound, based in the use of [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-note rows]]. Yet while this was indeed wholly new, its origins can be traced back in the work of earlier composers, such as [[Franz Liszt]],&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''New Grove'', 11:28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Wagner]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Max Reger]].&lt;ref&gt;*Anon. 2000.

Rochester, NY: Boydell Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it must be noted that Schoenberg also wrote tonal music throughout his career.

In the world of art, in the first decade of the 20th century, young painters such as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]] were causing a shock with their rejection of traditional [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] as the means of structuring paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html| title=Biography of Henri Matisse| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/cubism| title=MoMA| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the impressionist [[Monet]] had already been innovative in his use of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cmon/hd_cmon.htm| title=Claude Monet (1840–1926)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, as Picasso was painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', [[Oskar Kokoschka]] was writing ''Mörder, Hoffnung der Frauen'' (''Murderer, Hope of Women''), the first Expressionist play (produced with scandal in 1909), and Arnold Schoenberg was composing his String Quartet No.2 in F sharp minor (1908), his first composition without a tonal centre.

A primary influence that led to [[Cubism]] was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of [[Paul Cézanne]], which were displayed in a retrospective at the 1907 [[Salon d'Automne]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent| title=The Collection| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form; instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Metzinger]], ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt; Cubism was brought to the attention of the general public for the first time in 1911 at the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] in Paris (held 21 April&amp;nbsp;– 13 June). [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] were shown together in Room 41, provoking a 'scandal' out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris and beyond. Also in 1911, [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] painted ''Bild mit Kreis'' (''Picture with a Circle''), which he later called the first abstract painting.&lt;ref name=Sheppard&gt;Richard Sheppard, ''Modernism–Dada–Postmodernism''. Northwestern Univ. Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167}} In 1912, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote the first (and only) major Cubist manifesto, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', published in time for the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], the largest Cubist exhibition to date. In 1912 Metzinger painted and exhibited his enchanting ''[[La Femme au Cheval]] (Woman with a Horse)'' and ''Danseuse au Café ([[Dancer in a Café]])''. Albert Gleizes painted and exhibited his ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'' and his monumental ''Le Dépiquage des Moissons ([[Harvest Threshing]])''. This work, along with ''La Ville de Paris'' (''City of Paris'') by [[Robert Delaunay]], was the largest and most ambitious Cubist painting undertaken during the pre-War Cubist period.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Daniel, ''Albert Gleizes 1881–1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'' (exh. cat.). The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1964, pp. 12–25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, a group of four German artists, led by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], formed [[Die Brücke]] (the Bridge) in the city of [[Dresden]]. This was arguably the founding organization for the [[German Expressionist]] movement, though they did not use the word itself. A few years later, in 1911, a like-minded group of young artists formed [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider) in Munich. The name came from [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s ''Der Blaue Reiter'' painting of 1903. Among their members were Kandinsky, [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[August Macke]]. However, the term "Expressionism" did not firmly establish itself until 1913.&lt;ref name=Sheppard/&gt;{{rp|274}} Though initially mainly a German artistic movement,&lt;ref&gt;Note the parallel French movement Fauvism and the English [[Vorticism]]: "The Fauvist movement has been compared to German Expressionism, both projecting brilliant colors and spontaneous brushwork, and indebted to the same late nineteenth-century sources, especially [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]]." Sabine Rewald, "Fauvism". In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fauv/hd_fauv.htm (October 2004); and "Vorticism can be thought of as English Expressionism"]. Sherrill E. Grace, ''Regression and Apocalypse: Studies in North American Literary Expressionism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1989, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; most predominant in painting, poetry and the theatre between 1910 and 1930, most precursors of the movement were not German. Furthermore, there have been expressionist writers of prose fiction, as well as non-German speaking expressionist writers, and, while the movement had declined in Germany with the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in the 1930s, there were subsequent expressionist works.
[[File:Egon Schiele 061.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of Eduard Kosmack'' (1910) by [[Egon Schiele]]]]
Expressionism is notoriously difficult to define, in part because it "overlapped with other major 'isms' of the modernist period: with [[Futurism]], [[Vorticism]], [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Dada]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sherrill E. Grace, ''Regression and Apocalypse: Studies in North American Literary Expressionism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1989, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Murphy also comments: "the search for an all-inclusive definition is problematic to the extent that the most challenging expressionists" such as the novelist [[Franz Kafka]], poet [[Gottfried Benn]], and novelist [[Alfred Döblin]] were simultaneously the most vociferous anti-expressionists.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;Richard Murphy, ''Theorizing the Avant-Garde: Modernism, Expressionism, and the Problem of Postmodernity''. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} What, however, can be said, is that it was a movement that developed in the early 20th century mainly in Germany in reaction to the dehumanizing effect of industrialization and the growth of cities, and that "one of the central means by which expressionism identifies itself as an [[avant-garde]] movement, and by which it marks its distance to traditions and the cultural institution as a whole is through its relationship to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and the dominant conventions of representation."&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;{{rp|43}} More explicitly: that the expressionists rejected the ideology of realism.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;{{rp|43–48}} &lt;ref&gt;Walter H. Sokel, ''The Writer in Extremis''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1959, especially Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a concentrated Expressionist movement in early 20th century German theatre, of which [[Georg Kaiser]] and [[Ernst Toller]] were the most famous playwrights. Other notable Expressionist dramatists included [[Reinhard Sorge]], [[Walter Hasenclever]], [[Hans Henny Jahnn]], and [[Arnolt Bronnen]]. They looked back to Swedish playwright [[August Strindberg]] and German actor and dramatist [[Frank Wedekind]] as precursors of their [[dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] experiments. [[Oskar Kokoschka]]'s ''[[Murderer, the Hope of Women]]'' was the first fully Expressionist work for the theatre, which opened on 4 July 1909 in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus (2005, 55–57).&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme simplification of characters to mythic [[archetype|types]], choral effects, declamatory dialogue and heightened intensity would become characteristic of later Expressionist plays. The first full-length Expressionist play was ''[[The Son (play)|The Son]]'' by Walter Hasenclever, which was published in 1914 and first performed in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Rorrison (1998, 475) and Schürer (1997b, ix, xiv).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Futurism]] is yet another modernist movement. In 1909, the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' published [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|F. T. Marinetti]]'s first manifesto. Soon afterwards a group of painters ([[Giacomo Balla]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Luigi Russolo]], and [[Gino Severini]]) co-signed the [[Futurist Manifesto]]. Modeled on [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]' famous "[[Communist Manifesto]]" (1848), such manifestoes put forward ideas that were meant to provoke and to gather followers. However, arguments in favor of geometric or purely abstract painting were, at this time, largely confined to "little magazines" which had only tiny circulations. Modernist primitivism and pessimism were controversial, and the mainstream in the first decade of the 20th century was still inclined towards a faith in progress and liberal optimism.

[[Abstract art|Abstract]] artists, taking as their examples the [[impressionists]], as well as [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) and [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944), began with the assumption that color and [[shape]], not the depiction of the natural world, formed the essential characteristics of art.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Arnheim, ''Visual Thinking''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western art]] had been, from the [[Renaissance]] up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gooding, ''Abstract Art'', [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Piet Mondrian]], and [[Kazimir Malevich]] all believed in redefining art as the arrangement of pure color. The use of [[photography]], which had rendered much of the representational function of visual art obsolete, strongly affected this aspect of modernism.&lt;ref name="impressionism758"&gt;Sontag, Susan (1977) On Photography, Penguin, London&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modern architecture|Modernist architects]] and designers, such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Le Corbusier]], believed that new technology rendered old styles of building obsolete. Le Corbusier thought that buildings should function as "machines for living in", analogous to cars, which he saw as machines for traveling in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/137221/Le-Corbusier| title=Le Corbusier| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as cars had replaced the horse, so modernist design should reject the old styles and structures inherited from [[Ancient Greece]] or from the [[Middle Ages]]. Following this machine aesthetic, modernist designers typically rejected decorative motifs in design, preferring to emphasize the materials used and pure geometrical forms.&lt;ref name="GEMbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|title=Growth, Efficiency, and Modernism|last=|first=|year=2006|website=|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration|pages=14–15|accessdate=18 February 2017|origyear=2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110331105542/http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[skyscraper]] is the archetypal modernist building, and the Wainwright Building, a 10-story office building built 1890–91, in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States, is among the [[early skyscrapers|first skyscrapers]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Skyscraper."

[[File:Pedestal Table in the Studio.jpg|thumb|[[André Masson]], ''Pedestal Table in the Studio'' 1922, early example of [[Surrealism]]]]

In 1913—which was the year of philosopher [[Edmund Husserl]]'s ''Ideas'', physicist [[Niels Bohr]]'s quantized atom, [[Ezra Pound]]'s founding of [[imagism]], the [[Armory Show]] in New York, and in [[Saint Petersburg]] the "first futurist opera", [[Mikhail Matyushin]]'s ''[[Victory over the Sun]]''—another Russian composer, [[Igor Stravinsky]], composed ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', a ballet that depicts [[human sacrifice]], and has a musical score full of dissonance and primitive rhythm. This caused uproar on its first performance in Paris. At this time though modernism was still "progressive", increasingly it saw traditional forms and traditional social arrangements as hindering progress, and was recasting the artist as a revolutionary, engaged in overthrowing rather than enlightening society. Also in 1913 a less violent event occurred in France with the publication of the first volume of [[Marcel Proust]]'s important novel sequence ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]'' (1913–1927) (''In Search of Lost Time''). This is often presented as an early example of a writer using the [[stream-of-consciousness technique]], but Robert Humphrey comments that Proust "is concerned only with the reminiscent aspect of consciousness" and that he "was deliberately recapturing the past for the purpose of communicating; hence he did not write a stream-of-consciousness novel."&lt;ref&gt;''Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel'' (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles: University of California, 1954), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of consciousness was an important modernist literary innovation, and it has been suggested that [[Arthur Schnitzler]] (1862–1931) was the first to make full use of it in his short story "Leutnant Gustl" ("None but the Brave") (1900).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133295/stream-of-consciousness Encyclopædia Britannica Online, ''Stream of Consciousness'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy Richardson]] was the first English writer to use it, in the early volumes of her [[novel sequence]] ''[[Pilgrimage (novel sequence)|Pilgrimage]]'' (1915–67).&lt;ref&gt;In a review of these novels, in ''The Egoist'', April 1918, [[May Sinclair]] first applied the term "stream of consciousness" in a literary context, in her discussion of Richardson's stylistic innovations.&lt;/ref&gt; The other modernist novelists that are associated with the use of this narrative technique include [[James Joyce]] in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) and [[Italo Svevo]] in ''[[Zeno's Conscience|La coscienza di Zeno]]'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Beno|date=1990|title=Review of Italo Svevo: A Double Life|journal=Italica|volume=67|issue=3|pages=395–400|doi=10.2307/478649|jstor=478649|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the coming of the [[World War I|Great War]] of 1914–18 and the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the world was drastically changed and doubt cast on the beliefs and institutions of the past. The failure of the previous status quo seemed self-evident to a generation that had seen millions die fighting over scraps of earth: prior to 1914 it had been argued that no one would fight such a war, since the cost was too high. The birth of a machine age which had made major changes in the conditions of daily life in the 19th century now had radically changed the nature of warfare. The traumatic nature of recent experience altered basic assumptions, and realistic depiction of life in the arts seemed inadequate when faced with the fantastically surreal nature of [[trench warfare]]. The view that mankind was making steady moral progress now seemed ridiculous in the face of the senseless slaughter, described in works such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s novel ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1929). Therefore, modernism's view of reality, which had been a minority taste before the war, became more generally accepted in the 1920s.

In literature and visual art some Modernists sought to defy expectations mainly in order to make their art more vivid, or to force the audience to take the trouble to question their own preconceptions. This aspect of modernism has often seemed a reaction to [[consumerism|consumer culture]], which developed in Europe and North America in the late 19th century. Whereas most manufacturers try to make products that will be marketable by appealing to preferences and prejudices, [[high modernism|high modernists]] rejected such consumerist attitudes in order to undermine conventional thinking. The art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] expounded this theory of modernism in his essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg labeled the products of consumer culture "[[kitsch]]", because their design aimed simply to have maximum appeal, with any difficult features removed. For Greenberg, modernism thus formed a reaction against the development of such examples of modern consumer culture as commercial [[popular music]], [[Film|Hollywood]], and advertising. Greenberg associated this with the revolutionary rejection of capitalism.

Some Modernists saw themselves as part of a revolutionary culture that included political revolution. In [[Russia]] after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]] there was indeed initially a burgeoning of avant-garde cultural activity, which included [[Russian Futurism]]. However others rejected conventional politics as well as artistic conventions, believing that a revolution of [[political consciousness]] had greater importance than a change in political structures. But many modernists saw themselves as apolitical. Others, such as [[T. S. Eliot]], rejected mass [[popular culture]] from a conservative position. Some even argue that modernism in literature and art functioned to sustain an [[elitism|elite]] culture which excluded the majority of the population.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Surrealism]], which originated in the early 1920s, came to be regarded by the public as the most extreme form of modernism, or "the avant-garde of Modernism".&lt;ref name="DebordSurrealismModernism"&gt;[[Guy Debord]], 18 November 1958, as quoted in [http://www.notbored.org/surrealism.html ''Supreme Height of the Defenders of Surrealism in Paris and the Revelation of their Real Value''], Situationist International #2&lt;/ref&gt; The word "surrealist" was coined by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and first appeared in the preface to his play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tirésias]]'', which was written in 1903 and first performed in 1917. Major surrealists include [[Paul Éluard]], [[Robert Desnos]],&lt;ref name="Diary of a Genius"&gt;[[Salvador Dalí|Dalí, Salvador]], ''[http://www.bartleby.com/66/82/15682.html Diary of a Genius]'' quoted in ''The Columbia World of Quotations'' (1996) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406060625/http://www.bartleby.com/66/82/15682.html |date=6 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Ernst]], [[Hans Arp]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Joan Miró]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Dawn Ades, with Matthew Gale: "Surrealism", ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art''.

By 1930, Modernism had won a place in the establishment, including the political and artistic establishment, although by this time Modernism itself had changed.

===Modernism continues: 1930–1945===
Modernism continued to evolve during the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1932 composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] worked on ''[[Moses und Aron]]'', one of the first operas to make use of the [[twelve-tone technique]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Schoenberg, Arnold (1874 - 1951), composer : Grove Music Online - oi|volume=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.25024|year=2001|last1=Neighbour|first1=O.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pablo Picasso painted in 1937 ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', his cubist condemnation of [[fascism]], while in 1939 [[James Joyce]] pushed the boundaries of the modern novel further with ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. Also by 1930 Modernism began to influence mainstream culture, so that, for example,  ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine began publishing work, influenced by Modernism, by young writers and humorists like [[Dorothy Parker]],&lt;ref&gt;Caren Irr, "A Gendered Collision: Sentimentalism and Modernism in Dorothy Parker's Poetry and Fiction" (review). ''American Literature'', Volume 73, Number 4, December 2001 pp. 880–881.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Benchley]], [[E. B. White]], [[S. J. Perelman]], and [[James Thurber]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Keyser, "Robert Benchley and Dorothy Parker 'In Broadway Playhouses': Middlebrow Theatricality and Sophisticated Humour". ''Modernist Cultures'', Volume 6, pp. 121–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman is highly regarded for his humorous short stories that he published in magazines in the 1930s and 1940s, most often in ''The New Yorker'', which are considered to be the first examples of [[surrealist humor]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Barthelme]], 1982 interview in ''[[Partisan Review]]'', Volume 49, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern ideas in art also began to appear more frequently in commercials and logos, an early example of which, from 1916, is the famous [[London Underground]] logo designed by [[Edward Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=conObject.2902 |work=Exploring 20th Century London |publisher=Renaissance London/[[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council|MLA]] |title=A full alphabet of Johnston wood letter types |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most visible changes of this period was the adoption of new technologies into daily life of ordinary people in Western Europe and North America. Electricity, the telephone, the radio, the automobile—and the need to work with them, repair them and live with them—created social change. The kind of disruptive moment that only a few knew in the 1880s became a common occurrence. For example, the speed of communication reserved for the stock brokers of 1890 became part of family life, at least in middle class North America. Associated with urbanization and changing social mores also came smaller families and changed relationships between parents and their children.

[[File:Underground.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|thumb|[[London Underground]] logo designed by [[Edward Johnston]]. This is modern version (with minor modifications) of one that was first used in 1916.]]
Another strong influence at this time was [[Marxism]]. After the generally primitivistic/irrationalist aspect of pre-World War I Modernism, which for many Modernists precluded any attachment to merely political solutions, and the [[neoclassicism]] of the 1920s, as represented most famously by [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]—which rejected popular solutions to modern problems—the rise of [[Fascism]], the [[Great Depression]], and the march to war helped to radicalise a generation. [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[André Breton]], [[Louis Aragon]] and the philosophers [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Walter Benjamin]] are perhaps the most famous exemplars of this Modernist form of Marxism. There were, however, also Modernists explicitly of 'the right', including [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], T. S. Eliot, [[Ezra Pound]], the Dutch author [[Menno ter Braak]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Pericles Lewis, "Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics" (review). ''Modernism/modernity'', Volume 8, Number 4, November 2001, pp. 696–698.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant Modernist literary works continued to be created in the 1920s and 1930s, including further novels by [[Marcel Proust]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Robert Musil]], and [[Dorothy Richardson]]. The American Modernist dramatist [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s career began in 1914, but his major works appeared in the 1920s, 1930s and early 1940s. Two other significant Modernist dramatists writing in the 1920s and 1930s were [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Federico García Lorca]]. [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' was privately published in 1928, while another important landmark for the history of the modern novel came with the publication of [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' in 1929. In the 1930s, in addition to further major works by Faulkner, [[Samuel Beckett]] published his first major work, the novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]'' (1938). Then in 1939 James Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' appeared. This is written in a largely [[idioglossia|idiosyncratic language]], consisting of a mixture of standard English [[lexical item]]s and [[Neologism|neologistic]] [[multilingual]] [[pun]]s and [[portmanteau]] words, which attempts to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;James Mercanton (1967). ''Les heures de James Joyce''. Diffusion PUF.&lt;/ref&gt; In poetry T. S. Eliot, [[E. E. Cummings]], and [[Wallace Stevens]] were writing from the 1920s until the 1950s. While Modernist poetry in English is often viewed as an American phenomenon, with leading exponents including Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, [[Marianne Moore]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[H.D.]], and [[Louis Zukofsky]], there were important British Modernist poets, including [[David Jones (artist-poet)|David Jones]], [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], [[Basil Bunting]], and [[W. H. Auden]]. European Modernist poets include [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Constantine Cavafy]], and [[Paul Valéry]].

The Modernist movement continued during this period in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. In 1930 composer [[Dimitri Shostakovich]]'s (1906–1975) opera ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' was premiered, in which he uses a [[Musical montage|montage]] of different styles, including [[folk music]], [[popular song]] and [[atonality]]. Amongst his influences was [[Alban Berg]]'s (1985–1935) opera ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1925), which "had made a tremendous impression on Shostakovich when it was staged in Leningrad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boosey.com/pages/opera/moreDetails.asp?musicID=896 Note by Gerard McBurney on ''The Nose'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1932 [[Socialist realism]] began to oust Modernism in the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov, ''Unknown Socialist Realism.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 541–545.&lt;/ref&gt; Alban Berg wrote another significant, though incomplete, Modernist opera, ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', which premiered in 1937. Berg's [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] was first performed in 1935. Like Shostakovich, other composers faced difficulties in this period. In Germany [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874–1951) was forced to flee to the U.S. when Hitler came to power in 1933, because of his Modernist [[atonal]] style as well as his Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref name="Oxford Music Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com|title=Home Page in Oxford Music Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major works from this period are a [[Violin Concerto (Schoenberg)|Violin Concerto]], Op. 36 (1934/36), and [[Piano Concerto (Schoenberg)|Piano Concerto]], Op. 42 (1942). Schoenberg also wrote tonal music in this period with the Suite for Strings in G major (1935) and the [[Chamber Symphony No. 2 (Schoenberg)|Chamber Symphony No. 2]] in E{{music|flat}} minor, Op. 38 (begun in 1906, completed in 1939).&lt;ref name="Oxford Music Online" /&gt; During this time Hungarian Modernist [[Béla Bartók]] (1881–1945) produced a number of major works, including ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' (1936) and the ''[[Divertimento for String Orchestra (Bartók)|Divertimento for String Orchestra]]'' (1939), [[String Quartet No. 5 (Bartók)|String Quartet No. 5]] (1934), and [[String Quartet No. 6 (Bartók)|No. 6]] (his last, 1939). But he too left for the US in 1940, because of the rise of [[fascism]] in Hungary.&lt;ref name="Oxford Music Online" /&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky]] (1882–1971) continued writing in his [[neoclassical style]] during the 1930s and 1940s, writing works like the ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' (1930), [[Symphony in C (Stravinsky)|Symphony in C]] (1940) and ''[[Symphony in Three Movements (Stravinsky)|Symphony in Three Movements]]'' (1945). He also emigrated to the US because of World War II. [[Olivier Messiaen]] (1908–1992), however, served in the French army during the war and was imprisoned at [[Stalag VIII-A]] by the Germans, where he composed his famous ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]'' ("Quartet for the End of Time"). The quartet was first performed in January 1941 to an audience of prisoners and prison guards.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Rischin. ''For the End of Time: The Story of the Messiaen Quartet''. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In painting, during the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], modernism is defined by [[Surrealism]], late [[Cubism]], [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], [[Dada]], German [[Expressionism]], and Modernist and masterful color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] as well as the abstractions of artists like [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] which characterized the European art scene. In Germany, [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II, while in America, modernism is seen in the form of [[American Scene painting]] and the [[social realism]] and [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. Modernism is defined in [[Latin America]] by painters [[Joaquín Torres García]] from Uruguay and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, while the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]], began a renaissance of the arts for the region, characterized by a freer use of color and an emphasis on political messages.

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. Frida Kahlo's (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition, which were often bloody and violent. Frida Kahlo's Symbolist works relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature.

Political activism was an important piece of David Siqueiros' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. The young [[Jackson Pollock]] attended the workshop and helped build [[float (parade)|floats]] for the parade.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was [[Bombing of Guernica|bombed]] by Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of [[Francisco Franco]] to overthrow the Basque government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural-sized ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.
[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|[[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', 1937, protest against Fascism]]

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and through the years of World War II, American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]], in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The scene was inspired by a diner in [[Greenwich Village]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by [[Grant Wood]] from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting; like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s 1919 ''[[Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

The situation for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazis' power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. ''[[Degenerate art]]'' was a term adopted by the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany for virtually all [[modern art]]. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevist]] in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely. [[Degenerate Art Exhibition|Degenerate Art]] was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with modernism and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] that many left for the Americas. German artist [[Max Beckmann]] and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and others were just beginning to come of age.

Arshile Gorky's portrait of someone who might be Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, cubism and surrealism. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]], Gorky created biomorphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

===Introduction===
While ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'' states that modernism ended by c. 1939&lt;ref name="British Literature' 2006"&gt;J. H. Dettmar, "Modernism", in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', ed. David Scott Kastan. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to British and American literature, "When (if) Modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to Modernism occurred."&lt;ref&gt;"Modernism", in ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press Inc. Oxford Reference Online.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clement Greenberg sees modernism ending in the 1930s, with the exception of the visual and performing arts,&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt; but with regard to music, [[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]] notes that, while Modernism "seemed to be a spent force" by the late 1920s, after World War II, "a new generation of composers—[[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], [[Jean Barraqué|Barraqué]], [[Milton Babbitt|Babbitt]], [[Luigi Nono|Nono]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]], [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]]" revived modernism".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Griffiths, "Modernism", ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', ed. Alison Latham. Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact many literary Modernists lived into the 1950s and 1960s, though generally they were no longer producing major works. The term "[[late modernism]]" is also sometimes applied to Modernist works published after 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Hindrichs, "Late Modernism, 1928–1945: Criticism and Theory", ''Literature Compass'', Volume 8, Issue 11, pp. 840–855, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Dettmar, "Modernism", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', ed. David Scott Kastan. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Modernists (or late Modernists) still publishing after 1945 were [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[John Cowper Powys]], and [[Ezra Pound]]. [[Basil Bunting]], born in 1901, published his most important Modernist poem ''[[Briggflatts]]'' in 1965. In addition, [[Hermann Broch]]'s ''[[The Death of Virgil]]'' was published in 1945 and [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (novel)|Doctor Faustus]]'' in 1947. [[Samuel Beckett]], who died in 1989, has been described as a "later Modernist".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Dickstein, "An Outsider to His Own Life", Books, ''The New York Times'', 3 August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett is a writer with roots in the [[expressionist]] tradition of Modernism, who produced works from the 1930s until the 1980s, including ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'' (1951), ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1953), ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961), and ''[[Rockaby]]'' (1981). The terms "[[minimalist]]" and "[[post-Modernist]]" have also been applied to his later works.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Irish Literature'', ed. John Wilson Foster. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The poets [[Charles Olson]] (1910–1970) and [[J. H. Prynne]] (born 1936) are among the writers in the second half of the 20th century who have been described as late Modernists.&lt;ref&gt;''Late Modernist Poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors; see also Prynne's publisher, Bloodaxe Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the term "late modernism" has been redefined by at least one critic and used to refer to works written after 1945, rather than 1930. With this usage goes the idea that the ideology of modernism was significantly re-shaped by the events of [[World War II]], especially [[the Holocaust]] and the dropping of the atom bomb.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Mellors, ''Late Modernist Poetics: From Pound to Prynne''&lt;/ref&gt;

The postwar period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In [[Paris]] (the former center of European culture and the former capital of the art world) the climate for art was a disaster. Important collectors, dealers, and Modernist artists, writers, and poets had fled Europe for New York and America. The [[surrealists]] and modern artists from every cultural center of Europe had fled the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]], remained in France and survived.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a Modernist movement that combined lessons learned from Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, [[Pierre Matisse]]'s gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors.

Paris, moreover, recaptured much of its luster in the 1950s and 60s as the center of a machine art florescence, with both of the leading machine art sculptors [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[Nicolas Schöffer]] having moved there to launch their careers—and which florescence, in light of the technocentric character of modern life, may well have a particularly long lasting influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/1/4|author=Juliette Bessette|date=23 January 2018|title=The Machine as Art (in the 20th Century): An Introduction|journal=Arts|volume=7|page=4|doi=10.3390/arts7010004|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre of the Absurd===
[[File:En attendant Godot, Festival d'Avignon, 1978.jpeg|left|thumb|Samuel Beckett's ''[[En attendant Godot]]'', (''Waiting for Godot'') Festival d'Avignon, 1978]]
The term "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]" is applied to plays, written primarily by Europeans, that express the belief that human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down. Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hutchinson Encyclopedia'', Millennium Edition, Helicon 1999&lt;/ref&gt; While there are significant precursors, including [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873–1907), the Theatre of the Absurd is generally seen as beginning in the 1950s with the plays of [[Samuel Beckett]].

Critic [[Martin Esslin]] coined the term in his 1960 essay "Theatre of the Absurd". He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way [[Albert Camus]] uses the term in his 1942 essay, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm University of Glasgow, School of Modern Languages and Cultures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |date=23 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, and/or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. Though the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to [[vaudeville]], mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the "[[well-made play]]".

Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906–1989), [[Eugène Ionesco]] (1909–1994), [[Jean Genet]] (1910–1986), [[Harold Pinter]] (1930–2008), [[Tom Stoppard]] (born 1937), [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Alexander Vvedensky]] (1904–1941), [[Daniil Kharms]] (1905–1942), [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] (1921–1990), [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] (born 1929), [[Fernando Arrabal]] (born 1932), [[Václav Havel]] (1936–2011) and [[Edward Albee]] (1928–2016).

===Pollock and abstract influences===
During the late 1940s [[Jackson Pollock]]'s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture in the early 20th century via [[Cubism]] and constructed [[sculpture]], Pollock redefined the way art is made. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all who came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—placing unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artistic and industrial materials; dripping and throwing linear skeins of paint; drawing, staining, and brushing; using imagery and nonimagery—essentially blasted artmaking beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism generally expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities available to artists for the creation of new works of art.
The other [[abstract expressionists]] followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]] and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. Rereadings into abstract art by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catherine de Zegher]]&lt;ref&gt;De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; critically show, however, that pioneering women artists who produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by official accounts of its history.

===International figures from British art===
[[Henry Moore]] (1898–1986) emerged after [[World War II]] as Britain's leading [[Sculpture|sculptor]]. He was best known for his semi-[[abstract art|abstract]] monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art. His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures, usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces.
[[File:Moore_Große_liegende_Frauenfigur_1957_Zürich.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Moore]], ''Reclining Figure'' (1957). In front of the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]], Switzerland.]]

In the 1950s, Moore began to receive increasingly significant commissions, including a reclining figure for the [[UNESCO]] building in Paris in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unesco.org/artcollection/DetailAction.do?&amp;idOeuvre=1547&amp;nouvelleLangue=en Moore, Henry]". [[UNESCO]]. Retrieved on 16 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; With many more public works of art, the scale of Moore's sculptures grew significantly. The last three decades of Moore's life continued in a similar vein, with several major retrospectives taking place around the world, notably a prominent exhibition in the summer of 1972 in the grounds of the [[Belvedere (fort)|Forte di Belvedere]] overlooking [[Florence]]. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. On the campus of the [[University of Chicago]] in December 1967, 25 years to the minute after the team of physicists led by [[Enrico Fermi]] achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, Moore's ''[[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)|Nuclear Energy]]'' was unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;2 December 1967.

''Henry Moore: Space, Sculpture, Politics''. Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate, 2003. p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Chicago, Moore commemorated science with a large bronze sundial, locally named ''[[Man Enters the Cosmos]]'' (1980), which was commissioned to recognise the [[space exploration]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:20070701 Man Enters The Cosmos Explanatory Plaques.JPG|Enscripted on the plaque at the base of the sculpture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The "London School" of figurative painters, including [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] (1909–1992), [[Lucian Freud]] (1922–2011), [[Frank Auerbach]] (born 1931), [[Leon Kossoff]] (born 1926), and [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]] (1928–1995), have received widespread international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 219–225&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis Bacon was an Irish-born British figurative painter known for his bold, graphic and emotionally raw imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Harrison, ''In Camera: Francis Bacon: Photography, Film and the Practice of Painting'', London: Thames and Hudson, 2006, 7&lt;/ref&gt; His painterly but abstracted figures typically appear isolated in glass or steel geometrical cages set against flat, nondescript backgrounds. Bacon began painting during his early 20s but worked only sporadically until his mid-30s. His breakthrough came with the 1944 [[triptych]] ''[[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]]'' which sealed his reputation as a uniquely bleak chronicler of the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/francis_bacon/index.html?inline=nyt-per| title=Francis Bacon| author=Ken Johnson| date=3 December 2015| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His output can be crudely described as consisting of sequences or variations on a single motif; beginning with the 1940s male heads isolated in rooms, the early 1950s screaming popes, and mid to late 1950s animals and lone figures suspended in geometric structures. These were followed by his early 1960s modern variations of the crucifixion in the triptych format. From the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Bacon mainly produced strikingly compassionate portraits of friends. Following the suicide of his lover George Dyer in 1971, his art became more personal, inward-looking, and preoccupied with themes and motifs of death. During his lifetime, Bacon was equally reviled and acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', "Obituary", 29 April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucian Freud]] was a German-born British painter, known chiefly for his thickly [[impasto]]ed portrait and figure paintings, who was widely considered the pre-eminent British artist of his time.&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;William Grimes.

Ordinary people—many of them his friends—stared wide-eyed from the canvas, vulnerable to the artist's ruthless inspection."&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt;

===In the 1960s after abstract expressionism===
{{Main|Post-painterly abstraction|Color Field|Lyrical abstraction|Arte Povera|Process art|Western painting}}
In [[abstract art|abstract painting]] during the 1950s and 1960s several new directions like [[hard-edge painting]] and other forms of [[geometric abstraction]] began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of [[post-painterly abstraction]] when he curated an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. [[Color Field]] painting, hard-edge painting and [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. "Young Lyrical Painters", ''Art in America'', v. 57, n. 6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as radical new directions.

By the late 1960s however, [[postminimalism]], [[process art]] and [[Arte Povera]]&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;Sarah Douglas, ''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", ''[[Art+Auction]]'', March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; also emerged as revolutionary concepts and movements that encompassed both painting and sculpture, via lyrical abstraction and the postminimalist movement, and in early [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, and plastic and real space. [[Nancy Graves]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Colin McCahon]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Alan Saret]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Mario Merz]] and [[Peter Reginato]] were some of the younger artists who emerged during the era of [[late modernism]] that spawned the heyday of the art of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker.

===Pop art===
[[File:I was a Rich Man's Plaything 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Eduardo Paolozzi]]. ''I was a Rich Man's Plaything'' (1947) is considered the initial standard bearer of "pop art" and first to display the word "pop".]]
{{Main|Pop art|Western painting}}
In 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'', the first major [[pop art]] group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in England in 1958 the term "Pop Art" was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] to describe paintings that celebrated the [[consumerism]] of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the [[hermeneutic]] and psychological interior in favor of art that depicted and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (who created the groundbreaking ''I was a Rich Man's Plaything'', 1947) are considered seminal examples in the movement. Meanwhile, in the downtown scene in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] 10th Street galleries, artists were formulating an American version of pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show the works of [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited the works of other American artists, including those of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] for most of their careers. There is a connection between the radical works of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious [[Dada]]ists with a sense of humor, and pop artists like Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein, whose paintings reproduce the look of [[Ben-Day dots]], a technique used in commercial reproduction.

===Minimalism===
{{Main|Minimalism|Minimal music|Literary minimalism|Postminimalism|20th-century Western painting}}
[[Minimalism]] describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially [[Visual arts|visual art]] and [[Minimal music|music]], wherein artists intend to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all nonessential forms, features, or concepts. Minimalism is any design or style wherein the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect.

As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with this movement include [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Anne Truitt]], and [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Want, "Minimalism" in ''Grove Art Online''. Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the reductive aspects of modernism and is often interpreted as a reaction against [[Abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|Postminimal]] art practices. By the early 1960s minimalism emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in the [[geometric abstraction]] of [[Kazimir Malevich]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism| title=Minimalism| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]) that rejected the idea of relational and subjective painting, the complexity of [[abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional [[zeitgeist]] and polemics present in the arena of [[action painting]]. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Minimalism is variously construed either as a precursor to [[postmodernism]], or as a postmodern movement itself. In the latter perspective, early minimalism yielded advanced Modernist works, but the movement partially abandoned this direction when some artists like [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] changed direction in favor of the [[anti-form movement]].

Hal Foster, in his essay ''The Crux of Minimalism'',&lt;ref name="Hal Foster 1996, pp44-53"&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, pp. 44–53. {{ISBN|0262561077}}&lt;/ref&gt; examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian Modernism in their published definitions of minimalism.&lt;ref name="Hal Foster 1996, pp44-53"/&gt; He argues that minimalism is not a "dead end" of Modernism, but a "paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today."&lt;ref name="Hal Foster 1996, pp44-53"/&gt;

The terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music that features such repetition and iteration as those of the compositions of [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. Minimalist compositions are sometimes known as [[systems music]]. The term "minimalist" often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has also been used to describe the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novel]]s of [[Samuel Beckett]], the films of [[Robert Bresson]], the stories of [[Raymond Carver]], and the automobile designs of [[Colin Chapman]].

====Postminimalism====
[[File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|thumb|left|Smithson's ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' from atop Rozel Point, Utah, US, in mid-April 2005. Created in 1970, it still exists although it has often been submerged by the fluctuating lake level. It consists of some 6500 [[ton]]s of [[basalt]], earth and salt.]]
In the late 1960s [[Robert Pincus-Witten]]&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; coined the term "[[postminimalism]]" to describe minimalist-derived art which had content and contextual overtones that minimalism rejected. The term was applied by Pincus-Whitten to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Barry Le Va]], and others. Other minimalists including [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce late Modernist paintings and sculpture for the remainders of their careers.

Since then, many artists have embraced minimal or postminimal styles, and the label "Postmodern" has been attached to them.

====Collage, assemblage, installations====
{{Main|Collage|Assemblage (art)|Installation art}}
Related to [[abstract expressionism]] was the emergence of combining manufactured items with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. The work of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] exemplifies this trend. His "combines" of the 1950s were forerunners of [[pop art]] and [[installation art]], and used assemblages of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photographs. Rauschenberg, [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] were among important pioneers of both abstraction and pop art. Creating new conventions of art-making, they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion in their works of unlikely materials. Another pioneer of collage was [[Joseph Cornell]], whose more intimately scaled works were seen as radical because of both his personal iconography and his use of [[found object]]s.

====Neo-Dada====
{{Main|Neo-Dada}}

In the early 20th century [[Marcel Duchamp]] submitted for exhibition a [[urinal]] as a sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-fountain-t07573/text-summary| title='Fountain', Marcel Duchamp: Summary -  - Tate| work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; He professed his intent that people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]". ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was a urinal signed with the pseudonym "R. Mutt", the exhibition of which shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as Dada. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, other famous examples being [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4'33"]]'', which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence, and Rauschenberg's ''[[Erased de Kooning Drawing]]''. Many conceptual works take the position that art is the result of the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not of the intrinsic qualities of the work itself. In choosing "an ordinary article of life" and creating "a new thought for that object" Duchamp invited onlookers to view ''Fountain'' as a sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/dada/blindman/2/05.htm| title=Blindman No. 2| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcel Duchamp famously gave up "art" in favor of [[chess]]. Avant-garde composer [[David Tudor]] created a piece, ''Reunion'' (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross, that features a chess game in which each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. Duchamp and Cage played the game at the work's premier.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] identify Rauschenberg and [[Jasper Johns]] as part of the transitional phase, influenced by Duchamp, between Modernism and Postmodernism. Both used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high Modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997, p. 174. {{ISBN|1572302216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance and happenings====
{{Main|Performance art|Happening|Fluxus}}
[[File:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|left|[[Carolee Schneemann]], performing her piece ''Interior Scroll, 1975.'' |upright=0.75|[[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]] (pictured), [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html| title=Carolee Schneemann, Biography: Selected Works, Recent and Forthcoming Events| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of contemporary art. [[Yves Klein]] in France, [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Yoko Ono]] in New York City, and [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Wolf Vostell]] and [[Nam June Paik]] in Germany were pioneers of performance-based works of art. Groups like [[The Living Theatre]] with [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]] collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments, radically changing the relationship between audience and performer, especially in their piece ''Paradise Now''. The [[Judson Dance Theater]], located at the [[Judson Memorial Church]], New York; and the Judson dancers, notably [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Trisha Brown]], [[Elaine Summers]], Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]] and others; collaborated with artists [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and engineers like [[Billy Klüver]]. [[Park Place Gallery]] was a center for musical performances by electronic composers [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], and other notable performance artists including [[Joan Jonas]].

These performances were intended as works of a new art form combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. They were characterized by the reductive philosophies of minimalism and the spontaneous improvisation and expressivity of abstract expressionism. Images of Schneeman's performances of pieces meant to shock are occasionally used to illustrate these kinds of art, and she is often seen photographed while performing her piece ''Interior Scroll''. However, the images of her performing this piece are illustrating precisely what performance art is not. In performance art, the performance itself is the medium. Other media cannot illustrate performance art. Performance art is performed, not captured. By its nature performance is momentary and evanescent, which is part of the point of the medium as art. Representations of performance art in other media, whether by image, video, narrative or otherwise, select certain points of view in space or time or otherwise involve the inherent limitations of each medium, and which therefore cannot truly illustrate the medium of performance as art.

During the same period, various avant-garde artists created [[Happening]]s, mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in various specified locations, often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physicality, costuming, spontaneous [[nudity]], and various random or seemingly disconnected acts. Notable creators of happenings included [[Allan Kaprow]]—who first used the term in 1958,&lt;ref name="Allan Kaprow|Chronology"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/kaprow_chronology.html| title=Fluxus &amp;amp; Happening&amp;nbsp;– Allan Kaprow&amp;nbsp;– Chronology| accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/arts/design/13fink.html| work=The New York Times| title=Happenings Are Happening Again| first=Jori| last=Finkel| date=13 April 2008| accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intermedia, multi-media====
{{main|Intermedia}}

Another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. [[Intermedia]] is a term coined by [[Dick Higgins]] and meant to convey new art forms along the lines of [[Fluxus]], [[concrete poetry]], [[found objects]], [[performance art]], and [[computer art]]. Higgins was the publisher of the [[Something Else Press]], a concrete poet married to artist [[Alison Knowles]] and an admirer of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. [[Ihab Hassan]] includes "Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms," in his list of the characteristics of [[postmodern art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ihab Hassan in Lawrence E. Cahoone, ''From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2003. p. 13. {{ISBN|0631232133}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common forms of "multi-media art" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed [[video art]]. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with performance art, where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.

====Fluxus====
{{Main|Fluxus}}

Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–1978), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to [[John Cage]]'s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage's students included Fluxus founding members [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Al Hansen]], [[George Brecht]] and [[Dick Higgins]].

Fluxus encouraged a do-it-yourself aesthetic and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.

[[Andreas Huyssen]] criticises attempts to claim Fluxus for Postmodernism as "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement—as it were, postmodernism's sublime."&lt;ref name="Huyssen"&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 192. {{ISBN|0415909341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he sees Fluxus as a major [[Neo-Dada]]ist phenomena within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against "the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref name="Huyssen" /&gt;

===Late period===
{{Main|Late modernism}}
[[File:Brice Marden Vine.jpg|thumb|[[Brice Marden]], ''Vine'', 1992–93, oil on linen, {{convert|8|by|8+1/2|ft|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}}, Museum of Modern Art, New York]]
The continuation of [[abstract expressionism]], [[color field painting]], [[lyrical abstraction]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[minimalism]], [[abstract illusionism]], [[process art]], [[pop art]], [[postminimalism]], and other late 20th-century Modernist movements in both painting and sculpture continued through the first decade of the 21st century and constitute radical new directions in those mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, Carter. "The New Informalists", ''Art News'', v. 68, n. 8, December 1969, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Rose]]. ''American Painting. Part Two: The Twentieth Century''. Published by Skira–Rizzoli, New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Darby Bannard]]. "Notes on American Painting of the Sixties." ''Artforum'', January 1970, vol. 8, no. 5, pp. 40–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 21st century, well-established artists such as [[Sir Anthony Caro]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and younger artists including [[Brice Marden]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Isaac Witkin]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Mahirwan Mamtani]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joel Shapiro]], [[Tom Otterness]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and others continued to produce vital and influential paintings and sculpture.

==Modernism in Africa and Asia==
See also  [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] and [[Hanshinkan Modernism]]

Peter Kalliney suggests that,"Modernist concepts, especially aesthetic autonomy, were fundamental to the literature of [[decolonization]] in anglophone Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kalliney, "Modernism, African Literature, and the Cold War". ''Modern Language Quarterly'' (2015) 76 (3): 333–368.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, [[Rajat Neogy]], [[Christopher Okigbo]], and [[Wole Soyinka]], were among the writer who "repurposed modernist versions of aesthetic autonomy to declare their freedom from colonial bondage, from systems of racial discrimination, and even from the new postcolonial state".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kalliney, "Modernism, African Literature, and the Cold War".&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "modernism" and "modernist", according to scholar William J. Tyler, "have only recently become part of the standard discourse in English on modern Japanese literature and doubts concerning their authenticity vis-a-vis Western European modernism remain". Tyler finds this odd, given "the decidedly modern prose" of such "well-known Japanese writers as [[Kawabata Yasunari]], [[Nagai Kafu]], and [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]]". However, "scholars in the visual and fine arts, architecture, and poetry readily embraced "[[modanizumu]]" as a key concept for describing and analyzing Japanese culture in the 1920s and 1930s".&lt;ref&gt;''Modanizumu: Modernist Fiction from Japan'', 1913–1938. Edited by William J. Tyler. University of Hawai'i Press, 2008, [http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-5343-9780824832421.aspx].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, various young Japanese writers, including Kawabata Yasunari, [[Riichi Yokomitsu]] started a  literary journal ''Bungei Jidai'' ("The Artistic Age"). This journal was "part of an '[[art for art's sake]]' movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/4K875|title=Draft confirmed as Kawabata novel|date=2012-07-15|publisher=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese  modernist [[architect]] [[Kenzō Tange]] (1913–2005) was one of the most significant architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with [[Modern Architecture|modernism]], and designed major buildings on five continents. Tange was also an influential patron of the [[Metabolism (architecture)|Metabolist movement]]. He said: "It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call [[Structuralism (architecture)|structuralism]]",&lt;ref&gt;(cited in ''Plan'' 2/1982, Amsterdam)&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced from an early age by the Swiss modernist, [[Le Corbusier]], Tange gained international recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]].

In China the "[[New Sensationists]]" (新感觉派, Xīn Gǎnjué Pài) were a group of writers based in Shanghai who in the 1930s and 1940s were influenced, to varying degrees, by Western and Japanese modernism. They wrote fiction that was more concerned with the unconscious and with aesthetics than with politics or social problems. Among these writers were [[Mu Shiying]], [[Liu Na'ou]], and [[Shi Zhecun]].

In India, the [[Progressive Artists' Group]] was a group of [[modern art]]ists, mainly based in [[Mumbai]], [[India]] formed in 1947. Though it lacked any particular style, it synthesised [[Indian art]] with European and North America influences from the first half of the 20th Century, including Post-Impressionism, Cubism and Expressionism.

==Differences between modernism and postmodernism==
By the early 1980s the [[Postmodern]] movement in art and architecture began to establish its position through various [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] and [[intermedia]] formats. Postmodernism in music and literature began to take hold earlier. In music, postmodernism is described in one reference work, as a "term introduced in the 1970s",&lt;ref&gt;"Postmodernism", ''The Penguin Companion to Classical Music'', ed. Paul Griffiths. London: Penguin, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; while in British literature, ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'' sees modernism "ceding its predominance to postmodernism" as early as 1939.&lt;ref name="British Literature' 2006"/&gt; However, dates are highly debatable, especially as according to [[Andreas Huyssen]]: "one critic's postmodernism is another critic's modernism."&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bokkilden.no/SamboWeb/produkt.do?produktId=952726| title=Postmodern Debates| author=Bokkilden| work=Bokkilden}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes those who are critical of the division between the two and see them as two aspects of the same movement, and believe that late Modernism continues.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"/&gt;

Modernism is an encompassing label for a wide variety of cultural movements. [[Postmodernism]] is essentially a centralized movement that named itself, based on sociopolitical theory, although the term is now used in a wider sense to refer to activities from the 20th century onwards which exhibit awareness of and reinterpret the modern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/postmodernism?view=uk| title=Oxford Dictionaries - Dictionary, Thesaurus, &amp; Grammar| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postmodernism| title=Postmodern - Definition of postmodern by Merriam-Webster| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reichl, Cook's November 1989; [http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html American Heritage Dictionary's definition of the postmodern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075319/http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |date=9 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodern theory asserts that the attempt to canonise Modernism "after the fact" is doomed to undisambiguable contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/pomo.html| title=The Po-Mo Page: Postmodern to Post-postmodern| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a narrower sense, what was Modernist was not necessarily also postmodern. Those elements of Modernism which accentuated the benefits of rationality and socio-technological progress were only Modernist.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''British, Irish and American Literature'', Trier 2002, pp. 210–12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and hostility to modernism==
{{anchor|Criticisms of modernism}}
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
[[File:Franz Marc-The fate of the animals-1913.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Franz Marc]], ''The fate of the animals'', 1913, oil on canvas. The work was displayed at the exhibition of [[Degenerate art|"Entartete Kunst"]] ("degenerate art") in [[Munich]], [[Nazi Germany]], 1937.]]
Modernism's stress on [[freedom of expression]], experimentation, [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], and [[primitivism]] disregards conventional expectations. In many art forms this often meant startling and alienating audiences with bizarre and unpredictable effects, as in the strange and disturbing combinations of motifs in [[Surrealism]] or the use of extreme [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] and [[atonality]] in Modernist music. In literature this often involved the rejection of intelligible plots or characterization in novels, or the creation of poetry that defied clear interpretation.

From 1932 [[Socialist realism]] began to oust Modernism in the Soviet Union;&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov, ''Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|978-5901724217}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had previously endorsed [[Russian Futurism|Futurism]] and [[constructivism (art)|Constructivism]]. The [[Nazism|Nazi]] government of Germany deemed modernism [[narcissism|narcissistic]] and nonsensical, as well as "Jewish" (see [[Antisemitism]]) and "Negro".&lt;ref&gt;Kühnel, Anita. [https://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10077 "Entartete Kunst", from ''Grove Art Online''], MoMA website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis exhibited Modernist paintings alongside works by the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] in an exhibition entitled "[[Degenerate Art]]". Accusations of "formalism" could lead to the end of a career, or worse. For this reason many Modernists of the postwar generation felt that they were the most important bulwark against totalitarianism, the "[[sentinel species|canary in the coal mine]]", whose repression by a government or other group with supposed authority represented a warning that individual liberties were being threatened. Louis A. Sass compared madness, specifically [[schizophrenia]], and modernism in a less fascist manner by noting their shared disjunctive narratives, surreal images, and incoherence.&lt;ref&gt;Sass, Louis A. (1992). ''Madness and Modernism: Insanity in the Light of Modern Art, Literature, and Thought''. New York: Basic Books. Cited in Bauer, Amy (2004), "Cognition, Constraints, and Conceptual Blends in Modernist Music", in ''The Pleasure of Modernist Music''. {{ISBN|1580461433}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, modernism flourished mainly in consumer/capitalist societies, despite the fact that its proponents often rejected consumerism itself. However, [[high modernism]] began to merge with consumer culture after World War II, especially during the 1960s. In Britain, a youth [[subculture]] emerged calling itself "Modernist" (usually shortened to [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]]), following such representative music groups as [[the Who]] and [[the Kinks]]. The likes of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] combined popular musical traditions with Modernist verse, adopting literary devices derived from [[James Joyce]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[James Thurber]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], and others. [[The Beatles]] developed along similar lines, creating various Modernist musical effects on several albums, while musicians such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[Syd Barrett]] and [[Captain Beefheart]] proved even more experimental. Modernist devices also started to appear in popular cinema, and later on in music videos. Modernist design also began to enter the mainstream of popular culture, as simplified and stylized forms became popular, often associated with dreams of a [[space age]] high-tech future.

This merging of consumer and high versions of Modernist culture led to a radical transformation of the meaning of "Modernism". First, it implied that a movement based on the rejection of tradition had become a tradition of its own. Second, it demonstrated that the distinction between elite Modernist and mass consumerist culture had lost its precision. Some writers{{Who|date=September 2009}} declared that modernism had become so institutionalized that it was now "post avant-garde", indicating that it had lost its power as a revolutionary movement. Many have interpreted this transformation as the beginning of the phase that became known as [[postmodernism]]. For others, such as art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], postmodernism represents an extension of modernism.

"Anti-modern" or "counter-modern" movements seek to emphasize [[holism]], connection and [[spirituality]] as remedies or antidotes to modernism. Such movements see modernism as [[reductionist]], and therefore subject to an inability to see systemic and [[emergence|emergent]] effects. Many Modernists came to this viewpoint, for example [[Paul Hindemith]] in his late turn towards mysticism. Writers such as Paul H. Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson, in ''[[The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World]]'' (2000), Fredrick Turner in ''A Culture of Hope'' and [[Lester Brown]] in ''Plan B'', have articulated a critique of the basic idea of modernism itself—that individual creative expression should conform to the realities of technology. Instead, they argue, individual creativity should make everyday life more emotionally acceptable.

Some traditionalist artists like [[Alexander Stoddart]] reject modernism generally as the product of "an epoch of false money allied with false culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jack |first=Ian |title=Set in Stone |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=6 June 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jun/06/alexander-stoddart-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some fields, the effects of modernism have remained stronger and more persistent than in others. Visual art has made the most complete break with its past. Most major capital cities have museums devoted to modern art as distinct from post-[[Renaissance]] art (c. 1400 to c. 1900). Examples include the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[Tate Modern]] in London, and the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris. These galleries make no distinction between modernist and Postmodernist phases, seeing both as developments within Modern Art.

[[File:Seaside, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Seaside, Florida]]]]
'''New Urbanism''' is an [[urban design]] movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating [[Walkability|walkable]] neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/49f234rd|author=Boeing|title=LEED-ND and Livability Revisited|journal=Berkeley Planning Journal|date=2014|volume=27|pages=31–55|accessdate=2015-04-15|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually influenced many aspects of [[real estate development]], [[urban planning]], and municipal [[land-use]] strategies.

New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to [[World War II]]; it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design (TND) and [[transit-oriented development]] (TOD).&lt;ref&gt;Kelbaugh, Douglas S. 2002. Repairing the American Metropolis: Common Place Revisited. Seattle: University of Washington Press. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas can all be circled back to two concepts: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Urbanism Principles|url = http://www.newurbanism.org/newurbanism/principles.html|website = www.newurbanism.org|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Celebration fl.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Market Street, [[Celebration, Florida]]]]

The organizing body for New Urbanism is the [https://www.cnu.org/ Congress for the New Urbanism], founded in 1993. Its foundational text is the ''Charter of the New Urbanism'', which begins:

{{quote|We advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles: neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population; communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car; cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions; urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history, climate, [[ecology]], and building practice.&lt;ref name="The Charter of the New Urbanism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=The Charter of the New Urbanism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

New Urbanists support: [[regional planning]] for open space; context-appropriate [[architecture]] and planning; adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities, libraries and community centres;&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=Planning, Funding and Delivering Social Infrastructure in Australia's Outer Suburban Growth Areas|journal=Urban Policy and Research|date=16 February 2016|doi=10.1080/08111146.2015.1099523|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/iESRIdipyg6q3MvIyPS3/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes, walk, or take the train. They also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in [[suburban sprawl]]. The ''[[Charter of the New Urbanism]]'' also covers issues such as [[historic preservation]], safe streets, [[green building]], and the re-development of [[brownfield land]]. The ten [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]] also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches.

Architecturally, new urbanist developments are often accompanied by [[New Classical Architecture|New Classical]], [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], or [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] styles, although that is not always the case.

==Background==

[[File:Downtown baldwin park.JPG|thumb|right|250px|New Broad Street, [[Baldwin Park, Florida]]]]

Until the mid 20th century, cities were generally organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods. For most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable, although with the development of [[public transport|mass transit]] the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines, allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as [[streetcar suburb]]s. But with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies, attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car.&lt;ref&gt;Kunstler, James Howard. 1998. ''Home from nowhere: remaking our everyday world for the twenty-first Century.'' A Touchstone book. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster. p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, after World War II [[urban planner|urban planning]] largely centered around the use of municipal [[zoning]] ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development, and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing [[Middle class in the United States|middle class]]. The physical separation of where people live from where they work, shop and frequently spend their recreational time, together with low housing density, which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms, made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of [[automobile dependency]].

[[File:St petersburg florida downtown.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Beach Drive, [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]]]

This new system of development, with its rigorous separation of uses, arose after [[World War II]] and became known as "conventional suburban development"&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon and Shayne Vipond: "Gross Density and New Urbanism: Comparing Conventional and New Urbanist Suburbs in Markham, Ontario".  Journal of the American Planning Association, 1939-0130, Volume 71, Issue 1, 2005, pages 41–54&lt;/ref&gt; or pejoratively as [[urban sprawl]]. The majority of U.S. citizens now live in [[suburb]]an communities built in the last fifty years, and automobile use per capita has soared.

[[File:Post office in celebration.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Celebration, FL]] Post Office, designed by architect [[Michael Graves]]]]

Although New Urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later, a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the [[modernist]] planning techniques being put into practice. Social philosopher and historian [[Lewis Mumford]] criticized the "anti-urban" development of post-war America. ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]],'' written by [[Jane Jacobs]] in the early 1960s, called for planners to reconsider the single-use housing projects, large car-dependent thoroughfares, and segregated commercial centers that had become the "norm". The French architect [[François Spoerry]] has developed in the 60's the concept of "soft architecture" that he applied to [[Port Grimaud]], a new marina in south of France. The success of this project had a considerable influence and led to many new projects of soft architecture like [[Port Liberté]] in [[New Jersey]] or Le Plessis Robisson in France.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Rooted in these early dissenters, the ideas behind New Urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the "European" city proposed by architect [[Leon Krier]], and the [[pattern language]] theories of [[Christopher Alexander]]. The term "new urbanism" itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Barton |date=1985 |title=The New Urbanism as a Way of Life: The Relationship Between Inner City Revitalization in Canada and the Rise of the New Middle Class |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5NyySgAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22new+urbanism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1MYLVLCvMpecygTnioCQDw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA |accessdate=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meinig |first=Donald |date=1986 |title=The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k98OEM26HSAC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=%22new+urbanism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UMwLVPfZOZCcygTQm4CAAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20urbanism%22&amp;f=false |publisher=Yale University Press |page=255 |isbn=978-0-300-17394-9 |accessdate=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it wasn't until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1991 |title=Urban Design Update: Newsletter of the Institute for Urban Design, Volumes 7–15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8dUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22created+under+the+rubric+of+New+Urbanism%22&amp;dq=%22created+under+the+rubric+of+New+Urbanism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mc4LVOKkC5KNyATUt4DQCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA |publisher=Institute for Urban Design |accessdate=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the [[Local Government Commission (Sacramento, California)|Local Government Commission]], a private nonprofit group in [[Sacramento, California]], invited architects [[Peter Calthorpe]], Michael Corbett, [[Andrés Duany]], Elizabeth Moule, [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]], [[Stefanos Polyzoides]], and Daniel Solomon to develop a set of community principles for land use planning. Named the ''[[Ahwahnee Principles]]'' (after [[Yosemite National Park]]'s [[Ahwahnee Hotel]]), the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991, at its first Yosemite Conference for Local Elected Officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgc.org/about/ahwahnee/principles|title=Principles – Local Government Commission|work=Local Government Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calthorpe, Duany, Moule, Plater-Zyberk, Polyzoides, and Solomon founded the Chicago-based Congress for the New Urbanism in 1993. The CNU has grown to more than three thousand members, and is the leading international organization promoting New Urbanist design principles. It holds annual Congresses in various U.S. cities.

In 2009, co-founders Elizabeth Moule, Hank Dittmar, and Stefanos Polyzoides authored the Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between New Urbanism and sustainability. The Canons are "a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building, the making of community, and the conservation of our natural world". They promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions, the use of locally obtained materials, and in general, a "culture of permanence". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/sites/files/Canons.pdf  The Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625234557/http://www.cnu.org/sites/files/Canons.pdf |date=2014-06-25 }} |date=October 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

New Urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales. And while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant, New Urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning, architecture, and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Cozens, Paul Michael. 2008. New Urbanism, Crime and the Suburbs: A Review of the Evidence. Urban Policy and Research. 26(4):429–444.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
[[File:New Urbanism.jpg|thumb|New Urbanism]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Andrés Duany]] and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]], two of the founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops, front porches, and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] neighborhoods of [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. They and their colleagues observed patterns including the following:

[[File:Celebration fl park.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A park in [[Celebration, Florida]]]]
[[File:Great King St., New Town.jpg|thumb|Great King St, New Town, Edinburgh]]

* The neighborhood has a discernible center. This is often a square or a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner. A transit stop would be located at this center.
* Most of the dwellings are within a five-minute walk of the center, an average of roughly {{convert|0.25|mi|km}}.
* There are a variety of dwelling types — usually houses, [[terraced house|rowhouse]]s, and [[apartment building|apartment]]s — so that younger and older people, [[Single (relationship)|single]]s and families, the poor and the wealthy may find places to live.
* At the edge of the neighborhood, there are shops and offices of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household.
* A small ancillary building or [[garage apartment]] is permitted within the backyard of each house. It may be used as a rental unit or place to work (for example, an office or craft workshop).
* An elementary school is close enough so that most children can walk from their home.
* There are small playgrounds accessible to every dwelling — not more than a tenth of a mile away.
* Streets within the neighborhood form a connected network, which disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination.
* The streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees. This slows traffic, creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles.
* Buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street, creating a well-defined outdoor room.
* Parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street. Parking is relegated to the rear of buildings, usually accessed by alleys.
* Certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings. These provide sites for community meetings, education, and religious or cultural activities.

==Terminology==

[[File:House in celebration.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A [[Mediterranean Revival]] house in [[Celebration, Florida]]]]

Several terms are viewed either as synonymous, included in, or overlapping with the New Urbanism. The terms Neotraditional Development&lt;ref&gt;http://facweb.arch.ohio-state.edu/jnasar/crpinfo/research/NeoTradJPER2003.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Traditional Neighborhood Development are often associated with the New Urbanism. These terms generally refer to complete New Towns or new neighborhoods, often built in traditional architectural styles, as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects. The term Traditional Urbanism has also been used to describe the New Urbanism by those who object to the "new" moniker. The term "Walkable Urbanism" was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor Christopher Leinberger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leinberger|first1=Christopher|title=The Option of Urbanism|date=2009|publisher=Island Press|location=District of Columbia|isbn=1-59726-137-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many debate whether [[Smart Growth]] and the New Urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two; overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements. Placemaking is another term that is often used to signify New Urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups. The term Transit-Oriented Development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent New Urbanist [[Peter Calthorpe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/409612/does-china-s-urbanization-spell-doom-or-salvation-peter-calthorpe-weighs-in/|title=Does China's Urbanization Spell Doom or Salvation? Peter Calthorpe Weighs In&amp;nbsp;... |work=ArchDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is heavily promoted by New Urbanists. The term [[Sustainable development]] is sometimes associated with the New Urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of New Urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s, however, this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the [[United Nations]] and [[Agenda 21]] to include [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] issues (e.g., [[developing country]]) that exceed the scope of [[land development]] intended to be addressed by the New Urbanism or [[Sustainable Urbanism]]. The term "livability" or "livable communities" was popular under the [[Obama administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.streetsblog.org/2011/05/04/president-obamas-transportation-bill-prioritizes-livability-high-speed-rail/|title=President Obama's Transportation Bill Prioritizes Livability, High-Speed Rail – Streetsblog USA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the [[Local Government Commission (Sacramento, California)|Local Government Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newpartners.org/about/about-the-event|title=About the Event|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023010313/http://www.newpartners.org/about/about-the-event|archivedate=2014-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning magazine discussed the proliferation of "urbanisms" in an article in 2011 titled "A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Jonathan|title=A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms|date=April 2014|volume=77|issue=4|pages=19–21|url=https://www.planning.org/planning/2011/apr/60urbanisms.htm|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several New Urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the New Urbanism including [[Sustainable Urbanism]] and Tactical Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/design/2012/03/guide-tactical-urbanism/1387/|title=The Official Guide to Tactical Urbanism|work=CityLab}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of which Guerrilla Urbanism can be viewed as a subset). The term Tactical Urbanism was coined by Frenchman Michel de Certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by New Urbanist Mike Lydon and the co-authors of the Tactical Urbanism Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tactical-urbanism-citizen-projects-go-mainstream/|title=Tactical urbanism: Citizen projects go mainstream|date=1 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 [[Andres Duany]] authored a book that used the term Agrarian Urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of New Urbanist town design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Duany, Andres]] | title=Garden Cities: Theory &amp; Practice of Agrarian Urbanism | publisher=The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment | year=2011| isbn=1-906384-04-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 a group of New Urbanists led by CNU co-founder [[Andres Duany]] began a research project under the banner of Lean Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/design/2014/03/why-andres-duany-so-focused-making-lean-urbanism-thing/8635/|title=Why Andrés Duany Is So Focused on Making 'Lean Urbanism' a Thing|work=CityLab}}&lt;/ref&gt; which purported to provide a bridge between Tactical Urbanism and the New Urbanism.

Other terms have surfaced in reaction to the New Urbanism intended to provide a contrast, alternative to, or a refinement of the New Urbanism. Some of these terms include Everyday Urbanism by Harvard Professor Margaret Crawford, John Chase, and John Kaliski,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Chase, John | title=Everyday Urbanism| publisher=The Monacelli Press | year=1999| isbn=1-885254-81-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecological Urbanism]], and True Urbanism by architect Bernard Zyscovich. [[Landscape urbanism]] was popularized by Charles Waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the New Urbanism in his lectures at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mehaffy|first1=Michael|title=The Landscape Urbanism: Sprawl in a Pretty Green Dress?|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/46262|website=Planetizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents'', edited by Andres Duany and Emily Talen, specifically addressed the tension between these two views of [[urbanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/L/Landscape-Urbanism-and-its-Discontents|title=Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents|work=New Society Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael E. Arth]] promotes what he describes as a variant of the New Urbanism called the [[New pedestrianism|New Pedestrianism]], which is intended to be more pedestrian-oriented and traces its origins to a 1929 [[planned community]] in [[Radburn, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="ArthMichael"&gt;Arth, Michael E. (2010). ''Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests'' Golden Apples Media, {{ISBN|978-0-912467-12-2}}. pp. 120–139, 363–386&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary organization promoting the New Urbanism in the United States is the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] (CNU). The Congress for the New Urbanism is the leading organization promoting walkable, mixed-use neighborhood development, sustainable communities and healthier living conditions.  CNU members promote the principles of CNU's Charter and the hallmarks of New Urbanism, including:

* Livable streets arranged in compact, walkable blocks.
* A range of housing choices to serve people of diverse ages and income levels.
* Schools, stores and other nearby destinations reachable by walking, bicycling or transit service.
* An affirming, human-scaled public realm where appropriately designed buildings define and enliven streets and other public spaces.

The CNU has met annually since 1993 when they held their first general meeting in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], with approximately one hundred attendees. By 2008 the Congress was drawing two to three thousand attendees to the annual meetings.

The CNU began forming local and regional chapters circa 2004 with the founding of the New England and Florida Chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnuflorida.org/|title=Home – Congress For The New Urbanism Florida Chapter|work=Congress For The New Urbanism Florida Chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011 there were 16 official chapters and interest groups for 7 more.  {{As of|2013}}, Canada hosts two full CNU Chapters, one in Ontario (CNU Ontario), and one in British Columbia (Cascadia) which also includes a portion of the north-west US states.

While the CNU has international participation in Canada, sister organizations have been formed in other areas of the world including the Council for European Urbanism (CEU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceunet.org/|title=C.E.U. Council for European Urbanism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Movement for Israeli Urbanism (MIU) and the Australian Council for the New Urbanism.

By 2002 chapters of Students for the New Urbanism began appearing at universities including the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]], [[University of Georgia]], [[University of Notre Dame]], and the [[University of Miami]]. In 2003, a group of younger professionals and students met at the 11th Congress in Washington, D.C. and began developing a "Manifesto of the Next Generation of New Urbanists". The [[Next Generation of New Urbanists]] held their first major session the following year at the 12th meeting of the CNU in Chicago in 2004. The group has continued meeting annually {{As of|2014|lc=y}} with a focus on young professionals, students, new member issues, and ensuring the flow of fresh ideas and diverse viewpoints within the New Urbanism and the CNU. Spinoff projects of the Next Generation of the New Urbanists include the Living Urbanism publication first published in 2008 and the first [[Tactical Urbanism]] Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tacticalurbanismguide.com/|title=Tactical Urbanism Materials Guide – Your resource for getting TU Projects done in your community!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CNU has spawned publications and research groups. Publications include the ''New Urban News'' and the ''New Town Paper''. Research groups have formed independent nonprofits to research individual topics such as the Form-Based Codes Institute, The National Charrette Institute and the Center for Applied Transect Studies.

In the [[United Kingdom]] New Urbanist and European urbanism principles are practised and taught by [[The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment]]. Other organisations promote New Urbanism as part of their remit, such as [[International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture &amp; Urbanism|INTBAU]], A Vision of Europe, and others.

The CNU and other national organizations have also formed partnerships with like-minded groups. Organizations under the banner of [[Smart Growth]] also often work with the Congress for the New Urbanism. In addition the CNU has formed partnerships on specific projects such as working with the [[United States Green Building Council]] and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] to develop the [[LEED for Neighborhood Development]] standards,&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt; and with the [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] to develop a [[Context Sensitive Solutions]] (CSS) Design manual.

==Film==

The New Urbanism Film Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newurbanismfilmfestival.com/|title=New Urbanism Film Festival|work=New Urbanism Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in 2013 and 2014 in Los Angeles to highlight films and short films about the New Urbanism and related topics. The 2011 film ''[[Urbanized]]'' by Gary Hustwit featured then CNU Board Chair Ellen Dunham-Jones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hustwit.com/about-urbanized/|title=About Urbanized|work=Gary Hustwit|access-date=2014-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023010411/http://www.hustwit.com/about-urbanized/|archive-date=2014-10-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other urban thinkers on the international story of urbanization including the New Urbanist efforts in the United States.

The 2004 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The End of Suburbia|The End of Suburbia: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream]]'' argues that the depletion of oil will result in the demise of the sprawl-type development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endofsuburbia.com [http://www.endofsurburbia.com/ link to official website]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism]]'', a feature length 2008 documentary about urban designer [[Michael E. Arth]], explains the principles of his [[New Pedestrianism]], a more ecological and pedestrian-oriented version of New Urbanism.&lt;ref name="ArthMichael" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelearth.com/democracy/ Website about ''Democracy and the Common Wealth'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The film also gives a brief history of New Urbanism, and chronicles the rebuilding of an inner city slum into a model of New Pedestrianism and New Urbanism called The Garden District.&lt;ref&gt;Teri Pruden, "The New Urban Cowboy: Michael E. Arth transforms Cracktown into Historic Garden District in DeLand" DeLand Magazine, Jan–Feb, 2008.

==Criticism==
{{Globalize|date=February 2010}}
New Urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the [[political spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|title=From Garden City to Eco-urbanism: The quest for sustainable neighborhood development|journal=Sustainable Cities and Society|date=September 2015|doi=10.1016/j.scs.2015.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticized both for being a [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers.

Journalist [[Alex Marshall (Journalist)|Alex Marshall]] has decried New Urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty, aspirational slogans.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Alex Marshall, "Building New Urbanism: Less Filling, But Not So Tasty", ''Builder Magazine'', 30 November 1999, p. ___. Print; archived on Marshall's web site, http://www.alexmarshall.org/2006/08/02/building-new-urbanism-less-filling-but-not-so-tasty/. Retrieved 1 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 article in [[Metropolis (architecture magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]], Marshall denounced New Urbanism as "a grand fraud".&lt;ref&gt;Alex Marshall, "Suburbs in Disguise", ''Metropolis Magazine'', July 1996, p. 70, republished as "New Urbanism" in Busch, Akiko, ed., ''Design is&amp;nbsp;... Words, Things, People, Buildings and Places'' (New York:Metropolis Books/Princeton Architectural Press, 2002), p. 272; and as "Suburbs in Disguise" on Marshall's web site, http://www.alexmarshall.org/2007/08/31/suburbs-in-disguise/, retrieved 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The attack continued in numerous articles, including an opinion column in the ''Washington Post'' in September of the same year,&lt;ref&gt;Alex Marshall, "Putting Some 'City' Back In the Suburbs", ''Washington Post'', 1 September 1996, p. C1, print, https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/growth/solutions/nokent.htm; retrieved 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Marshall's first book, [http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/marhow ''How Cities Work:  Suburbs, Sprawl, and the Roads Not Taken'']&lt;ref&gt;U. of Texas Press 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the New Urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, S. et al. (2004) A Decade of HOPE VI. The Urban Institute&lt;/ref&gt;  Independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments,&lt;ref&gt;Goetz, Edward G. (2003) Clearing the Way: Deconcentrating the Poor in Urban America, The Urban Institute Press: Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaskin, R.J., Joseph, M.L., Webber, H.S. (2007) The Theoretical Basis for Addressing Poverty Through Mixed-Income Development. Urban Affairs Review 42 (3): 369–409.&lt;/ref&gt; but the argument that New Urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, J. and K. Perrott (2009) Producing diversity in a new urbanism community. Town Planning Review 80 (3): 267–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parties have criticized the New Urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking, cycling, and public transport. The Charter of the New Urbanism states that "communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car".&lt;ref name="The Charter of the New Urbanism"/&gt; Some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of [[Car-free movement|car-free developments]].  Michael E Arth proposes [[new pedestrianism]] as a way to further elevate the status of pedestrians by focusing on pedestrian-only paths. Steve Melia proposes the idea of "filtered permeability" (see [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)]]) which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limiting the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevemelia.co.uk/ltt.htm "Neighbourhoods Should be Made Permeable for Walking and Cycling but not for Cars"], Steve Melia, Local Transport Today, January 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the New Urbanism's claimed environmental benefits, a rating system for neighborhood environmental design, [[LEED-ND]], was developed by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], and the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnu.org/leednd |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014174711/http://www.cnu.org/leednd |archivedate=2014-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to quantify the sustainability of New Urbanist neighborhood design.&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/articles/getting-know-leed-neighborhood-development|title=Getting to know LEED: Neighborhood Development|date=1 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Urbanist and board member of CNU, [[Doug Farr]] has taken a step further and coined [[Sustainable Urbanism]], which combines New Urbanism and LEED-ND to create walkable, transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure.

New Urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned, large-scale development, "instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves".&lt;ref&gt;[http://p2pfoundation.net/Brief_History_of_P2P-Urbanism "A brief history of Peer-to-peer Urbanism"], Nikos Salingaros and Federico Mena-Quintero, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions.&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, J. (2006) Planning the Good Community: New Urbanism in Theory and Practice. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{Main article|Examples of New Urbanism}}

===United States===

New Urbanism is having a growing influence on how and where metropolitan regions choose to grow. At least fourteen large-scale planning initiatives are based on the principles of linking transportation and land-use policies, and using the neighborhood as the fundamental building block of a region.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} [[Miami, Florida]], has adopted the most ambitious New Urbanist-based zoning code reform yet undertaken by a major U.S. city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/node/3166|title=Saving western Maryland before it's swallowed up|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than six hundred new towns, villages, and neighborhoods, following New Urbanist principles, have been planned or are currently under construction in the U.S. Hundreds of new, small-scale, urban and suburban infill projects are under way to reestablish walkable streets and blocks. In Maryland and several other states, New Urbanist principles are an integral part of ''[[smart growth]]'' legislation.

In the mid-1990s, the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) adopted the principles of the New Urbanism in its multibillion-dollar program to rebuild public housing projects nationwide. New Urbanists have planned and developed hundreds of projects in infill locations. Most were driven by the private sector, but many, including HUD projects, used public money.

====University Place in Memphis====

In 2010 University Place in Memphis became the second only [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) LEED certified neighborhood.  LEED ND (neighborhood development) standards integrates principles of smart growth, urbanism and green building  and were developed through a collaboration between USGBC, Congress for the New Urbanism, and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]].  University Place, developed by [[McCormack Baron Salazar]], is a 405-unit, 30-acre, mixed-income, mixed use, multigenerational, [[HOPE VI]] grant community that revitalized the severely distressed Lamar Terrace public housing site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multihousingnews.com/news/south/architecture-inc-celebrates-leed-nd-certification-of-university-place-in-memphis/1004034759.html  Architecture Inc. Celebrates LEED-ND Certification of University Place in Memphis], Multi Housing News, May 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Cotton District====
[[The Cotton District]] in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], was the first New Urbanist development, begun in 1968 long before the New Urbanism movement was organized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tndtownpaper.com/Volume4/new_towns_cotton_district.htm] The Town Paper, Vol. 4, No. 1 — December 2001/ January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The District borders Mississippi State University, and consists mostly of residential rental units for college students along with restaurants, bars and retail. The Cotton District got its name because it is built in the vicinity of an old cotton mill.

====Seaside====
[[Seaside, Florida]], the first fully New Urbanist town, began development in 1981 on eighty acres (324,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of [[Florida Panhandle]] coastline. It was featured on the cover of the [[Atlantic Monthly]] in 1988, when only a few streets were completed, and has become internationally famous for its architecture, and the quality of its streets and public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamer|first1=David|title=Learning from the past: Historic Districts and the New Urbanism in the United States|journal=Planning Perspectives|date=2000|volume=15|issue=2|pages=107–122|doi=10.1080/026654300364047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seaside is now a tourist destination and appeared in the 1998 movie ''[[The Truman Show]]''. Lots sold for $15,000 in the early 1980s, and slightly over a decade later, the price had escalated to about $200,000. Today, most lots sell for more than a million dollars, and some houses top $5&amp;nbsp;million.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

====Mueller Community====
The [[Mueller Community]] is located on the 700 acre site of the former [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]] in [[Austin, Texas]], which closed in 1999. Per the developer, the value of the Mueller development upon completion will be $1.3 billion, and will comprise 4.2 million square feet of non-residential development, 650,000 square feet of retail space, 4,600 homes, and 140 acres of open space. An estimated 10,000 permanent jobs within the development will have been created by the time it is complete. The Mueller Community also has more electric cars per capita than any other neighborhood in the United States – a fact partially attributable to an incentive program.

====Stapleton====
The site of the former [[Stapleton International Airport]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and [[Aurora, Colorado]], closed in 1995, is now being redeveloped by [[Forest City Enterprises]].&lt;ref name="LAT 2003-10-18"&gt;Vincent, Roger and Groves, Martha (October 18, 2003) [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/18/business/fi-playa18 "L.A.'s Urban Model"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved 12 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Stapleton is expected to be home to at least 30,000 residents, six schools and 2&amp;nbsp;million square feet (180,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of retail. Construction began in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandtech.org/ DSST Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-26-100-million_x.htm USA Today&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northfield Stapleton]], one of the development's major retail centers, recently opened.

====San Antonio====
In 1997 [[San Antonio, Texas]], as part of a new master plan, created new regulations called the Unified Development Code (UDC), largely influenced by New Urbanism. One feature of the UDC is six unique land development patterns that can be applied to certain districts: Conservation Development, Commercial Center Development, Office or Institutional Campus Development, Commercial Retrofit Development, Tradition Neighborhood Development, [[Transit Oriented Development]]. Each district has specific standards and design regulation. The six development patterns were created to reflect existing development patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Greenburg, Ellen, 2004. Codifying New Urbanism: How to Reform Municipal Land Development Regulations. American Planning Association PAS Report Number 526&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mountain House====
[[Mountain House, San Joaquin County, California|Mountain House]], one of the latest New Urbanist projects in the United States, is a new town located near [[Tracy, California]].  Construction started in 2001. Mountain House will consist of 12 villages, each with its own elementary school, park, and commercial area. In addition, a future [[train station]], transit center and bus system are planned for Mountain House.

====Mesa del Sol====
[[Mesa del Sol]], New Mexico—the largest New Urbanist project in the United States—was designed by architect [[Peter Calthorpe]], and is being developed by [[Forest City Enterprises]]. Mesa del Sol may take five decades to reach full build-out, at which time it should have 38,000 residential units, housing a population of 100,000; a {{convert|1400|acre|km2|adj=on}} industrial office park; four town centers; an urban center; and a [[downtown]] that would provide a [[twin towns and sister cities|twin city]] within [[Albuquerque]].

====I'On====
Located in [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina]], [[I'On]] is a traditional neighborhood development, mixed with a new urbanism  styled architecture, reflecting on the building designs of the nearby downtown areas of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Founded on April 30, 1995, I'On was designed by the town planning firms of Dover, Kohl &amp; Partners and [[Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company]], and currently holds over 750 single family homes. Features of the community include extensive sidewalks, shared [[public]] greens and parks, [[trails]] and a grid of narrow, [[traffic calming]] streets. Most homes are required to have a [[front porch]] of not less than eight feet (2.46&amp;nbsp;m) in depth. Floor heights of 10 feet (3.1&amp;nbsp;m), raised foundations and smaller lot sizes give the community a [[Urban density|dense]], vertical feel.

====Haile Plantation====
[[Haile Plantation, Florida]], is a 2,600 household ({{convert|1,700|acre|km2}}) development of regional impact southwest of the city of Gainesville, within Alachua County. Haile Village Center is a traditional neighborhood center within the development. It was originally started in 1978 and completed in 2007. In addition to the 2,600 homes the neighborhood consists of two merchant centers (one a New England narrow street village and the other a chain grocery strip mall). There are also two public elementary schools and an 18-hole golf course.

====Celebration, Florida====
In June 1996, the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]] unveiled its 5,000&amp;nbsp;acre (20&amp;nbsp;km²) town of [[Celebration, Florida|Celebration]], near Orlando, Florida. Celebration opened its downtown in October 1996, relying heavily on the experiences of Seaside, whose downtown was nearly complete. Disney shuns the label New Urbanism, calling Celebration simply a "town".

Celebration's Downtown has become one of the area's most popular tourist destinations making the community a showcase for New Urbanism as a prime example of the creation of a "sense of place".&lt;ref&gt;Celebration Business Alliance, Sept 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jersey City====
The construction of the [[Hudson Bergen Light Rail]] in [[Hudson County, New Jersey]] has spurred transit-oriented development. In [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], two projects are planned to transform [[brownfield]] sites, both of which have required remediation of [[toxic waste]] by previous owners. [[Bayfront, Jersey City|Bayfront]], once site of a [[Honeywell]] plant is a {{convert|100|acre|km2}} site on the [[Hackensack River]], and is nearby the planned West Campus of [[New Jersey City University]]. [[Canal Crossing, Jersey City|Canal Crossing]], named for the former [[Morris Canal]], was once partially owned by [[PPG Industries]], and is a {{convert|117|acre|km2}} site west of [[Liberty State Park]].

====Old York Village, Chesterfield Township, New Jersey====
The sparsely developed agricultural [[Chesterfield Township, New Jersey|Township of Chesterfield]] in [[New Jersey]] covers approximately {{convert|21.61|sqmi|km2}} and has made farmland preservation a priority since the 1970s.  Chesterfield has permanently preserved more than {{convert|7000|acre|km2}} of farmland through state and county programs and a township-wide transfer of development credits program that directs future growth to a designated "receiving area" known as Old York Village.  Old York Village is a neo-traditional, new urbanism town on {{convert|560|acre|km2}} incorporating a variety of housing types, neighborhood commercial facilities, a new elementary school, civic uses, and active and passive open space areas with preserved agricultural land surrounding the planned village.  Construction began in the early 2000s and a significant percentage of the community is now complete. Old York Village was the winner of the American Planning Association National Outstanding Planning Award in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bF_sLhalru4J:www.clarkecatonhintz.com/news_62/cch.pdf+Old+York+Village+Chesterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShmUa4sV_i-RkZGv6VCfru69zqmyvd5QuPhmbvt5rknjP-2U5ceIqitHl7582Z5kNIPD4OgHwbRbyf1gybr7uRoLFeZNt2zwDdwkAHE8sIn0CrPSu1O0ENRX_hc9dHjNk6SxPjS&amp;sig=AHIEtbSNUnz4J_fonSY-LCM60WBGc0GLxw "Old York Village, Chesterfield Wins an American Planning Association Award for an Outstanding Project/ Program/ Tool"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesterfieldtwp.com/Smart%20Growth/smartgrowthpage.html "Old York Village Implementing Smart Growth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001092432/http://www.chesterfieldtwp.com/Smart%20Growth/smartgrowthpage.html |date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesterfieldtwp.com/Smart%20Growth/Master%20Plan%20Amendment-May%2028,%202002.pdf "Master Plan Amendment: Township of Chesterfield"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norfolk VA East Beach ====
Norfolk, VA, East Beach. designed and built in the style of traditional Atlantic coastal villages. The Master Plan for East Beach was developed in the style of “New Urbanism” by world renowned TND master planners Duany Plater-Zyberk.  Newly constructed homes reflect traditional classic detail and proportion of Tidewater Virginia homes, and are built with materials that will withstand the test of time and forces of Mother Nature and the Chesapeake Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbeachnorfolk.com/index.php|title=East Beach Norfolk – Luxury Condos, Villas, Waterfront Homes – A Simple Life on the Chesapeake Bay|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===

New Urbanism is closely related to the [[Urban village]] movement in Europe. They both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning. In Europe many brown-field sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than Modernist models. One well-publicized example is [[Poundbury]] in England, a suburban extension to the town of Dorchester, which was built on land owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] under the overview of [[Prince Charles]]. The original masterplan was designed by [[Leon Krier]]. A report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents, although the aspirations to reduce [[car dependency]] had not been successful. Rising house prices and a perceived premium have made the open market housing unaffordable for many local people.&lt;ref name="poundbury"&gt;WATSON, G., BENTLEY, I., ROAF, S. and SMITH, P., 2004. Learning from Poundbury, Research for the West Dorset District Council and the Duchy of Cornwall. Oxford Brookes University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council for European Urbanism (CEU), formed in 2003, shares many of the same aims as the U.S.'s New Urbanists. CEU's Charter is a development of the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] Charter revised and reorganised to relate better to European conditions. An Australian organisation, Australian Council for New Urbanism has since 2001 run conferences and events to promote New Urbanism in that country. A [[New Zealand Urban Design Protocol]] was created by the Ministry for the Environment in 2005.

There are many developments around the world that follow New Urbanist principles to a greater or lesser extent:

====Europe====
*[[Le Plessis-Robinson]], a 21st-century example of [[New classical architecture|neo-traditionalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/57600|title=Le Plessis-Robinson: A Model for Smart Growth|work=Planetizen: The independent resource for people passionate about planning and related fields}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the south-west of Paris. This city is in the process of transforming itself, destroying old modern blocklike buildings and replacing them with traditional buildings and houses in one of the biggest worldwide projects with Val d'Europe.  In 2008 the city was nominated best architectural project of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeunesarchi.com{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Poundbury]], in Dorset, England, is a neotraditionalist urban extension focussed on high quality urban realm and the expression of traditional modes of urban or village life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/behind-the-facade-of-prince-charless-poundbury_o|title=Behind the Façade of Prince Charles's Poundbury|date=2013-12-03|newspaper=Architect|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tornagrain]], Between Inverness and Nairn, Scotland, The design is based on the architectural and planning traditions  of the Highlands and the rest of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tornagrain.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Val d'Europe]], east of Paris, France. Developed by [[Disneyland Resort Paris]], this town is a kind of European counterpart to Walt Disney World Celebration City.
*[[Jakriborg]], in Southern [[Sweden]], is a recent example of the New Urbanist movement.
*[[Brandevoort]], in [[Helmond]], in the [[Netherlands]], is a new example of the New Urbanist movement.
*''Sankt Eriksområdet'' quarter in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], built in the 1990s.
*Other developments can be found at Heulebrug, part of [[Knokke-Heist]], in [[Belgium]], and Fonti di Matilde in [[:it:San Bartolomeo (Reggio Emilia)|San Bartolomeo]] (outside of [[Reggio Emilia]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interactive.wttw.com/bontempi/selected-works|title=Bontempi Selected Works|work=WTTW Chicago Public Media – Television and Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]].
*[[Kartanonkoski]], in [[Vantaa]], [[Finland]], is the only example of neotraditional architecture in Finland implemented on a larger scale. The area has around 4000 inhabitants and its architecture has been mainly influenced by [[Nordic Classicism]].

====Americas====
*[[Mahogany Bay Village, Belize]], is a 60-acre New Urbanist community on Ambergris Caye, Belize. 
*[[Orchid Bay, Belize]], is one of the largest New Urbanist projects in Central America and the Caribbean.
*[[Las Catalinas, Costa Rica]], is a coastal town in the [[Guanacaste Province]] of Northwest [[Costa Rica]]. Envisioned as a compact, walkable beach town, Las Catalinas was founded in 2006 by [[Charles Brewer (businessman)|Charles Brewer]] and incorporates many of the principles of New Urbanism.
*[[McKenzie Towne, Calgary|McKenzie Towne]] is a New Urbanist development which commenced in 1995 by [[Carma Developers]] LP in [[Calgary]].
*[[Cornell, Ontario|Cornell]], within the city of [[Markham, Ontario]], was designed with walkable neighborhoods, density to support public transit, a variety of housing types and retail.&lt;ref&gt;

*New Amherst is a new urbanist development in the town of [[Cobourg, Ontario]].
*[[UniverCity]], beside the [[Simon Fraser University]] campus on Burnaby Mountain in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]], is an award-winning sustainable community that is designed to be walkable, dense, and well connected to public transit networks.

====Asia====
*The structure plan for [[Thimphu]], [[Bhutan]], follows [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]], which share underlying axioms with the New Urbanism.

====Africa====
There are several such developments in South Africa. The most notable is [[Melrose Arch]] in [[Johannesburg]]. [[Triple Point (East London)|Triple Point]] is a comparable mixed-use development in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], in [[Eastern Cape]] province. The development, announced in 2007, comprises 30&amp;nbsp;hectares. It is made up of three apartment complexes together with over 30 residential sites as well as 20,000 sq&amp;nbsp;m of residential and office space. The development is valued at over R2&amp;nbsp;billion ($250&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eprop.co.za/news/item/9127-East-London-gets-own-Melrose-Arch.html |title="EAST LONDON GETS OWN MELROSE ARCH", ''eProp.co.za, 12 December 2007 |access-date=2013-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427102550/http://www.eprop.co.za/news/item/9127-East-London-gets-own-Melrose-Arch.html |archive-date=2015-04-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been cases where market forces of urban decay are confused with new urbanism in [https://www.africaurban.org/debunking-new-urbanism-harare/ African cities].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.africaurban.org/debunking-new-urbanism-harare/|title=Debunking New Urbanism in Harare|last=Muzenda|first=Archimedes|date=|website=|publisher=African Urban Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907144749/https://www.africaurban.org/debunking-new-urbanism-harare/|archive-date=2018-09-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to a form of suburban mixed-use development that does not promote walkability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infrastructurene.ws/2016/08/25/in-search-of-a-new-african-urbanism/|title=In search of a new African urbanism {{!}} Infrastructure news|website=www.infrastructurene.ws|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.up.ac.za/media/shared/Legacy/sitefiles/file/44/1068/3229/9086/africanperspectives/pdf/papers/viana.pdf|title=African City: towards a new paradigm –“chameleonic” urbanism for hybrid cities|last=Viana|first=|date=|website=|publisher=African Perspectives Conference Proceedings|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
Most new developments on the edges of Australia's major cities are master planned, often guided expressly by the principles of New Urbanism. The relationship between housing, activity centres, the transport network and key social infrastructure (sporting facilities, libraries, community centres etc.) is defined at structure planning stage.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;
*Tullimbar Village, NSW Australia, is a new development which follows the principles of New Urbanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tullimbar Village :: Wollongong NSW :: Contemporary Lifestyle Community|url = http://www.tullimbarvillage.com.au|website = www.tullimbarvillage.com.au|accessdate = 2015-05-29|first = Screen|last = Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}{{primary source inline|date=December 2017}}

Another important factor or principle of New Urbanism that guides Australia's major cities is how good their foot circulation seems to be which is guided by the wayfinding systems that are implemented. Kenneth B. Hall, Jr. and Gerald A. Porterfield said in their book, "Community by Design," the way to gain good circulation is to take some thoughtful consideration to things like wayfinding, sight lines, transition, visual clues, and reference points.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community by Design|last=Hall|first=Kenneth B.|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|others=Gerald A. Porterfield|year=2001|location=|pages=97|doi=10.1036/007141794X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulation design should work to create an interesting and informative system that utilizes subtle elements as well as technical ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; City of Port Philip, Australia,  is a good example of wayfinding where they have come up with a comprehensive pedestrian signage system, specifically for their local areas of St Kilda, South Melbourne and Port Melbourne.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoriawalks.org.au/wayfinding/|title=Case study - Wayfinding signage|website=www.victoriawalks.org.au|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.studiobinocular.com/2013/02/city-of-port-phillip-wayfinding/|title=City of Port Phillip: Wayfinding - Studio Binocular|date=2013-02-09|work=Studio Binocular|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's wayfinding system consists of 26 individually designed panels that are placed on some major streets such as St Kilda and St Kilda East, linking St Kilda Junction and Balaclava Station to the foreshore via Fitzroy, Carlisle and Acland Streets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; City of Port Philip also created directional signage systems that makes use of the already existing street furniture such as trash cans to help provide for 130 directional indicators across Port Melbourne.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Offsite construction''' refers to the planning, design, fabrication, and assembly of building elements at a location other than their final installed location to support the rapid and efficient construction of a permanent structure.  Such building elements may be prefabricated in a different location and transported to the site or prefabricated on the construction site and then transported to their final location.  Offsite construction is characterized by an integrated planning and supply chain optimization strategy.  Offsite manufacturing (OSM), offsite production (OSP) and offsite fabrication (OSF) are used when referring primarily to the factory work proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=Offsite Architecture|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon and New York|isbn=978-1-138-82137-8|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building configurations ==
Off-site construction (like on-site construction) can be used for a variety of purposes including residential, educational, health care and commercial applications. Buildings can range from a few modular units to several hundred. They can be arranged in architectural configurations and can be many stories in height.
== Similarities ==
Off-site construction is similar to [[modular building|modular construction]], but it is focused primarily on permanent construction; modular construction can be either permanent or relocatable. Also known as offsite construction, or OSC, and also incorporates many MMC - or Modern Methods of Construction

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8707">The '''open-circuit time constant method''' is an approximate analysis technique used in electronic circuit design to determine the corner frequency of [[complex circuit]]s. It also is known as the '''zero-value time constant technique'''. The method provides a quick evaluation, and identifies the largest contributions to time constants as a guide to the circuit improvements.

The basis of the method is the approximation that the corner frequency of the amplifier is determined by the term in the denominator of its transfer function that is linear in frequency. This approximation can be extremely inaccurate in some cases where a zero in the numerator is near in frequency.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The method also uses a simplified method for finding the term linear in frequency based upon summing the RC-products for each capacitor in the circuit, where the resistor R for a selected capacitor is the resistance found by inserting a test source at its site and setting all other capacitors to zero. Hence the name ''zero-value time constant technique''.

==Example: Simple RC network==
[[File:Open-circuit time constant.PNG|thumbnail|500px|Figure 1: Simple RC circuit and auxiliary circuits to find time constants]]
Figure 1 shows a simple RC low-pass filter. Its [[transfer function]] is found using [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's current law]] as follows. At the output,

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {V_1 - V_O } {R_2} = j\omega C_2 V_O \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage at the top of capacitor ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. At the center node:

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {V_S-V_1}{R_1} = j \omega C_1 V_1 + \frac {V_1-V_O} {R_2} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Combining these relations the transfer function is found to be:

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {V_O} {V_S} = \frac {1} {1 + j \omega \left(C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1 \right) +(j \omega )^2 C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2 } &lt;/math&gt;

The linear term in ''j''ω in this transfer function can be derived by the following method, which is an application of the open-circuit time constant method to this example.
# Set the signal source to zero.
# Select capacitor ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, replace it by a test voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, and replace ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by an open circuit. Then the resistance seen by the test voltage is found using the circuit in the middle panel of Figure 1 and is simply ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; =  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Form the product ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ( ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ).
# Select capacitor ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, replace it by a test voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, and replace ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by an open circuit. Then the resistance seen by the test voltage is found using the circuit in the right panel of Figure 1 and is simply ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Form the product ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Add these terms.

In effect, it is as though each capacitor charges and discharges through the resistance found in the circuit when the other capacitor is an open circuit.

The open circuit time constant procedure provides the linear term in ''j''ω regardless of how complex the RC network becomes. For a complex circuit, the procedure consists of following the above rules, going through all the  capacitors in the circuit. A more general derivation is found in Gray and Meyer.&lt;ref name=Gray-Meyer&gt;
{{cite book 
|author=Paul R. Gray, Hurst P J Lewis S H &amp; Meyer RG

|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0-471-32168-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

So far the result is general, but an approximation is introduced to make use of this result: the assumption is made that this linear term in ''j''ω determines the corner frequency of the circuit.

That assumption can be examined more closely using the example of Figure 1: suppose the time constants of this circuit are τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; that is:

::&lt;math&gt; \left( 1 + j \omega { \tau}_1) (1 +j \omega {\tau}_2 \right) = 1 + j \omega \left(C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1 \right) +(j \omega )^2 C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the coefficients of the linear and quadratic terms in ''j''ω, there results:

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 + \tau_2 = C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1  \ , &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 \tau_2 = C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

One of the two time constants will be the longest; let it be τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Suppose for the moment that it is much larger than the other, τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, the approximations hold that:

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 + \tau_2 \approx \tau_1 \ , &lt;/math&gt;

and

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_2 = \frac {\tau_1 \tau_2 } { \tau_1} \approx \frac {\tau_1 \tau_2 } { \tau_1 + \tau_2 } \ . &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, substituting the RC-values:

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 \approx \hat { \tau_1} =\ \tau_1 + \tau_2  = C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1   \ , &lt;/math&gt;
and
::&lt;math&gt; \tau_2 \approx \hat { \tau_2} =\frac {\tau_1 \tau_2 } { \tau_1 + \tau_2 } = \frac {C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2} {C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ( ^ ) denotes the approximate result. As an aside, notice that the circuit time constants both involve both capacitors; in other words, in general the circuit time constants are not decided by any single capacitor. Using these results, it is easy to explore how well the corner frequency (the 3&amp;nbsp;dB frequency) is given by

::&lt;math&gt; f_{3dB} = \frac {1} {2 \pi \hat{ \tau_1 }} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Open Circuit Time Constant Estimates.PNG|thumbnail|400px|Figure 2: Comparison of OCTC estimates with actual pole positions]]
as the parameters vary. Also, the exact transfer function can be compared with the approximate one, that is,

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {(1+j \omega \tau_1)(1 + j \omega \tau_2)}\ &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \ &lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp;  with  &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt; \ &lt;/math&gt;   &lt;math&gt;\  \frac {1} {(1+j \omega \hat {\tau_1 })(1 + j \omega \hat { \tau_2} )} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Of course agreement is good when the assumption τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is accurate.

Figure 2 illustrates the approximation. The x-axis is the ratio τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a logarithmic scale. An increase in this variable means the higher pole is further above the corner frequency. The y-axis is the ratio of the OCTC (open-circuit time constant) estimate to the true time constant. For the lowest pole use curve T_1; this curve refers to the corner frequency; and for the higher pole use curve T_2.  The worst agreement is for τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the corner frequency is a factor of 2 too small. The higher pole is a factor of 2 too high (its time constant is half of the real value).

In all cases, the estimated corner frequency is closer than a factor of two from the real one, and always is ''conservative'' that is, lower than the real corner, so the actual circuit will behave better than predicted. However, the higher pole always is ''optimistic'', that is, predicts the high pole at a higher frequency than really is the case. To use these estimates for [[Step response#Control of overshoot|step response]] predictions, which depend upon the ratio of the two pole frequencies (see article on [[Pole splitting#Selection of CC|pole splitting]] for an example), Figure 2 suggests a fairly large ratio of τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is needed for accuracy because the errors in τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reinforce each other in the ratio τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The open-circuit time constant method focuses upon the corner frequency alone, but as seen above, estimates for higher poles also are possible.

Application of the open-circuit time constant method to a number of single transistor amplifier stages can be found in Pittet and Kandaswamy.&lt;ref name=Pittet&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6065">'''Ophiophagy''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὄφις + φαγία}} "snake eating") is a specialized form of [[feeding]] or alimentary [[behavior]] of animals which [[predation|hunt]] and eat [[snake]]s. There are ophiophagous [[mammal]]s (such as the [[skunk]]s and the [[mongoose]]s), [[bird]]s (such as [[Circaetinae|snake eagles]], the [[secretarybird]], and some [[hawk]]s), [[lizard]]s (such as the [[common collared lizard]]), and even other snakes, such as the Central and South American [[mussurana]]s and the North American [[Lampropeltis getula|common kingsnake]]. The genus of the venomous [[king cobra]] (''Ophiophagus hannah'') is named for this habit.

==Ophiophagy in myth and legend==
:''The mythic associations of snakes are discussed at [[Serpent (symbolism)]].''
A snake-eating bird of prey appears in a [[legend]] of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] people, who gave rise to the [[Aztec]] empire, and it is represented in the [[flag of Mexico|Mexican flag]]: The [[Mexica]]s, guided by their god [[Huitzilopochtli]], sought a place where the bird landed on a [[Opuntia|prickly pear cactus]], devouring a snake. They found the sign on an island in [[Lake Texcoco]], where they erected the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] ("Place of the Prickly Pear Cactus" &amp;ndash; present-day [[Mexico City]]) in 1325. (In the [[coat of arms of Mexico]] this bird is depicted as a [[golden eagle]], though it is often said to be a [[northern caracara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siti.com.mx/musave.dir/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907150539/http://www.siti.com.mx/musave.dir/ |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that the bird was a [[laughing falcon]] or snake hawk, a bird of prey which feeds almost exclusively on snakes.) 
[[Image:Coat of arms of Mexico.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of Mexico]]

The [[Maya peoples|Mayans]] also had the legend of ophiophagy in their [[folklore]] and [[mythology]]. 

[[Guatemala]] may derive its name from the [[Nahuatl]] word ''coactlmoctl-lan'', meaning "land of the snake-eating bird."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.questconnect.org/ca_guatemala.htm |title=Guatemala |publisher=Questconnect.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity|Christian]] folklore associates snakes with [[evil]] (see [[serpent (symbolism)#Serpents in Judeo-Christian Mythology|serpent]]) and considers anything that destroys them good. An example for this tradition is [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[short story]] "[[Rikki-Tikki-Tavi]]" (in ''[[The Jungle Book]]''), in which Rikki-Tikki, a [[mongoose]], defends a human family against a pair of evil [[cobra]]s.

In [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] scriptures, [[Garuda]], the mount of [[Vishnu]], is the enemy to the [[Naga (mythology)|Nāgas]], a race of intelligent serpent- or dragon-like beings, whom he hunts.

==Practical use==
[[Image:Morphnus_guianensis_eating_green_snake_-Bolivia-8.jpg|thumb|[[Crested eagle]] with [[emerald tree boa]] prey]]

In some regions, farmers keep ophiophagous animals as [[pet]]s in order to keep their living environment clear of such snakes as [[cobra]]s and [[Crotalinae|pit viper]]s (including [[rattlesnake]]s and [[Bothrops|lanceheads]]) which annually claim a large number of deaths of domestic animals, such as [[cattle]], and bites on humans. An example is tamed [[mongoose]]s in [[India]]. In the 1930s a [[Brazil]]ian plan to breed and release large numbers of [[mussurana]]s for the control of pit vipers was tried but didn't work. The [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]], in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]], which specializes in the production of [[antivenom]]s, erected a statue of the mussurana ''[[Clelia clelia]]'' as its symbol and a tribute to its usefulness in combating venomous snake bites. Peafowl have been kept for millennia due to their ophiophagous habit.

==Immunity==
Many ophiophagous animals seem to be immune to the [[venom]] of the usual [[venomous snake|snakes]] they prey and feed upon. The phenomenon was studied in the [[mussurana]] by the Brazilian scientist [[Vital Brazil]]. They have [[antihemorrhagic]] and antineurotoxic [[antibody|antibodies]] in their [[blood]]. The [[Virginia opossum]] (''Didelphis virginiana'') has been found to have the most resistance towards snake venom. This immunity is not acquired and has probably evolved as an adaptation to predation by venomous snakes in their [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]].

In [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', the author correctly dismisses the idea of [[mongoose]]s ingesting herbs to combat poison as old folklore. He attributes no special abilities to the animal other than superb agility and skill at avoiding being bitten. However, recent studies have shown that the mongoose's ability to resist snake venom is at least in part due to its modified nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) that does not bind with [[Alpha-Bungarotoxin|alpha-BTX]], and [[alpha-neurotoxin]] (Barchan et al. 1992).

'''Papyrus''' {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|p|aɪ|r|ə|s}} is a material similar to thick [[paper]] that was used in ancient times as a [[writing surface]]. It was made from the [[pith]] of the papyrus plant, ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'', a wetland [[sedge]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Papyrus | title=Papyrus definition | work=Dictionary.com | accessdate=20 November 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Papyrus'' (plural: ''papyri'') can also refer to a document written on sheets of such material, joined together side by side and rolled up into a [[scroll]], an early form of a book. 

[[Image:Letter on Papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An official letter on a papyrus of the 3rd century BCE]]
Papyrus is first known to have been used in [[Egypt]] (at least as far back as the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]]), as the papyrus plant was once abundant across the [[Nile Delta]]. It was also used [[History of the Mediterranean|throughout the Mediterranean]] region and in the [[Kingdom of Kush]]. Apart from a writing material, ancient Egyptians employed papyrus in the construction of other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], such as [[reed boats]], [[mat]]s, [[rope]], [[sandals]], and [[basket]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebers Papyrus|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177583/Ebers-papyrus|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Paper and Books in Ancient Egypt: An Inaugural Lecture Delivered at University College London, 29 May 1947''. London: H. K. Lewis. (Reprinted Chicago: Ares Publishers Inc., 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Sheets of parchment were folded to form quires from which [[Codex|book-form codices]] were fashioned. [[List of early Christian writers|Early Christian writers]] soon adopted the codex form, and in the Græco-Roman world, it became common to cut sheets from papyrus rolls to form codices.

Codices were an improvement on the papyrus scroll, as the papyrus was not pliable enough to fold without cracking and a long roll, or scroll, was required to create large-volume texts. Papyrus had the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to produce, but it was fragile and susceptible to both moisture and excessive dryness. Unless the papyrus was of perfect quality, the writing surface was irregular, and the range of media that could be used was also limited.

Papyrus was replaced in Europe by the cheaper, locally produced products [[parchment]] and [[vellum]], of significantly higher durability in moist climates, though [[Henri Pirenne]]'s connection of its disappearance with the Muslim conquest of Egypt is contested.&lt;ref&gt;Pirenne, ''Mohammed and Charlemagne'', critiqued by R.S. Lopez, "Mohammed and Charlemagne: a revision", ''Speculum'' (1943:14–38.).&lt;/ref&gt; Its last appearance in the [[Merovingian]] chancery is with a document of 692, though it was known in [[Gaul]] until the middle of the following century. The latest certain dates for the use of papyrus are 1057 for a papal decree (typically conservative, all [[papal bull]]s were on papyrus until 1022), under [[Pope Victor II]],&lt;ref&gt;[[David Diringer]], ''The Book before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental'', Dover Publications, New York 1982, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1087 for an Arabic document. Its use in Egypt continued until it was replaced by more inexpensive [[paper]] introduced by the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] who originally learned of it from the Chinese. By the 12th century, parchment and paper were in use in the [[Byzantine Empire]], but papyrus was still an option.&lt;ref name=Byzantine&gt;Bompaire, Jacques and Jean Irigoin. ''La paleographie grecque et byzantine'', Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1977, 389 n. 6, cited in Alice-Mary Talbot (ed.). ''Holy women of Byzantium'', Dumbarton Oaks, 1996, p. 227. {{ISBN|0-88402-248-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Papyrus was made in several qualities and prices. [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Isidore of Seville]] described six variations of papyrus which were sold in the Roman market of the day. These were graded by quality based on how fine, firm, white, and smooth the writing surface was. Grades ranged from the superfine Augustan, which was produced in sheets of 13 digits (10 inches) wide, to the least expensive and most coarse, measuring six digits (four inches) wide. Materials deemed unusable for writing or less than six digits were considered commercial quality and were pasted edge to edge to be used only for wrapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=N|year=1983|title=Papyrus and Ancient Writing: The First Hundred Years of Papyrology|url=|journal=Archaeology|volume=36 |issue=4|pages=31–37|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the middle of the 19th century, only some isolated documents written on papyrus were known, and that museums simply displayed them as curiosities.&lt;ref name="Betz"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans Dieter Betz|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3684249.html|year=1992|title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not contain literary works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic G.

He wrote about the content of the [[Leyden papyrus X|Leyden papyrus]], published in 1830. The first publication has been credited to the British scholar [[Charles Wycliffe Goodwin]] (1817–1878), who published for the [[Cambridge Antiquarian Society]], one of the [[Papyri Graecae Magicae]] V, translated into English with commentary in 1853.&lt;ref name="Betz" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[English language|English]] word "papyrus" derives, via [[Latin]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] πάπυρος (''papyros''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpa%2Fpuros πάπυρος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; a loanword of unknown (perhaps [[Pre-Greek]]) origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1151.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek has a second word for it, βύβλος (''byblos'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbu%2Fblos βύβλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; said to derive from the name of the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Byblos]]). The Greek writer [[Theophrastus]], who flourished during the 4th century BCE, uses ''papyros'' when referring to the plant used as a foodstuff and ''byblos'' for the same plant when used for nonfood products, such as cordage, basketry, or writing surfaces. The more specific term βίβλος ''biblos'', which finds its way into English in such words as 'bibliography', 'bibliophile', and 'bible', refers to the inner bark of the papyrus plant. ''Papyrus'' is also the etymon of 'paper', a similar substance.

In the [[Egyptian language]], papyrus was called ''wadj'' (''w3ḏ''), ''tjufy'' (''ṯwfy''), or ''djet'' (''ḏt'').

== Documents written on papyrus ==
[[File:Papyrus bill of sale donkey.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bill of sale for a donkey, papyrus; 19.3 by 7.2&amp;nbsp;cm, MS Gr SM2223, Houghton Library, Harvard University]]

The word for the material papyrus is also used to designate documents written on sheets of it, often rolled up into scrolls. The plural for such documents is papyri. Historical papyri are given identifying names—generally the name of the discoverer, first owner or institution where they are kept—and numbered, such as "[[Papyrus Harris I]]". Often an abbreviated form is used, such as "pHarris I". These documents provide important information on ancient writings; they give us the only extant copy of [[Menander]], the Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]], Egyptian treatises on medicine (the [[Ebers Papyrus]]) and on surgery (the [[Edwin Smith papyrus]]), Egyptian mathematical treatises (the [[Rhind papyrus]]), and Egyptian folk tales (the [[Westcar papyrus]]). When, in the 18th century, a library of ancient papyri was found in [[Herculaneum]], ripples of expectation spread among the learned men of the time. However, since these papyri were badly charred, their unscrolling and deciphering is still going on today.

== Manufacture and use ==
[[File:Papyrus sheet.svg|thumb|right|Different ways of cutting papyrus stem and making of papyrus sheet]]
[[File:kew.gardens.papyrus.plant.arp.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Papyrus plant ''Cyperus papyrus'' at Kew Gardens, London]]
[[File:Cyperus papyrus-pjt3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Papyrus plants near [[Syracuse, Sicily]]]]

Papyrus is made from the stem of the papyrus plant, ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]''. The outer rind is first removed, and the sticky fibrous inner [[pith]] is cut lengthwise into thin strips of about {{convert|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. The strips are then placed side by side on a hard surface with their edges slightly overlapping, and then another layer of strips is laid on top at a right angle. The strips may have been soaked in water long enough for [[decomposition]] to begin, perhaps increasing adhesion, but this is not certain. The two layers possibly were glued together.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Greek and Latin Palaeography'', Maunde Thompson. [https://archive.org/details/greeklatin00thomuoft archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; While still moist, the two layers are hammered together, mashing the layers into a single sheet. The sheet is then dried under pressure. After drying, the sheet is polished with some rounded object, possibly a stone or seashell or round hardwood.&lt;ref&gt;Bierbrier, Morris Leonard, ed. 1986. ''Papyrus: Structure and Usage''. British Museum Occasional Papers 60, ser. ed. Anne Marriott. London: British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheets could be cut to fit the obligatory size or glued together to create a longer roll. A wooden stick would be attached to the last sheet in a roll, making it easier to handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|year=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; To form the long strip scrolls required, a number of such sheets were united, placed so all the horizontal fibres parallel with the roll's length were on one side and all the vertical fibres on the other. Normally, texts were first written on the ''[[recto]]'', the lines following the fibres, parallel to the long edges of the scroll. Secondarily, papyrus was often reused, writing across the fibres on the ''[[verso]]''.&lt;ref name = Skeat/&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] describes the methods of preparing papyrus in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''.

In a dry [[climate]], like that of Egypt, papyrus is stable, formed as it is of highly rot-resistant [[cellulose]]; but storage in humid conditions can result in [[mold]]s attacking and destroying the material. Library papyrus rolls were stored in wooden boxes and chests made in the form of statues. Papyrus scrolls were organized according to subject or author, and identified with clay labels that specified their contents without having to unroll the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|year=2009|publisher=Skyhorse|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European conditions, papyrus seems to have lasted only a matter of decades; a 200-year-old papyrus was considered extraordinary. Imported papyrus once commonplace in [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] has since deteriorated beyond repair, but papyri are still being found in Egypt; extraordinary examples include the [[Elephantine papyri]] and the famous finds at [[Oxyrhynchus]] and [[Nag Hammadi]]. The [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], containing the library of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BCE)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]], [[Julius Caesar]]'s father-in-law, was preserved by the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]], but has only been partially excavated.

Sporadic attempts to revive the manufacture of papyrus have been made since the mid-18th century. [[Scotland|Scottish]] explorer [[James Bruce]] experimented in the late 18th century with papyrus plants from the [[Sudan]], for papyrus had become extinct in Egypt. Also in the 18th century, [[Sicily|Sicilian]] Saverio Landolina manufactured papyrus at [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], where papyrus plants had continued to grow in the wild.  During the 1920s, when Egyptologist [[Battiscombe Gunn]] lived in [[Maadi]], outside Cairo, he experimented with the manufacture of papyrus, growing the plant in his garden. He beat the sliced papyrus stalks between two layers of linen, and produced successful examples of papyrus, one of which was exhibited in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo.&lt;ref name=Cerny&gt;{{cite book   | first = Jaroslav   | last = Cerny  | title = Paper and books in Ancient Egypt  | publisher = H. K. Lewis &amp; Co. Ltd.  | location = London  | year = 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{cite book  | first = A.  | last = Lucas  | title = Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries, 2nd Ed  | publisher = Edward Arnold and Co.  | location = London  | year = 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern technique of papyrus production used in Egypt for the tourist trade was developed in 1962 by the Egyptian engineer Hassan Ragab using plants that had been reintroduced into Egypt in 1872 from France. Both Sicily and Egypt have centres of limited papyrus production.

Papyrus is still used by communities living in the vicinity of swamps, to the extent that rural householders derive up to 75% of their income from swamp goods.&lt;ref&gt;(Maclean et al. 2003b; c).&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in East and Central Africa, people harvest papyrus, which is used to manufacture items that are sold or used locally. Examples include baskets, hats, fish traps, trays or winnowing mats, and floor mats.&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, S. 2000. ''Papyrus and its Uses in Modern Day Russia'', Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;56–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Papyrus is also used to make roofs, ceilings, rope and fences. Although alternatives, such as [[eucalyptus]], are increasingly available, papyrus is still used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, I.M.D., R. Tinch, M. Hassall and R.R. Boar. 2003c.

== Description ==

A growth in mobile devices, for example [[smartphones]], [[tablet computers]] or [[activity trackers]], which have multiple sensors, has made participatory sensing viable in the large-scale.

'''Philip Leroy Culbertson''' (born 1944) is a scholar in [[Practical Theology]]. He was a lecturer at the [[University of Auckland School of Theology]] and was Director of Pastoral Studies at St John's Theological College until his retirement in 2007. Before this he taught at the School of Theology, University of the South, Sewanee, TN, from 1985 to 1992. He is an ordained priest of the [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]] tradition. He is also a [[psychotherapist]] in private practice and has taught at two training institutes in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. He is well published in the fields of Pastoral ministry, counselling, gender{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and spirituality (particularly in relation to some of the Old Testament), and Jewish/Christian dialogue.

In 2004 Culbertson was interviewed by Sunday, a current affairs show broadcast in New Zealand, regarding his opinion of the controversial [[Destiny Church (New Zealand)|Destiny Church]] led by Bishop [[Brian Tamaki]] in which among other things he stated, "As far as I can tell it's a [[cult]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Destiny|first=Peter|last=Lineham|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9939">The term '''phonestheme''' ({{IPAc-en|f|oʊ|ˈ|n|ɛ|s|θ|iː|m}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|phonestheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''phonaestheme''' in British English) was coined in 1930 by British linguist [[J. R. Firth]] (from the Greek φωνή ''phone'', "sound", and αἴσθημα ''aisthema'', "perception" from αίσθάνομαι ''aisthanomai'', "I perceive")  to label the systematic pairing of form and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in a [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Firth, J. R. | authorlink = J. R. Firth |year=1964 |orig-year=1930 |title = The Tongues of Men, and Speech | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = London | page = 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such pairing would violate the [[Course_in_General_Linguistics#Arbitrariness|arbitrariness principle]] of [[semantics]].

A phonestheme is different from a [[morpheme]] because it does not meet the normal criterion of [[compositionality]].

Within [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce's]] "theory of signs" the phonestheme is considered to be an "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|icon]]" rather than a "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|symbol]]" or an "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|index]]".

==Identification==
Phonesthemes are of critical interest to students of the internal structure of words because they appear to be a case where the internal structure of the word is non-compositional; i.e., a word with a phonestheme in it has other material in it that is not itself a morpheme.  Phonesthemes "fascinate some linguists", as [[Ben Zimmer]] has phrased it, in a process that can become "mystical" or "unscientific".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |author-link=Ben_Zimmer |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/lexicon_valley/2014/10/lexicon_valley_the_etymology_and_history_of_the_word_snark_with_lexicographer.html |title=Where Did the Word ''Snark'' Come From? |website=Lexicon Valley |publisher=Slate |host=Bob Garfield and Mike Vuolo |date=2014-10-20 |time=0:27:30 |access-date=2015-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, the English phonestheme "gl-" occurs in a large number of words relating to light or vision, like "glitter", "glisten", "glow", "gleam", "glare", "glint", "glimmer", "gloss", and so on; yet, despite this, the remainder of each word is not itself a phonestheme (i.e., a pairing of form and meaning); i.e., "-isten", "-ow", and "-eam" do not make meaningful contributions to "glisten", "glow", and "gleam".
There are three main ways in which phonesthemes are empirically identified.

===Corpus studies===
The first is through corpus studies, where the words of a language are subjected to statistical analysis, and the particular form-meaning pairing, or phonestheme, is shown to constitute a statistically unexpected distribution in the lexicon or not.

Corpus studies can inform a researcher about the current state of the lexicon, a critical first step, but importantly are completely uninformative when it comes to questions of whether and how phonesthemes are represented in the minds of language users.

===Study of patterns in neologisms===
The second type of approach makes use of the tendency for phonesthemes to participate in the coinage and interpretation of [[neologisms]] (i.e., new words in a language). Various studies have demonstrated that, when asked to invent or interpret new words, subjects tend to follow the patterns that are predicted by the phonesthemes in their language. It is known, for example, that the word ''bangle'' is a [[Loanword|loan]] from [[Hindi language|Hindi]] but speakers tend to associate it with English [[onomatopoeia]] like ''bang''. While this approach demonstrates the vitality of phonesthemic patterns, it does not provide any evidence about whether (or how) phonesthemes are represented in the minds of speaker-hearers.

===Study of linguistic processing patterns===
The final type of evidence uses the methods of [[psycholinguistics]] to study exactly how phonesthemes participate in language processing. One such method is phonesthemic priming — akin to morphological priming — which demonstrates that people represent phonesthemes much as they do typical morphemes, despite the fact that phonesthemes are non-compositional.

Discussions of phonesthesia are often grouped with other phenomena under the rubric of [[sound symbolism]].

==Distribution==
Phonesthemes have been documented in numerous languages from diverse language families, among them English, Swedish, and other [[Indo-European languages]], [[Austronesian languages]], and Japanese.

While phonesthemes have mostly been identified in the onsets of words and syllables, they can have other forms. There has been some argument that sequences like "-ash" and "-ack" in English also serve as phonesthemes, due to their patterning in words that denote forceful, destructive contact ("smash", "crash", "bash", etc.) and abrupt contact ("smack", "whack", "crack", etc.), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bolinger |first=Dwight |date=1980 |title=Language, the Loaded Weapon: The use and abuse of language today |location=New York |publisher=Longman |page=20 |isbn=0582291089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the distribution of phonesthemes, linguists consider their ''motivation''. In some cases, there may appear to be good sound-symbolic reasons why phonesthemes would have the form they have. In the case of "-ack", for example, we might imagine that the words sharing this phonestheme do so because they denote events that would produce a similar sound. But critically, there are many phonesthemes for which there can be no sound-symbolic basis, such as "gl-", for the simple reason that their meanings (such as 'pertaining to light or vision') entail no sound.

While there are numerous studies on living languages, research is lacking about ancient languages, although the first documented example of phonesthemes dates back to at least the fourth century B.C.: Plato's
Cratylus clearly mentioned the gl- and st- phonesthemes and their explanation in terms of phonosemantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leonardi |first=Filippo Maria |date=2015 |title=Phonesthemes in Latin Language |publisher=Academia.edu |url=https://www.academia.edu/17549917/Phonesthemes_in_Latin_Language_2015_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of phonesthemes in English (aside from "gl-"), include "sn-", related to the mouth or nose, as in "snarl", "snout", "snicker", "snack", and so on; and there is also a set of words starting with "sl-", which appears in words denoting frictionless motion, like "slide", "slick", "sled", and so on - which are themselves a subset of a larger set of words beginning with sl- that are pejorative behaviours, traits, or events: slack, slouch, sludge, slime, slosh, slash, sloppy, slug, sluggard, slattern, slut, slang, sly, slither, slow, sloth, sleepy, sleet, slip, slipshod, slope, slit, slay, sleek, slant, slovenly, slab, slap, slough, slum, slump, slobber, slaver, slur, slog, slate.

==Ablaut phonesthesia==
{{original research|section|date=November 2018}}
A further phonesthetic phenomenon, ablaut [[phonesthesia]], mimics the paradigm of a strong verb like ''swim'' : ''swam'' : ''swum'' with internal vowel change or ''[[apophony]]''. Take the word "flip."  It has an alliterative group, "fl-", that evokes the volatility of fly, flow, flee, fleet, flash, flake, and flick. Its rhymes, dip, sip, quip, drip, pip, tip, slip, and so forth, add to a connotation of minor labile action. But it is also part of an ablaut series where vowel alternation has semantic value (as in "flip-flop").

This kind of vowel alternation can be found in reduplicated word pairs like "pitter-patter," "chit-chat," "tip-top," or "tip-tap."

A regularity of phonesthetic relationship is shown by proportional analogies such as '''clip : clasp :: grip : grasp''';&lt;ref&gt;The conventionally abbreviated expressions, such as "'''clip : clasp :: grip : grasp'''", when fully expanded, are read as "'''clip''' is to '''clasp''' in precisely the same way as '''grip''' is to '''grasp'''", and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''crash : crush :: mash : mush'''; or '''crash : crunch :: mash : munch'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |mailing-list=Linguist List |last=Grew |first=Philip |title=re: 9.1050 Phonological Clusters of Semantically Similar Words |date=1998-08-05 |url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/9/9-1106.html |access-date=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the principle means that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave; the behavior should not astonish or surprise users.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Formulation==
A [[textbook]] formulation is: "People are part of the system. The design should match the user's experience, expectations, and [[mental model]]s."&lt;ref name="SaltzerKaashoek2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saltzer|first1=J. H.|last2=Kaashoek|first2=Frans|authorlink2 =  Frans Kaashoek | title=Principles of computer system design: an introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-NOcVMGWSUC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-12-374957-4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of "least surprising" behavior can depend on the expected [[audience]] (for example, [[end user]]s, [[programmer]]s, or [[System Administrators Day|system administrators]]).&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt;

In more practical terms, the principle aims to leverage the pre-existing knowledge of users to minimize the [[learning curve]], for instance by designing interfaces that borrow heavily from "functionally similar or analogous programs with which your users are likely to be familiar".&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt; User expectations in this respect may be closely related to a particular [[computing platform]] or [[tradition]]. For example, [[Unix]] command line programs are expected to follow certain conventions with respect to [[Switch (command line)|switches]],&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt; and [[GUI widget|widget]]s of [[Microsoft Windows]] programs are expected to follow certain conventions with respect to [[keyboard shortcut]]s.&lt;ref name="Petroutsos2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petroutsos|first=Evangelos|title=Mastering Microsoft Visual Basic 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7LZTSVKZDoC&amp;pg=PA133|year=2010|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-53287-4|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more abstract settings like an [[Application programming interface|API]], the expectation that [[Function (computer science)|function]] or method names intuitively match their behavior is another example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176622 |chapter=How to design a good API and why it matters |last=Bloch|first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Bloch |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |year=2006 |pages=506–7  |doi=10.1145/1176617.1176622 |isbn=1-59593-491-X  |title=Proceeding OOPSLA '06 Companion to the 21st ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Object-oriented programming systems, languages, and applications }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice also involves the application of sensible [[default (computer science)|default]]s.&lt;ref name="rexx" /&gt;

When two elements of an interface conflict, or are ambiguous, the behavior should be that which will least surprise the [[User (computing)|user]]; in particular a [[programmer]] should try to think of the behavior that will least surprise someone who uses the program, rather than that behavior that is natural from knowing the inner workings of the program.&lt;ref name="rexx"&gt;{{cite journal

|quote=Could there be a high astonishment factor associated with the new feature? If a feature is accidentally misapplied by the user and causes what appears to him to be an unpredictable result, that feature has a high astonishment factor and is therefore undesirable.

|doi=10.1147/sj.234.0326|authorlink=Mike Cowlishaw|accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A web site could declare an [[Form (HTML)|input]] that should autofocus when the page is loaded,&lt;ref name="Forms in HTML"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Forms_in_HTML#The_autofocus_attribute | title=Forms in HTML | publisher=Mozilla | work=Mozilla Developers Network | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a search field (e.g., [[Google.com]]), or the ''username'' field of a [[login]] [[Form (HTML)|form]].  Sites offering [[keyboard shortcut]]s often allow pressing {{Key press|?}} to see the available shortcuts.  Examples include [[Gmail]]&lt;ref name="Gmail Keyboard Shortcuts"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594 | title=Keyboard shortcuts for Gmail | author=Vivian | publisher=Google | date=2013-06-21 | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jira (software)|Jira]].&lt;ref name="Jira Using Keyboard Shortcuts"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Keyboard+Shortcuts#UsingKeyboardShortcuts-AccessingtheKeyboardShortcutsDialogBox | title=Using Keyboard Shortcuts | publisher=Atlassian | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{keypress|F1}} [[Function key]] in [[Windows operating system]]s is almost always for opening a help program associated with an application, and similarly for some of the Linux [[desktop environment]]s.  The corresponding key combination in [[Mac OS X]] is {{keypress|Command|Shift|/}}. Users expect a help screen or similar help services [[Context menu|popup]] when they press this key. Software binding this key to some other feature is likely to cause astonishment if no help appears. [[Malware|Malicious programs]] are known to exploit users' familiarity with regular shortcut keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9164038/Microsoft_Don_t_press_F1_key_in_Windows_XP |title=Microsoft: Don't press F1 key in Windows XP |newspaper=Computerworld |first=G. |last=Keizer |date=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In programming, a good example of this principle is the common &lt;code&gt;ParseInteger(string, radix)&lt;/code&gt; function which exists in most languages and is used to convert a [[String (computer science)|string]] to an integer value. The [[radix]] is usually an optional argument and assumed to be 10 (representing [[Decimal|base 10]]). Other bases are usually supported (like [[Binary number|binary]] or [[octal]]) but only when specified explicitly; when the radix argument is not specified, base 10 is assumed. Notably JavaScript did not originally adopt this behavior, which resulted in developer confusion and software bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5600366/why-does-the-radix-for-javascripts-parseint-default-to-8 |title=Why does the radix for JavaScript's parseInt default to 8? |date=8 April 2011 |work=Stack Overflow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10892">The  '''Proto-Ionians''' are the hypothetical earliest speakers of the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic dialects]] of [[Ancient Greek]], chiefly in the works of Jean Faucounau. The relation of Ionic to the other Greek dialects has been subject to some debate. It is mostly grouped with [[Arcadocypriot]] as opposed to [[Doric Greek|Doric]], reflecting two waves of migration into Greece following the [[Proto-Greek]] period, but sometimes also as separate from Arcadocypriot on equal footing with Doric, suggesting three distinct waves of migration.

==Position of Ionic Greek==

Mainstream Greek linguistics separates the [[Ancient Greek dialects|Greek dialects]] into two large genetic groups, one including [[Doric Greek]] and the other including both [[Arcadocypriot]] and [[Ionic Greek]]. But alternative approaches proposing three groups are not uncommon; Thumb and Kieckers (1932) propose three groups, classifying Ionic as genetically just as separate from Arcadocypriot as from Doric. Like a few other linguists (Vladimir Georgiev, C. Rhuijgh, P. Léveque, etc.),
The bipartite classification is known as the "Risch–Chadwick theory", named after its two famous proponents, Ernst Risch and [[John Chadwick]].{{ref|Chadwick}}

The "Proto-Ionians" first appear in the work of [[Ernst Curtius]] (1887), who believed that the [[Attic-Ionic]] dialect group was due to an "Ionicization" of Attica by immigration from Ionia in historical times. Curtius hypothesized that there had been a "Proto-Ionian" migration from the Balkans to western Anatolia in the same period that brought the [[Arcadocypriot|Arcadic]] dialect (the successor of the [[Mycenean Greek]] stage yet undiscovered in the time of Curtius) to mainland Greece.{{ref|Hallm}} Curtius' hypothesis was endorsed by George Hempl in 1920.{{ref|Hempl}} Hempl preferred to call these hypothetical, early Anatolian Greeks "Javonians". Hempl attempted to defend a reading of [[Hittite cuneiform]] as Greek, in spite of the  establishment of the [[Hittite language]] as a separate branch of Indo-European by Hrozný in 1917.

==Faucounau==
{{Notability|date=April 2009}}
The tripartite theory was revived by amateur linguist Jean Faucounau. In his view, the first Greek settlers in their historical territory were the (Pelasgic) "proto-Ionians", who were separated around 3000 BC from both the proto-[[Dorians]] and the proto-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]]. Faucounau traces this three-wave model to similar views put forward by [[Paul Kretschmer]] in the 1890s and the 1900s (''i.e.'', before the decipherment of [[Linear B]]), with a modification: the (proto-Ionic) First wave came by sea, the "Proto-Ionians" settling first in the Cycladic Islands, then in Euboea and Attica. The last two waves are the generally accepted arrival of the Mycenaean Greeks (the linguistic predecessors of the Arcadocypriot speakers) in around 1700 BC and the [[Dorian invasion]] around 1100 BC.

Following Georgiev{{ref|Georgiev1}}{{ref|Georgiev2}}, Faucounau makes three arguments for the proto-Ionic language{{ref|Faucouneau}}. The first is the explanation of certain Mycenaean forms as [[loan word|loan-words]] from the proto-Ionians already present in Greece: he asserts that [[digamma]] is unexpectedly absent from some Mycenaean words,{{ref|digamma}} the occasional resolution of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Syllabic consonant|vocalic ''r'']] to ''-or/ro-'' instead of ''-ar/ra-''; ''to-pe-za'' for τράπεζα,{{ref|trapeza}} and the explanation of Mycenaean ''pa-da-yeu'' as Greek παδάω/πηδάω{{ref|LSJ}}, "spring leap, bound", which he interprets as both [[cognate]] with, and having the same meaning as, [[modern English|English]] ''paddle''.{{ref|paddle}}.

The second argument is a refinement of a long-established argument in [[archaeoastronomy]], developed most recently by Michael Ovenden,{{ref|Ovenden}} which considers the motion of the North Pole with respect to the fixed stars, because of the [[precession]] of the [[equinox]]es. Ovenden concluded, from the slant of the [[constellation]]s in the present sky and the hypothesis that [[Aratus]] and [[Hipparchus]] (insofar as his work survives) correctly and completely represent immemorial tradition, that the constellations we now use had been devised when the Pole was in [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], about 2800 BC. He also concluded that the inventors probably lived between 34°30' and 37°30' N., north of most ancient civilizations, and so were likely to be the Minoans.

Dr. Crommelin, FRAS, has disputed this latitude, arguing that the constellation makers could only see to 54° S, but that this was compatible with latitudes as low as the 31°N of [[Alexandria]]; stars which only skirt the southern horizon by a few degrees are not effectively visible. Assuming a Greek latitude would render [[Canopus]] and [[Fomalhaut]] invisible. Crommelin estimates the constellators at 2460 BC; [[Richard Anthony Proctor|R. A. Proctor]] has estimated 2170 BC. [[E. W. Maunder]] 2700 BC.{{Ref|Crommelin}}

Faucounau's addition to this is the argument that Crete is also too far south, that the names of the constellations are (Ionic) Greek, not Minoan, and therefore that the constellation makers must be the proto-Ionians in the [[Cyclades]].{{ref|Crete}}  The south coast of Crete follows 35°N latitude; [[Syros]], which he identifies as a center of proto-Ionian civilization,{{ref|syros}} is at 37°20'.{{ref|Atlas}} On this basis, he identifies the proto-Ionians with the archaeological [[Cyclades|Early Cycladic II]] culture: after all, they made round "[[frying pans]]," and one of them with an incised spiral, and the Phaistos Disc is round with an incised spiral.{{Ref|pan}}

His third argument depends on Herodotus's somewhat obscure use of the word [[Pelasgians|Pelasgian]] for various peoples, Greek-speaking and otherwise, around the Aegean basin. Faucounau claims that the word, which he derives idiosyncratically from πελαγος, "sea",{{ref|pelagos}} means the descendants of the proto-Ionians. Some of them lost their language because they settled among foreigners; others, such as the Athenians, preserved their language - Attic, apparently, arises from a mixture of proto-Ionian and other dialects. He does not explain why Homer speaks of [[Dodona]], inland in north-western Greece, as Pelasgian (Il, 16,233); nor why no place in historic [[Ionia]] is called Pelasgian.

He adds to the above arguments with archaeological facts. For example, the Treaty of [[Alaksandu]] between [[Wilusa]] and the [[Hittite empire]] bore a Greek name at a time when there was no Mycenaean pottery at Troy. Faucounau considers that all these arguments are an indirect confirmation of his own decipherment claim of the [[Phaistos Disk]] as proto-Ionic.

Faucounau's "Proto-Ionic Disk Language" has most of the properties of [[Homeric Greek]], including loss of [[Labial–velar consonant|labiovelars]] and even of [[digamma]] (both are preserved intact in the Mycenaean of the 14th century BC). Digamma, in Faucounau's reading of the Phaistos Disk, has in some instances passed to ''y'', a sound shift not known from any other Greek dialect, but suspected in Ionic (e.g. Ion. païs v/etym. paus). For Faucounau, the [[Pelasgian]]s, the [[Troy|Trojans]], the [[Carians]] and the [[Philistines]] are all descended from the Proto-Ionians.

Faucounau's work on this subject has received two scholarly notices. [[Paul Faure (archeologist)|Paul Faure]], as below, writes warmly of many parts of the Proto-Ionian theory. He declines to address the decipherment, and omits the Celts; he also dates the Middle Cycladic culture only from 2700 BC, not 2900. Yves Duhoux expresses his disbelief in the decipherment, but does not mention the wider theory, except to deny that the Disc came from Syros. Faucounau's paper on the statistical problem of how many glyphs are likely to be omitted from a short text has never been cited. Most of it addresses the long-solved case in which the glyphs are equally likely.

The '''Regional Forum on Environment and Health in Southeast and East Asian Countries''' is a global framework for action provided by Agenda 21 of the 1992 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]]; the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development; the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of the [[United Nations]] and the recommendations of the fifth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development in Asia and the Pacific (held at [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] in March 2005) on enhancing the environmental sustainability of economic growth. The second Ministerial Regional Forum was held 14–16 July 2010 in [[Jeju Province]], South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/66mK9MDsR?url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/12/117_69551.html  Bae Ji-sook, "Ministers tackle environmental damage".

=={{anchor|Points}}Charter==
*Recognizing that the environment greatly affects health,
*Acknowledging the importance of ensuring the protection of human health and the environment,
*Understanding that children, the elderly and the poor are among the most vulnerable to and suffer most from environmental deterioration,
*Conscious that improving environmental health and ensuring sustainable economic growth are key components of poverty reduction,
*Realizing that the maintenance of health and well-being depend on environmental quality and sustainable development,
*Underlining the importance and cost-effectiveness of giving priority to preventive action,
*Conscious of the urgency to take immediate, coordinated action involving all relevant government agencies, organizations from the private sector, civil society, academia and media,
*Aware that solutions require inter-disciplinary and cross-sectoral interventions with experts from physical and natural sciences, health and social sciences, development, finance and other fields,
*Realizing the specific characteristics, cultural diversity and needs of the region (its unprecedented economic development, rapid urbanization and population growth and widespread poverty),
*Admitting that nations in the region are physically interconnected by shared bodies of water and air,
*Mindful that many environmental and health issues are trans-boundary in nature and that globalization has highlighted the interdependence of nations, communities and individuals,
*Keeping in mind existing international agreements on the protection of the ozone layer, climate change, biodiversity conservation, the management of chemicals and wastes and other initiatives related to environment and health,
*Mindful of the precautionary approach and guided by the "polluter pays" principle and the norms of good governance including civic engagement and participation, efficiency, equity, transparency and accountability,
*Taking note of the various efforts being undertaken by various countries at the national and regional levels,

The ministers responsible for the environment and health of the Southeast Asian countries of [[Brunei]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos|Lao People’s Democratic Republic]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam|Viet Nam]], and the East Asian countries of [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Mongolia]] and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], meeting together for the first time at Bangkok on 9 August 2007, adopted the charter of the Regional Forum on Environment and Health; have agreed upon the principles, vision, goals and objectives, strategies and structures set forth therein as the basis for their joint commitment to collective and individual country actions, and call upon their international partners to support the implementation of the charter.

==Sustainable development==
[[Sustainable development]] encompasses nurturing the environment, enhancing economic growth and social equity to reduce poverty, promoting the health and well-being of people and encouraging partnerships and cooperation among stakeholders and countries in the region.
Without environmental and health protection, development is undermined. Without economic growth (essential to poverty reduction and improving the quality of life), protection of the environment and promotion of health will also fail.
The Regional Forum's vision is to safeguard and enhance health and the environment, promoting development which reduces poverty.
The interplay of health and environment and their role in poverty reduction needs to be understood and addressed.
This can be achieved by a national approach that integrates the efforts of stakeholders in preserving the environment with the protection of human health and well-being. The regional forum also believes that national efforts for environmental preservation and health protection may be affected by development activities and environmental and health conditions in neighboring countries. Thus, greater regional partnership and cooperation are needed to address common interests and threats to the region.

==Goals and objectives==
The general objective of the regional initiative is to effectively deal with the environmental-health problems within countries and among themselves by increasing the capacity of Southeast and East Asian countries in environmental-health management.
It aims to strengthen the cooperation of the ministries responsible for environment and health within the countries and across the region by providing a mechanism for sharing knowledge and experiences, improving policy and regulatory frameworks at the national and regional level, and promoting the implementation of integrated environmental-health strategies and regulations.

==Initiatives==
*Effectively and efficiently achieve their targets in health, environmental sustainability, poverty and global partnership for development under the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
*Institutionalize the integrated management of environmental health at all levels within each participating country and among the Southeast and East Asian countries through the establishment of a coordinated institutional mechanism
*Enable countries to assess priority environmental health risks, develop and implement cost-effective national environmental health action plans (NEHAP) and disseminate them to stakeholders

=={{anchor|THE WAY FORWARD}}Future plans==
The member countries of the Regional Forum on Environment and Health in Southeast and East Asian Countries should:
* Undertake the best possible actions available to address (and reverse) the trend of environmental degradation and its negative impact on health to ensure the implementation of global and regional agreements (such as the Millennium Development Goals)
* Establish and/or strengthen existing inter-agency and multi-sector technical working groups and national coordination mechanisms and processes, linking these with other countries in the region to facilitate capacity-building and the exchange of information, technology, resources and learning
* Prepare and regularly update NEHAP (or equivalent plans) and ensure their implementation so priority environmental-health issues in each country are effectively addressed
* Build the capacity of stakeholders so they can be mobilized to support the implementation of NEHAP
* Strengthen collaboration among themselves and with other regional and global intergovernmental bodies on trans-boundary, regional, and global environmental-health issues (including attendance at the regional forum
* Advocate for adequate budgets and resources for the environment and health sectors in their countries
* Ensure that the charter is widely disseminated within each country and across the region in the languages of the region

International partner organizations are encouraged to:
* Support this regional initiative by providing needed technical and financial assistance and sharing information and expertise
* Support the development and implementation of NEHAP and equivalent plans
* Intensify coordination and cooperation among themselves to optimize the use of resources
* Ensure proper coordination with existing intergovernmental processes

Countries and partner organizations should work for the widest possible endorsement of the charter, to ensure the attainment of its objectives.
Ministers responsible for environment and health of southeast and east-Asian countries will meet every three years to assess national and regional progress and agree on specific actions to reduce significant environmental threats to health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22879">The '''simulation hypothesis''' or '''simulation theory''' proposes that all of reality, including the earth and the universe, is in fact an artificial simulation, most likely a [[computer simulation]]. Some versions rely on the development of a [[simulated reality]], a proposed technology that would seem realistic enough to convince its inhabitants the simulation was real. The hypothesis has been a central plot device of many [[science fiction]] stories and films.

==Origins==
There is a long philosophical and scientific history to the underlying thesis that reality is an illusion. This [[skeptical hypothesis]] can be traced back to antiquity; for example, to the "[[Zhuangzi (book)#.22The Butterfly Dream.22|Butterfly Dream]]" of [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You're living in a computer simulation, and math proves it|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5799396/youre-living-in-a-computer-simulation-and-math-proves-it|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Indian philosophy of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]].

==Simulation hypothesis==
[[File:Nick Bostrom.jpg|thumb|[[Nick Bostrom]] in 2014]]

{{quote|Many works of science fiction as well as some forecasts by serious technologists and futurologists predict that enormous amounts of computing power will be available in the future. Let us suppose for a moment that these predictions are correct. One thing that later generations might do with their super-powerful computers is run detailed simulations of their forebears or of people like their forebears. Because their computers would be so powerful, they could run a great many such simulations. Suppose that these simulated people are conscious (as they would be if the simulations were sufficiently fine-grained and if a certain quite widely accepted position in the philosophy of mind is correct). Then it could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do not belong to the original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants of an original race. It is then possible to argue that, if this were the case, we would be rational to think that we are likely among the simulated minds rather than among the original biological ones. Therefore, if we don't think that we are currently living in a computer simulation, we are not entitled to believe that we will have descendants who will run lots of such simulations of their forebears.|Nick Bostrom, ''Are you living in a computer simulation?'', 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bostrom, Nick |journal=Philosophical Quarterly |date=2003 |volume=53 |issue=211 |pages=243–255 |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html |title=Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ancestor simulation===
In 2003, philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] proposed a [[trilemma]] that he called "the simulation argument". Despite the name, Bostrom's "simulation argument" does not directly argue that we live in a simulation; instead, Bostrom's trilemma argues that one of three unlikely-seeming propositions is almost certainly true:
# "The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage (that is, one capable of running high-fidelity ancestor simulations) is very close to zero", '''or'''
# "The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero", '''or'''
# "The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one"
The trilemma points out that a technologically mature "posthuman" civilization would have enormous computing power; if even a tiny percentage of them were to run "ancestor simulations" (that is, "high-fidelity" simulations of ancestral life that would be indistinguishable from reality to the simulated ancestor), the total number of simulated ancestors, or "Sims", in the universe (or [[multiverse]], if it exists) would greatly exceed the total number of actual ancestors.

Bostrom goes on to use a type of [[Anthropic principle#Character of anthropic reasoning|anthropic reasoning]] to claim that, ''if'' the third proposition is the one of those three that is true, and almost all people with our kind of experiences live in simulations, ''then'' we are almost certainly living in a simulation.

Bostrom claims his argument goes beyond the classical ancient "[[skeptical hypothesis]]", claiming that "...we have interesting empirical reasons to believe that a certain [[logical disjunction|disjunctive]] claim about the world is true", the third of the three disjunctive propositions being that we are almost certainly living in a simulation. Thus, Bostrom, and writers in agreement with Bostrom such as [[David Chalmers]], argue there might be empirical reasons for the "simulation hypothesis", and that therefore the simulation hypothesis is not a skeptical hypothesis but rather a "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical hypothesis]]". Bostrom states he personally sees no strong argument for which of the three trilemma propositions is the true one: "If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one's credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3)... I note that people who hear about the simulation argument often react by saying, 'Yes, I accept the argument, and it is obvious that it is possibility #''n'' that obtains.' But different people pick a different ''n''. Some think it obvious that (1) is true, others that (2) is true, yet others that (3) is true."

As a corollary to the trilemma, Bostrom states that "Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation."&lt;!-- The entire trilemma section up to here is cited to: --&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2003"&gt;Bostrom, N., 2003, [http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html Are You Living in a Simulation?], Philosophical Quarterly (2003), Vol. 53, No. 211, pp. 243-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faq&gt;[http://www.simulation-argument.com/faq.html The Simulation Argument Website] FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostrom&gt;[http://www.simulation-argument.com/matrix.html The Simulation Argument: Why the Probability that You Are Living in a Matrix is Quite High], [[Nick Bostrom]], Professor of Philosophy at [[Oxford University]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "M@M"&gt;Davis J. Chalmers [http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html The Matrix as Metaphysics] Dept of Philosophy, U. o Arizona; paper written for the philosophy section of ''[[The Matrix]]'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Bostrom's anthropic reasoning===
{{further|Anthropic principle}}

Bostrom argues that, ''if'' "the fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one", ''then'' it follows that we probably live in a simulation. Some philosophers disagree, proposing that perhaps "Sims" do not have conscious experiences the same way that unsimulated humans do, or that it can otherwise be self-evident to a human that they are a human rather than a Sim.&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Weatherson]]. "Are you a sim?" The Philosophical Quarterly 53.212 (2003): 425-431.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Barry Dainton modifies Bostrom's trilemma by substituting "neural ancestor simulations" (ranging from literal brains in a vat, to far-future humans with induced high-fidelity hallucinations that they are their own distant ancestors) for Bostrom's "ancestor simulations", on the grounds that every philosophical school of thought can agree that sufficiently high-tech neural ancestor simulation experiences would be indistinguishable from non-simulated experiences. Even if high-fidelity computer Sims are never conscious, Dainton's reasoning leads to the following conclusion: either the fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage and are able and willing to run large numbers of neural ancestor simulations is close to zero, or we are in some kind of (possibly neural) ancestor simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Dainton, Barry. "On singularities and simulations." Journal of Consciousness Studies 19.1 (2012): 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars categorically reject or are uninterested in anthropic reasoning, dismissing it as "merely philosophical", unfalsifiable, or inherently unscientific.&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;

Some critics reject the [[block universe]] view of time that Bostrom implicitly accepts and propose that we could be in the first generation, such that all the simulated people that will one day be created [[philosophical presentism|don't yet exist]].&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;

The cosmologist [[Sean M. Carroll]] argues that the simulation hypothesis leads to a contradiction: if a civilization is capable of performing simulations, then it will likely perform many simulations, which implies that we are most likely at the lowest level of simulation (from which point one's impression will be that it is impossible to perform a simulation), which contradicts the arguer's assumption that advanced civilizations can most likely perform simulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/08/22/maybe-we-do-not-live-in-a-simulation-the-resolution-conundrum/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments, within the trilemma, against the simulation hypothesis===
[[File:Molecular Dynamics Simulation of DPPC Lipid Bilayer.webm|thumb|Simulation down to molecular level of very small sample of matter]]
Some scholars accept the trilemma, and argue that the first or second of the propositions are true, and that the third proposition (the proposition that we live in a simulation) is false. Physicist [[Paul Davies]] deploys Bostrom's trilemma as part of one possible argument against a near-infinite [[multiverse]]. This argument runs as follows: if there were a near-infinite multiverse, there would be posthuman civilizations running ancestor simulations, and therefore we would come to the untenable and scientifically self-defeating conclusion that we live in a simulation; therefore, by ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', existing multiverse theories are likely false. (Unlike Bostrom and Chalmers, Davies (among others) considers the simulation hypothesis to be self-defeating.)&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Paul, Charles William. "Multiverse cosmological models." [[Modern Physics Letters A]] 19.10 (2004): 727-743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some point out that there is currently no proof of technology which would facilitate the existence of sufficiently high-fidelity ancestor simulation. Additionally, there is no proof that it is physically possible or feasible for a posthuman civilization to create such a simulation, and therefore for the present, the first proposition must be true.&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;
Additionally there are proofs of [[limits of computation]].

==Consequences of living in a simulation==
Economist [[Robin Hanson]] argues a self-interested high-fidelity Sim should strive to be entertaining and praiseworthy in order to avoid being turned off or being shunted into a non-conscious low-fidelity part of the simulation. Hanson additionally speculates that someone who is aware that he might be a Sim might care less about others and live more for today: "your motivation to save for retirement, or to help the poor in Ethiopia, might be muted by realizing that in your simulation, you will never retire and there is no Ethiopia."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Hanson]]. "How to live in a simulation." Journal of Evolution and Technology 7.1 (2001).
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing the hypothesis physically==
A long-shot method to test one type of simulation hypothesis was proposed in 2012 in a joint paper by physicists Silas R. Beane from the University of Bonn (now at the University of Washington, Seattle), and Zohreh Davoudi and Martin J. Savage from the University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Beane |first= Silas |author2= Zohreh Davoudi |author3= Martin J. Savage |date= 9 November 2012 |title= Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation |arxiv= 1210.1847 |laysource= The Physics arXiv Blog  |laysummary= http://www.technologyreview.com/view/429561/the-measurement-that-would-reveal-the-universe-as-a-computer-simulation/ |laydate= October 10, 2012 |quote= ABSTRACT Observable consequences of the hypothesis that the observed universe is a numerical simulation performed on a cubic space-time lattice or grid are explored. The simulation scenario is first motivated by extrapolating current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCD into the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory technology as a guide, we assume that our universe is an early numerical simulation with unimproved Wilson fermion discretization and investigate potentially-observable consequences. Among the observables that are considered are the muon g-2 and the current differences between determinations of alpha, but the most stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing of the universe, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;10^&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; GeV, is derived from the high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum. The numerical simulation scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest energy cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that reflects the structure of the underlying lattice.|ref= |separator= |postscript= |bibcode= 2014EPJA...50..148B|doi= 10.1140/epja/i2014-14148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the assumption of finite computational resources, the simulation of the universe would be performed by dividing the continuum space-time into a discrete set of points. In analogy with the mini-simulations that [[lattice gauge theory|lattice-gauge theorists]] run today to build up [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] from the underlying theory of [[strong interaction]]s (known as [[Quantum chromodynamics]]), several observational consequences of a grid-like space-time have been studied in their work. Among proposed signatures is an [[anisotropy]] in the distribution of ultra-high-energy [[cosmic ray]]s, that, if observed, would be consistent with the simulation hypothesis according to these physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation|title=Are We Living in a Computer Simulation?|first=Clara|last=Moskowitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multitude of physical observables must be explored before any such scenario could be accepted or rejected as a theory of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.washington.edu/users/savage/Simulation/Universe/|title=Physics Home|website=www.phys.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Campbell et al. propose several experiments aimed at testing the simulation theory in their ''On testing the simulation theory'' paper.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Campbell, Houman Owhadi, Joe Sauvageau, David Watkinson: ''On testing the simulation theory.'' {{arXiv|1703.00058}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 they started a Kickstarter campaign to fund the experiments, which reached $236,590, more than the required sum of $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simulation/do-we-live-in-a-virtual-reality|title=Do we live in a Virtual Reality?|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the simulation hypothesis in philosophy==
Besides attempting to assess whether the simulation hypothesis is true or false, philosophers have also used it to illustrate other philosophical problems, especially in [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]. [[David Chalmers]] has argued that simulated beings might wonder whether their [[Mind|mental]] lives are governed by the [[physics]] of their environment, when in fact these mental lives are simulated separately (and are thus, in fact, not governed by the simulated physics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consc.net/notes/dualism.html|title=How Cartesian Dualism Might Have Been True|last=Chalmers|first=David|date=January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They might eventually find that their thoughts fail to be physically [[causality|caused]].  Chalmers argues that this means that [[mind-body dualism|Cartesian dualism]] is not necessarily as problematic of a philosophical view as is commonly supposed, though he does not endorse it.

Similarly, Vincent Conitzer has used the following computer simulation scenarios to illuminate [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts—about [[qualia]] (what it is ''like'' to have specific experiences), [[indexicality]] (what time it is ''now'' and who ''I'' am), and [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it.  The person observing knows that besides the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation, there must be ''additional'' code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. (These questions are related to the [[inverted spectrum]] scenario and whether there are further facts about personal identity.)  That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine her [[consciousness|experience]] by themselves.  But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in the simulation that she has ''forgotten'' that it is a simulation she is watching.  Could she not still reach the same conclusion?  And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?

==In popular culture==

===Science fiction themes===
{{main|Simulated reality in fiction|Simulated consciousness (science fiction)}}
Science fiction has highlighted themes such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and computer gaming for more than fifty years. ''[[Simulacron-3]]'' (1964) by [[Daniel F. Galouye]] (alternative title: ''Counterfeit World'') tells the story of a virtual city developed as a computer simulation for market research purposes, in which the simulated inhabitants possess consciousness; all but one of the inhabitants are unaware of the true nature of their world. The book was made into a German made-for-TV film called  [[World on a Wire|“World on a Wire”]] (1973) directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. The movie ''[[The Thirteenth Floor]]'' (1999) was also loosely based on this book. "[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]" is a short story by American writer [[Philip K. Dick]], first published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' in April 1966, and was the basis for [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'' (1990 film)]] and [[Total Recall (2012 film)|''Total Recall'' (2012 film)]]. In ''[[Overdrawn at the Memory Bank]]'', a 1983 television movie, the main character pays to have his mind connected to a simulation. More recently, the same theme was repeated in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'', which depicted a world in which artificially intelligent robots enslaved humanity within a simulation set in the contemporary world. The 2012 play ''World of Wires'' was partially inspired by the Bostrom essay on the simulation hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/theater/reviews/world-of-wires-at-the-kitchen-review.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Brantley | title=‘World of Wires' at the Kitchen — Review | date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Extremis (Doctor Who)|Extremis]]" (broadcast on 20 May 2017 on [[BBC One]]) of the science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', aliens called "The Monks" plan an invasion of Earth by running and studying a holographic simulation of Earth with conscious inhabitants. When the virtual Doctor finds out about the simulation he sends an email about the simulation to his real self so that the real Doctor can save the world. In the first season of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', a science-fiction animated comedy, the episode "[[M. Night Shaym-Aliens!]]" Aliens trap the lead role (Rick) in a simulated reality in order to trick him into revealing his formula for concentrated dark matter. In the game ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'', it is revealed that the whole world of the gods Bionis and Mechonis was a simulation run by Alvis, the administrative computer of a phase transition experiment facility (heavily implied to be "Ontos" in Xenoblade Chronicles 2) after Klaus destroyed the universe in a multi-verse experiment. ''[[Simulation Theory (album)|Simulation Theory]]'' is also the name of the eighth album by British alternative band [[Muse (band)|Muse]], released on the 9th of November 2018.

{{notability|date=May 2016}}
'''Social architecture''' is the conscious design of an environment that encourages a desired range of social behaviors leading towards some goal or set of goals. The environment social architecture influences may be [[Social structure|social systems]], or digital spaces such as [[Social media|media]] tools (sometimes synonymous with [[Web 2.0]]) and [[User experience design|UX strategy]]. In building design it can refer to the architecture of social spaces such as bars and restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Gatsby. "Social Architecture: A New Approach To Designing Social Spaces." ''Huffington Post'' 06/05/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In social systems, "social architects" seek to modify human behaviors ([[behavior modification|behavior change]]) through carefully designed programs or workshops that seek to involve the members of a population to improve, for example, the livability and safety or environmental impact of their own communities.

In digital spaces,  "social architecture" is sometimes confused with "[[information architecture]]" or "[[interaction design]]".

The theory of social architecture can be applied to solve talent attraction and retention issues, while simultaneously combating a community's social issues. The Milwaukee-based firm, [http://www.newaukee.com NEWaukee] is the first social architecture firm in the United States.

== Architecture of On-Line Communities ==
In September 2011 [[Pieter Hintjens]] presented "Social Architecture 101" at Mix-IT in Lyon. Hintjens defined the term like this: "Social Architecture by analogy with conventional architecture, is the process, and the product, of planning, designing, and growing an online community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/pieterh/social-architecture101 Social Architecture 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hintjens' 2016 book, "Social Architecture"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Social-Architecture-Building--line-Communities-ebook/dp/B01F8I7Z7E Pieter Hintjens, "Social Architecture: Building On-line Communities", 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; provides a theoretical framework and a set of tools for building online communities, including a contribution process&lt;ref&gt;[http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/ (C4)]&lt;/ref&gt; for open source software communities. The book refers to the [[ZeroMQ]] community as an example built using these tools and process.

== Kevin Werbach's interview on Amy Jo Kim ==
[[Amy Jo Kim]] is an American author and researcher on the subject of developing online communities. On [[Kevin Werbach]] interview on Amy Jo Kim. Kevin states that "Amy Jo Kim is an expert in the development of social architectures."

== Social architecture on team-building ==

Social Architecture is different from interaction design and information architecture. Rather, it can be illustrated with the combination of two. Specifically, the idea is to use structural (e.g. software, organizational rule) tools to design a socio-technical infrastructure for participants to behave in the wanted direction of the designer. It can be used as a conceptual framework for directing building a real-world community of which member communication is mostly taking off online. Social architecture aims for creating an effective infrastructure for non-face-to-face communication and management.

As more and more across-devices team-building platform (such as [https://slack.com Slack] [http://basecamp.com Basecamp]\[https://www.teambition.com Teambition]\[https://tower.im Tower.im]) has been used, they provide some empirically-designed communication pattern for new joined teams whose major communications taking off online.

The popular team-building platforms have some common features that their designers see as providing more efficient online communications. Mostly the team leader (or any member) will create a team on the platform with customizable name and invite other team members to join this team. The created team will be able to use designed features from the platform. They include:

'''Newsfeed''': Similar to Facebook's news feed, it is a semi-public feed where all joined team members can post or update their thoughts and get immediate or delayed feedback from other team members.

'''Discussion Board:''' Team members can create threads related to topics for all members to participate in discussing.

'''File Sharing:''' Team member can upload files from their multi-platform devices and cloud storage.

'''Chatroom and Private chat:''' They provide real-time chat among all team members or between specific team members.

'''Task-distribution and checklist:''' Team members can(be) distribute tasks and set deadlines.

'''Calendar:''' A shared calendar with deadlines and important dates.

'''The Cloisters''' in [[Letchworth Garden City]], [[Hertfordshire]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] was built in 1905 as an open-air school dedicated to [[Psychology]] and where students were taught skills from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. After a period of neglect during [[World War II]] The Cloisters became the North Hertfordshire Masonic Centre in 1951.

==Annie Jane Lawrence==
[[File:Annie Jane Lawrence 1910.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Annie Jane Lawrence c1910]]
The Cloisters was built by [[Quaker]] Miss Annie Jane Lawrence (16 April 1863&amp;ndash;3 August 1953), the daughter of Alfred Lawrence (1826 - 1875), who, with his brother Frederick, owned 'Lawrence Brothers, Smiths and Founders', and his wife Mary Elizabeth (née Ridge, 1838-1903).&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;Miles, V.W., ''The Cloisters, Letchworth, 1907-1967'' Published by The Lawrence Cloisters Trust (1967) pg 7&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather William Lawrence (1789-1855) came from humble origins but went on to be elected Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Carpenters]] in 1848 and an Alderman of the [[City of London]], while her uncle [[Sir James Lawrence, 1st Baronet|Sir James Lawrence]] was [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1868. Her younger brother was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence]] (1871-1961).&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;[http://thecloisters.org.uk/About.aspx About The Cloisters - A Brief History - The Cloisters, Letchworth website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 she was a pupil at the School for Ladies in [[Hove]] in [[Sussex]], while in 1895 she visited Boston in the USA.&lt;ref name=Ancestry/&gt; 

As a young woman she undertook social work in the slums of London, which urged her on to action. Lawrence decided to build a centre dedicated as a school of thought from which adults could go out and effect social change. She chose Letchworth because it was the world's First Garden City; here she leased three acres of land on which she built The Cloisters and Cloisters Lodge, intending that the former should be a School of Philosophy while she lived in the latter.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

==Design==
The design reputedly came to Miss Lawrence in a dream. The building originally consisted of a large half-oval 'open-air room' called the `Cloisters Garth' with an open colonnade to the south and large glazed bays to the north; this was flanked by two wings, one housing the kitchen and store rooms and the other the cubicles and dressing rooms for an oval open-air swimming pool. It was designed according to the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement, and was built using [[marble]]s and other materials from all over [[Europe]].

==1905-1907==
Originally built as an open-air school dedicated to [[Psychology]], with accommodation for 20 students, students were encouraged to study "how thought affects action and what causes and produces thought." Through healthy outdoor living it was intended that the students would develop healthy minds. The building was also designed to hold lectures, conferences, drama and musical performances as well as organ recitals. Students were also taught skills from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;

Designed by [[architect]] [[William Harrison Cowlishaw]], building commenced on the {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in 1905, and the building opened on 17 January 1907, having cost the then huge sum of £20,000. Miss Lawrence built a house for herself, 'Cloisters Lodge', alongside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Cloisters.htm Utopia Britannica - British Utopian Experiments 1325 - 1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1907-1939==
[[File:cloisters1908.jpg|The Cloisters in 1908|thumb|right]]
A small community developed at ''The Cloisters'' dedicated to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. It became the base for the ''Alpha Union'' set up by J. Bruce Wallace of the Brotherhood Church, who organised summer schools and residential courses there. Miss Lawrence, although somewhat deaf, was a great music lover. On one occasion she brought The London Concert Orchestra, made up of 40 unemployed musicians, to play at the Cloisters Garth. This was part of an ongoing series of concerts that she organised attended by audiences of 1,000, making organ recitals, band and choral concerts a regular part of the new town's cultural life. The last concert was given by the Brotherhood Orchestra in 1939 on the day the [[Second World War]] broke out.

== History since 1939==
[[File:Cloistersletchworth1b.JPG|thumb|right|The Masonic Temple at The Cloisters]]
The Cloisters was commandeered by the Army during the [[Second World War]] and suffered damage. By 1948 Miss Lawrence found it increasingly difficult to maintain the building and to repair the damage caused by the Army. She initially offered it to the local Council, who turned it down. Eventually, she offered it to the local [[Freemasons]] who accepted it, turning it into the [[North Hertfordshire]] [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Centre. About sixty [[Masonic lodges]] and 'side degrees' meet at The Cloisters, and the centre is run and maintained by an elected Board of Trustees, The Lawrence Cloisters Trust. A Craft Lodge, the 'Cloisters Lodge No 7100' was formed there in 1951 to commemorate Miss Lawrence's generous gift of the building to [[Hertfordshire]] [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, Jack ''The Cloisters, Letchworth'' in ''Freemasonry Today'' Issue 11 (Winter 1999/2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/16291128?versionId=19104779 Christodoulou, Glenn ''The Cloisters Lodge: the Next Twenty-Five Years'' Privately printed  by the Cloisters Lodge No. 7100 Festival Committee  (2001) [[National Library of Australia]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Lawrence eventually moved out of Cloisters Lodge into a house on Willian Way in Letchworth but her increasing frailty led to her moving to St Catherine's Nursing Home where she died aged 90 on 3 August 1953.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; She is buried in the churchyard of [[Church of All Saints, Willian|All Saints Church]] in [[Willian, Hertfordshire|Willian]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. In her will she left £41,246 2s 6d to George Ernest Hinman (Solicitor) and her brother the Rt. Hon. [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Frederick William Pethick-Lawrence]].&lt;ref name=Ancestry&gt;[http://person.ancestry.co.uk/tree/87123076/person/80019953384/facts Annie Jane Lawrence - [[Ancestry.com]] - pay to view]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cloisters has been designated by Letchworth Garden City Corporation as one of the 'great historic buildings' of [[North Hertfordshire]]. It is a Grade II* [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1102019|desc=The Cloisters|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 The Cloisters appeared in episode 4 of [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s five-part series ''Britain's Secret Homes'', placing it in 16th place out of 50 historic buildings in Britain selected by [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/britains-secret-homes/episode-4/ 'Britain's Secret Homes: Episode 4' on the '[[English Heritage]]'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although structurally sound, in October 2013 the building was put on [[English Heritage]]'s 'At Risk Register' owing mainly to the poor condition of its roof tiles which have allowed water to cause damage.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical building 'at risk' says English Heritage' - 'HItchin, Letchworth &amp; Baldock Advertiser'' October 16, 2013 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Cloisters on at risk register' - ''The Hitchin Comet'' October 17, 2013 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge''''' is a 1998 [[non-fiction]] book by anthropologist Dr. [[Jeremy Narby]].  

==Research==
Narby performed two years of [[field work]] in the Pichis Valley of the [[Peruvian Amazon]] researching the ecology of the [[Asháninka]], an [[indigenous peoples in Peru]].

==Hypothesis==
Investigating the connections between [[shamanism]] and [[molecular biology]], Narby hypothesizes that shamans may be able to access information at the molecular level through the ingestion of [[entheogens]], specifically [[ayahuasca]].&lt;ref name="iin" /&gt;  [[Biophysicist]] Jacques Dubochet criticized Narby for not testing his hypothesis.&lt;ref name="iin"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12976">'''Toxicogenomics''' is a subdiscipline of [[pharmacology]] that deals with the collection, interpretation, and storage of information about [[gene]] and [[protein]] activity within a particular [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] of an [[organism]] in response to exposure to [[toxin|toxic substances]]. Toxicogenomics combines [[toxicology]] with [[genomics]] or other high-throughput molecular profiling technologies such as [[transcriptomics]], [[proteomics]] and [[metabolomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=The National Academies Press|title= Communicating Toxicogenomics Information to Nonexperts: A Workshop Summary |year=2005|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11179&amp;page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Toxicogenomics: Principles and Applications | veditors = Hamadeh HK, Afshari CA | year = 2004 | publisher = Wiley-Liss | location  =Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 0-471-43417-5 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Omenn GS | title = Book Review: Toxicogenomics: Principles and Applications |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. | volume = 112 | issue = 16 | pages = A962 | date  =November 2004 | pmc = 1247673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicogenomics endeavors to elucidate the molecular mechanisms evolved in the expression of toxicity, and to derive molecular expression patterns (i.e., molecular [[biomarker]]s) that predict toxicity or the genetic susceptibility to it.

In pharmaceutical research, toxicogenomics is defined as the study of the structure and function of the [[genome]] as it responds to adverse xenobiotic exposure. It is the toxicological subdiscipline of [[pharmacogenomics]], which is broadly defined as the study of inter-individual variations in whole-genome or candidate gene [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] maps, [[haplotype]] markers, and alterations in [[gene expression]] that might correlate with drug responses.&lt;ref name="pmid15340386"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lesko LJ, Woodcock J | title = Translation of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics: a regulatory perspective | journal = Nature Reviews.

The term is still not universally accepted, and others have offered alternative terms such as ''chemogenomics'' to describe essentially the same field of study.&lt;ref name="pmid15952870"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fielden MR, Pearson C, Brennan R, Kolaja KL | title = Preclinical drug safety analysis by chemogenomic profiling in the liver | journal = American Journal of Pharmacogenomics : Genomics-related Research in Drug Development and Clinical Practice | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 161–71 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15952870 | doi = 10.2165/00129785-200505030-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature and complexity of the data (in volume and variability) demands highly developed processes of automated handling and storage. The analysis usually involves a wide array of [[bioinformatics]] and [[statistics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattes WB, Pettit SD, Sansone SA, Bushel PR, Waters MD | title = Database development in toxicogenomics: issues and efforts | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 495–505 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15033600 | pmc = 1241904 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.6697 | url = http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/txg/members/2004/6697/6697.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080704171519/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/txg/members/2004/6697/6697.html | archivedate = 2008-07-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; often including [[statistical classification]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H, Gmuender H, Bandenburg A, Ahr HJ | title = Prediction of a carcinogenic potential of rat hepatocarcinogens using toxicogenomics analysis of short-term in vivo studies | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 637 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 23–39 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17689568 | doi = 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2007.06.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pharmaceutical [[drug discovery]] and [[drug development|development]], toxicogenomics is used to study possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse]] (i.e. [[toxic]]) effects of pharmaceutical [[drug]]s in defined [[model organism|model systems]] in order to draw conclusions on the toxic risk to patients or the environment. Both the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) currently preclude basing regulatory decision-making on genomics data alone. However, they do encourage the voluntary submission of well-documented, quality genomics data. Both agencies are considering the use of submitted data on a case-by-case basis for assessment purposes (e.g., to help elucidate mechanism of action or contribute to a weight-of-evidence approach) or for populating relevant comparative databases by encouraging parallel submissions of genomics data and traditional toxicological test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corvi R, Ahr HJ, Albertini S, Blakey DH, Clerici L, Coecke S, Douglas GR, Gribaldo L, Groten JP, Haase B, Hamernik K, Hartung T, Inoue T, Indans I, Maurici D, Orphanides G, Rembges D, Sansone SA, Snape JR, Toda E, Tong W, van Delft JH, Weis B, Schechtman LM | title = Meeting report: Validation of toxicogenomics-based test systems: ECVAM-ICCVAM/NICEATM considerations for regulatory use | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 114 | issue = 3 | pages = 420–9 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16507466 | pmc = 1392237 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.8247 | url = http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/8247/8247.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081017084247/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/8247/8247.html | archivedate = 2008-10-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24920">[[Transparency of media ownership in Europe|Transparency of media ownership]] is the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies. The disclosure of media ownership can be prescribed by generic regulation (commercial law) or by media-specific provision. Such measures may mandate the disclosure of information on media ownership structures to specific authorities or to the general public.

Turkey has both generic company laws and media-specific regulations on transparency of the print, broadcasting and online media outlets. Despite the existence of such laws, according to some experts the existing regulatory framework does not guarantee the disclosure of crucial information and to know who actually owns and influences the media in Turkey.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/162199587/TMO-Turkey|title=Transparency of Media Ownership- The Legal Framework.

== Overview ==
With regard to the disclosure of media ownership information, Turkey has both generic company laws and specific regulations concerning the printed, broadcast and online sectors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf|title=The Transparency of Media Ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States: Report on a Project by Access Info Europe and the Open Society Program on Independent Journalism|last=Craufurd-Smith|first=R.|last2=Stolte|first2=Y.|date=2014|website=research.ed.ac.uk|publisher=Open Society Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulations provide both for the disclosure to public bodies such as the Chief Prosecutor's Office and the [[Radio and Television Supreme Council|“Radio and Television Supreme Council” (RTUK)]], and for the disclosure to citizens through the publication of ownership information on the media companies’ websites.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

However, a research by [[Access Info Europe]] shows that the existing laws misses to prescribe the disclosure of crucial information therefore failing to actually disclose who owns and influences the media in Turkey. In fact, neither print media (under the Press Law) nor broadcast (under the Law on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts) or online media (under the Law on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts and the Law on the Regulation of Online Broadcasts and the Struggle of Crimes Committed Online) are required to report the essential information needed to identify ownership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, as ''Access Info'' notes, the law applying to broadcasting and on demand services does not require to disclose if shares are held on behalf of another nor the existence of [[beneficial owner]]s.

Uncertainty in the realm of transparency of media ownership in Turkey increased after 2001, when the ban on media conglomerates' bidding in public tenders was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5210149/The_media_ownership_in_Turkey_and_its_advantages|title=The media ownership in Turkey and its advantages|last=Sözeri|first=Ceren|date=2013|website=academia.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 15 years, the biggest Turkish media owners are corporations also operating in sectors such as construction, energy, mining and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://turkey.mom-rsf.org/en/owners/|title=Media Owners|last=|first=|date=|website=turkey.mom-rsf.org|publisher=Reporters Without Borders, Bianet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mulksuzlestirme.org/index.en/|title=Networks of Dispossession|last=|first=|date=|website=mulksuzlestirme.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, strong ties with the government are lamented by Turkish civil society and the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mediaobservatory.net/radar/media-integrity-report-media-ownership-and-financing-turkey|title=Media integrity report: Media ownership and financing in Turkey|last=Tunç|first=Asli|date=November 30, 2015|website=mediaobservatory.net|publisher=South East European Media Observatory|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Books/Media-in-New-Turkey.-The-Origins-of-an-Authoritarian-Neoliberal-State|title=Media in New Turkey.

The situation of uncertain transparency of media ownership increased throughout 2015 and 2016, when government's trustees were appointed to allegedly [[Gülen movement|Gulenist]]-affiliated media outlets and companies. A takeover took place in October 26, 2016 for the [[Koza İpek Holding|Koza-Ipek Media Group]], which owned, among others, ''Bugun'' and ''Millet'' dailies and [[Cihan News Agency]]. Similarly, trustees were appointed on March 5, 2016, for [[Feza Publications|Feza Holding]], the media holding publishing, among others, the most read newspaper in Turkey, [[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]], and the English-language daily [[Today's Zaman|Today's Zaman]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=2961658&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=2397056&amp;Usage=2|title=Memorandum on freedom of expression and media freedom in Turkey|last=Muižnieks|first=Nils|date=February 15, 2017|website=wcd.coe.int|publisher=Council of Europe, Commissioner for Human Rights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bianet.org/english/human-rights/172807-trustee-appointed-to-cihan-news-agency|title=Trustee Appointed to Cihan News Agency|last=|first=|date=March 8, 2016|work=Bianet|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bianet.org/english/law/168682-trustee-appointed-to-koza-holding|title=Trustee Appointed to Koza Holding|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2015|work=Bianet|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bianet.org/english/media/168745-map-of-media-ownership-in-turkey|title=Map of Media Ownership in Turkey|last=Akgül|first=Elif|date=October 29, 2015|work=Bianet|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assets of these companies are currently under the jurisdiction of the government's [[Savings Deposit Insurance Fund of Turkey|Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF)]], and it is not clear if the companies will be either dissolved or sold off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/11/turkey-what-government-do-with-gulen-linked-companies.html#ixzz4c48qYBbK|title=What's next for hundreds of companies seized by Turkish government?|last=Cetingulec|first=Mehmet|date=November 2016|work=Al Monitor|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/turkey-government-became-top-tycoon.html|title=How Turkey’s government became the country’s top tycoon|last=Doğan|first=Zülfikar|date=October 2016|work=Al Monitor|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/turkey-hires-advisers-to-sell-10-billion-of-seized-companies|title=Turkey Hires Advisers to Sell $10 Billion of Seized Firms|last=Ersoy|first=Ercan|date=November 30, 2016|work=Bloomberg News|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
Disclosure of ownership information of [[Broadcasting|broadcast media]] (radio and television) is required by Law No. 6112 on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawsturkey.com/law/law-on-the-establishment-of-radio-and-television-enterprises-and-their-media-services-6112|title=Law No. 6112 on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts|last=|first=|date=February 15, 2011|website=lawsturkey.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Regulation on the Administrative and Financial Terms to Be Obeyed By Media Service Provider Institutions and the Platform and Infrastructure Service Operators (2011). With regard to print media, disclosure is required by the Press Law No. 5187 (2004). Finally, with regard to online media, disclosure is required by Law No. 5651 on the Regulation of Online Broadcasts and the Struggle of Crimes Committed Online &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=11035|title=Law No. 5651 on Regulating Broadcasting in the Internet and Fighting Against Crimes Committed through Internet Broadcasting|last=|first=|date=May 4, 2007|website=wipo.int|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2016)011-e|title=Opinion on Law No. 5651 on Regulation of Publications on the Internet and Combating Crimes Committed by Means of such Publication ("The Internet Law")|last=|first=|date=June 10–11, 2016|website=venice.coe.int|publisher=Venice Commission, European Commission for Democracy through Law|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Regulation on the Procedures and Principles of Internet Broadcasts (2007).

Law No. 6112 on broadcasters requires “media service providers” to report ownership information. They are defined as legal entities which choose the content of the radio, television and on-demand broadcasting services. Instead, according to the Press Law, ownership information have to be disclosed for media organizations publishing “printed materials”. Finally, the legislation on [[Internet regulation in Turkey#Organization of the ICTA|online media]] includes within its scope content providers, [[Internet hosting service|hosting service providers]] and [[Internet service provider#Access providers ISP|access providers]] (under Article No. 3 of Law No. 5651). They should publish their up to date information in the homepage of their website.

According to the relevant regulations for radios and televisions, ownership information have to be notified when a licence application is made, in cases of transfer of shares, acquisition and merger, changes to the disclosed information and annually, following the annual general meeting of [[shareholder]]s. Instead, under the Press Law, information have to be disclosed before publishing a newspaper or other periodicals.

Except for online media, if the information has the nature of [[Trade secret|commercial secret]], it can be withheld.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, this was the case when the ''[[Media Ownership Monitor]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://turkey.mom-rsf.org/en/|title=Media Ownership Monitor Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=turkey.mom-rsf.org|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a project conducted by a team of members of ''[[Bianet]]'', an independent Turkish press agency, and [[Reporters Without Borders]] – requested information regarding the Turkish public broadcaster's ([[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]]) finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seenpm.org/owns-media-turkey-media-ownership-monitoring-project/|title=‘Who Owns the Media in Turkey?’ – Media Ownership Monitoring Project|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2016|website=seenpm.org|publisher=South East European Network for Professionalization of Media|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanctions for non-disclosure are foreseen in the Press Law and in the Internet Law, covering only printed and online publications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Also foreign media organizations are covered by the above listed requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Information to be disclosed ===
According to the laws, the information that have to be disclosed by the information providers are:
* Name and contact details of media organisation;
* Name and contact details of owner;
* Country of domicile of company with an interest;
* Citizenship/residence status of individual with an interest;
* Except for the online media, the size of shareholding, namely the current shareholding structure, the voting shares, the capital-shares, the managers
* Management details: names of the members of board of directors, names and citizenship details of general managers and managers in charge and the duties of managers);
* Only for broadcasting media, if spouses, blood relatives and relatives in law up to the third degree are shareholders in the company, it will be indicated within the shareholdership structure considering these shares as owned by the same person;
* Only for print media, disclosure is required also for political, religious or other affiliations of shareholder, interests by owners in other media organisations and in non-media businesses.
Experts consider that existing obligations are not sufficient to establish who the legal or natural persons who effectively own and ultimately control the media organisations are.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Disclosure to public authorities ===
According to the Press Law, disclosure of ownership information has to be made to the Office of the local Chief Prosecutor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Law No. 6112 on media service providers (broadcaster), their ownership information have to be reported to the [[Radio and Television Supreme Council|“Radio and Television Supreme Council” (RTÜK)]] .

However, experts consider that regulators have no transparent, credible, and accessible annual records on media ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mediaobservatory.net/radar/monitoring-eu-guidelines-turkey-instruments-political-propaganda-and-censorship|title=Monitoring EU Guidelines in Turkey: Instruments of political propaganda and censorship|last=Tunç|first=Asli|date=June 21, 2015|website=mediaobservatory.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mediaobservatory.net/radar/p24-publishes-report-turkey%E2%80%99s-media-watchdog-lawmakers|title=P24 publishes a report on Turkey’s media watchdog - for lawmakers|last=|first=|date=May 12, 2016|website=mediaobservatory.net|publisher=P24 Platform for Independent Journalism|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disclosure to the citizens ===
The information notified to the RTÜK have also to be published by the media organizations concerned on their websites. Under the Press Law, the records of the Public Prosecutor's office shall be public and anyone can see the relevant files containing published information and documents by making an application.

Information on media ownership can be obtained by the public by making a Freedom of Information request, under Law No. 4982, on the [[Access to public information in Turkey|Right to Obtain Information]] which entitles individuals to request information and documents from public and publicly owned bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bedk.gov.tr/Yayinlar/LEGISLATION_ON_THE_RIGHT_TO_INFORMATION/LEGISLATION_ON_THE_RIGHT_TO_INFORMATION.pdf|title=Legislation on the Right to Information|last=|first=|date=December 1, 2014|website=bedk.gov.tr|publisher=REPUBLIC OF TURKEY, PRIME MINISTRY, The Review Board of Access to Information|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, requests for information related to media ownership are raised by professionals and media institutions, while it is not common among ordinary citizens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Media service providers (radio and TV broadcasters) can only be set up as [[Joint-stock company|joint stock companies]]. Only [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] have to disclose information to the trade registry, under the Turkish Commercial Code No. 6102.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=11081|title=Turkish Commercial Code (Law No. 6102)|last=|first=|date=January 13, 2011|website=wipo.int|publisher=|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media companies entering in the category of public joint-stock companies also have to respect the Capital Market Law No. 2499 (1981) and the Communiqué on Financial Reporting of the Capital Markets Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/Communique_on_Financial_Reporting_of_Capital_Markets_Board_English.pdf|title=Communiqué on the Principles of Financial Reporting in Capital Markets, No.  26842|last=|first=|date=April 9, 2008|website=.access-info.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.borsaistanbul.com/data/kilavuzlar/Public%20Disclosure%20Platform.pdf?hocvqgtkepcoaakb|title=Public Disclosure Forum|last=|first=|date=November 2011|website=borsaistanbul.com|publisher=Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These public enterprises should regularly draw financial statements to the [[Capital Markets Board of Turkey|Capital Markets Board]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmb.gov.tr/|title=Capital Markets Board of Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=cmb.gov.tr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and annual reports should be disclosed to the public.

An example of public joint-stock company in the field of media is the state-run [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] (TRT- Türkiye Radyo ve Televizyon Kurumu).

The results of a survey  clearly showed that the sole enforcement of commercial law provides insufficient information regarding who effectively owns and ultimately controls media organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Beneficial ownership ==
None of the laws regulating print, broadcast and online media requires disclosure of [[beneficial owner]]s, i.e. holders owning shares on behalf of another person, or those with indirect control or a significant interest to a media authority or to the public.

If the media company is established as a joint stock company, shareholding information can easily be accessed through the company's website and through the database of the trade registry. However, if shares are owned by one and actually used by another one as per an internal agreement, this information is not required to be disclosed by private or publicly-listed companies meaning ultimate ownership cannot therefore be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12181|title=Turkey TMO Consultation|last=|first=|date=|website=access-info.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, experts consider that a reasonable, non-technical individual would not be able to ascertain who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media organisation, from the information available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Influence of advertising financing ==
As advertising is an important income for media providers and  the allocation of advertisements may influence editorial policies or weaken certain media rather than others, media service providers (broadcasters) shall report their monthly commercial advertisement income to the RTÜK, by the 20th day of the following month.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The distribution of public funds on advertising is existentially an important source of income for smaller papers but the relative data remain hidden. For instance, the request of information on this topic by the [[Media Ownership Monitor]] was refused by the [[Access to public information in Turkey|Turkish Right to Information Assessment Council]], citing “trade secrets” as a reason.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://turkey.mom-rsf.org/en/findings/indicators/#!8dc92ea5c8f7b762a99f91c4dd1096e8|title=(Political) Control over Media Funding|last=|first=|date=|website=turkey.mom-rsf.org|publisher=Reporters Without Borders, Bianet|publication-place=Media Ownership Monitor- Turkey|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the coup attempt, on October 5, 2016, regulations regarding  the [[Press Advertising Institution]] (''[[:tr:Basın İlan Kurumu|Basın İlan Kurumu]]''- BİK)- the authority managing public announcements and advertising- were changed. According to this contested regulation,&lt;ref&gt;Regulation No. 29848, October 5, 2010, Art. No. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  any news outlet that employs a journalist who is being tried on terrorism related charges will not be given state advertising, unless the employee is fired from the media organization in five days.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Civil society initiatives ==
Referring to the actions to be taken at a domestic level, some experts underlined the importance of encouraging public debate on media ownership, and to enhance media literacy on this topic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2016, [[Reporters Without Borders]], together with the Turkish independent press agency [[Bianet]], launched the project ''[[Media Ownership Monitor]] Turkey'' to promote transparency in media ownership and to map who owns and controls the media in Turkey, by creating a public available and updated database listing the owners of the main media outlets (both individual owners and media companies) and detailing also the interests and the affiliations of owners into companies or political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://turkey.mom-rsf.org/en/|title=Media Ownership Monitor Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=turkey.mom-rsf.org|publisher=Reporters Without Borders, Bianet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another civil society initiative is the ''[[Network Data Compiling]]'', a collective data compiling and mapping project dedicated to pursue the relations between capital and power in Turkey, released on July 14, 2014.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Tremie components.png|thumb|Hopper, pipes and lifting cap components of a tremie concrete placement tube]]

The '''tremie''' [[concrete]] placement method uses a vertical or nearly vertical pipe, through which concrete is placed by gravity feed below water level.

The lower end of the pipe is kept immersed in fresh concrete so that concrete rising from the bottom displaces the water, thus limiting washing out of the [[cement]] content of the fresh concrete to the exposed upper surface. The upper end of the tremie pipe is kept above the water level during the pour and is provided with a conical  hopper for batch loading, or concrete may be pumped into the top of the tremie pipe. Concrete must be poured at a rate which avoids setting in the tremie. Admixtures may be used to control setting time, slump and workability. Vibration and jerking of the pipe may be applied to encourage slumping and levelling of the upper surface of the pour, and the tremie may need to be raised occasionally during the pour so that the bottom end is not too deeply embedded, but the pipe must not be moved sufficiently to break clear of the mound and expose the bottom opening to the water, as this would allow washout of cement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=Dhrubajyoti|title=Analysis of tremie technique in concreting of bottom plug of wells|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/13214313/713257597/name/Paper-+Analysis+of+Tremie+Technique+in+concreting+of+bottom+plug+of+wells.pdf |accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
A tremie is used to pour concrete underwater in a way that avoids washout of cement from the mix due to turbulent water contact with the concrete while it is flowing. This produces a more reliable strength of the product. 

==Equipment==

A tremie is a watertight pipe, usually of about 250mm inside diameter (150 to 300 mm),&lt;ref name="Tremie pipes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Concrete Pumping Products - Tremie Pipes|url=http://www.tremiepipe.com/|website=we-couplings.com|publisher=W.E. Couplings Ltd|accessdate=1 June 2017|location=Anderton, Lancashire}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a conical hopper at its upper end above the water level. It may have a loose plug or a valve at the bottom end. The tremie is often supported by a working platform above the water level. The pipe is made up of short sections commonly joined by screw thread with O-ring seal so that the length can be adjusted during the pour without getting the top of the pipe below the water or removing the bottom end from below the surface of the poured concrete. To facilitate management of pipe length is may be built up from 1 to 3.5m sections. A foam rubber 'pig' may be used to plug the pipe while introducing the first batch of concrete.&lt;ref name="Civil Engineering Today 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Method of underwater concreting - Tremie method|url=http://engineerstoday.blogspot.co.za/2009/02/method-of-underwater-concreting-tremie.html|website=Civil Engineers Today|accessdate=1 June 2017|date=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tremie pipes" /&gt;

==Placement==
To start placement, the tremie pipe is first lowered into position. Air and water must be kept out of the tremie during placement by keeping the pipe full of concrete at all times. This is facilitated if the hopper capacity is at least equal to the volume of the pipe. When initially charging the tremie a wad of empty cement bags or a foam rubber plug known as a pig may be stuffed into the pipe to keep the flow under control while the first concrete forces the plug down the pipe and displaces the water. The pig will float out and rise to the surface. The discharge opening must be kept well immersed in the placed concrete, allowing flow from within the placement. {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} of embedment should be maintained as a minimum if possible. This can be measured by finding the level of the concrete surface below the top of the pipe with a weighted tape and subtracting from the known length of the tremie. It is critically important to concrete quality that the tremie discharge remains well embedded in the concrete. As the pour progresses, if flow slows or stops, the discharge opening is raised so that the head in the pipe can maintain flow. Continuous flow is desirable if possible.&lt;ref name="Civil Engineering Today 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tremie pipes" /&gt;

If it is necessary to move the tremie laterally, it is better to lift it out vertically, plug it and start a new pour at the new position than to drag it sideways through freshly placed concrete. If the area of the pour is too large to manage from a single point, it is better to use several tremies in parallel than to shift a single tremie around. A spacing between tremies of between 3.5 and 5m, and a distance of about 2.5m from the formwork has been recommended. The risk of segregation and uneven setting can be minimised by providing a continuous flow of concrete through all the tremies to maintain a moderately even surface.&lt;ref name="Civil Engineering Today 2009" /&gt;

==Concrete==
Concrete for tremie placement should have a very high slump of about 150 mm to 200 mm.&lt;ref name="Suryakanta"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suryakanta|title=How concreting is done under water by tremie method?|url=http://civilblog.org/2015/04/06/how-concreting-is-done-under-water-by-tremie-method/|website=Concrete technology|publisher=Civilblog.org|accessdate=1 June 2017|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
* Concrete is often poured through a tremie pipe to build [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]], which are the foundations of, among other things, [[bridge]]s that span bodies of water.
* Pilings.&lt;ref name="Tremie pipes" /&gt;
* Monitoring wells: Tremie methods are employed for materials other than concrete, and for industries other than construction. For example, [[bentonite]] slurries for [[Piezometer|monitoring wells]] are often emplaced via tremie pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Nielsen |editor1-first=David  |title=Practical handbook of ground-water [sic] monitoring |year=1991 |publisher=CRC Press LLC |isbn=0-87371-124-6 |page=321 |quote=In wells more than about 50 feet deep, granular bentonite may be mixed with water and conveyed through a tremie pipe from the surface directly to its intended depth in the annulus. Pelletized bentonite is not effectively installed through tremie pipes.
