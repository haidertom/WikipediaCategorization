In [[physics]], the '''angular velocity''' of a particle is the rate at which it rotates around a chosen center point: that is, the time rate of change of its [[angular displacement]] relative to the origin (i.e. in layman's terms: how quickly an object goes around something over a period of time - e.g. how fast the earth orbits the sun). It is measured in angle per unit time, [[radians per second]] in [[SI]] units, and is usually represented by the symbol [[omega]] ('''ω''', sometimes '''Ω'''). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.

For example, a [[Geosynchronous orbit|geostationary]] satellite completes one orbit per day above the equator, or 360 degrees per 24 hours, and has angular velocity ''&amp;omega;'' = 360 / 24 = 15 degrees per hour, or 2&amp;pi; / 24 &amp;asymp; 0.26 radians per hour. If angle is measured in [[radians]], the linear velocity is the radius times the angular velocity, &lt;math&gt;v = r\omega&lt;/math&gt;. With orbital radius 42,000 km from the earth's center, the satellite's speed through space is thus ''v'' = 42,000 &amp;times; 0.26 &amp;asymp; 11,000 km/hr. The angular velocity is positive since the satellite travels eastward with the Earth's rotation (counter-clockwise from above the north pole.)

In three dimensions, angular velocity is a [[pseudovector]], with its magnitude measuring the rate of rotation, and its direction pointing along the axis of rotation (perpendicular to the radius and velocity vectors). The up-or-down orientation of angular velocity is conventionally specified by the [[right-hand rule]].&lt;ref name= EM1&gt;{{cite book

== Angular velocity of a particle ==

=== Particle in two dimensions ===
[[Image:Angular velocity1.svg|right|256 px|thumb|The angular velocity of the particle at ''P'' with respect to the origin ''O'' is determined by the [[perpendicular component]] of the velocity vector '''v'''.]]

In the simplest case of circular motion at radius ''r'', with position given by the angular displacement &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt; from the x-axis, the angular velocity is the rate of change of angle with respect to time: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \tfrac{d\phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is measured in [[radian]]s, the distance from the x-axis around the circle to the particle is &lt;math&gt;\ell=r\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and the linear velocity is &lt;math&gt;v(t)=\tfrac{d\ell}{dt}=r\omega(t)&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\omega=\tfrac{v}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.  

In the general case of a particle moving in the plane, the angular velocity is measured relative to a chosen center point, called the origin. The diagram shows the radius vector '''r''' from the origin ''O'' to the particle ''P'', with its [[polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(r, \phi)&lt;/math&gt;. (All variables are functions of time ''t''.) The particle has linear velocity splitting as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_\|+\mathbf{v}_\perp&lt;/math&gt;,  with the radial component &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_\|&lt;/math&gt; parallel to the radius, and the  cross-radial (or tangential or circular) component &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_\perp&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to the radius. When there is no radial component, the particle moves around the origin in a circle; but when there is no cross-radial component, it moves in a straight line from the origin. Since radial motion leaves the angle unchanged, only the cross-radial component of linear velocity contributes to angular velocity.

The angular velocity ''ω'' is the rate of change of angle with respect to time, which can be computed from the cross-radial velocity as:

: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{d\phi}{dt} = \frac{v_\perp}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the cross-radial speed &lt;math&gt;v_\perp&lt;/math&gt; is the signed magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_\perp&lt;/math&gt;, positive for counter-clockwise motion, negative for clockwise. Taking polar coordinates for the linear velocity '''v''' gives magnitude ''v'' (linear speed) and angle ''&amp;theta;'' relative to the radius vector; in these terms, &lt;math&gt;v_\perp = v\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, so that 

: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{v\sin(\theta)}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

These formulas may be derived from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=(x(t),y(t))&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(x'(t),y'(t))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan(y(t)/x(t))&lt;/math&gt;, together with the projection formula &lt;math&gt;v_\perp = \tfrac{\mathbf{r}^\perp\!\!}{r}\cdot \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}^\perp = (-y,x)&lt;/math&gt;.

In two dimensions, angular velocity is a number with plus or minus sign indicating orientation, but not pointing in a direction. The sign is conventionally taken to be positive if the radius vector turns counter-clockwise, and negative if clockwise. Angular velocity may be termed a [[pseudoscalar]], a numerical quantity which changes sign under a [[parity (physics)|parity inversion]], such as inverting one axis or switching the two axes.

=== Particle in three dimensions ===
[[Image:Angular velocity.svg|thumb|250px|The angular velocity describes the rate of change of angular position, and the instantaneous axis of rotation. In this case (counter-clockwise rotation) the vector points up.]]

In  [[three-dimensional space]], we again have the position vector '''r''' of a moving particle, its radius vector from the origin. Angular velocity is a vector (or [[pseudovector]]) whose magnitude measures the rate at which the radius sweeps out angle, and whose direction shows the principal axis of rotation. Its up-or-down direction is given by the [[right-hand rule]].

Let the axial vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; be the unit-length vector perpendicular to the plane of rotation spanned by the radius and velocity vectors, so that the direction of rotation is counter-clockwise looking from the top of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking polar coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; in the plane of rotation, as in the two-dimensional case above, one may define the angular velocity vector as: 

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega =\omega \mathbf u = \tfrac{d\phi}{dt}\mathbf u=\frac{v \sin(\theta)}{r}\mathbf u,&lt;/math&gt; 

where ''&amp;theta;'' is the angle between '''r''' and '''v'''. In terms of the cross product, this is:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega
=\frac{\mathbf r\times\mathbf v}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

From this, one can recover the tangential velocity as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{\perp} =\boldsymbol{\omega} \times\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Addition of angular velocity vectors ====
[[image:gimbaleuler.svg|thumb|Schematic construction for addition of angular velocity vectors for rotating frames]]

If a point rotates with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; in a [[Frame of a vector space|coordinate frame]] &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; which itself rotates with an angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt; with respect to an external frame &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;, we can define &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 + \omega_2&lt;/math&gt; to be the composite angular velocity vector of the point with respect to &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;. This operation coincides with usual addition of vectors, and it gives angular velocity the algebraic structure of a true [[Vector space#Definition|vector]], rather than just a pseudo-vector.

The only non-obvious property of the above addition is commutativity. This can be proven from the fact that the velocity tensor ''W'' (see below) is skew-symmetric, so that &lt;math&gt;R=e^{Wt}&lt;/math&gt; is a rotation matrix which can be expanded as &lt;math&gt;R = I + W\cdot dt + \tfrac 12 (W \cdot dt)^2 + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;. The composition of rotations is not commutative, but &lt;math&gt;(I+W_1\cdot dt)(I+W_2 \cdot dt)=(I+W_2 \cdot dt)(I+W_1\cdot dt)&lt;/math&gt; is commutative to first order, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 + \omega_2 = \omega_2 + \omega_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that this also defines the substraction as the addition of a negative vector.

== Angular velocity vector for a frame ==

Given a rotating frame of three unit coordinate vectors, all the three must have the same angular speed at each instant. In such a frame, each vector may be considered as a moving particle with constant scalar radius.

The rotating frame appears in the context of [[rigid body|rigid bodies]], and special tools have been developed for it: the angular velocity may be described as a vector or equivalently as a tensor. 

Consistent with the general definition, the angular velocity of a frame is defined as the angular velocity of any of the three vectors (same for all). The addition of angular velocity vectors for frames is also defined by the usual vector addition (composition of linear movements), and can be useful to decompose the rotation as in a [[gimbal]]. Components of the vector can be calculated as derivatives of the parameters defining the moving frames (Euler angles or rotation matrices). As in the general case, addition is commutative: &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 + \omega_2 = \omega_2 + \omega_1&lt;/math&gt;.

By [[Euler's rotation theorem]], any rotating frame possesses an [[instantaneous axis of rotation]], which is the direction of the angular velocity vector, and the magnitude of the angular velocity is consistent with the two dimensional case.

=== Components from the vectors of the frame ===

Considering a coordinate vector of the frame as a particle, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{e}_i|=1&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the angular velocity vector:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=\frac{\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}}{r^2}
= \mathbf{e}_1\times\dot{\mathbf{e}}_1 =\mathbf{e}_2\times\dot{\mathbf{e}}_2 = \mathbf{e}_3\times\dot{\mathbf{e}}_3.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; are the columns of the matrix of the frame, and  &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{e}}_i&lt;/math&gt; their time derivatives.

=== Components from Euler angles ===

[[Image:Eulerframe.svg|thumb|Diagram showing Euler frame in green]]

The components of the angular velocity pseudovector were first calculated by [[Leonhard Euler]] using his [[Euler angles]] and the use of an intermediate frame:
* One axis of the reference frame (the precession axis)
* The line of nodes of the moving frame with respect to the reference frame (nutation axis)
* One axis of the moving frame (the intrinsic rotation axis)

Euler proved that the projections of the angular velocity pseudovector on each of these three axes is the derivative of its associated angle (which is equivalent to decomposing the instantaneous rotation into three instantaneous [[Euler rotations]]). Therefore:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vti.mod.gov.rs/ntp/rad2007/3-07/hedr/hedr.pdf K.S.HEDRIH: Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) and rigid body dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega = \dot\alpha\mathbf u_1+\dot\beta\mathbf u_2+\dot\gamma \mathbf u_3&lt;/math&gt;

This basis is not orthonormal and it is difficult to use, but now the velocity vector can be changed to the fixed frame or to the moving frame with just a change of bases. For example, changing to the mobile frame:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega = (\dot\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma+\dot\beta\cos\gamma)\mathbf i+(\dot\alpha\sin\beta\cos\gamma-\dot\beta\sin\gamma)\mathbf j +(\dot\alpha\cos\beta+\dot\gamma)\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf i,\mathbf j,\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors for the frame fixed in the moving body. This example has been made using the Z-X-Z convention for Euler angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroengineering.info/angspeedconventions.html |title=online tool to calculate angular speed vectors |publisher=Aeroengineering.info |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Angular velocity tensor ==
{{see also|Skew-symmetric matrix}}

The angular velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=(\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z)&lt;/math&gt; defined above may be equivalently expressed as an '''angular velocity tensor''', the matrix (or linear mapping) ''W'' = ''W''(''t'') defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;

W =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -\omega_z &amp; \omega_y \\
\omega_z &amp; 0 &amp; -\omega_x \\
-\omega_y &amp; \omega_x &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is an [[Angular displacement#Infinitesimal rotation matrices|infinitesimal rotation matrix]]. The linear mapping ''W'' acts as &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol\omega \times)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf{r} = W \cdot\mathbf{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Calculation from the orientation matrix===

A vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt; undergoing uniform circular motion around an axis satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d \mathbf r} {dt} = \boldsymbol{\omega} \times\mathbf{r} = W \cdot \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Given the orientation matrix ''A''(''t'') of a frame, whose columns are the moving orthonormal coordinate vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_1,\mathbf e_2,\mathbf e_3&lt;/math&gt;, we can obtain its angular velocity tensor ''W''(''t'') as follows. Angular velocity must be the same for the three vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt;, so arranging the three vector equations into columns of a matrix, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dA}{dt} = W \cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;

(This holds even if ''A''(''t'') does not rotate uniformly.) Therefore the angular velocity tensor is:

: &lt;math&gt;W = \frac {dA} {dt} \cdot A^{-1} = \frac {dA} {dt} \cdot A^{\mathrm{T}},&lt;/math&gt;

since the inverse of the orthogonal matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is its transpose &lt;math&gt;A^{\mathrm{T}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties of angular velocity tensors ==
{{see also|Infinitesimal rotation}}

In general, the angular velocity in an ''n''-dimensional space is the time derivative of the angular displacement tensor, which is a second rank [[skew-symmetric tensor]].

This tensor ''W'' will have {{nowrap|''n''(''n''−1)/2}} independent components, which is the dimension of the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Lie group]] of [[rotations]] of an ''n''-dimensional inner product space.&lt;ref name="baez"&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/classical/galilei2.pdf Rotations and Angular Momentum] on the Classical Mechanics page of [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/README.html the website of John Baez], especially Questions 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duality with respect to the velocity vector ===

In three dimensions, angular velocity can be represented by a pseudovector because second rank tensors are [[dual space|dual]] to pseudovectors in three dimensions. Since the angular velocity tensor ''W'' = ''W''(''t'') is a [[skew-symmetric matrix]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
W =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; \omega_z &amp; -\omega_y \\
-\omega_z &amp; 0 &amp; \omega_x \\
\omega_y &amp; -\omega_x &amp; 0\\
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

its [[Hodge dual]] is a vector, which is precisely the previous angular velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=[\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z]&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Exponential of ''W'' ===

If we know an initial frame ''A''(0) and we are given a ''constant'' angular velocity tensor ''W'', we can obtain ''A''(''t'') for any given ''t''. Recall the matrix differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dA} {dt} = W \cdot A .&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be integrated to give:

: &lt;math&gt;A(t) = e^{Wt}A(0) ,&lt;/math&gt;

which shows a connection with the [[Lie group]] of rotations.

=== ''W'' is skew-symmetric ===
We prove that angular velocity tensor is [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew symmetric]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;W = \frac {dA(t)}{dt} \cdot A^\text{T} &lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;W^\text{T} = -W&lt;/math&gt;.

A rotation matrix ''A'' is orthogonal, inverse to its transpose, so we have &lt;math&gt;I=A\cdot A^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;A=A(t)&lt;/math&gt; a frame matrix, taking the time derivative of the equation gives:

: &lt;math&gt;0=\frac{dA}{dt}A^\text{T}+A\frac{dA^\text{T}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the formula &lt;math&gt;(A B)^\text{T}=B^\text{T}A^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{dA}{dt}A^\text{T}+\left(\frac{dA}{dt} A^\text{T}\right)^\text{T} = W + W^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, ''W'' is the negative of its transpose, which implies it is skew symmetric.

=== Coordinate-free description ===
At any instant &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the angular velocity tensor represents a linear map between the position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and the velocity vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt; of a point on a rigid body rotating around the origin:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = W\mathbf{r} .&lt;/math&gt;

The relation between this linear map and the angular velocity [[pseudovector]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the following.

Because ''W'' is the derivative of an [[orthogonal transformation]], the bilinear form

: &lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{s}) = (W\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{s} &lt;/math&gt;

is [[Bilinear form#Symmetric, skew-symmetric and alternating forms|skew-symmetric]]. Thus we can apply the fact of [[exterior algebra]] that there is a unique [[linear form]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^2 V &lt;/math&gt; that

: &lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{r}\wedge \mathbf{s}) = B(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{s})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\wedge \mathbf{s} \in \Lambda^2 V &lt;/math&gt; is the [[exterior product]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the [[Musical isomorphism|sharp]] ''L''{{sup|{{music|sharp}}}} of ''L'' we get

: &lt;math&gt; (W\mathbf{r})\cdot \mathbf{s} = L^\sharp \cdot (\mathbf{r}\wedge \mathbf{s}) &lt;/math&gt;

Introducing &lt;math&gt; \omega := {\star} (L^\sharp) &lt;/math&gt;, as the [[Hodge dual]] of ''L''{{sup|{{music|sharp}}}}, and applying the definition of the Hodge dual twice supposing that the preferred unit 3-vector is &lt;math&gt; \star 1&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; (W\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{s} = {\star} ( {\star} ( L^\sharp ) \wedge \mathbf{r} \wedge \mathbf{s}) = {\star} (\omega \wedge \mathbf{r} \wedge \mathbf{s}) = {\star} ( \omega \wedge \mathbf{r} ) \cdot \mathbf{s} = ( \omega \times \mathbf{r} ) \cdot \mathbf{s} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\omega \times \mathbf{r} := {\star} (\omega \wedge \mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;

by definition.

Because &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary vector, from nondegeneracy of [[scalar product]] follows

: &lt;math&gt; W\mathbf{r} = \omega \times \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Angular velocity as a vector field ===
For angular velocity tensor maps positions to velocities, it is a [[vector field]]. In particular, this vector field is a [[Killing vector field]] belonging to an element of the [[Lie algebra]] so(3) of the 3-dimensional [[rotation group SO(3)]]. This element of so(3) can also be regarded as the angular velocity vector.

== Rigid body considerations ==
{{see also|axes conventions}}

[[Image:AngularVelocity02.svg|right|320 px|thumb|Position of point P located in the rigid body (shown in blue). '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the position with respect to the lab frame, centered at ''O'' and '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the position with respect to the rigid body frame, centered at {{′|''O''}}. The origin of the rigid body frame is at vector position '''R''' from the lab frame.]]

The same equations for the angular speed can be obtained reasoning over a rotating [[rigid body]]. Here is not assumed that the rigid body rotates around the origin. Instead, it can be supposed rotating around an arbitrary point that is moving with a linear velocity ''V''(''t'') in each instant.

To obtain the equations, it is convenient to imagine a rigid body attached to the frames and consider a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the rigid body. Then we will study the coordinate transformations between this coordinate and the fixed "laboratory" system.

As shown in the figure on the right, the lab system's origin is at point ''O'', the rigid body system origin is at {{′|''O''}} and the vector from ''O'' to {{′|''O''}} is '''R'''. A particle (''i'') in the rigid body is located at point P and the vector position of this particle is '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in the lab frame, and at position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in the body frame. It is seen that the position of the particle can be written:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_i=\mathbf{R}+\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt;

The defining characteristic of a rigid body is that the distance between any two points in a rigid body is unchanging in time. This means that the length of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; is unchanging. By [[Euler's rotation theorem]], we may replace the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a 3×3 [[rotation matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the particle at some fixed point in time, say {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}}. This replacement is useful, because now it is only the rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; that is changing in time and not the reference vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;, as the rigid body rotates about point {{′|''O''}}. Also, since the three columns of the rotation matrix represent the three [[versor]]s of a reference frame rotating together with the rigid body, any rotation about any axis becomes now visible, while the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; would not rotate if the rotation axis were parallel to it, and hence it would only describe a rotation about an axis perpendicular to it (i.e., it would not see the component of the angular velocity pseudovector parallel to it, and would only allow the computation of the component perpendicular to it). The position of the particle is now written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_i=\mathbf{R}+\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the time derivative yields the velocity of the particle:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i=\mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the velocity of the particle (in the lab frame) and '''V''' is the velocity of {{′|''O''}} (the origin of the rigid body frame). Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a rotation matrix its inverse is its transpose. So we substitute &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{R}^\text{T}\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{I}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^\text{T}\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^\text{T}\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+W\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W = \frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the previous [[angular velocity tensor]].

It can be [[#W is skew-symmetric|proved]] that this is a [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew symmetric matrix]], so we can take its [[dual space|dual]] to get a 3 dimensional pseudovector that is precisely the previous angular velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=[\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z]&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting ''ω'' for ''W'' into the above velocity expression, and replacing matrix multiplication by an equivalent cross product:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i=\mathbf{V}+\boldsymbol\omega\times\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that the velocity of a point in a rigid body can be divided into two terms – the velocity of a reference point fixed in the rigid body plus the cross product term involving the angular velocity of the particle with respect to the reference point. This angular velocity is the "spin" angular velocity of the rigid body as opposed to the angular velocity of the reference point {{′|''O''}} about the origin ''O''.

=== Consistency ===
We have supposed that the rigid body rotates around an arbitrary point. We should prove that the angular velocity previously defined is independent from the choice of origin, which means that the angular velocity is an intrinsic property of the spinning rigid body.

[[image:AngularVelocity03.svg|right|320 px| thumb| Proving the independence of angular velocity from choice of origin]]

See the graph to the right: The origin of lab frame is ''O'', while ''O''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''O''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two fixed points on the rigid body, whose velocity is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Suppose the angular velocity with respect to ''O''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Since point ''P'' and ''O''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have only one velocity,

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}_1 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_1\times\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{v}_2 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_2\times\mathbf{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{v}_1 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_1\times\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{v}_1 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_1\times (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) &lt;/math&gt;

The above two yields that

: &lt;math&gt; (\boldsymbol{\omega}_1-\boldsymbol{\omega}_2) \times \mathbf{r}_2=0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since the point ''P'' (and thus &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt;) is arbitrary, it follows that

: &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega}_1 = \boldsymbol{\omega}_2 &lt;/math&gt;

If the reference point is the [[instantaneous axis of rotation]] the expression of velocity of a point in the rigid body will have just the angular velocity term. This is because the velocity of instantaneous axis of rotation is zero. An example of instantaneous axis of rotation is the hinge of a door. Another example is the point of contact of a purely rolling spherical (or, more generally, convex) rigid body.

'''Behavior management''' is similar to [[behavior modification]]. It is a less intensive version of [[behavior therapy]]. In behavior modification, the focus is on changing behavior, while in behavior management the focus is on maintaining order. Behavior management skills are of particular importance to teachers in the educational system. Behavior management include all of the actions and conscious in actions to enhance the probability people, individually and in groups, choose behaviors which are personally fulfilling, productive, and socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin J.D. and Baldwinn J.I. (1986). Behavior principals in everyday life (2nd Edition), Engle Wood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a great deal of research related to "behavior change" and "behavior management". Student Davidson does, in actuality, misinterpret the origination of the theory in connection to England's Industrial Revolution. B.F. Skinner and Carl Rogers have given two distinctly different approaches for addressing the behavior. Skinner's approach says that anyone can [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] behavior by first identifying what the individual finds rewarding. Once the rewards of an individual are known, then those rewards can be selected that the manager is willing to give in exchange for good behavior. Skinner calls this "Positive Reinforcement Psychology". Rogers proposes that in order to effectively address behavior problems, an individual must be persuaded to want to behave appropriately. This is done by teaching the individual the difference between right and wrong including why he or she should do what is right. Rogers believes that the individual must have an internal awareness of right and wrong.

==Uses of behavior management==
Many of the principles and techniques used are the same as behavior modification yet delivered in a less intensively and consistent fashion. Usually, behavior management is applied at the group level by a classroom teacher as a form of [[behavioral engineering]] to produce high rates of student work completion and minimize classroom disruption. In addition, greater focus has been placed on building self-control. Brophy (1986) writes: 
{{quote|"Contemporary behavior modification approaches involve students more actively in planning and shaping their own behavior through participation in the negotiation of contracts with their teachers and through exposure to training designed to help them to monitor and evaluate their behavior more actively, to learn techniques of self-control and problem solving, and to set goals and reinforce themselves for meeting these meetings." (p.&amp;nbsp;191)&lt;ref&gt;Brophy, J. (1986). "Classroom Management Techniques." Education and Urban Society 18/2, 182–194&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In general behavior management strategies have been very effective in reducing classroom disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Brophy, J.E. (1983) "Classroom Organization and Management." The Elementary School Journal 83/4, 265–285.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, recent efforts have focused on incorporating principles of functional assessment into the process.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Waguespack, Terrence Vaccaro &amp; Lauren Continere (2006). Functional Behavioral Assessment and Intervention with Emotional/Behaviorally Disordered Students: In Pursuit of State of the Art. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 2 (4), 463–474. [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

While such programs can come from a variety of [[behavioral change theories]], the most common practices rely on the use of [[applied behavior analysis]] principles such as [[positive reinforcement]] and mild punishments (such as [[response cost]] and [[child time-out]]). Behavioral practices such as differential reinforcement are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemarie Daddario, Karla Anhalt &amp; Lyle E. Barton (2007). Differential Reinforcement of Other Behavior Applied Classwide in a Child Care Setting. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 3 (3), 342–348. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, these are delivered in a [[token economy]] or a level system.,&lt;ref&gt;Cancio, E. &amp; Johnson, J.W. (2007). Level Systems Revisited: An Impact Tool For Educating Students with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 3 (4), 512–527 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the reward component is considered effective. For example, Cotton (1988) reviewed 37 studies on tokens, praise, and other reward systems and found them to be highly effective in managing student classroom behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, K. (1988). Instructional Reinforcement. Close-Up No. 3. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; The most comprehensive review of token procedures to match to children's level of behavioral severity was Walker's text "The acting out child."&lt;ref&gt;Walker, H. (1990). The Acting Out Child. Soper's West.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main parts to behavior management systems: Whole group, table group, and individual.  These can be things such as marble jars for the class, prize charts for the tables, and a grid chart with 25 spaces for individual students.  There are many different types of charts you can find to use for each part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 Part Classroom Management System|url=http://www.superteacherworksheets.com/classroom-behavior-cont.html|website=SuperTeacherWorksheets.com|publisher=Maryann|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building prosocial behavior==
{{Main|Behavior analysis of child development}}
Over the years, behavioral management principles such as reinforcement, modeling and even the use of punishment have been explored in the building of [[prosocial behavior]]. This area is sometimes referred to as "Behavioral Development" or [[Behavior analysis of child development]]. Midlarsky and colleagues (1973) used a combination of modeling and reinforcement to build altruistic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Midlarsky, E., Bryan, J.H., &amp; Brickman, P. (1973). Aversive approval: Interactive effects of modeling and reinforcement on altruistic behavior. ''Child Development'', 44, 321–328&lt;/ref&gt; Two studies exist in which modeling by itself did not increase prosocial behavior;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, M.B.(1970).

''Journal of Experimental Child Psychology'', 10, 8–15&lt;/ref&gt; however, modeling is much more effective than instruction giving (such as "preaching").&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, J.H. &amp; Walbek, N.H. (1970). The impact of words and deeds concerning altruism upon children. ''Child Development'', 41, 747–759&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, J.H. &amp; Walbek, N. (1970).

Sharing in preschool as a function of the amount and type of reinforcement.

Effects of cooperative response acquisition on social behavior during free play. ''Journal of Experimental Ch Psychology'', 12, 387–395&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research indicates that behavioral "interventions" produce the most valuable results when "applied" during early childhood and "early adolescence."&lt;ref&gt;Januaw.nasponline.org/publications/spr/40-2/spr402january.pdf "A meta-analysis of classroom-wide interventions to build social skills: do they work?", ''School Psychology Review'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversial has been the role of punishment in forming prosocial behavior. One study found that donation rates of children could be increased by punishing episodes of failure to donate.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, D.P., Gelfand, D.M., Smith, C.L., Paul, S.C., Cromer, C.C., Page, B.C. &amp; Lebenta, D.V. (1976). Factors affecting the acquisition and elimination of children's donating behavior. ''Journal of Experimental Child Psychology'', 21, 328–338&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialization process continues by peers with reinforcement and punishment playing major roles. Peers are more likely to punish cross-gender play and reinforce play specific to gender.&lt;ref&gt;Fagot, B.I., &amp; Patterson, G.R. (1969). An in vivo analysis of reinforcing contingencies for sex role behaviors in the preschool child. ''Developmental Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, M.E. &amp; Roopnarine, J.L. (1979). Peer influences on sex role development in preschoolers. ''Child Development'', 50, 1219–1222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, M.E., Easterbrooks, M.A., &amp; Holden, G. (1980). Reinforcement and punishment among preschoolers: Characteristcorrelates. ''Child Development'', 51, 1230–1236&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior management is used when an individual tries to stop problem behavior from another individual. Behavior modification and behavior therapy are two ways to help with behavior management. Behavior therapy is used when an individual is trying to find the course of the behavior, why the individual is behaving the way they are. Behavior modification is a technique to increase or decrease behavior. Using these techniques, one can achieve behavior management. (Goal: Making audience more informed on the topics and using proper grammar and neutral language)

Positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive and negative punishment are all forms of Operant Conditioning. Reinforcements are when you try to increase behavior, either positively or negatively. If you use positive reinforcement, you add a wanted stimulus for desired behavior (e.g. awarding good behavior with a treat). Negative reinforcement is when you increase behavior by removing something unwanted. (e.g., The child’s room is messy and his mom nags him to clean it up, he eventually keeps it clean to remove his mom’s nagging.) Punishment is trying to decrease behavior, either by using negative or positive. [[Positive punishment]] is when you add an unwanted stimulus to decrease the target’s behavior. (e.g., spanking a child when he behaves badly.) Here, spanking is being added to decrease his bad behavior. Negative punishment is when you remove something the target enjoys or likes to remove his or her bad behavior. (e.g. your child comes home past curfew every weekend, you remove watching TV when he is past curfew, therefore, your child’s behavior of coming past curfew will decrease.) This is negative punishment because your child likes to watch TV, so when you take that away from him for being late, he doesn’t like it, therefore, wanting to come home in time to not get that privilege taken away. (Goal: to elaborate and give more background to help reinforce the theory.) 
 
[[Abraham Maslow]] is a very well-known humanist psychologist with his work on hierarchy needs, in which he states that humans have basic needs, and if they are not satisfied, those individuals will not desire anything else. Maslow also claims that humans are never really satisfied, in that our needs are never fully fulfilled, therefore, this can affect how we can behave (e.g., if our needs are never fully fulfilled, then we might not always behave well, even if we do get a treat for good behavior.) A related concept, "Hawthorne Effect" involves the manipulation of behavior of somebody being observed. For example, if you’re being studied in an experiment, you might perform better or work harder because you are aware of the attention you are getting. It is this effect of observation that is called the "Hawthorne Effect". This is interesting because if we take a child who is behaving very poorly, no matter what, and they were put in an experiment, they might increase their good behavior because they are getting attention from the researcher. The point of operant conditioning in behavior modification is to regulate the behavior. It is a method to use different techniques and tie them all together to monitor how one behaves. It can cause a problem when talking about Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs because in this model Maslow goes on to explain how no one’s needs are fully met. The highest point on Maslow’s pyramid is self-actualization which Maslow argues is the goal in which we do not reach. This can pose a problem when it comes to behavior modification because one might think if that individual can not reach that ultimate goal, why try at all. Self-actualization is the goal in which humans have this sense of belonging or accomplishment. Humans have needs, just like any other breed of animal and when one type of animal does not attain those goals or needs, there is this feeling of dissatisfaction. When a person does not meet that top goal there is a void and that person might feel depressed that he or she can not get to that ultimate step. Using these behavioral modifications or techniques one can train or teach oneself how to better attain these goals.

'''Brodie's Law''' is an amendment to the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] [[Crimes Act 1958]] which makes serious [[bullying]] an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. The law is named after Brodie Panlock, a 19-year-old who committed suicide after being bullied at work. Brodie's parents, Damien and Rae Panlock, successfully lobbied the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]] to make the amendment.

==Brodie Panlock==

Brodie Rae Constance Panlock grew up in the outer eastern suburbs of [[Melbourne]] in the [[Australia]]n [[States and territories of Australia|state]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] with her parents and two older brothers.{{R|"abcpushed"|"torment"}} In early 2005, at the age of 18, Brodie started working at Cafe Vamp in [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] an inner suburb of [[Melbourne]].{{R|"abcpushed"|"torment"}} In March 2006, shortly after her 19th birthday, Brodie moved to a small flat in Hawthorn to be closer to work. Cafe Vamp helped Brodie with references and lent her the bond money for the flat.{{R|"torment"|"pain"}} She worked 12 hours a day, 6 days a week{{R|"pain"|"ReBrief"|p2=5 &amp; 6}} and was described as a "loyal employee" and "buoyant, chirpy, compassionate, patient, giving girl" by co-workers.{{R|"torment"}} Panlock had plans to save enough money to travel overseas with her brother and his girlfriend before enrolling at [[Technical and further education |TAFE]] to study [[social work]].{{R|"torment"|"pain"}}

Shortly after 11:00pm on 20 September 2006 Brodie jumped from the top of a multilevel carpark in Hawthorn and died from her injuries in [[The Alfred Hospital]] three days later.{{R|"torment"}}

===Bullying===

Panlock became involved in an intermittent intimate relationship with the cafe manager Nicholas Smallwood in the fifteen months leading up to her death.{{R|"torment"|"darkness"|"4men"}} Panlock became infatuated with Smallwood, but the attention was not returned.{{R|"darkness"}}

In the last few months Panlock's relationship with Smallwood became unhealthy, according to Coroner Peter White, who found that Smallwood and others "systematically bullied her, both physically and emotionally".{{R|"4men"}} Smallwood, fellow waiter Rhys MacAlpine and, to a lesser extent, chef Gabriel Toomey,{{R|"darkness"}} called her names, told her she was fat, ugly and a whore.{{R|"abcpushed"}} They kicked and spat on her, held her down and poured oil on her hair and clothes, covered her in chocolate sauce and filled her kit bag with fish oil. Other employees intervened without effect,{{R|"abcpushed"}} and the cafe owner Marcus Dela Cruz turned a blind eye to the behaviour.

In May 2006 after being kicked out of Smallwood's apartment, Panlock took rat poison and alcohol in a suicide attempt. Smallwood later taunted Panlock that she could not do it properly, and put rat poison in her handbag.{{R|"abcpushed"|"darkness"|"torment"|"fine"}}

===Final days===

On 20 September 2006, Smallwood left her flat after Panlock had begged him to stay. She called a former school friend Ashlea Cooper, who gave evidence to the inquest. Cooper recalled that Panlock "cried hysterically" and felt that she had made a fool of herself, saying: {{Quote|text=''How embarrassing ... I want to die. Ash, it is over. I have had enough. It's over.{{R|"torment"}}}}
Shortly after 11:00pm on 20 September 2006, Brodie jumped from the top of a multilevel carpark in Hawthorn; she died from her injuries in [[The Alfred Hospital]] three days later.{{R|"torment"}}

===Penalty===

Four men and MAP Foundation, the company that owned Cafe Vamp, were charged with offences under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 for their part in bullying Panlock. They pleaded guilty to the charges on 8 February 2010, at the Melbourne Magistrates' Court. They were ordered to pay $335,000 in fines as follows:{{R|"ReBrief"|"fine"}}
*MAP Foundation – $220,000
*Marcus Dela Cruz – $30,000
*Nicholas Smallwood – $45,000
*Rhys MacAlpine – $30,000
*Gabriel Toomey – $10,000

==Law Reform==

===Victoria===

Brodie Panlock's parents Damien and Rae Panlock successfully lobbied the Victorian Government to make changes to the law to include serious bullying as an offence punishable by imprisonment.{{R|"lobaust"|"probono"|"Leader"}}

On 4 November 2010 the [[Attorney-General of Victoria|Victorian Attorney-General]] asked the [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Law Reform Commission]] to review the adequacy of Victoria's criminal laws in dealing with serious bullying. The request was made to ensure that perpetrators of serious bullying receive appropriate sanction under Victoria's criminal law.{{R|"VLRC1"}} On 5 April 2011, the Attorney-General introduced the Crimes Amendment (Bullying) Bill 2011 to Parliament, which amended the offence of stalking under section 21 of the Crimes Act 1958, to include serious bullying as a crime carrying a maximum penalty of ten years.{{R|"VLRC2"}} The Bill received [[royal assent]] on 7 June 2011,{{R|"bill"}} and commenced immediately; it is colloquially known as "Brodie's Law".{{R|"abcBL"|"edu"}}

In the five years since the law's proclamation on 16 June 2011, fifty-eight offenders were charged with 140 offences against Brodie's Law.{{R|"stats5"|"Woolies"|"CMail58"}}

===National===

The [[Attorney-General of Victoria|Victoria Attorney-General]] [[Robert Clark (Australian politician)|Robert Clark]] announced that Brodie's Law would be discussed at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in November 2011.{{R|"lobaust"}}

The response by the Victorian government was backed by the [[Treasurer of Australia |Federal Assistant Treasurer]], [[Bill Shorten]]. In September 2011 the New South Wales Government was examining the Victorian legislation.{{R|"lobaust"}}

Damien and Rae Panlock continued to lobby the federal government because they feared that the states would fail to agree on the matter. On 26 May 2012, they met with [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]], [[Julia Gillard]], and Bill Shorten, now [[Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations|Minister for Workplace Relations]], and made a joint announcement of a national parliamentary inquiry into bullying.{{R|"lobaust"|"pmtrscpt"}} The report was released on 25 November 2012, and "contained 23 recommendations including the adoption of a new national definition of 'workplace bullying', a workplace bullying 'hotline' and a legislative and regulatory framework."{{R|"probono"}} In response to the recommendations the Federal Parliament passed the Fair Work Amendment Act 2013 which gave the [[Fair Work Commission]] jurisdiction to hear and resolve ''"a workplace incidence of bullying"''.{{R|"ShortenPR"}}

==Brodie's Law Foundation==

In late 2012, Damien and Rae Panlock toured Victoria, using the first anniversary of the introduction of Brodie's Law to raise awareness about bullying.{{R|"BRat"}}

Damien and Rae Panlock continue to tour Australia and speak in workplaces and at public events, to campaign against bullying.{{R|"BRat"|"wsblf"|"SAWHS"|"CFMEU"|"Foundation"}} The foundation assists with education in workplaces, schools and sporting clubs, with speaking engagements and production of education packages for teachers, club members, employers, and employees.

In February 2017, Brodie's Law Foundation was formed and registered as a charity.{{R|"ASIC"|"ABN"}}

[[File:Anagram canonical svg.svg|thumb|Algorithmic [[anagram]] test using [[multiset]]s as canonical forms: The strings "&lt;tt&gt;madam curie&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;radium came&lt;/tt&gt;" are given as [[C (programming language)|C]] arrays. Each one is converted into a canonical form by sorting. Since both sorted strings literally agree, the original strings were anagrams of each other.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''canonical''', '''normal''', or '''standard'''  '''form''' of a [[mathematical object]] is a standard way of presenting that object as a [[mathematical expression]]. The distinction between "canonical" and "normal" forms varies by subfield. In most fields, a canonical form specifies a ''unique'' representation for every object, while a normal form simply specifies its form, without the requirement of uniqueness.

The canonical form of a [[positive integer]] in [[decimal representation]] is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero.

More generally, for a class of objects on which an [[equivalence relation]] is defined, a '''canonical form''' consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, [[Jordan normal form]] is a canonical form for [[matrix similarity]], and the [[row echelon form]] is a canonical form, when one considers as equivalent a matrix and its left product by an [[invertible matrix]].

In computer science, and more specifically in [[computer algebra]], when representing mathematical objects in a computer, there are usually many different ways to represent the same object. In this context, a '''canonical form''' is a representation such that every object has a unique representation. Thus, the equality of two objects can easily be tested by testing the equality of their canonical forms. However canonical forms frequently depend on arbitrary choices (like ordering the variables), and this introduces difficulties for testing the equality of two objects resulting on independent computations. Therefore, in computer algebra, ''normal form'' is a weaker notion: A '''normal form''' is a representation such that zero is uniquely represented. This allows testing for equality by putting the difference of two objects in normal form.

'''Canonical form''' can also mean a [[differential form]] that is defined in a natural (canonical) way.

In computer science, data that has more than one possible representation can often be canonicalized into a completely unique representation called its '''canonical form'''.  Putting something into canonical form is [[canonicalization]].&lt;ref&gt;The term 'canonization' is sometimes incorrectly used for this.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Suppose we have some set ''S'' of objects, with an [[equivalence relation]] ''R''. A '''canonical form''' is given by designating some objects of ''S'' to be "in canonical form", such that every object under consideration is equivalent to exactly one object in canonical form. In other words, the canonical forms in ''S'' represent the equivalence classes, once and only once. To test whether two objects are equivalent, it then suffices to test their canonical forms for equality.
A canonical form thus provides a [[classification theorem]] and more, in that it not just classifies every class, but gives a distinguished (canonical) representative.

Formally, a canonicalization with respect to an equivalence relation ''R'' on a set ''S'' is a mapping ''c'':''S''→''S'' such that for all ''s'', ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''S'':
# ''c''(''s'') = ''c''(''c''(''s'')) &amp;nbsp; ([[idempotence]]),
# ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''R'' ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''c''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''c''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;nbsp; (decisiveness), and 
# ''s'' ''R'' ''c''(''s'') &amp;nbsp; (representativeness). 
Property 3 is redundant, it follows by applying 2 to 1.

In practical terms, one wants to be able to recognize the canonical forms. There is also a practical, algorithmic question to consider: how to pass from a given object ''s'' in ''S'' to its canonical form ''s''*? Canonical forms are generally used to make operating with equivalence classes more effective. For example, in [[modular arithmetic]], the canonical form for a residue class is usually taken as the least non-negative integer in it. Operations on classes are carried out by combining these representatives and then reducing the result to its least non-negative residue.
The uniqueness requirement is sometimes relaxed, allowing the forms to be unique up to some finer equivalence relation, like allowing reordering of terms (if there is no natural ordering on terms).

A canonical form may simply be a convention, or a deep theorem.

For example, polynomials are conventionally written with the terms in descending powers: it is more usual to write ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 30 than ''x'' + 30 + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, although the two forms define the same polynomial. By contrast, the existence of [[Jordan canonical form]] for a matrix is a deep theorem.

==Examples==
Note: in this section, "[[up to]]" some equivalence relation E means that the canonical form is not unique in general, but that if one object has two different canonical forms, they are E-equivalent.

In the untyped lambda calculus, e.g., the term &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.(x x) \; \lambda x.(x x))&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have a normal form. In the typed lambda calculus, every well-formed term can be rewritten to its normal form.

===Graph theory===
{{main article|Graph canonization}}
In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, '''graph canonization''' is the problem finding a canonical form of a given graph ''G''. A canonical form is a [[Graph labeling|labeled graph]] Canon(''G'') that is [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''G'', such that every graph that is isomorphic to ''G'' has the same canonical form as ''G''. Thus, from a solution to the graph canonization problem, one could also solve the problem of [[graph isomorphism]]: to test whether two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic, compute their canonical forms Canon(''G'') and Canon(''H''), and test whether these two canonical forms are identical.

===Differential forms===
Canonical [[differential form]]s include the [[canonical one-form]] and [[canonical symplectic form]], important in the study of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] and [[symplectic manifold]]s.

=== Computing ===
In [[computing]], the reduction of data to any kind of canonical form is commonly called ''data normalization''.

For instance, [[database normalization]] is the process of organizing the [[Field (computer science)|fields]] and [[Table (database)|table]]s of a [[relational database]] to minimize [[Data redundancy|redundancy]] and dependency. 

In the field of [[software security]], a common [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] is unchecked [[malicious input]]. The mitigation for this problem is proper [[input validation]]. Before input validation may be performed, the input must be normalized, i.e., eliminating encoding (for instance [[Character encodings in HTML|HTML encoding]]) and reducing the input data to a single common [[character set]].

Other forms of data, typically associated with [[signal processing]] (including [[Audio signal processing|audio]] and [[Image processing|imaging]]) or [[machine learning]], can be normalized in order to provide a limited range of values.

{{anchor|Biliteral|Triliteral|Multiliteral}}A '''Carroll diagram''', '''Lewis Carroll's square''', '''biliteral diagram''' or a ''two-way table'' is a [[diagram]] used for grouping things in a yes/no fashion. Numbers or objects are either categorised as 'x' (having an [[wiktionary:attribute#Noun|attribute]] x) or 'not x' (not having an attribute 'x'). They are named after [[Lewis Carroll]], the [[pseudonym]] of [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]].&lt;ref name="Ley_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SJS_2013"/&gt;

==Usage==
[[Image:Carroll Diagram (two criteria).svg|thumb|A more complex Carroll diagram.]]
Although Carroll diagrams can be as simple as the first one above, the most well known types are those similar to the second one, where two attributes are shown. The &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;universe&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; of a Carroll diagram is contained within the boxes in the diagram, as any [[number]] or [[Object (philosophy)|object]] has to either have an attribute or not have it.

Carroll diagrams are often learnt by [[schoolchildren]], but they can also be used outside the field of [[education]], since they are a tidy way of categorising and displaying information.

The '''Center for the Study of Democracy''' is a research and education institute at [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]] that focuses on the study of the history of emerging democracy in [[St. Mary's City, Maryland]], the site of Maryland'a first colonial capital and the location of many firsts in the development of democratic rights in North America; this work is done in conjunction with studies of modern democracies.  

The mission of the Center for the Study of Democracy is to draw historical lessons and also inspiration from history, in order to increase understanding of the processes and principles that lead to the constructive maintenance and enhancement of democracy in the United States and around the world. 

It does so by drawing on in-depth historical research, in conjunction with in-depth research on modern democracy-related issues and events, as they both relate to the process of [[democratization]] (establishing and improving democracy in all of its processes). 

The Center also sponsors numerous ongoing public forums and debates and seminars on these issues, many of which are covered by the media. 

The debates also often include hosting and moderating major political leaders or policy leaders facing off against their opponents.  

The Center for the Study of Democracy also strives to better understand historic setbacks and inconsistencies in the [[democratization]] process of historic Maryland and the United States, in order to better understand how these were eventually overcome; taking lessons from history that can then be applied to study of how democracy might be more constructively furthered today. The center Works in particular to increase understanding of how democracy may be enhanced in spite of the many obstacles that democratization often faces. 

The Center is jointly run by the Public Honors College, [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]] and its partner institution and neighbor, [[St. Mary's City, Maryland#Historic St. Mary's City|Historic St. Mary's City]], one of the nation's preeminent historical and archeological research institutions, 

==History==

The Center for the Study of Democracy was established in 2002. Such notable people as former [[U.S. District Court]] judge [[Thomas Penfield Jackson]], former National Security Adviser [[Anthony Lake]] former state Senator [[J. Frank Raley]] Jr. and former Maryland Governor [[William Donald Schaefer]] were very involved in its founding as well as being advisory board members. 

So was former [[Washington Post]] Editor in Chief [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]].&lt;ref&gt;"Center for the Study of Democracy: Purpose and Inspiration for Our Work", St. Mary's College of Maryland, CFSOD, {{cite web |url=http://www.smcm.edu/democracy/about/advisory.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808072754/http://www.smcm.edu/democracy/about/advisory.html |archivedate=2014-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these men also served for years on the Board of Trustees of St. Mary's College of Maryland.

The Center for the Study of Democracy hosts over 25 educational events and or / or public forums per year.  

===Political forums===

The Center hosts forums for state and national politicians on various key issues related to democratic governance, human rights, inclusion, lawmaking and security as it relates to democracy.

===Lectures and seminars===

The center sponsors and also directly provides many academic and also public lectures on both the historical and modern process of democratization. Learning from history (both recent history and older, foundational history) in order to better understand how democracy takes hold, and may be enhanced and spread constructively and effectively.

===College educational programs===

The center provides a minor in Democracy Studies at the St. Mary's College of Maryland. It also hosts numerous seminars and forums available to students. 

It also provides special visiting lecturers and scholars, as well as providing special lectures to other college classes and programs.

===Patuxent Defense Forum===

The center also hosts the Patuxent Defense Forum, a gathering of high level experts on international security, including representatives from the academic community, foreign policy leadership, defense industry and military leadership. The purpose of the forum is to increase understanding related to the processes that lead to constructive maintenance and enhancement of democracy from a strategic defense point of view.

==Public Lectures==

The Center also sponsors and hosts public lectures on areas of study related to its mission: 

* Peter S. Carmichael, Civil War Expert, Lecture on Slavery and the Civil War in the South&lt;ref&gt;"Civil War Expert Visits St. Mary’s College Sept. 22", Center for the Study of Democracy, {{cite web|url=http://www.smcm.edu/news/pressrelease/2011/09/11-142.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826181818/http://www.smcm.edu/news/pressrelease/2011/09/11-142.html |archivedate=2014-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Historical research===

The center supports and engages in research focused on examining the birth and emergence of various aspects of democracy in the earlier history of the state of Maryland and also the wider English speaking world. It then applies lessons and perspectives related to this history to modern day issues tied to the furtherance of democracy, both in the United States and in newly emerging democracies around the world.

===Contemporary research===

Extensive research is also done on issues related to the emergence of democracy in countries where it never previously existed or persisted; enhancement and furtherance of democracy in developed nations as well as furtherance of minority and women's participation in democracy worldwide.

==National Public Radio==

On Maryland and Washington, D.C. public radio, the Center for the Study of Democracy is often sought out for expert commentary.

==Funding==

The Institution is both publicly and privately funded. It is nonprofit and under the joint operation of the Public Honors College, St. Mary's College of Maryland (a Maryland state public school) and Historic St. Mary's City Maryland (a state research, historic interpretation and educational agency).   

The organization has been funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. It also has a history of gaining funding from other major granting institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8884">[[File:Codomain2.SVG|right|thumb|250px|A function {{math|'''f'''}} from {{math|'''X'''}} to {{math|'''Y'''}}. The large blue oval is {{math|'''Y'''}} which is the codomain of {{math|'''f'''}}{{nbsp}}. The smaller (yellow) oval inside {{math|'''Y'''}} is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of {{math|'''f'''}}{{nbsp}}.]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''codomain''' or '''target set''' of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|Y}} into which all of the [[output (mathematics)|output]] of the function is constrained to fall. It is the set {{mvar|Y}} in the notation {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}}. The codomain is also sometimes referred to as the [[range (mathematics)|range]] but that term is ambiguous as it may also refer to the [[image (mathematics)|image]].

The codomain is part of a function {{mvar|f}} if it is defined as described in 1954 by [[Nicolas Bourbaki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements de Mathematique,Theorie des Ensembles |author=N.Bourbaki |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |publisher=Hermann &amp; cie |page=76 |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely a triple {{math|(''X'', ''Y'', ''F'')}}, with {{mvar|F}} a functional subset&lt;ref&gt;A set of pairs is ''functional'' iff no two distinct pairs have the same first component [Bourbaki, ''op. cit.'', p. 76]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Cartesian product]] {{math|''X'' × ''Y''}} and {{math|''X''}} is the set of first components of the pairs in {{mvar|F}} (the ''domain''). The set {{mvar|F}} is called the ''graph'' of the function. The set of all elements of the form {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, where {{mvar|x}} ranges over the elements of the [[domain of a function|domain]] {{mvar|X}}, is called the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of {{mvar|f}}. In general, the image of a function is a subset of its codomain. Thus, it may not coincide with its codomain. Namely, a function that is not [[Surjective function|surjective]] has elements {{mvar|y}} in its codomain for which the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} does not have a solution.

An alternative definition of ''function'' by Bourbaki [Bourbaki, ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;77], namely as just a functional graph, does not include a codomain and is also widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forster|2003}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=mVeTuaRwWssC|page=10|text=Some mathematical cultures make this explicit, saying that a function}} pp. 10&amp;ndash;11]&lt;/ref&gt; For example in [[set theory]] it is desirable to permit the domain of a function to be a [[Class (set theory)|proper class]] {{mvar|X}}, in which case there is formally no such thing as a triple {{math|(''X'', ''Y'', ''F'')}}. With such a definition functions do not have a codomain, although some authors still use it informally after introducing a function in the form {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eccles|1997}}, p. 91 ([{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=ImCSX_gm40oC|page=91|text=The reader may wonder at this variety of ways of thinking about a function}} quote 1], [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=ImCSX_gm40oC|page=91|text=When defining a function using a formula it is important to be clear about which sets are the domain and the codomain of the function}} quote 2]); {{Harvnb|Mac Lane|1998}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=MXboNPdTv7QC|page=8|text=Here "function" means a function with specified domain and specified codomain}} p. 8]; Mac Lane, in {{Harvnb|Scott|Jech|1967}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=5mf4Vckj0gEC|page=232|text=Note explicitly that the notion of function is not that customary in axiomatic set theory}} p. 232]; {{Harvnb|Sharma|2004}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=IGvDpe6hYiQC|page=91|text=Functions as sets of ordered pairs}} p. 91]; {{Harvnb|Stewart|Tall|1977}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=TLelvnIU2sEC|page=89|text=Strictly speaking we cannot talk of 'the' codomain of a function}} p. 89]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
For a function

:&lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

defined by

:&lt;math&gt;f\colon\,x\mapsto x^2, \text{ or equivalently }f(x)\ =\ x^2,&lt;/math&gt;

the codomain of {{mvar|f}} is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, but {{mvar|f}} does not map to any negative number. 
Thus the image of {{mvar|f}} is the set &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^+_0&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{closed-open|0, ∞}}.

An alternative function {{mvar|g}} is defined thus: 

: &lt;math&gt;g\colon\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^+_0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g\colon\,x\mapsto x^2.&lt;/math&gt;

While {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} map a given {{mvar|x}} to the same number, they are not, in this view, the same function because they have different codomains. A third function {{mvar|h}} can be defined to demonstrate why:

: &lt;math&gt;h\colon\,x\mapsto \sqrt x.&lt;/math&gt;

The domain of {{mvar|h}} must be defined to be &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^+_0&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;h\colon\mathbb{R}^+_0\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[function composition|compositions]] are denoted

:&lt;math&gt;h \circ f,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h \circ g.&lt;/math&gt;

On inspection, {{math|''h'' ∘ ''f''}} is not useful. It is true, unless defined otherwise, that the image of {{mvar|f}} is not known; it is only known that it is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, it is possible that {{mvar|h}}, when composed with {{mvar|f}}, might receive an argument for which no output is defined – negative numbers are not elements of the domain of {{mvar|h}}, which is the [[square root function]].

Function composition therefore is a useful notion only when the ''codomain''  of the function on the right side of a composition (not its ''image'', which is a consequence of the function and could be unknown at the level of the composition) is the same as the domain of the function on the left side.

The codomain affects whether a function is a [[surjection]], in that the function is surjective if and only if its codomain equals its image.  In the example, {{mvar|g}} is a surjection while {{mvar|f}} is not.  The codomain does not affect whether a function is an [[injective function|injection]].

A second example of the difference between codomain and image is demonstrated by the [[linear transformation]]s between two [[vector space]]s – in particular, all the linear transformations from &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; to itself, which can be represented by the {{math|2×2}} [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with real coefficients.  Each matrix represents a map with the domain &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; and codomain &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  However, the image is uncertain.  Some transformations may have image equal to the whole codomain (in this case the matrices with [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] {{math|2}}) but many do not, instead mapping into some smaller [[Linear subspace|subspace]] (the matrices with rank {{math|1}} or {{math|0}}).  Take for example the matrix {{mvar|T}} given by
:&lt;math&gt;T = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
which represents a linear transformation that maps the point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} to {{math|(''x'', ''x'')}}.  The point {{math|(2, 3)}} is not in the image of {{mvar|T}}, but is still in the codomain since linear transformations from &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; are of explicit relevance.  Just like all {{math|2×2}} matrices, {{mvar|T}} represents a member of that set.  Examining the differences between the image and codomain can often be useful for discovering properties of the function in question.  For example, it can be concluded that {{mvar|T}} does not have full rank since its image is smaller than the whole codomain.

The term '''Dakshinachara''' ([[Right-Hand Path]]) is a technical term used to refer to [[Tantra|Tantric sects]] that do not engage in [[nastika|heterodox]] practices. In contrast, ''[[Vamachara]]'' ([[Left-Hand Path]]) is  used to describe particular tantric practices that are considered [[nastika|heterodox]] according to usual [[Hindu]] social norms.

==Etymology==
N. N. Bhattacharyya explains the Sanskrit technical term ''[[Ācāra|{{IAST|ācāra}}]]'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The means of spiritual attainment which varies from person to person according to competence.... ''Ācāras'' are generally of seven kinds – Veda, Vaiṣṇava, Śaiva, Dakṣiṇa, Vāma, Siddhāṇta, and Kaula, falling into two broad categories – Dakṣiṇa and Vāma. Interpretations vary regarding the nature and grouping of the ''ācāras''.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharyya (1999) pp. 368-69.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Dakshina|{{IAST|Dakṣiṇa}}]]'' mans "right".&lt;ref&gt;Macdonell, A. A. (1996) p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, the term Dakṣiṇāra is often translated "Right-hand practice".

==Practices==

The ''Brahma Yamala'', a [[Tantras|Tantric text]], says there are three currents of tradition (dakshina, vama, and madhyama) characterized respectively by the predominance of each of the three [[guna]]s (sattva, rajas, and tamas).  According to this text, dakshina is characterized by [[sattva]], and is pure; Madhyama, characterized by [[rajas]], is mixed; and Vama, characterized by [[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]], is impure.  The Tantras of each class follow a particular line of spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bagchi, P. C. "Evolution of the Tantras" in: Prabhananda (2000) pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Dakshinachara consists of traditional Hindu practices such as [[asceticism]] and [[meditation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">The '''Declaration of Table Mountain''' is a statement on [[freedom of the press|press freedom]] in [[Africa]]. The statement was issued by the [[World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers]] (WAN-IFRA) and World Editors Forum (WEF) at the 60th meeting of the World Newspaper Conference and 14th World Editors Forum Conference in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], 3–6 June 2007. It is named after [[Table Mountain]], at the southern tip of the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of Table Mountain", ''Index on Censorship'', Volume 36, Number 3, 2007, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In country after country, the African press is crippled by a panoply of repressive measures, from the jailing and persecution of journalists to the widespread scourge of 'insult laws' and criminal defamation. As the start of an intensive campaign to improve this appalling situation, the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) adopted the Declaration of Table Mountain on 3 June 2007 in Cape Town, South Africa, during its annual meeting.

Through this Declaration, WAN-IFRA has stated its conviction that Africa urgently needs a strong, free and independent press to act as a watchdog over public institutions, a crucial role that the press is hindered from and punished for playing by the widespread resort to 'insult laws' and criminal defamation, in particular.

Major African and international non-governmental organisations that, day after day, defend and promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press have now endorsed the Declaration and expressed their readiness to contribute to this campaign. Together, with determination, we will now aggressively press our case in the hope for a better future for African media freedom.

According to [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his 2008 book ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', "The runaway would be beaten, and salt pickle, lime juice, and [[bird pepper]] would be rubbed into his or her open wounds. Another slave would defecate into the mouth of the miscreant, who would then be gagged for four to five hours."&lt;ref name=Gladwell&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |authorlink=Malcolm Gladwell |year=2008 |title=[[Outliers (book)|Outliers: The Story of Success]] |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |page=282 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-316-01792-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment was invented by [[Thomas Thistlewood]], a slave overseer and named for the slave, Derby, who was made to undergo this punishment when he was caught eating young sugar cane stalks in the field on 25 May 1756.

[[Image:Duality_(CoP).png|thumb|300px|Adaptation of the taichi symbol for [[Yin and yang]] by {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.]]

In the context of a [[community of practice]], the notion of a '''duality''' is used to capture the idea of the tension between two opposing forces which become a driving force for change and creativity.  Wenger {{Harv|Wenger|1998}} uses the concept of dualities to examine the forces that create and sustain a community of practice.  He describes a duality as "a single conceptual unit that is formed by two inseparable and mutually constitutive elements whose inherent tensions and complementarity give the concept richness and dynamism" {{Harv|Wenger|1998|p=66}}.  

Some compare the concept of a duality to that of [[yin and yang]], i.e. two mutually defining opposites.

The opposing entities in a duality need to be viewed from a perspective of balance rather than opposition.  The term implies a dynamism, continual change and mutual adjustment as the tensions that are inherent in dualities can be both creative and constraining. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}} identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice: participation–reification, designed–emergent, identification–negotiability and local–global.

== Participation and reification ==
The ''participation–reification'' duality is concerned with meaning.  Meaning is created through participation and active involvement in some practice.  Reification is a way of making an abstract and concise representation of what is often a complex and frequently messy practice, thus making it easier to share within the community.  Because of its obvious links to [[knowledge management]], the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest in this field {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.

== Designed and emergent ==
The ''designed–emergent'' duality focuses on time and captures the tension between pre-planned and emergent activities.  Designers can plan an activity that is designed to achieve a particular purpose however, some activities emerge through interaction and participation of the community; these are unplanned and may be contrary to what the designers intended.  These give participants the opportunity to (re)negotiate existing meaning.  The designed–emergent duality is often mentioned in relation to the design of on-line learning environments e.g. {{Harv|Barab|MaKinster|Scheckler|2003}}.

== Identification and negotiability ==
The ''identification–negotiability'' duality is concerned with "how the power to define, adapt, or interpret the design is distributed" {{Harv|Wenger|1998|p=235}}.  Identification is the process through which individuals build their identities.  This can include not only how individuals perceive themselves but also their right to contribute to and shape the direction of a community as a whole.  Thus, this duality serves to combine both power and belonging in the shaping of the community.

== Local and global ==
The ''local–global'' duality concerns how one CoP relates to another.  The challenge is to share local knowledge that meets the needs of a particular domain in a way that will be of relevance to others who are not involved in it.  Wenger uses the notion of a [[boundary object]], [[brokerage]] {{Harv|Wenger|1998|p=106}} and boundary encounters {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002|p=84}} to explain how individuals can establish relationships and learn from other communities.

'''Dzogchen''' ({{bo|w=rdzogs chen}}) or "[[Pāramitā|Great Perfection]]", Sanskrit: '''अतियोग''', is a tradition of teachings in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] aimed at discovering and continuing in the natural [[Ground (Dzogchen)|primordial state]] of being.{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=4}} It is a central teaching of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and of [[Bon]].{{refn|group=quote|John Pettit: "Great Perfection" variously indicates the texts (''āgama, lung'') and oral instructions (''upadeśa, man ngag'') that indicate the nature of enlightened wisdom (''rdzogs chen gyi gzhung dang man ngag''), the verbal conventions of those texts (''rdzogs chen gyi chos skad''), the yogis who meditate according to those texts and instructions (''rdzogs chen gyi rnal &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;byor pa''), a famous monastery where the Great Perfection was practiced by monks and yogis (''rdzogs chen dgon sde''), and the philosophical system (''siddhānta, grub mtha&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'') or vision (''darśana, lta ba'') of the Great Perfection.{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=4}}}} In these traditions, Dzogchen is the highest and most definitive path of the nine vehicles to liberation.{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=82}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Padmasambhava in yam-yum.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Vajrasattva in [[Yab-Yum|yab-yum]], which represents the primordial union of wisdom and compassion. The male figure is usually linked to [[Karuṇā|compassion]] and [[Upaya|skillful means]], while the female partner relates to [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]].]]
''Dzogchen'' is composed of two terms:
* ''rdzogs'' – perfection&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;
* ''chen'' – great&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;

The term initially referred to the "highest perfection" of deity visualisation, after the visualisation has been dissolved and one rests in the natural state of the innately [[Luminous mind|luminous and pure mind]].{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; In the 10th and 11th century, ''Dzogchen'' emerged as a separate tantric vehicle in the [[Nyingma]] tradition,&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; used synonymously with the Sanskrit term ''ati yoga'' (primordial yoga).{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=24}}

According to van Schaik, in the 8th-century tantra ''Sarvabuddhasamāyoga'' 
{{quote|... there seems to be an association of Anuyoga with yogic bliss, and Atiyoga with a realization of the nature of reality via that bliss. This ties in with the three stages of deity yoga described in a work attributed to Padmasambhava: development (kye), perfection (dzog) and great perfection (dzogchen).&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;}}

According to the 14th Dalai Lama, the term ''dzogchen'' may be a rendering of the [[Sanskrit]] term ''mahāsandhi''.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=208}}

According to Anyen Rinpoche, the true meaning is that the student must take the entire path as an interconnected entity of equal importance. Dzogchen is perfect because it is an all-inclusive totality that leads to middle way realization, in avoiding the two extremes of nihilism and eternalism. It classifies outer, inner and secret teachings, which are only separated by the cognitive construct of words and completely encompasses Tibetan Buddhist wisdom.{{sfn| Anyen Rinpoche | 2006 | p = 12–13}}  It can be as easy as taking [[Bodhicitta]] as the method, and failing this is missing an essential element to accomplishment.{{sfn| Anyen Rinpoche | 2006 | p = 57}}

==Origins and history==

===Traditional accounts===

====Nyingma tradition====
[[File:Adi Buddha Samantabhadra.jpg|thumb|Adi Buddha [[Samantabhadra]].]]
According to the Nyingma tradition,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}} the primordial Buddha [[Samantabhadra]] taught Dzogchen to the Buddha [[Vajrasattva]], who transmitted it to the first human lineage holder, the Indian [[Garab Dorje]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 55 CE).{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}} According to tradition, the Dzogchen teachings were brought to Tibet by [[Padmasambhava]] in the late 8th and early 9th centuries. He was aided by two Indian masters, [[Vimalamitra]] and [[Vairocana]].{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} According to the Nyingma tradition, they transmitted the Dzogchen teachings in three distinct series, namely the Mind Series (''sem-de''), Space series (''long-de''), and Secret Instruction Series (''men-ngak-de'').{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}} According to tradition, these teachings were concealed shortly afterward, during the 9th century, when the Tibetan empire disintegrated.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} From the 10th century forward, innovations in the Nyingma tradition were largely introduced historically as revelations of these concealed scriptures, known as [[Terma (religion)|terma]].{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}}

====Bon tradition====
In the fourteenth century, Loden Nyingpo revealed a [[Terma (religion)|terma]] containing the story of [[Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche]].{{sfn|Schaik|2011|p=99}} According to this terma, Dzogchen originated with the founder of the Bon tradition, Tonpa Shenrab, who lived 18,000 years ago, ruling the kingdom of Tazik, which supposedly lay west of Tibet.{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}} He transmitted these teachings to the region of Zhang-zhung, the far western part of the Tibetan cultural world.{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} The earliest Bon literature only exists in Tibetan manuscripts, the earliest of which can be dated to the 11th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} The Bon tradition also has a threefold classification, namely ''Dzogchen'', ''A-tri'', and the "Zhang-zhung Aural Lineage (''zhang-zhung nyen-gyu'').{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}}

===Historical origins and development===

====Tibetan Empire (7th–9th century)====
The written history of Tibet begins in the early 7th century, when the Tibetan kingdoms were united, and Tibet expanded throughout large parts of Central Asia.{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=3}} [[Songtsen Gampo]] (reign ca.617-649/50) conquered the kingdom of Zhangzhung in western Tibet, dominated Nepal, and threatened the Chinese dominance in strategically important areas of the [[Silk Road]].{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=4}} He is also credited with the adoption of a writing system, the establishment of a legal code, and the introduction of Buddhism, though it probably only played a minor role.{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=4}} [[Tri Songdetsen]] (742-ca.797) adopted Buddhism, but also maintained the martial traditions of the Tibetan empire.{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=4}} The Tibetans controlled Dunhuang, a major Buddhist center, from the 780s until the mid-ninth century.{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=4-5}} Halfway through the 9th century the Tibetan empire [[History of Tibet#Era of Fragmentation|collapsed]].{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=5}} Royal patronage of Buddhism was lost, leading to a decline of Buddhism in Tibet,{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/libra-oa:7588|title=Bringing Light Into the Darkness: An Intellectual History of Tibet's Dark Age (842-978 CE)|last=Manuel|first=Lopez,|date=2014|website=UVA Library {{!}} Virgo|language=en|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to recover with the renaissance of Tibetan culture occurring from the late 10th century to the early 12th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} known as the later dissemination of Buddhism.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}

====Traditional classification of Dzogchen texts (9th–14th century)====
Traditionally, the early Dzogchen literature is categorized into three categories,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} which more or less reflect the historical development of Dzogchen:
# [[Semde]] (Wylie: ''sems sde''; Skt: ''cittavarga''), the "Mind series"; this category contains the earliest (proto) Dzogchen teachings.{{sfn|Schaik|2004a}} Tradition attributes them to Padmasmabhava and his consorts, and dates them to the 8th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} but they first appeared in the 9th century, written by Tibetans;{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}
#[[Longde (Dzogchen)|Longde]] (Wylie:  ''klong sde''; Skt: ''abhyantaravarga''), the series of Space; this series reflects the developments of the 11th-14th centuries, when new Buddhist techniques and doctrines  were introduced into Tibet;{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} 
# [[Menngagde]] (Wylie:  ''man ngag sde'', Skt: ''upadeshavarga''), the series of secret Oral Instructions, also known as Seminal Heart or Nyingthik (''snying thig''), also reflects the developments of the 11th-14th centuries; this series has overshadowed the other two. This division focuses on two aspects of practice: ''kadag trekchö'', "the cutting through of primordial purity", and ''lhündrub tögal'', "the direct crossing of spontaneous presence".&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Marcia Binder (Ed.) (2002). The Dzogchen Primer: Embracing The Spiritual Path According To The Great Perfection. London, Great Britain: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-57062-829-7}} pg. 38)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origins and Dunhuang texts (8th–10th century)====
[[File:Dzogchen text from Dunhuang 9th century.jpeg|thumb|right|Dzogchen text from Dunhuang 9th century]]
According to [[Sam van Schaik]], who studies early Dzogchen manuscripts from the [[Dunhuang]] caves, the Dzogchen texts are influenced by earlier Mahayana sources such as the [[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]] and [[Buddhist Tantras|Indian Buddhist Tantras]] with their teaching of [[shunyata|emptiness]] and [[Luminous mind|luminosity]], which in Dzogchen texts are presented as 'ever-purity' (''ka-dag'') and 'spontaneous presence' (''lhun-grub'').&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam van Schaik also notes that there is a discrepancy between the histories as presented by the traditions, and the picture that emerges from those manuscripts.{{sfn|Schaik|2004a}}&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV"&gt;[http://earlytibet.com/2011/08/03/early-dzogchen-iv/ Sam van Schaik, ''Early Dzogchen IV: the role of Atiyoga'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no record of Dzogchen as a separate tradition or vehicle prior to the 10th century,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}} although the terms ''atiyoga'' (as a higher practice than Tantra) and ''dzogchen'' do appear in 8th and 9th century Indian tantric texts.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} There is also no independent attestation of the existence of any separate traditions or lineages under the name of ''Dzogchen'' outside of Tibet,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} and it may be a unique Tibetan teaching,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} drawing on multiple influences, including both native Tibetan non-Buddhist beliefs and Chinese and Indian Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}

According to van Schaik, the term ''atiyoga'' first appeared in the 8th century, in an Indian tantra called ''Sarvabuddhasamāyoga''.{{refn|group=note|Tibetan has a ninefold classification scheme for the Buddhist teachings. First come the vehicles of the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas. Then come the three vehicles of "outer" yoga, and then the three vehicles of "inner" yoga. The "inner yoga" vehicles are Mahāyoga, Anuyoga and Atiyoga. The Dzogchen teachings are part of Atiyoga.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;}} In this text, ''Anuyoga'' is the stage of yogic bliss, while ''Atiyoga'' is the stage of the realization of the "nature of reality."&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; According to van Schaik, this fits with the three stages of deity yoga as described in a work attributed to Padmasambhava: development (kye), perfection (dzog) and great perfection (dzogchen).&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; ''Atiyoga'' here is not a vehicle, but a stage or aspect of yogic practice.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; In Tibetan sources, until the 10th century ''Atiyoga'' is characterized as a "mode" (''tshul'') or a "view" (''lta ba''), which is to be applied within deity yoga.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;

According to van Schaik, the concept of dzogchen, "great perfection," first appeared as the culmination of the meditative practice of [[deity yoga]]{{refn|group=note|The visualization of a deity and recitation of his or her mantra.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;}} around the 8th century.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; The term ''dzogchen'' was likely taken from the ''[[Guhyagarbhatantra]]''. This tantra describes, as other tantras, how in the creation stage one generates a visualisation of a deity and its [[mandala]]. This is followed by the completion stage, in which one dissolves the deity and the mandala into oneself, merging oneself with the deity. In the ''Guhyagarbhatantra'' and some other tantras, there follows a stage called ''rdzogs chen'', in which one rests in the natural state of the innately [[Luminous mind|luminous and pure mind]].{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}

In the 9th and 10th centuries deity yoga was contextualized in Dzogchen in terms of nonconceptuality, [[Nondualism|nonduality]] and the spontaneous presence of the enlightened state.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; Some Dunhuang texts dated at the 10th century show the first signs of a developing nine vehicles system. Nevertheless, ''Anuyoga'' and ''Atiyoga'' are still regarded then as modes of ''Mahāyoga'' practice.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; Only in the 11th century came ''Atiyoga'' to be threatened as a separate vehicle, at least in the newly emerging Nyingma tradition.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; Nevertheless, even in the 13th century (and later) the idea of Atiyoga as a vehicle was controversial in other Buddhist schools.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; Van Schaik quotes Sakya Pandita as writing, in his ''Distinguishing the Three Vows'':
{{quote|If one understands this tradition properly,&lt;br&gt;Then the view of Atiyoga too&lt;br&gt;Is wisdom and not a vehicle.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;}}

====Early Dzogchen – the Mind series (9–10th century)====
Most of the early Dzogchen literature, which are claimed to be "translations", are original compositions from a much later date than the 8th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} According to Germano, the Dzogchen-tradition first appeared in the first half of the 9th century, with a series of short texts attributed to Indian saints.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} They were codified into a canon of eighteen texts which were referred to as "mind oriented" (''sems phyogs''), and later became known as "mind series" (sems de''). {{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}

The mind series reflect the teachings of early Dzogchen, which rejected all forms of practice, and asserted that striving for liberation would simply create more delusion.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} One has simply to recognize the nature of one's own mind, which is naturally empty (''stong pa''), luminous ('''od gsal ba''), and pure.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} According to Germano, its characteristic language, which is marked by naturalism and negation, is already pronounced in some Indian tantras.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} Nevertheless, these texts are still inextricably bound up with tantric [[Mahayoga]], with its visualisations of deities and mandals, and complex initiations.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}

During the 9th and 10th centuries these texts, which represent the dominant form of the tradition in the 9th and 10th centuries,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} were gradually transformed into full-fledged tantras, culminating in the  [[Kulayarāja Tantra]] (''kun byed rgyal po'', "The All-Creating King"{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}), in the last half of the 10th or the first half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} According to Germano, this tantra was historically perhaps the most important and widely quoted of all Dzogchen scriptures.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}

====Transformation – the Space and Instruction series (11th–14th century)====
Early Dzogchen was completely transformed in the 11th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} with the [[History of Tibet#Era of Fragmentation|renaissance of Tibetan culture]] occurring from the late 10th century to the early 12th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}known as the later dissemination of Buddhism.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} New techniques and doctrines were introduced from India, resulting in new schools of Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} and radical new developments in Dzogchen doctrine and practice, with a growing emphasis on meditative practice.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} The older Bon and Nyingma traditions incorporated these new influences through the process of [[Terma (religion)|Treasure revelation]].{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} Especially the ''[[yogini]]'' tantras were influential, involving horrific imagery and violent rituals, erotic imagery, and sexual and somatic practices.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} These influences are reflected in the rise of [[subtle body]] representations and practices, new pantheons of wrathful and erotic Buddhas, increasingly [[Antinomianism|antinomium]] rhetorics, and a focus on death-motifs.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546-2547}}

These influences were incorporated in several movements such as the "Secret Cycle" (''gsang skor''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} "Ultra Pith" (''yang tig''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} "Brahmin's tradition" (''bram ze'i lugs''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} the "Space Class Series,"{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} and especially the "Instruction Class series",{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} which culminated in the "Seminal Heart" (''snying thig''), which emerged in the late 11th and early 12th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}}

The "Seminal Heart" belongs to the "Instruction series."{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} The main texts of the instruction series are the so-called [[seventeen tantras]] and the two "seminal heart" collections, namely the ''[[Vima Nyingtik|bi ma snying thig]]'' (''Vima Nyingthig'',{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} "Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra") and the ''mkha' 'gro snying thig'' (''Khandro nyingthig'',{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} "Seminal Heart of the Dakini").{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} The "Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra" is attributed to Vimalamitra, but was largely composed by their discoverers, in the 11th and 12th century.{{sfn|Germano|Gyatso|2001|p=244}} The "Seminal Heart of the Dakini" was produced by Tsultrim Dorje (''Tshul khrims rdo rje'')(1291-1315/17).{{sfn|Germano|Gyatso|2001|p=244}}

The Seminal Heart teachings became the dominant Dzogchen-teachings,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}  but was also criticized by conservative strands within the Nyingma-school.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} The most important Nyingma of the 12th century, Nyangrel Nyingma Özer (''Nyang ral nyi ma 'od zer'', 1136-1204{{refn|group=note|In the eleventh and twelfth centuries there were several competing terma traditions surrounding [[Vimalamitra]], [[Songtsen Gampo]], [[Vairotsana]] and Padmasambhava.{{sfn|Davidson|2005|p=229}} At the end of the 12th century, there was the "victory of the Padmasambhava cult." {{sfn|Davidson|2005|p=278}} Nyangrel Nyima Özer was the principal architect of the Padmasambhava mythos.{{sfn|Gyatso|2006}} The [[Maratika Cave]] is referred to in Tibetan literature from the 12th century. ''[[Kathang Zanglingma]]'', a terma with the biography of Padmasambhava, revealed and transmitted by Nyangrel Nyima Ozer, narrates the "events:  which made the Maratika caves a sacred place for [[Vajrayana]] practitioners.}}
) developed his "Crown Pith" (''spyi ti'') to reassert the older traditions in a new form.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} His writings, which were also presented as revelations, are marked by a relative absence of ''yogini'' tantra influence, and transcend the prescriptions of specific practices, as well as the rhetoric of violence, sexuality and transgression.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}

====Longchenpa's ''Seven Treasuries'' (14th century)====
A pivotal figure in the history of Dzogchen was [[Longchenpa|Longchenpa Rabjampa]] (1308-1364, possibly 1369). He systematized the Seminal Heart teachings{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} and other collections of texts that were circulating at the time in Tibet,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=169}} in the [[Seven Treasuries]] (''mdzod bdun''), the "Trilogy of Natural Freedom" (''rang grol skor gsum''), and the [[Trilogy of Natural Ease]] (''ngal gso skor gsum'').{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} Longchenpa refined the terminology and interpretations, and integrated the Seminal Heart teachings with broader Mahayana literature.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}

Malcolm Smith notes that Longchenpa's ''Tshig don mdzod,'' the [[Seven Treasuries|"Treasury of Subjects,"]]&lt;ref group=web name="MS"&gt;[http://www.atikosha.org/2012/09/a-preliminary-note-on-vimalamitras.html Malcolm Smith, ''A Preliminary Note on Vimalamitra's Aural Lineage '']&lt;/ref&gt; was preceded by several other texts by other authors dealing with the same topics.&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt; Smith mentions the 12th century text "The Eleven Subjects of The Great Perfection"{{refn|group=note|''rdzogs pa chen po tshig don bcu gcig pa bzhugs so''}} by Nyi 'bum. This itself was derived from the eighth and final chapter of the commentary to [[Necklace of Precious Pearls|The String of Pearls Tantra]].&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt;

Nyi 'bum's "Eleven Subjects" is the basis for Longchenpa's "Treasury of Subjects" as well as Rigzin Godem's "The Aural Lineage of Vimalamitra"{{refn|group=note|''rgod kyi ldem 'phru can. dgongs pa zang thal''}}&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt; from the Gongpa Zangthal.&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt;

According to Smith, Nyi 'bum's "Eleven Subjects" provided the outline upon which Longchenpa's "Treasury of Subjects" was based, using the general sequence of citations, and even copying or reworking entire passages.&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt; According to Smith, Nyi 'bum's "Eleven Subjects" was transmitted in a close circle of disciples, with very little outside contact, whereas Longchenpa's "Treasury of Subjects" contains responses to 14th century scholastic objections to Dzogchen.&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt;

====Later termas====
In subsequent centuries more additions followed, including the "Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones"{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} (''kar-gling zhi-khro''){{refn|group=note|''zab-chos zhi-khro dgongs-pa rang-grol''}} by [[Karma Lingpa]],{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=ix}} (1326–1386), popularly known as "Karma Lingpa's Peaceful and Wrathful Ones",{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} which includes the two texts of the ''[[Bardo Thodol|bar-do thos-grol]]'', the "Tibetan Book of the Dead".{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}}{{refn|group=note|The ''bar-do thos-grol'' was translated by Kazi Dawa Samdup (1868-1922), and edited and published by W.Y. Evans-Wenz. This translation was popularized as "the Tibetan Book of the Dead", but contains many mistakes in translation and interpretation.{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}}{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71-115}} See also {{Citation | last =Reynolds | first =John Myrdin | year =1989 | title =Self-Liberation through seeing with naked awareness | publisher =Station Hill Press, Inc.}}}}

Other important termas are "The Penetrating Wisdom" (''dgongs pa zang thal''), revealed by Rinzin Gödem (''rig 'dzin rgod ldem'', 1337-1409);{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} and "The Nucleus of Ati's Profound Meaning" (''rDzogs pa chen po a ti zab don snying po'') by Terdak Lingpa (''gter bdag gling pa'', 1646-1714).{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}

Particularly influential of these later revelations are the works of [[Jigme Lingpa]] (1730–1798).{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} His [[Longchen Nyingthig]] (''klong chen snying thig''), "The Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse"{{sfn|Klein|Wangmo|2010}} or "The Seminal Heart of the Great Matrix",{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} is a hidden teaching from [[Padmasambhava]] which was revealed by Jigme Lingpa.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} The Longchen Nyingthig is said to be the essence of the ''Vima Nyingthig'' and ''Khandro Nyingthig'', the "Early Nyingthig,",{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} and has become known as the "later Nyingthig".{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} It is one of the most widely practiced teachings in the Nyingmapa school.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=xxxv}} [[Patrul Rinpoche]]  (1808–1887) wrote down Jigme Lingpa's pre-liminary practices into a book called ''The Words of My Perfect Teacher''.{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2011}}

====Modern times====
In the early 20th century the first publications on Tibetan Buddhism appeared in the west. An early publication on Dzogchen was the so-called "Tibetan Book of the Dead," edited by W.Y. Evans-Wentz, which became highly popular, but contains many mistakes in translation and interpretation.{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71-115}} Dzogchen has been popularized in the western world by the Tibetan diaspora, starting with the exile of 1959. Well-known teachers include [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] and [[Namkhai Norbu]]. The 14th Dalai Lama is also a qualified Dzogchen teacher.&lt;ref group=web name="GD" /&gt;

[[Chögyam Trungpa]] coined the term ''Maha Ati'' for Dzogchen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trungpa |first=Chögyam |authorlink=Chögyam_Trungpa |title=The Essential Chogyam Trungpa |year=1999 |publisher=Shambhala Publications, Inc |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=1-57062-466-6 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; a master of the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism. He generally preferred to introduce [[Sanskrit]] rather than [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] terms to his students and felt "Maha Ati" was the closest equivalent for Dzogchen, although he acknowledged it was an unorthodox choice. The coinage does not follow the [[sandhi]] rules which would be rendered as mahāti. This serves as an indication of its pedigree as a [[calque]].

===Kagyu and Gelugpa===
Dzogchen has also been taught and practiced in the [[Kagyu]]{{refn|group=note|Wylie: ''bka' brgyud''}} lineage,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=169}} beginning with the Third [[Karmapa]], [[Rangjung Dorje]]  (1284–1339).{{refn|group=note|Wylie: ''rang byung rdo rje''}} 

The [[Drikung]] Kagyu also have a tradition of Dzogchen teachings, the ''yangzab dzogchen''.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Krasser, Tibetan studies, International Association for Tibetan Studies. Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1997 - Tibet (China), page 586&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lozang Gyatso, 5th Dalai Lama]] (1617–1682), [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama]] ( 1876–1933), and [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama]] (present), all [[Gelug]]pas, are also noted Dzogchen masters, although their adoption of the practice of Dzogchen has been a source of controversy among more conservative members of the Gelug tradition.&lt;ref group=web name="GD"&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/messages/dolgyal-shugden/ganden-tripa/the-shugden-affair-i Georges Dreyfus, ''The Shugden Affair: Origins of a Controversy (Part I)''. Official website of the Office of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103131534/http://dalailama.com/messages/dolgyal-shugden/ganden-tripa/the-shugden-affair-i|date=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual background==
[[File:Appearance of sky for weather forecast, Dhaka, Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|The metaphors of sky and spaciousness are often used to describe the nature of mind in Dzogchen.]]
[[Tibetan Buddhism]] developed five main schools. The Madhyamika philosophy obtained a central position in the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]], [[Sakya]] and [[Gelugpa]] schools. The [[Jonang|Jonang school]], which until recently was thought to be extinct, developed a different interpretation of [[Two truths doctrine|ultimate truth]].
Dzogchen texts use unique terminology to describe the Dzogchen view. Some of these terms deal with the different elements and features of the mind. The generic term for consciousness is ''shes pa'', and includes the six sense consciousnesses. Different forms of shes pa include ''ye shes'' ([[Jñāna]], 'pristine consciousness') and ''shes rab'' ([[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]], wisdom).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sam van Schaik]], two significant terms used in Dzogchen literature is the Ground (''gzhi'') and Gnosis (''rig pa''), which represent the "ontological and gnoseological aspects of the nirvanic state" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Dzogchen literature also describes nirvana as the "expanse" (''klong'' or ''dbyings'') or the "true expanse" (''chos dbyings'', Sanskrit: [[Dharmadhatu]]). The term [[Dharmakaya]] is also often associated with these terms in Dzogchen,&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; as explained by [[Tulku Urgyen]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dharmakaya is like space. You cannot say there is any limit to space in any direction. No matter how far you go, you never reach a point where space stops and that is the end of space. Space is infinite in all directions; so is dharmakaya. Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Pema Kunsang; Wellsprings of the Great Perfection The Lives and Insights of the Early Masters, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Malcolm Smith, the Dzogchen view is also based on the Indian Buddhist [[Buddha-nature]] doctrine of the [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 14th Dalai Lama  the Ground is the Buddha-nature, the nature of mind which is emptiness.&lt;ref&gt; The (14th) Dalai Lama (2000), ''Dzogchen: Heart Essence of the Great Perfection'', p.109&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rinpoche Thrangu, [[Rangjung Dorje]] (1284–1339), the third Karmapa Lama (head of the Karma Kagyu) and Nyingma lineage holder, also stated that the Ground is Buddha-nature.{{refn|group=note|Rangjung Dorje also influenced [[Dolpopa]]. In 1321 the famous scholar [[Dolpopa]] (1292-1361) visited [[Tsurphu]] Monastery for the first time and had extensive discussions with Rangjung Dorje about doctrinal issues. It appears that Rangjung Dorje almost certainly influenced the development of some of Dolpopa's theories, possibly including his [[Zhentong]] (''gzhan stong'') method.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Cyrus (1999). ''The Buddha from Dolpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen'', pp. 17, 47–48, 51–52, 61. State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-4191-1}} (hc); {{ISBN|0-7914-4192-X}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Rinpoche Thrangu, "whether one does Mahamudra or Dzogchen practice, buddha nature is the foundation from which both of these meditations develop."&lt;ref&gt;Rinpoche Thrangu (2006), ''On Buddha Essence: A Commentary on Rangjung Dorje's Treatise'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basis===
[[File:Tibetan Dharmacakra.png|thumb|right|180px|The [[gankyil]] symbolizes the inseparability of all of the groups of three in Dzogchen teaching, such as the Base, Path, and Fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Namkhai Norbu; The Crystal and the Way of Light: Sutra, Tantra, and Dzogchen, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A key concept in Dzogchen is the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|'basis', 'ground' or 'primordial state']] (Tibetan: ''gzhi'', Sanskrit: ''sthana''), also called the general ground (''spyi gzhi'') or the original ground (''gdod ma'i gzhi''). The basis is the original state "before realization produced buddhas and nonrealization produced sentient beings". It is atemporal and unchanging and yet it is "noetically potent", giving rise to mind, delusion and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis is also associated with the term [[Dharmata]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Compassion (''[[karuṇā]]'', ''thugs rje''), the "immanent presence of the ground in all appearances".&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text, "An Aspirational prayer for the Ground, Path and Result" defines the three aspects of the basis thus:&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, pp. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

::''Because its essence is empty, it is free from the limit of eternalism''
::''Because its nature is luminous, it is free from the extreme of nihilism''
::''Because its compassion is unobstructed, it is the ground of the manifold manifestations''

Moreover, the basis is associated with the primordial or original [[Buddhahood]], also called [[Samantabhadra]], which is said to be beyond time itself and hence Buddhahood is not something to be gained, but an act of recognizing what is already immanent in all sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, this view of the basis stems from the Indian [[Buddha-nature]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms used to describe the basis include unobstructed (''ma 'gags pa''), universal (''kun khyab'') and omnipresent.&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rigpa===
[[File:Quartz crystal.jpg|thumb|Rigpa is often explained through the metaphor of a crystal or a [[crystal ball]]]]
[[File:Melong Dorje.jpg|thumb|Melong Dorje, wearing a [[Melong]] (mirror), which is a symbol of ''ka dag''.]]
''[[Rigpa]]'' (Sk: ''Vidya'', "knowledge") is a central concept in Dzogchen which means "unconfused knowledge of the basis that is its own state".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 12.
&lt;/ref&gt; It is "reflexively self-aware primordial wisdom,"{{sfn|Klein|Wangyal|2006|p=109}} which is self-reflexively aware of itself as unbounded wholeness.{{sfn|Ray|2001|p=v}}{{refn|group=quote|Descriptions of ''rigpa'':
* Klein and Wangyal: "[...] the essence and base of self-arisen wisdom is the allbase, that primordial open awareness is the base, and that recognition of this base is not separate from the primordial wisdom itself [...] that open awareness is itself authentic and its authenticity is a function of it being aware of, or recognizing itself as, the base [...] The reflexively self-aware primordial wisdom is itself open awareness (''[[rigpa]]''), inalienably one with unbounded wholeness."{{Klein|Wangyal|2006|p=109}}
* Reginald Rey: "...primordial wisdom's recognition of itself as unbounded wholeness [...] the incorruptible mindnature.{{sfn|Ray|2001|p=v}}}} The analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one's true nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections; or like a [[crystal ball]] that takes on the colour of the material on which it is placed without itself being changed. The knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity (which cannot be found by searching nor identified){{sfn|Third Dzogchen Rinpoche|2008|p=152}} is called [[rigpa]].{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=97}}

According to [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]], there are three aspects of rigpa:&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;
# The essential nature of rigpa: primal purity (ka-dag). Rigpa is primordially without stains, both being self-void (''rang-stong'') and other-void (''gzhan-stong'');
# The influencing nature of rigpa: the manner in which rigpa influences others. Rigpa is responsiveness (''thugs-rje'', compassion). It responds effortlessly and spontaneously to others with compassion;
# The functional nature of rigpa: rigpa effortlessly and spontaneously establishes "appearances" (''lhun-grub'').

As Berzin notes, all of the good qualities (''yon-tan'') of a Buddha are already "are innate (''lhan-skyes'') to rigpa, which means that they arise simultaneously with each moment of rigpa, and primordial (''gnyugs-ma''), in the sense of having no beginning.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;

Sam van Schaik translates rigpa as "[[gnosis]]" which he glosses as "a form of awareness aligned to the nirvanic state".&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that other definitions of rigpa include "free from elaborations" (''srpos bral''), "non conceptual" (''rtog med'') and "transcendent of the intellect" (''blo 'das''). It is also often paired with emptiness, as in the contraction ''rig stong'' (gnosis-emptiness).&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

John W. Pettit notes that ''rigpa'' is seen as beyond affirmation and negation, acceptance and rejection, and therefore it is known as "natural" (''ma bcos pa'') and "effortless" (''rtsol med'') once recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Dzogchen is also known as the pinnacle and final destination of all paths.

===Ma Rigpa===
''Ma Rigpa'' ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]) is the opposite of rigpa or knowledge. ''Ma rigpa'' is ignorance or unawareness, the failure to recognize the nature of the basis. An important theme in Dzogchen texts is explaining how ignorance arises from the basis or [[Dharmata]], which is associated with ''ye shes'' or 'pristine consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Automatically arising unawareness (''lhan-skyes ma-rigpa'') exists because the basis is seen having a natural cognitive potentiality and luminosity (''gdangs''), which is the ground for [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]]. When consciousness fails to recognize that all phenomena arise as the creativity (''rtsal'') of the nature of mind and misses its own luminescence or does not "recognize its own face", sentient beings arise instead of Buddhas. As explained by [[Tulku Urgyen]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the case of an ignorant sentient being the mind is called empty cognizance suffused with ignorance (marigpa). The mind of all the Buddhas is called empty cognizance suffused with awareness (rigpa).&lt;ref&gt;Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche; Repeating the Words of the Buddha, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Vimalamitra]]'s ''Illuminating Lamp'', delusion arises because sentient beings "lapse towards external mentally apprehended objects". This external grasping is then said to produce sentient beings out of [[dependent origination]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This dualistic conceptualizing process which leads to samsara is termed [[Manas-vijnana|manas]] as well as "awareness moving away from the ground".&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanence and Distinction===
[[File:Dzong.jpg|thumb|The [[Garuda]] is used as a symbol of primordial nature, which is already completely perfect, since this mythological animal is said to be born fully grown.&lt;ref&gt;Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, page 109.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to Sam van Schaik, there is a certain tension in Dzogchen thought (as in other forms of Buddhism) between the idea that [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]] are immanent within each other and yet are still different. In texts such as the [[Longchen Nyingtig]] for example, the basis and rigpa are presented as being "intrinsically innate to the individual mind".&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Great Perfection Tantra of the Expanse of Samantabhadra’s Wisdom'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you think that he who is called “the heart essence of all buddhas, the Primordial Lord, the noble Victorious One, Samantabhadra” is contained in a mindstream separate from the ocean-like realm of sentient beings, then this is a nihilistic view in which samsara and nirvana remain unconnected.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, [[Longchenpa]] (12th century), writes in his ''Illuminating Sunlight'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every type of experiential content belonging to samsara and nirvana has, as its very basis, a natural state that is a spontaneously present buddha—a dimension of purity and perfection, that is perfect by nature. This natural state is not created by a profound buddha nor by a clever sentient being. Independent of causality, causes did not produce it and conditions can not make it perish. This state is one of self-existing wakefulness, defying all that words can describe, in a way that also transcends the reach of the intellect and thoughts. It is within the nonarising vastness of such a basic natural state that all phenomena belonging to samsara and nirvana are, essentially and without any exception, a state of buddha—purity and perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Pema Kunsang; Wellsprings of the Great Perfection The Lives and Insights of the Early Masters, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This lack of difference between these two states, their [[non-dual]] (''advaya'') nature, corresponds with the idea that change from one to another doesn't happen due to an ordinary process of causation but is an instantaneous and perfect 'self-recognition' (''rang ngo sprod'') of what is already innately (''lhan-skyes'') there.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; According to John W. Pettit, this idea has its roots in Indian texts such as [[Nagarjuna]]'s [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]], which states that samsara and nirvana are not separate and that there is no difference between the "doer", the "going" and the "going to" (i.e. the ground, path and fruit).&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, John W.; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 78&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this emphasis on immanence, Dzogchen texts do indicate a subtle difference between terms associated with delusion (''kun gzhi'' or ''alaya'', ''sems'' or mind) and terms associated with full enlightenment (''dharmakaya'' and ''rigpa'').&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alaya and [[Ālayavijñāna]] are associated with karmic imprints (''vasana'') of the mind and with mental afflictions (''klesa''). The "alaya for habits" is the basis (''gzhi'') along with ignorance (''marigpa'') which includes all sorts of obscuring habits and grasping tendencies.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;

These terms stem from Indian [[Yogacara]] texts, such as the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harmonisation with Madhyamaka===
Koppl notes that although later Nyingma authors such as [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] attempted to harmonize the view of Dzogchen with [[Madhyamaka]], the earlier Nyingma author [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo]] did not.{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}{{refn|group=quote|Heidi Koppl: "Unlike Mipham, Rongzom did not attempt to harmonize the view of Mantra or Dzogchen with Madhyamaka."{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}}} Rongzom held that the views of sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of tantra.{{sfn|Koppl|2008|p=ch4}}{{refn|group=quote|Heidi Koppl: "By now we have seen that Rongzom regards the views of the Sutrayana as inferior to those of Mantra, and he underscores his commitment to the purity of all phenomena by criticizing the Madhyamaka objectification of the authentic relative truth."{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}}} In contrast, the 14th Dalai Lama, in his book Dzogchen, &lt;ref&gt;the Dalai Lama, Dzogchen p. 158 (Snow Lion 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that Madhyamaka and Dzogchen come down to the same point. The view of reality obtained through Madhyamaka philosophy and the Dzogchen view of Rigpa can be regarded  as identical. With regard to the practice in these traditions, however, at the initial stages there do seem certain differences in practice and emphasis.

==Teachings and practice==
Dzogchen is a secret teaching emphasizing the rigpa view. It is a secret from those who are incapable of receiving it. The student can properly receive it with direct in-person realization under a guru's instruction. It is accessible to all; however, it is generally considered an advanced practice because safety from generating an incorrect view necessitates preliminary practices with a teacher's empowerment. {{sfn|Ingram|1993|}}

Dzogchen teachings emphasize naturalness, spontaneity and simplicity.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} Although Dzogchen is portrayed as being distinct from tantra, it has incorporated many concepts and practices from tantric Buddhism.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} It embraces a widely varied array of traditions, that range from a systematic rejection of all tantric practices, to a full incorporation of tantric practices.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}}

===Three principles===
The [[Vima Nyingtik|"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra"]] epitomized the Dzogchen teaching in three principles, known as the Three Statements of Garab Dorje (Tsik Sum Né Dek). They give in short the development a student has to undergo:
#Direct introduction to one's own nature (Tib. ''ngo rang thog tu sprod pa''), namely ''rigpa'';
#Not remaining in doubt concerning this unique state (Tib. ''thag gcig thog tu bcad pa'');
#Continuing to remain in this state (Tib. ''gdeng grol thog tu bca' pa'').

In subsequent centuries these teachings were expanded, most notably in the [[Longchen Nyingthig]] by [[Jigme Lingpa]] (1730-1798).{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} His systematisation is the most widely used Dzogchen-teaching nowadays.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}

===Structure of practice===


====Anthology of practices====
The dzogchen teachings consist of vast anthologies of practices presented as preliminary and auxiliary contemplative techniques, including standard Buddhist meditation techniques and tantra practices which have been integrated into Dzogchen.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547, 2548}}

Longchenpa, in "Finding Comfort and Ease in Meditation" (''bsam gtan ngal gso''), the second text of the [[Trilogy of Natural Ease]] (''ngal gso skor gsum''),{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=254}} and its auto-commentary the ''Shing rta rnam dag'',{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}} uses the standard triad of meditative experiences (''nyams'') to structure the text and the practices: bliss (''bde ba''), radiance/clarity (''gsal ba''), and non-conceptuality (''mi rtog pa'').{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=254}} This triad is also presented as preliminaries, main practice, and concluding phase.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}} The preliminaries are further divided into:
* the general preliminaries on impermanence and renunciation of cyclic existence, which corresponds to the [[Therevada]]; 
* the special preliminaries on compassion and the engendering of compassionate motivation, which corresponds with the [[Mahayana]]; 
* the supreme preliminaries, consisting of the generation phase, perfection phase and Guru yoga.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}}

This systematisation contextualized the system in terms of Tibetan Buddhism, while simultaneously relegating these preliminaries to a lower status, while emphasizing their necessity.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}} Longchenpa couples meditation with Guru yoga in these preliminaries.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}}

The teachings based on the ''Longchen Nyingthig'' are divided into preliminary practices and main practices.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|1994}} Alexander Berzin explicitly mentions meditative practices as a preliminary of the main practice.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/dzogchen-advanced/the-major-facets-of-dzogchen Alexander Berzin, ''The Major Facets of Dzogchen'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|2001}}{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=81}}{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2011}}

====General overview====
A general overview gives the following:
* Preliminary practices:
** Initial empowerment: according to Tsoknyi Rinpoche, Dzogchen practice starts with receiving empowerment;{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=4}} 
** ''[[Ngondro]]'', general or outer, and special or inner preliminary practices, which prepare one for the main practice;
* Great Perfection practice:
** Further empowerment:  receiving an empowerment (''dbang'', initiation) and keeping the vows conferred at that time. This activates our Buddha-mind, by consciously generating a state of mind that is accompanied by understanding;
** Supreme preliminary practices: Jigme Lingpa's ''ru shan'' and ''sbyong ba''; practice of the three samadhis;{{refn|group=note|According to Berzin, this is the equivalent of the generation stage, as emphasized in Mahayoga.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;}}
** Main practice, which consists of:&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Ron Garry: "The practice is that of Cutting through Solidity (khregs chod), which is related to primordial purity (ka dag); and Direct Vision of Reality (thod rgal), which is related to spontaneous presence (Ihun grub)."{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|2005|p=296}}}}
*** ''Trekchö'', "break through",&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt; recognising ''rigpa'';
*** ''Tögal'' (''thod rgal''), "leap ahead",&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt; spontaneous presence"{{sfn|Rinpoche Dzogchen Ponlop|2003}}{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004}} which is the stabilisation of ''rigpa'' and compassionate action.
** Concluding phase

===Preliminary practices===
The ''[[Ngondro]]'', preliminary practices, consist of outer preliminaries and inner preliminaries.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;

====Initial empowerment====
According to Tsoknyi Rinpoche, before one starts with the Dzogchen-practices [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] is necessary. This plants the "seeds of realization" within the present body, speech and mind.{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=4}} Empowerment "invests us with the ability to be liberated into the already present ground."{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=5}} The practices bring the seeds to maturation, resulting in the qualities of enlightened body, speech and mind.{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=6}}

====General or outer preliminaries====
The outer preliminaries are as follows:&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;
* appreciating our precious human rebirths; 
* contemplating death and impermanence; 
* contemplating the faults of samsara; 
* contemplating karmic cause and effect and the possibility of gaining liberation from it; 
* contemplating the benefits of liberation; 
* building and maintaining a good relation with a spiritual teacher;

====Special or inner preliminaries====
The inner preliminaries are as follows:&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt; 
* taking refuge; 
* cultivating [[bodhichitta]] and the "far-reaching attitudes" (Tib. ''phar-byin'', Skt. ''[[paramita]]''); 
* practicing [[Vajrasattva]] recitation, for purification of the gross obstacles; 
* practicing [[mandala]] offerings, in which we develop generosity and strengthen our enlightenment-building network of positive force; 
* making  ''kusali'' offerings of ''[[chöd]]'', in which we imagine cutting up and giving away our ordinary bodies; 
* practicing [[Guru Yoga]], in which we recognize and focus on [[Buddha-nature]] in our spiritual mentors and in ourselves;

===Great perfection practices===

====Empowerment====
According to Berzin, receiving [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] (''dbang'', initiation) and keeping the vows conferred at that time is a necessary step to move on to the main practice. This activates our Buddha-mind, by consciously generating a state of mind that is accompanied by understanding. Alexander Berzin further notes:&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;
* "In Gelug, the conscious experience is some level of blissful awareness of voidness."
* "In the non-Gelug systems, it is focus on Buddha-nature in our tantric masters and in us, with some level of understanding of Buddha-nature."
* "In dzogchen, it is focus specifically on the basis three aspects of rigpa as Buddha-nature factors in our tantric masters and in us."

====Supreme preliminary practices====
With the influence of tantra, and the systematisations of Longchenpa, the main Dzogchen practices came to be preceded by preliminary (meditative) practices.{{sfn|Germano|1994}}

In the text "Finding Comfort and Ease in the Nature of Mind" (''sems nyid ngal gso''), which is part of the [[Trilogy of Natural Ease]] (''ngal gso skor gsum''), Longchenpa arranges 141 contemplative practices, split into three sections: exoteric Buddhism (92), tantra (92), and the Great Perfection (27).{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=251}} Most of these practices are "technique-free."{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=254}} The typical Buddhist meditations are relegated to the preliminary phase, while the main meditative practices are typical "direct" approaches.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=262}}

Longchenpa includes the perfection phase techniques of channels, winds and nuclei into the main and concluding phases.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=256}} The "concluding phase" includes discussions of new contemplative techniques, which aid the practice of the main phase.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=257}}

The Great Perfection practices as described by Jigme Lingpa consist of preliminary practices, specific for the Great Perfection practice, and the main practice.{{sfn|Schaik|2004b|p=98}}

=====Jigme Lingpa – ''ru shan'' and ''sbyong ba''=====
[[Image:Nyingma Jigme Lingpa.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jigme Lingpa]]]] 
Jigme Lingpa mentions two kinds of preliminary practices, '''khor 'das ru shan dbye ba'',{{refn|group=note|Korday Rushen; {{bo|t=འཁོར་འདས་རུ་ཤན|w='khor 'das ru shan}}}} "making a gap between samsara and nirvana,"{{sfn|Schaik|2004B|p=98}}{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=81}}  and ''sbyong ba''.{{sfn|Schaik|2004B|p=98}}

''Ru shan'' is a series of visualisation and recitation exercises,{{sfn|Schaik|2004B|p=98}} derived from the Seminal Heart tradition.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=262}} The name reflects the dualism of the distinctions between mind and insight, [[Eight Consciousnesses|ālaya]] and [[dharmakāya]].{{sfn|Schaik|2004B|p=98}} Longchenpa places this practice in the "enhancement" (''bogs dbyung'') section of his concluding phase. It describes a practice "involving going to a solitary spot and acting out whatever comes to your mind."{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=262}}{{refn|group=note|See {{Citation | last =Germano | first =David | chapter =The Elements, Insanity, and Lettered Subjectivity | editor-last =Lopez, Jr. | editor-first =Donald | year =1997| title =The Religions of Tibet in Practice | publisher =Princeton University Press}}.}}{{refn|group=quote|John Pettit , in ''Tricycle Magazine'', winter 1997: "David Germano [...] describes unusual practices of the Great Perfection [...] Germano introduces the "differentiation of Samsara and Nirvana," a form of meditative warm-up exercise that has not, to my knowledge, ever been discussed so explicitly. This practice is unusual by any standard, Tibetan or Western, except perhaps for those who have experimented with [[Stanislav Grof]]'s Holotropic Breathwork or Primal Scream Therapy. (See also [[Ego death]]). In the exercise, a practitioner jumps, prowls, and howls like a wolf and imitates its thought patterns, or pretends to be a mass murderer and then suddenly switches to the outlook of a self-sacrificing saint. "In short," Germano writes, "one lets oneself go crazy physically, verbally and mentally in a flood of diverse activity, so that by this total surrender to the play of images and desire across the mirroring surface of one's being, one gradually comes to understand the very nature of the mirror itself."&lt;ref group=web name="TM"&gt;[http://www.tricycle.com/reviews/the-religions-tibet-practice John Pettit, ''Review of "The Religions of Tibet in Practice"'', TriCycle Magazine, Winter 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Sbyong ba'' is a variety of teachings for training (''sbyong ba'') the body, speech and mind. The training of the body entails instructions for physical posture. The training of speech mainly entails recitation, especially of the syllable ''[[Om mani padme hum|hūm]]''. The training of the mind is a Madhyamaka-like analysis of the concept of the mind, to make clear that mind cannot arise from anywhere, reside anywhere,or go anywhere. They are in effect an establishment of [[Sunyata|emptiness]] by means of the intellect.{{sfn|Schaik|2004B|p=98-99}}

=====Meditative practices=====
According to Alexander Berzin, after the preliminary practices follow meditative practices, in which the practitioners works with the three aspects of rigpa.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Berzin also uses the term "Mahayoga Stage" for this stage.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;}}

The three samadhis (ting-nge-’dzin gsum) are practiced, in which the practitioners works, in the imagination, with the three aspects of rigpa:
# "Basis samadhi" on the authentic nature (''gzhi de-bzhin-nyid-kyi ting-nge-’dzin'', ''de-ting''): the meditator is absorbed in an approximation of rigpa’s primal purity. It is a state of open receptiveness (''klong''), which is the basis for being able to help others as a Buddha;
# "Path samadhi illuminating everywhere" (''lam kun-snang-ba’i ting-nge-’dzin'', ''snang-ting''): being moved by compassion, the meditator is absorbed in an approximation of rigpa’s responsiveness;
# "Resultant samadhi on the cause" (''‘bras-bu-rgyu’i-ting-nge-’dzin'', ''rgyu-ting''): the meditator is absorbed in the visualization of a seed-syllable, which brings the result of actually helping limited beings.

=====''Semdzin''=====
[[File:Dzogchen A.png|thumb|right|White Tibetan letter Ah]]
The Dzogchen meditation practices also include a series of exercises known as ''Semdzin'' (''sems dzin''),{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=81}} which literally means "to hold the mind" or "to fix mind."{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=81}} They include a whole range of methods, including fixation, breathing, and different body postures, all aiming to bring one into the state of contemplation.{{sfn|Norbu|2000|p=130}}{{refn|group=note|Longchenpa divides them into three categories of seven exercises.{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=81}} Exercises in the first category include
{{quote|"[F]ixating on a white Tibetan letter A on the tip of one's nose. Linking the letter with one's breathing, it goes out into space with each exhalation and returns to the tip of the nose with each inhalation. This fixation inhibits the arising of extraneous thoughts [...] however, the second exercise in the same category involves the sounding of the syllable PHAT! which instantly shatters one's thoughts and attachments. Symbolically, the two parts of the syllable indicate the two aspects of enlightenment, that is, PHA signifies Means (''thabs'') and TA signifies Wisdom (''shes rab'')."{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=81}}}}

According to Reynolds, it is this specific ''Semdzin'' practice which was used by Patrul Rinpoche to provide a direct introduction to the knowledge of ''rigpa''. It temporarily blocks the flow of thought, and brings us temporarily in a state of emptiness and clarity.{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=82}}}}

====Main practice====

=====Trekchö=====
The practice of Trekchö (''khregs chod''), "cutting through solidity",{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|2005|p=296}} reflects the earliest developments of Dzogchen, with its admonition against practice.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{refn|group=note|Compare [[Karma Chagme]], who associates Trekchö with [[Semde]].{{sfn|Karma Chagme|Gyatrul Rinpoche|Wallace|1998|p=180}} He further equates Trekchö with [[Mahāmudrā]],{{sfn|Karma Chagme|Gyatrul Rinpoche|Wallace|1998|p=180}}}} In this practice one first identifies, and then sustains recognition of, one's own innately pure, empty awareness.{{sfn|Dahl|2009|p=255}}{{sfn|Mackenzie Stewart|2014}}{{refn|group=quote|See also:
* The main trekchö instructions in the [[Lamrim Yeshe Nyingpo]]: "This instant freshness, unspoiled by the thoughts of the three times; You directly see in actuality by letting be in naturalness."{{sfn|Schmidt|2001|p=77}}
* [[Tsoknyi Rinpoche|Drubwang Tsoknyi Rinpoche]]: "''Trekchö'' is the thorough cut of cutting through, cutting the obscurations completely to pieces, like slashing through them with a knife. So the past thought has ceased, the future thought hasn't yet arisen, and the knife is cutting through this stream of present thought. But one doesn't keep hold of this knife either; one lets the knife go, so there is a gap.  When you cut through again and again in this way, the string of thought falls to pieces. If you cut a rosary in a few places, at some point it doesn't work any longer.{{sfn|Schmidt|2002|p=38}}
* Namkhai Norbu: "Once one has arrived at contemplation through any method, one has to continue in it, and working to bring this continuation into every action and situation is called ''Tregchöd'', which literally means "(spontaneous cutting of tension," in thes ense that as soon as the primordial state manifests and dualism is thus overcome, on einstantly falls into a state of total relaxation, like a bundle of sticks, that, having been bound together, falls loosely into a total relaxed pattern as soon as the string binding it has been cut."{{sfn|Norbu|2000|p=130}}}} Students receive [[pointing-out instruction]] (''sems khrid'', ''ngos sprod'') in which a teacher introduces the student to the nature of his or her mind.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} According to Tsoknyi Rinpoche, these instructions are received after the preliminary practices, though there's also a tradition to give them before the preliminary practices.{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=7}}{{refn|group=quote|Tsoknyi Rinpoche: "As for my own personal experience, when I underwent the ngondro training, I had already received some Dzogchen instructions. The awakened state of rigpa had been pointed out, and I had a lukewarm certainty about what it was. But the ngondro helped me progress.{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=7}}"}}{{refn|group=quote|Some examples of ''Trekchö'':
* John Myrdhin Reynolds: "[T]he proper procedure is to introduce the practitioner directly to the state of contemplation by way of first dissolving one's mental activities (''sems kyi yal-ba ngo-sprod-pa''). If one observes the mind and searches for where a thought (''rnam-rtog'') arises, where it remains, and where it goes, no matter how much one researches and investigates this, one will find nothing. It is this very "unfindability" (''mi rnyed'') of the arising, the abiding, and the passing away of thoughts which is the greatest of all finds. Thoughts do not arise from anywhere (''byung sa med''), they do not remain anywhere (''gnas sa med''), and they do not go anywhere ('''gro sa med''). They do not arise from within the body, nor do they arise from outside the body. They are truly without any root or source (''ghzi med rsta bral''). Like the clouds in the sky, they arise only to dissolve again. Thoughts arise out of the state of emptiness and return again into this state of emptiness, which represents pure potentiality. We only have to observe our mind to discover this for ourselves. And this shunyata, this state of emptiness, is in fact the very essence of the mind (''sems kyi ngo-bo stong-pa nyid'').{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=75}}
* [[Sogyal Rinpoche]]: "Nyoshul Lungtok, who later became one of the greatest Dzogchen masters of recent times, followed his teacher Patrul Rinpoche for about eighteen years. During all that time, they were almost inseparable. Nyoshul Lungtok studied and practiced extremely diligently, and accumulated a wealth of purification, merit, and practice; he was ready to recognize the Rigpa, but had not yet had the final introduction. Then, one famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery. It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: "Did you say you do not know the essence of Mind?" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.&lt;br&gt;"There's nothing to it really," Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, "My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father." Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side. Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, "Do you see the stars up there in the sky?"&lt;br&gt;"Yes."&lt;br&gt;"Do you hear the dogs barking in Dzogchen Monastery?"&lt;br&gt;"Yes."&lt;br&gt;"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?"&lt;br&gt;"Yes."&lt;br&gt;"Well, the nature of Dzogchen is this: simply this."&lt;br&gt;Nyoshul Lungtok tells us what happened then: "At that instant, I arrived at a certainty of realization from within. I had been liberated from the fetters of 'it is' and 'it is not.' I had realized the primordial wisdom, the naked union of emptiness and intrinsic awareness. I was introduced to this realization by his blessing, as the great Indian master Saraha said: He in whose heart the words of the master have entered, Sees the truth like a treasure in his own palm."{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|1994|p=160}}}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ramana Maharshi#Death experience (1896)|Ramana Maharshi's awakening]], [[Kensho#Spontaneous kenshō|spontaneous kenshō]], and [[Subitism|sudden insight]]}}

Jigme Lingpa divides the trekchö practice into ordinary and extraordinary instructions.{{sfn|Schaik|2004b|p=99}} The ordinary section comprises the rejection of the ''all is mind – mind is empty'' approach, which is a conceptual establishment of emptiness.{{sfn|Schaik|2004b|p=99}} Jigme Lingpa's extraordinary instructions give the instructions on the breakthrough proper, which consist of the setting out of the view (''lta ba''), the doubts and errors that may occur in practice, and some general instructions thematized as "the four ways of being at leisure" (''cog bzhag'').{{sfn|Schaik|2004b|p=99}} The "setting out of the view" tries to point the reader toward a direct recognition of rigpa, insisting upon the immanence of rigpa, and dismissive of meditation and effort.).{{sfn|Schaik|2004b|p=99-100}} Insight leads to ''nyamshag'', "being present in the state of clarity and emptiness".{{sfn|Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|2001|p=87}}

=====Tögal=====
''Tögal'' (''thod rgal'') means "spontaneous presence",{{sfn|Rinpoche Dzogchen Ponlop|2003}}{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004}} "direct crossing",{{sfn|Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche|1994|p=44}} "direct crossing of spontaneous presence",{{sfn|Schmidt|2002}} or "direct transcendence.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} The literal meaning is "to proceed directly to the goal without having to go through intermediate steps."{{sfn|Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche|1994|p=224}}

''Tögal'' is also called "the practice of vision",&lt;ref group=web name="OTZZ"&gt;[http://www.wisdom-books.com/ProductExtract.asp?PID=14663 Extract from ''Oral Tradition from Zhang Zhung. An Introduction to the Bonpo Dzogchen Teachings of the Oral Tradition from Zhang Zhung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181933/http://www.wisdom-books.com/ProductExtract.asp?PID=14663 |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the practice of the Clear Light (''[[Ösel (yoga)|od-gsal]]'')".&lt;ref group=web name="OTZZ" /&gt; It entails progressing through the [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Four_visions Four Visions].{{sfn|Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche|1994|p=38}} The practices engage the subtle body of psychic channels, winds and drops (''rtsa rlung thig le'').{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} The practices aim at generating a spontaneous flow of luminous, rainbow-colored images that gradually expand in extent and complexity.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}

''Tögal'' is an innovative practice,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} and reflects the innovations of the  Manngede cycles in Dzogchen, and the incorporation of complex tantric techniques and doctrines.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} They are an adaptation of Tantric "perfection phase" techniques (''rdzogs rim''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} as outlined in the early-eleventh-century Indian Tantric ''[[Kalachakra]]'' cycle, "The Wheel of Time",{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} which was probably  a direct inspiration for the Seminal Heart.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}

====Rainbow body====
Lhun grub practice may lead to full enlightenment and the self-liberation of the human body into a [[rainbow body]]{{refn|group=note|Wylie: 'ja' lus, pronounced Jalü}} at the moment of death,{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=204}} when all the fixation and grasping has been exhausted.{{sfn|Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche|1994|p=233}} It is a nonmaterial body of light with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one's compassion.{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|2005|p=296}}{{sfn|Matthieu|2001|p=153}}{{sfn|Ray|2001|p=323}} It is a manifestation of the [[Sambhogakāya]].{{sfn|Matthieu|2001|p=153}}

Some exceptional practitioners such as [[Padmasambhava]] and [[Vimalamitra]] are held to have realized a higher type of rainbow body without dying. Having completed the four visions before death, the individual focuses on the lights that surround the fingers. His or her physical body self-liberates into a nonmaterial body of light (a [[Sambhogakāya]]) with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one's compassion.{{sfn|Matthieu|2001|p=153}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">'''Epidoseis''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπιδόσεις}}) was a form of non-compulsory, non-tax financial giving in [[ancient Greece]].

These epidoseis were voluntary contributions, either in money, arms, or ships, which were made by the citizens of [[Athens]] in order to meet the extraordinary demands of the state. When the expenses of the state were greater than its revenue, it was usual for the [[prytaneis]] to summon an assembly of the people -- ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]'' -- and, after explaining the necessities of the state, to call upon the citizens to contribute according to their means.

Those who were willing to contribute then rose and said what they would give; while those who were unwilling to give anything, remained silent or retired privately from the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Alcibiades]]'' 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Phocion]]'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meid"&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''[[Against Meidias]]'' pp. 566-567. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophrastus]], ''Characters'' 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Athen. iv. p. 168, e&lt;/ref&gt; The names of those who had promised to contribute, together with the amount of their contributions, were written on tablets, which were placed before the statues of the [[Eponymous archon|Eponymi]], where they remained until the amount was paid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaeus]], ''On Dicaeogenes'' p. 111, ed. Reisk&lt;/ref&gt;

These voluntary contributions were frequently very large. Sometimes the more wealthy citizens voluntarily undertook a "trierarchy", or the expenses of equipping a [[trireme]].&lt;ref name="meid"/&gt; We read that the freedman [[Pasion]] furnished 1000 shields, together with five triremes, which he equipped at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] ''Against Stephanus'' p. 1127. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chrysippus]] presented a talent to the state, when [[Alexander the Great]] moved against Thebes during the [[Battle of Thebes]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] ''Against Phormio'' p. 918. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristophanes, son of Nicophemus]] gave 30,000 [[drachma]]e for an expedition against [[Cyprus]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], ''On the Property of Aristophanes'' p. 644&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charidemus]] and [[Diotimus]], two commanders, made a free gift of 800 shields;&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''De Corona'' p. 265. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and similar instances of liberality are mentioned by German classical scholar [[August Böckh]], from whom the preceding examples have been taken.&lt;ref&gt;[[August Böckh]], ''The Public Economy of Athens''  pp. 586, 587, 2nd. ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erica Chenoweth''' (born April 22, 1980) is an American [[political scientist]] as well as a faculty member and [[Ph.D.]] program co-director at the [[University of Denver|University of Denver's]] [[Josef Korbel School of International Studies]].&lt;ref name=DUFaculty&gt;{{cite web|title=Erica Chenoweth Faculty Page|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/faculty/chenoweth.html|work=du.edu/korbel|publisher=University of Denver|accessdate=1 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chenoweth is also the Director of the university's Program on Terrorism and Insurgency Research and a researcher at the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo|Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO)]]. Within the [[international relations]] community, she is known for her work on [[civil resistance]] movements and political violence.

==Education==
Chenoweth received her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] at the [[University of Dayton]], followed by an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. She previously taught at [[Wesleyan University]] until 2012 and completed postdoctoral fellowships at [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=DUFaculty/&gt; Chenoweth joined the University of Denver faculty in 2012.&lt;ref name=WIAR&gt;{{cite web|title=Another Honor for the University of Denver’s Erica Chenoweth|url=http://www.wiareport.com/2012/12/another-honor-for-the-university-of-denvers-erica-chenoweth/|work=WIAReport|publisher=Women in Academia Report|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Maria J. Stephan of the [[Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], Chenoweth co-wrote the book, ''Why Civil Resistance Works''.  Chenoweth and Stephan organized an international team of scholars in identifying all the major violent and nonviolent governmental change efforts of the twentieth century.  They translated the results into a theory of civil resistance and its success rate for political change compared to violent resistance.&lt;ref name=InsideHigerEd&gt;{{cite web|title=Success of Nonviolent Revolution|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/audio/2012/11/06/success-nonviolent-revolution|work=Academic Minute|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their team identified over 200 violent revolutions and over 100 nonviolent campaigns.  Twenty-six percent of the violent revolutions were successful, while 53 percent of the nonviolent campaigns succeeded.  Moreover, [[v:Effective defense#Nonviolence builds democracy; violence doesn't|looking at change in democracy]] ([[Polity data series|Polity IV scores]]) indicates that nonviolence promotes democracy while violence promotes tyranny.

In addition every campaign that got active participation from at least 3.5 percent of the population succeeded, and many succeeded with less.  All the campaigns that achieved that threshold were nonviolent;  no violent campaign achieved that threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chenoweth|first1=Erica|title=My Talk at TEDxBoulder: Civil Resistance and the “3.5% Rule”|url=https://rationalinsurgent.com/2013/11/04/my-talk-at-tedxboulder-civil-resistance-and-the-3-5-rule/|website=RationalInsurgent.org|publisher=Rational Insurgent|accessdate=2016-10-10|date=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 ''Why Civil Resistance Works'' won the [[American Political Science Association|American Political Science Association's]] [[Woodrow Wilson Foundation|Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award]] for "the best book published in the U.S. during the previous calendar year on government, politics, or international affairs."&lt;ref name=APSA&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award Recipient|url=http://www.apsanet.org/content_58660.cfm|work=Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award|publisher=American Political Science Association|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chenoweth, along with Stephan, also won the 2013 [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] for Ideas for Improving the World Order.&lt;ref name=Grawemeyer&gt;{{cite web|title=Pair win world order prize for civil resistance study|url=http://grawemeyer.org/news-updates/pair-win-world-order-prize-for-civil-resistance-study|work=The Grawemeyer Awards|publisher=University of Louisville|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past winners of this award include [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Robert Keohane]].&lt;ref name=GrawePrevious&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous Winners - University Of Louisville Grawemeyer Award For Ideas Improving World Order |url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/ |work=The Grawemeyer Awards |publisher=University of Louisville |accessdate=28 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528135353/http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners |archivedate=28 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' named Chenoweth one of the [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|Top 100 Global Thinkers]] of the year "for proving [[Gandhi]] right," noting her work on providing evidence for the efficacy of nonviolent political movements.&lt;ref name=FP100&gt;{{cite news|title=Erica Chenoweth: For proving Gandhi right|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013_global_thinkers/public/chenoweth|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Erica also won the [[Karl Deutsch Award (International Relations)]] for being "judged to have made the most significant contribution to the study of International Relations and Peace Research by the means of publication."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prio.no/News/Item/?x=1835&lt;/ref&gt;

Chenoweth was also awarded the [[International Studies Association]] award for "Best Group Blog of the Year". It was awarded the blog "Violence @ a Glance", which she founded with [[Barbara F. Walter]].

'''Escapism''' is the avoidance of unpleasant, boring, arduous, scary, or banal aspects of [[Everyday life|daily life]].&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/escapism&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as a term to define the actions people take to help relieve persistent feelings of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or general [[sadness]].

==Perceptions==
Entire industries have sprung up to foster a growing tendency of people to remove themselves from the rigors of daily life – especially into the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;G. Kainer, ''Grace and the Great Controversy'' (2010) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Many activities that are normal parts of a healthy existence (e.g., eating, sleeping, exercise, sexual activity) can also become avenues of escapism when taken to extremes or out of proper context; and as a result the word "escapism" often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that escapists are unhappy, with an inability or unwillingness to connect meaningfully with the world and to take necessary action.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baggett et al, ''C. S. Lewis as Philosopher'' (2009) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the [[OED]] defined escapism as "The tendency to seek, or the practice of seeking, distraction from what normally has to be endured".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in T. A. Shipley, ''The Road to Middle-Earth'' (1992) p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many challenge the idea that escapism is fundamentally and exclusively negative. [[C. S. Lewis]] was fond of humorously remarking that the usual enemies of escape were jailers;&lt;ref&gt;G. Kainer, ''Grace and the Great Controversy'' (2010) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and considered that used in moderation escapism could serve both to refresh and to expand the imaginative powers.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baggett et al, ''C. S. Lewis as Philosopher'' (2009) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] argued for escapism in fantasy literature as the creative expression of reality within a secondary (imaginative) world, (but also emphasised that they required an element of horror in them, if they were not to be 'mere escapism').&lt;ref&gt;T. F. Nicolay, ''Tolkien and the Modernists'' (2014) p. 79 and p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Pratchett]] considered that the twentieth century had seen the development over time of a more positive view of escapist literature.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Pratchett &amp; Stephen Briggs, ''The Discworld Companion'' (2012) p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from literature, [[music]] has been seen and valued as an artistic medium of escape, too.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Der Welt abhanden kommen. Über musikalischen Eskapismus''. In: ''Merkur'' 66 (2012), no. 2, pp. 135–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological escapes==
[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] considered a quota of escapist [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] a necessary element in the life of humans: "[T]hey cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction they can extort from reality. 'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions', [[Theodor Fontane]] once said".&lt;ref&gt;S, Freud, ''Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL1) p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; His followers saw rest and wish fulfilment (in small measures) as useful tools in adjusting to traumatic upset;&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946), p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; while later psychologists have highlighted the role of vicarious distractions in shifting unwanted [[Mood (psychology)|moods]], especially anger and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if permanent residence is taken up in some such [[John Steiner (psychoanalyst)#Psychic retreat|psychic retreats]], the results will often be negative and even pathological.&lt;ref&gt;R. Britton, ''Belief and Imagination'' (2003) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs cause some forms of escapism which can occur when certain mind-altering drugs are taken which make the participant forget the reality of where they are or what they are meant to be doing.

==Escapist societies==
Some social critics warn of attempts by the powers that control society to provide means of escapism instead of actually bettering the condition of the people – what [[Juvenal]] called “bread and the [[Gladiatorial games|games]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''The Sixteen Satires'' (1982) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Escapist societies appear often in literature. ''[[The Time Machine]]'' depicts the Eloi, a lackadaisical, insouciant race of the future, and the horror their happy lifestyle belies. The novel subtly criticizes [[capitalism]], or at least classism, as a means of escape. Escapist societies are common in dystopian novels; for example, in the ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' society, television and "seashell radios" are used to escape a life with strict regulations and the threat of a forthcoming war. In science fiction media escapism is often depicted as an extension of social evolution, as society becomes detached from physical reality and processing into a virtual one, examples include the virtual world of Oz in the 2009 Japanese animated science fiction anime ''[[Summer Wars]]'' and the game "Society" in the 2009 American science fiction film ''[[Gamer (2009 film)|Gamer]]'', a play on the real-life [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] game ''[[Second Life]]''. Other escapist societies in literature include ''The Reality Bug'' by D. J. McHale, where an entire civilization leaves their world in ruin while they 'jump' into their perfect realities. The aim of the anti hero becomes a quest to make their realities seemingly less perfect in order to regain control over their dying planet.

Social philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]] wrote that utopias and images of fulfilment, however regressive they might be, also included an impetus for a radical social change. According to Bloch, social justice could not be realized without seeing things fundamentally differently. Something that is mere "daydreaming" or "escapism" from the viewpoint of a technological-rational society might be a seed for a new and more humane social order, as it can be seen as an "immature, but honest substitute for revolution".

==Escape scale==

The Norwegian psychologist Frode Stenseng has presented a dualistic model of escapism in relation to different types of activity engagements. He discusses the paradox that the flow state ([[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]) resembles psychological states obtainable through actions such as drug abuse, sexual masochism, and suicide ideation ([[Roy Baumeister|Baumeister]]). Accordingly, he deduces that the state of escape can have both positive and negative meanings and outcomes. Stenseng argues that there exist two forms of escapism with different affective outcomes dependent on the motivational focus that lies behind the immersion in the activity. Escapism in the form of self-suppression stems from motives to run away from unpleasant thoughts, self-perceptions, and emotions, whereas self-expansion stems from motives to gain positive experiences through the activity and to discover new aspects of self. Stenseng has developed the "escape scale" to measure self-suppression and self-expansion in people´s favorite activities, such as sports, arts, and gaming. Empirical investigations of the model have shown that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stenseng|first1=Frode|last2=Rise|first2=Jostein|last3=Kraft|first3=Pål|title=Activity Engagement as Escape from Self: The Role of Self-Suppression and Self-Expansion|journal=Leisure Sciences: An Interdisciplinary Journal|date=2012|volume=34|issue=1|pages=19–38|doi=10.1080/01490400.2012.633849|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490400.2012.633849}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the two dimensions are distinctively different with regard to affective outcomes 
* some individuals are more prone to engage through one type of escapism 
* situational levels of well-being affect the type of escapism that becomes dominant at a specific time

==During the Great Depression== 
[[Alan Brinkley]], author of ''Culture and Politics in the Great Depression'', presents how escapism became the new trend for dealing with the hardships created by [[Great Depression|the stock market crash in 1929]]: magazines, radio and movies, all were aimed to help people mentally escape from the mass poverty and economic downturn. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, which became hugely popular during the 1930s, was said to have pictures that give "no indication that there was such a thing as depression; most of the pictures are of bathing beauties and ship launchings and building projects and sports heroes – of almost anything but poverty and unemployment”. Famous director [[Preston Sturges]] aimed to validate this notion by creating a film called ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]''. The film ends with a group of poor destitute men in jail watching a comedic [[Mickey Mouse]] [[cartoon]] that ultimately lifts their spirits. Sturges aims to point out how "foolish and vain and self-indulgent" it would be to make a film about suffering. Therefore, movies of the time more often than not focused on comedic plot lines that distanced people emotionally from the horrors that were occurring all around them. These films "consciously, deliberately set out to divert people from their problems", but it also diverted them from the problems of those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Alan. Culture and Politics in the Great Depression. Waco, Tx: Markham Press Fund, 1999. http://www.uvm.edu/~pblackme/Brinkley.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolution]] has been an important theme in fiction, including [[speculative evolution]] in [[science fiction]], since the late 19th century, though it began before [[Charles Darwin]]'s time, and reflects [[orthogenesis|progressionist]] and [[Lamarck]]ist views as well as Darwin's.&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |last2=Langford |first2=David R. | |title=Evolution |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/evolution |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darwinian evolution]] is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival. Other themes include the replacement of humanity, either by other species or by [[intelligent machine]]s.

[[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], as set out in his 1859 ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', is the dominant theory in modern biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last = Coyne |first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution Resources |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] |year=2016 |url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603230514/http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |archivedate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is accompanied as a philosophy and in fiction by two earlier evolutionary theories, progressionism ([[orthogenesis]]) and [[Lamarckism]].&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Progressionism is the view that evolution is progress towards some goal of perfection, and that it is in some way directed towards that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pages=526–539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamarckism, a philosophy that long predates [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]], is the view that evolution is guided by the inheritance of characteristics acquired by use or disuse during an animal's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Zirkle1935&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zirkle | first1=Conway | authorlink=Conway Zirkle | year=1935 | title=The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis| journal=[[The American Naturalist]] | volume=69 | issue=| pages=417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progressionism==
{{see|Orthogenesis}}

Ideas of progress and evolution were popular, long before Darwinism, in the 18th century, leading to [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif]]'s allegorical 1781 story ''{{ill|La découverte Australe par un homme volant|fr|La Découverte australe}}'' (The Southern Hemisphere Discovery by a Flying Man).&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; 

The evolutionary biologist Kayla M. Hardwick quotes from the 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', where the villain Faora states: "The fact that you possess a sense of morality, and we do not, gives us an evolutionary advantage. And if history has taught us anything, it is that evolution always wins." She points out that the idea that evolution wins is progressionist, while (she argues) the idea that evolution gives evil an advantage over the moral and good, driving the creation of formidable monsters, is a popular science fiction misconception.&lt;ref name=Hardwick2014&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hardwick |first1=Kayla M. |title=Natural selection at the movies: Only the bad guys evolve |url=https://nothinginbiology.org/2014/10/22/natural-selection-at-the-movies-only-the-bad-guys-evolve/ |website=Nothing in Biology Makes Sense [except in the light of evolution] |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardwick gives as examples of the evolution of "bad-guy traits" the [[Morlock]]s in [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1895 ''[[The Time Machine]]'', the bugs' [[caste (insect)|caste system]] in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1959 ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', and the effective colonisation by [[Don Siegel]]'s 1956 ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' aliens.&lt;ref name=Hardwick2014/&gt;

==Lamarckism==
{{see|Lamarckism}}

In French 19th century literature, evolutionary fantasy was Lamarckian, as seen in [[Camille Flammarion]]'s 1887 ''Lumen'' and his 1894 ''[[Omega: The Last Days of the World]]'', [[J.-H. Rosny]]'s 1887 ''Les Xipéhuz'' and his 1910 ''La mort de la terre'', and [[Jules Verne]]'s 1901 ''La grande forêt, le village aérien''. The Lamarckist philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s creative evolution driven by the supposed [[élan vital]] likely inspired [[J. D. Beresford]]'s English evolutionary fantasy, his 1911 ''[[The Hampdenshire Wonder]]''.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

==Darwinism==
[[File:Alvim-correa12.jpg|thumb|Illustration for a 1906 edition of [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1898 "[[The War of the Worlds]]" by [[Henrique Alvim Corréa]]]]
{{see|Speculative evolution}}

Darwin's version of evolution has been widely explored in fiction, both in fantasies and in imaginative explorations of its grimmer "[[survival of the fittest]]" effects, with much attention focused on possible human evolution. H. G. Wells's ''The Time Machine'' already mentioned, his 1896 ''[[The Island of Dr Moreau]]'', and his 1898 ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' all pessimistically explore the possible dire consequences of the darker sides of human nature in the struggle for survival.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; More broadly, [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1899 ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and [[R. L. Stevenson]]'s 1886 ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' portray Darwinian thinking in mainstream [[English literature]].&lt;ref name="NYT1986"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levine |first1=George |title=Darwin and the Evolution of Fiction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/books/darwin-and-the-evolution-of-fiction.html |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] wrote an optimistic tale, ''The Last Judgement'', in the 1927 collection ''Possible Worlds''. This influenced [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s 1930 ''[[Last and First Men]]'', which portrays the many species that evolved from humans in a billion-year timeframe. A different take on Darwinism is the idea, popular from the 1950s onwards, that humans will evolve more or less godlike mental capacity, as in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1950 ''[[Childhood's End]]'' and [[Brian Aldiss]]'s 1959 ''[[Galaxies Like Grains of Sand]]''. Another science fiction theme is the replacement of humanity on Earth by other species or [[intelligent machine]]s. For instance, [[Olof Johannesson]]'s 1966 ''The Great Computer'' gives humans the role of enabling intelligent machines to evolve, while [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1985 ''Galapagos'' is one of several novels to depict a replacement species.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

[[File:"Mon han dog ikke skulle komme?".jpg|thumb|"Surely he will come?". Painting by [[Christen Dalsgaard]]. From the [[Hirschsprung Collection]], Denmark.]]
In the case of [[uncertainty]], '''expectation''' is what is considered the most likely to happen&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35 &lt;/ref&gt;. An expectation, which is a [[belief]] that is centered on the [[future]], may or may not be realistic. A less advantageous result gives rise to the [[emotion]] of [[disappointment]]&lt;ref&gt;Castelfranchi, C. and Miceli, M., 2011. Anticipation and emotion. In Emotion-Oriented Systems (pp. 483-500). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;. If something happens that is not at all expected, it is a [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. An expectation about the behavior or performance of another person, expressed to that person, may have the nature of a strong request, or an order; this kind of expectation is called a [[social norm]]. The degree to which something is expected to be true can be expressed using [[fuzzy logic]].

==Expectations of well-being==
[[Richard Lazarus]] asserts that people become accustomed to positive or negative life experiences which lead to favorable or unfavorable expectations of their present and near-future circumstances. Lazarus notes the widely accepted philosophical principle that "happiness depends on the background psychological status of the person...and cannot be well predicted without reference to one's expectations."&lt;ref name=Lazarus&gt;{{cite book |last=Lazarus |first=Richard |title=Emotion and Adaptation |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-19-506994-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to happiness or unhappiness, Lazarus notes that objective conditions of life are those of hardship and deprivation often make a positive assessment of their well-being," while "people who are objectively well off...often make a negative assessment of their well-being." Lazarus argues that "the most sensible explanation of this apparent paradox is that people...develop favorable or unfavorable ''expectations''" that guide such assessments.&lt;ref name=Lazarus/&gt;

==Expectations impact on beliefs==
Sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] wrote that a person's expectation is directly linked to [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. Whether or not such an expectation is truthful or not, has little or no effect on the outcome. If a person believes what they are told or convinces himself/herself of the fact, chances are this person will see the expectation to its inevitable conclusion. There is an inherent danger in this kind of labeling especially for the educator. Since children are easily convinced of certain tenets especially when told to them by an authority figure like a parent or teacher, they may believe whatever is taught to them even if what is taught has no factual basis. If the student or child were to act on false information, certain positive or negative [[unintended consequences]] could result. If overly positive or elevated expectations were used to describe or manipulate a person's [[self-image]] and execution falls short, the results could be a total reversal of that person's [[self-confidence]]. If thought of in terms of [[causality]] or cause and effect, the higher a person's expectation and the lower the execution, the higher the frustration level may become. This in turn could cause a total cessation of effort and motivate the person to quit.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Expectations elicitation ==
Expectations are a central part of value calculations in economics. For example, calculating the [[Subjective expected utility]] of an outcome requires knowing the both the value of an outcome and the probability that it will occur.  Researchers who elicit (or measure) the expectations of individuals can input these beliefs into the model in place of standard probabilities.  The strategy of eliciting individual expectations is now incorporated into many international surveys, including the [[Health and Retirement Study]] in the United States.

Expectations elicitation is used in many domains, including survival and educational outcomes, but may be most prominent in financial realms.  Expectations are theoretically important for models such as the [[Efficient-market hypothesis]] which suggest that all information should be incorporated into the market, as well as for [[Modern portfolio theory]] which suggests that investors must be compensated for higher levels of risk through higher (expected) returns.  Following these models, empirical research has found that consumers with more optimistic stock market expectations are more likely to hold riskier assets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vissing-Jorgenson|date=2003|title=Perspectives on Behavioral Finance: Does "Irrationality" Disappear with Wealth?

==Overview==
Each author has recorded the subjective experiences of various persons in violent environments and surroundings. These are the perspectives of the offenders, victims, noncombatants, soldiers, insurgents, black marketers, heroes, scavengers and researchers. Articles also show how anthropologists are often compelled to create innovative data gathering strategies when working in the midst of dangerous environments.

      <comment>In quantum free particle - section Mathematica description: moved '&lt;/math&gt;' from end of sentence to end of formula, just before 'there is no energy time uncertainty unlike presumed'.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11371">In [[physics]], a '''free particle''' is a particle that, in some sense, is not bound by an external force, or equivalently not in a region where its potential energy varies. In classical physics, this means the particle is present in a "field-free" space. In quantum mechanics, it means a region of uniform potential, usually set to zero in the region of interest since potential can be arbitrarily set to zero at any point (or surface in three dimensions) in space.

==Classical free particle==

The classical free particle is characterized simply by a fixed [[velocity]] '''v'''. The [[momentum]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[kinetic energy]] (equal to total energy) by

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{p^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass of the particle and '''v''' is the vector velocity of the particle.

==Quantum free particle==

[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of [[matter wave|de Broglie waves]] in 1d - real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the colour [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform, there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the decreases again, and vice versa - the result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[Plane wave]]. Bottom: [[Wave packet]].]]

===Mathematical description===

{{main|Schrödinger equation|Matter wave}}

A free particle in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is described by the free [[Schrödinger equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \ \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi (\mathbf{r}, t) &lt;/math&gt;

where ψ is the [[wavefunction]] of the particle at position '''r''' and time ''t''. The solution for a particle with momentum '''p''' or [[wave vector]] '''k''', at [[angular frequency]] ω or energy ''E'', is given by the [[complex number|complex]] [[plane wave]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = Ae^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} = Ae^{i(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}-E t)/\hbar} &lt;/math&gt;

with [[amplitude]] ''A''. As for ''all'' quantum particles free ''or'' bound, the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]s

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta p_x \Delta x \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt; there is no energy time uncertainty unlike presumed.&lt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01637-7&gt;

(similarly for the ''y'' and ''z'' directions), and the [[De Broglie relations]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = \hbar \mathbf{k}, \quad E = \hbar \omega&lt;/math&gt;

apply. Since the potential energy is (set to) zero, the total energy ''E'' is equal to the kinetic energy, which has the same form as in classical physics:

:&lt;math&gt; E = T \,\rightarrow \,\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} =\hbar \omega &lt;/math&gt;

===Measurement and calculations===

The integral of the [[probability density function]]

:&lt;math&gt; \rho(\mathbf{r},t) = \psi^*(\mathbf{r},t)\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = |\psi(\mathbf{r},t)|^2&lt;/math&gt;

where * denotes [[complex conjugate]], over all space is the probability of finding the particle in all space, which must be unity if the particle exists:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_\mathrm{all\,space} |\psi(\mathbf{r},t)|^2 d^3 \mathbf{r}=1&lt;/math&gt;

This is the normalization condition for the wave function. The wavefunction is not normalizable for a plane wave, but is for a [[wavepacket]].

  }}
{{Clear}}

===Fourier decomposition===
The free particle wave function may be represented by a superposition of ''momentum'' eigenfunctions, with coefficients given by the [[Fourier transform]] of the initial wavefunction:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 4.1&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) =\frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \int_\mathrm{all \, \textbf{k} \, space}  \hat \psi_0 (\mathbf{k})e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} d^3 \mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is over all '''k'''-space and &lt;math&gt; \omega = \omega(\mathbf{k}) = \frac{\hbar \mathbf{k}^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt; (to ensure that the wave packet is a solution of the free particle Schrödinger equation). Here &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the wave function at time 0 and &lt;math&gt;\hat\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt;. (The Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;\hat\psi_0(\mathbf k)&lt;/math&gt; is essentially the [[Wave_function#Momentum-space_wave_functions|momentum wave function]] of the position wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi_0(\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt;, but written as a function of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p=\hbar\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt;.)

The expectation value of the momentum '''p''' for the complex plane wave is

:&lt;math&gt; \langle\mathbf{p}\rangle=\left\langle \psi \left|-i\hbar\nabla\right|\psi\right\rangle = \hbar\mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt;,

and for the general wave packet it is

:&lt;math&gt; \langle\mathbf{p}\rangle = \int_\mathrm{all\,space} \psi^*(\mathbf{r},t)(-i\hbar\nabla)\psi(\mathbf{r},t) d^3 \mathbf{r} = \int_\mathrm{all \, \textbf{k} \, space} \hbar \mathbf{k} |\hat\psi_0(\mathbf{k})|^2  d^3 \mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt;.

The expectation value of the energy E is 

:&lt;math&gt; \langle E\rangle=\left\langle \psi \left|- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \right|\psi\right\rangle = \int_\mathrm{all\,space} \psi^*(\mathbf{r},t)\left(- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \right)\psi(\mathbf{r},t) d^3 \mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Group velocity and phase velocity===
[[File:Wave_packet_propagation.png|thumb|right|Propagation of a wave packet, with the motion of a single peak shaded in purple. The peaks move at the phase velocity while the overall packet moves at the group velocity.]]
The [[phase velocity]] is defined to be the speed at which a plane wave solution propagates, namely

:&lt;math&gt; v_p=\frac{\omega}{k}=\frac{\hbar k}{2m} = \frac{p}{2m} &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{2m}&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' the speed of a classical particle with momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;; rather, it is half of the classical velocity.

Meanwhile, suppose that the initial wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is a [[wave packet]] whose Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;\hat\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is concentrated near a particular wave vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[group velocity]] of the plane wave is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; v_g= \nabla\omega(\mathbf k)=\frac{\hbar\mathbf k}{m}=\frac{\mathbf p}{m}&lt;/math&gt;,

which agrees with the formula for the classical velocity of the particle. The group velocity is the (approximate) speed at which the whole wave packet propagates, while the phase velocity is the speed at which the individual peaks in the wave packet move.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Sections 4.3 and 4.4&lt;/ref&gt; The figure illustrates this phenomenon, with the individual peaks within the wave packet propagating at half the speed of the overall packet.

===Spread of the wave packet===
The notion of group velocity is based on a linear approximation to the dispersion relation &lt;math&gt;\omega(k)&lt;/math&gt; near a particular value of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Equation 4.24&lt;/ref&gt; In this approximation, the amplitude of the wave packet moves at a velocity equal to the group velocity ''without changing shape''. This result is an approximation that fails to capture certain interesting aspects of the evolution a free quantum particle. Notably, the width of the wave packet, as measured by the uncertainty in the position, grows linearly in time for large times. This phenomenon is called the [[Wave_packet#Gaussian_wave_packets_in_quantum_mechanics|spread of the wave packet]] for a free particle.

Specifically, it is not difficult to compute an exact formula for the uncertainty &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\psi(t)}X&lt;/math&gt; as a function of time, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the position operator. Working in one spatial dimension for simplicity, we have:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 4.10&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta_{\psi(t)}X)^2=\frac{t^2}{m^2}(\Delta_{\psi_0}P)^2+\frac{2t}{m}\left(\left\langle \frac{XP+PX}{2}\right\rangle_{\psi_0}-\left\langle X\right\rangle_{\psi_0} \left\langle P\right\rangle_{\psi_0} \right)+(\Delta_{\psi_0}X)^2&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is the time-zero wave function. The expression in parentheses in the second term on the right-hand side is the quantum covariance of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, for large positive times, the uncertainty in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; grows linearly, with the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;(\Delta_{\psi_0}P)/m&lt;/math&gt;. If the momentum of the initial wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is highly localized, the wave packet will spread slowly and the group-velocity approximation will remain good for a long time. Intuitively, this result says that if the initial wave function has a very sharply defined momentum, then the particle has a sharply defined velocity and will (to good approximation) propagate at this velocity for a long time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33355">In a notable study of power conducted by [[social psychologist]]s [[John R. P. French]] and [[Bertram Raven]] in 1959, [[Power (social and political)|power]] is divided into five separate and distinct forms.  In 1965 Raven revised this model to include a sixth form by separating the informational power base as distinct from the expert power base.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2010, 2006). Group Dynamics. Belmont: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relating to [[social communication]] studies, ''power'' in [[social influence]] settings has introduced a large realm of research pertaining to [[persuasion]] tactics and leadership practices. Through social communication studies, it has been theorized that leadership and power are closely linked. It has been further presumed that different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in [[organizational communication]] and throughout the workforce.  In a notable study of power conducted by social psychologists John R. P. French and Bertram Raven in 1959, power is divided into five separate and distinct forms.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt; They identified those five bases of power as ''coercive, reward, legitimate, referent, and expert''. This was followed by Raven's subsequent identification in 1965 of a sixth separate and distinct base of power: informational power.&lt;ref name=371-382&gt;Raven, B. H. (1965). Social influence and power. In I.D. Steiner &amp; M. Fishbein (Eds.),Current studies in social psychology (pp. 371–382). New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, French and Raven defined social influence as a change in the belief, attitude, or behavior of a person (the target of influence) which results from the action of another person (an influencing agent), and they defined social power as the potential for such influence, that is, the ability of the agent to bring about such a change using available resources.&lt;ref name=1242-49&gt;Raven, Bertram H. "Power, Six Bases of." Encyclopedia of Leadership.Ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2004. 1242-49. SAGE; Reference Online. Web. 30 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there have been many formal definitions of leadership that did not include [[social influence]] and power, any discussion of leadership must inevitably deal with the means by which a leader gets the members of a group or organization to act and move in a particular direction.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

Whereby, this is to be considered "power" in social influential situations.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Overview==
The original French and Raven (1959) model included five bases of power – reward, coercion, legitimate, expert, and referent – however, informational power was added by Raven in 1965, bringing the total to six.&lt;ref name=217-244&gt;Raven, Bertram H. (1992) "A power interaction model on interpersonal influence: French and Raven thirty years later". Journal of Social Behavior and Personality. Vol. 7, No. 2, 217-244&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the model has gone through very significant developments: coercion and reward can have personal as well as impersonal forms. Expert and referent power can be negative or positive. Legitimate power, in addition to position power, may be based on other normative obligations: reciprocity, equity, and responsibility. Information may be utilized in direct or indirect fashion.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

French and Raven defined social power as the potential for influence (a change in the belief, attitude or behavior of a someone who is the target of influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt;

As we know [[leadership]] and power are closely linked.  This model shows how the different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in organizational communication and throughout the workforce. "The French-Raven power forms are introduced with consideration of the level of observability and the extent to which power is dependent or independent of structural conditions.  Dependency refers to the degree of internalization that occurs among persons subject to social control.  Using these considerations it is possible to link personal processes to structural conditions".&lt;ref name=Lazarsfeld&gt;Lazarsfeld, Paul. Menzel, Herbert. 1961. On the relation between individual and collective properties. pp 214–249 in Amitai Etzioni (ed.), Complex Organizations: A Sociological Reader. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original typology ==
The bases of social power have evolved over the years with benefits coming from advanced research and theoretical developments in related fields. On the basis of research and evidence, there have been many other developments and elaborations on the original theory. French and Raven developed an original model outlining the change dependencies and also further delineating each power basis.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Though it is a common understanding that most social influence can still be understood by the original six bases of power, the foundational bases have been elaborated and further differentiated.

==Bases of power==
As mentioned above, there are now six main concepts of power strategies consistently studied in social communication research. They are described as Coercive, Reward, Legitimate, Referent, Expert, and Informational.  Additionally, research has shown that [[source credibility]] has an explicit effect on the bases of power used in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Nesler, Mitchell S.; Aguinis, Herman; Quigley, Brian M.; Tedeschi, James T. (1993). "The Effect of Credibility on Perceived Power". Journal of Applied Social Psychology 23 (17): 1407–1425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Source credibility, the bases of power, and objective power, which is established based on variables such as position or title, are interrelated. The levels of each have a direct relationship in the manipulation and levels of one another.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

The bases of power differ according to the manner in which social changes are implemented, the permanence of such changes, and the ways in which each basis of power is established and maintained.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

The effectiveness of power is situational. Given there are six bases of power studied in the [[Communication]] field, it is very important to know the situational uses of each power, focusing on when each is most effective.  According to French and Raven, "it is of particular practical interest to know what bases of power or which power strategies are most likely to be effective, but it is clear that there is no simple answer.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

For example, a power strategy that works immediately but relies on surveillance (for example, reward power or coercive power) may not last once surveillance ends. One organizational study found that reward power tended to lead to greater satisfaction on the part of employees, which means that it might increase influence in a broad range of situations. Coercive power was more effective in influencing a subordinate who jeopardized the success of the overall organization or threatened the leader's authority, even though in the short term it also led to resentment on the part of the target. A power strategy that ultimately leads to private acceptance and long-lasting change (for example, information power) may be difficult to implement, and consume considerable time and energy. In the short term, complete reliance on information power might even be dangerous (for example, telling a small child not to run into the street unattended). A military officer leading his troops into combat might be severely handicapped if he had to give complete explanations for each move. Instead, he would want to rely on unquestioned legitimate position power, backed up by coercive power. Power resources, which may be effective for one leader, dealing with one target or follower, may not work for a different leader and follower. The manner in which the power strategy is utilized will also affect its success or failure. Where coercion is deemed necessary, a leader might soften its negative effects with a touch of humor. There have been studies indicating that cultural factors may determine the effectiveness of power strategies."&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;
             
=== Coercive power ===
{{Also|Coercive control}}
[[File:Blackbeard, Buccaneer - Cover.jpg|thumbnail|Blackbeard the infamous pirate]]
Coercive power uses the threat of force to gain [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] from another. Force may include physical, social, emotional, political, or economic means. Coercion is not always recognized by the target of influence.&lt;ref name=Petress&gt;{{cite web|last=Petress|first=Ken|date=2003|title=Power: Definition, Typology, Description, Examples, and Implications|format=PDF|url=http://uthscsa.edu/gme/documents/powerdefinitionstypologyexamples.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of power is based upon the idea of [[coercion]]. The main idea behind this concept is that someone is forced to do something that he/she does not desire to do. The main goal of coercion is compliance. Coercive power's influence is socially dependent on how the target relates to the change being desired by the influence agent.&lt;ref name=Pierro&gt;Pierro, A., Cicero, L., &amp; Raven, B. Motivated Compliance With Bases of Social Power. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38, 1921-1944.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, a person would have to be consistently watched by the influencing agent in order for the change to remain in effect.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt;

==== Impersonal ====
An example of impersonal coercion relates a person's belief that the influencing agent has the real power to physically threaten, impose a monetary fine or dismiss an employee.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Personal ====
An example of personal coercion relates to a threat of rejection or the possibility of disapproval from a person whom is highly valued.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

According to Changingminds.org "demonstrations of the harm are often used to illustrate what will happen if compliance is not gained".&lt;ref&gt;ChangingMinds. (2002–2009). Retrieved on May 5, 2009 from Changingminds.org&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} The power of coercion has been proven to be related with [[Punishment (psychology)|punitive behavior]] that may be outside one's normal role expectations.&lt;ref name=Hinkin /&gt; However coercion has also been associated positively with generally punitive behavior and negatively associated to contingent [[Reward system|reward behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, D. A., &amp; Sims, H. P. Perceptions of managerial power as a consequence of managerial behavior and reputation. Journal of Management 1983, 9, 7-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This source of power can often lead to problems and in many circumstances it involves [[abuse]].  These type of leaders rely on the use of threats in their [[leadership style]]. Often the threats involve saying someone will be fired or demoted.

=== Reward power ===
{{Also|Operant conditioning|Reinforcement|Punishment (psychology)}}
Reward power is based on the right of some to offer or deny tangible, social, emotional, or spiritual [[Reward system|rewards]] to others for doing what is wanted or expected of them. Some examples of reward power (positive reward) are: (a) a child is given a dollar for earning better grades; (b) a student is admitted into an honor society for excellent effort; (c) a retiree is praised and feted for lengthy service at a retirement party; and (d) New York firefighters were heralded as heroes for their acts on 9-11-01.[[File:Money 555.jpg|thumbnail]] Some examples of reward power (negative reward) are: (a) a driver is fined for illegal parking; (b) a teenager grounded for a week for misbehaving; (c) a rookie player is ridiculed for not following tradition; and (d) [[President Harding]]'s name is commonly invoked whenever [[political scandal]] is mentioned. Some pitfalls can emerge when a too heavy reliance is placed on reward power; these include: (a) some people become fixated and too dependent on rewards to do even mundane activities; (b) too severe fears of punishment can immobilize some people; (c) as time passes, past rewards become insufficient to motivate or activate desired outcomes; and (d) negative rewards may be perverted into positive attention.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

==== Impersonal ====
An example of impersonal reward relates to promises of promotions, money and rewards from various social areas.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Personal ====
An example of personal reward relates to the reward of receiving approval from a desired person and building relationships with romantic partners.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

=== Legitimate power ===
{{Also|Legitimisation}}
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II - 1953-Dress.JPG|thumbnail|Queen Elizabeth II - 1953]]
Legitimate power comes from an elected, selected, or appointed position of authority and may be underpinned by [[social norms]].&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; This power which means the ability to administer to another certain feelings of [[obligation]] or the notion of responsibility.&lt;ref name=Hinkin /&gt; "Rewarding and Punishing subordinates is generally seen as a legitimate part of the formal or appointed leadership role and most managerial positions in work organizations carry with them, some degree of expected reward and punishment."&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. (1990). Handbook of leadership (3rd ed.). New York: Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; This type of formal power relies on position in an authority [[hierarchy]]. Occasionally, those possessing legitimate power fail to recognize they have it, and may begin to notice others going around them to accomplish their goals.&lt;ref name="administration1998"&gt;Fuqua, E., Payne, K., &amp; Cangemi, J. (1998). Leadership and the effective use of power. National Forum of Educational Administration and Supervision Journal, 15E(4), 36-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Three bases of legitimate power are cultural values, acceptance of social structure, and designation.&lt;ref name=150-167&gt;French, J. and Raven, B. (1959). The Bases of Social Power. In Studies in Social Power, D. Cartwright, Ed., pp. 150-167. Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural values comprise a general basis for legitimate power of one entity over another.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; Such legitimacy is conferred by others and this [[Legitimation|legitimacy]] can be revoked by the original granters, their designees, or their inheritors.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Legitimate power originates from a target of influence accepting the power of the influencing agent whereas behavioral change or [[compliance (psychology)|compliance]] occurs based on target's obligation.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; One who uses legitimate power may have a high need for power which is their motivator to use this base for change in behavior and influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; There may be a range of legitimate power.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt;

==== Position ====
The legitimate position power is based on the social norm which requires people to be obedient to those who hold superior positions in a formal or informal social structure.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Examples may include: a [[Police legitimacy|police officer's legitimacy]] to make arrests; a parent's legitimacy to restrict a child's activities; the President's legitimacy to live in the White House; and the Congress' legitimacy to declare war. Some pitfalls can arise when too heavy reliance is placed on legitimate power; these include: (a) unexpected exigencies call for non-legitimized individuals to act in the absence of a legitimate authority – such as a citizen's arrest in the absence of a police official; and (b) military legitimacy&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

==== Reciprocity ====
The legitimate power of reciprocity is based on the social norm of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]].&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Which states how we feel obligated to do something in return for someone who does something beneficial for us.&lt;ref&gt;Gouldner, A. (1960). The norm of reciprocity: A preliminary statement.
American Sociological Review, 47, 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). New York:
HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Equity ====
The legitimate power of equity is based on the social norm of equity (or [[compensatory damages]])&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; The social norm of equity makes people feel compelled to compensate someone who has suffered or worked hard.&lt;ref&gt;Walster, E., Walster, G. W., &amp; Berscheid, E. (1978). Equity theory and
research. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as someone whom we have harmed in some way is based on the premise that there is a wrong that can be made right, which may be a compensatory form of righting the wrong.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz&gt;Berkowitz, L. and Daniels, L. (1963).  The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, Vol 66(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dependence  ====
The legitimate power of dependence is based on the social norm of [[social responsibility]].&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Social responsibility norm states how people feel obligated to help someone who is in need of assistance.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz/&gt;

People traditionally obey the person with this power solely based on their role, position or title rather than the person specifically as a leader. Therefore, this type of power can easily be lost and the leader does not have his position or title anymore. This power is therefore not strong enough to be one's only form of influencing/persuading.

=== Referent power ===
{{Main article|Referent power}}
Referent power is rooted in the affiliations we make and/or the groups and organizations we belong to.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Our affiliation with a group and the beliefs of the group are shared to some degree. As Referent power emphasizes similarity, respect for an agent of influence's superiority may be undermined by a target of influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Use of this power base and its outcomes may be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; An agent for change motivated with a strong need for affiliation and concern of likeability will prefer this power base and will influence their leadership style.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Ingratiation or flattery and sense of community may be used by an agent of influence to enhance their influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt;
[[File:Reagans with Billy Graham.jpg|thumbnail|Reagans with Rev. Billy Graham]]

==== Positive ====
Referent power in a positive form utilizes the shared personal connection or shared belief between the influencing agent and target with the intention of positively correlated actions of the target.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Negative ====
Referent power in a negative form produces actions in opposition to the intent of the influencing agent, this is the result from the agent's creation of [[cognitive dissonance]] between the referent influencing agent and the target's perception of that influence.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Examples of referent power include: (a) each of the last seven White House press secretaries have been paid handsomely for their memoirs relating to their presence at the seat of government; (b) Mrs. Hillary Clinton gained political capital by her marriage to the President; (c) Reverend Pat Robertson lost a bid for the Republican Party's nomination for President due, in significant part, to his religious affiliation; and (4) national firefighters have received vocational acclaim due to the association with the heroic NYC firefighters. Some pitfalls can occur related to referent assumptions; these include: (a) guilt or glory by association where little or no true tie is established; (b) associative traits tend to linger long after real association ends; (c) some individuals tend to pay dearly for associates' misdeeds or terrible reputations.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; It is important to distinguish between referent power and other bases of social power involving control or [[conformity]].&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; According to Fuqua, Payne, and Cangemi, referent power acts a little like [[role model]] power. It depends on respecting, liking, and holding another individual in high esteem. It usually develops over a long period of time.&lt;ref name="administration1998"/&gt;

The power of holding the ability to administer to another a sense of personal acceptance or personal approval.&lt;ref name=Hinkin&gt;Hinkin, T. R., &amp; Schriesheim, C. A. Development and application of new scales to measure the bases of social power. Journal of Applied Psychology, 1989 74, 561-567.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of power is strong enough that the power-holder is often looked up to as a role model.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, B. H. Political applications of the psychology of interpersonal influence and social power. Political Psychology, 1990, 11, 493-520.&lt;/ref&gt; This power is often regarded as admiration, or charm. The responsibility involved is heavy and the power easily lost, but when combined with other forms of power it can be very useful. Referent power is commonly seen in political and military figures, although celebrities often have this as well.

=== Expert power===
[[File:Julius Richmond, Surgeon General official photo.jpg|thumbnail|[[Julius Richmond]], [[Surgeon General of the United States]]]]
Expert power is based on what one knows, experience, and special skills or talents.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Expertise can be demonstrated by reputation, credentials certifying [[expertise]], and actions.  The effectiveness and impacts of the Expert power base may be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; According to Raven, there will be more use of Expert power if the motive is a need for achievement.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; The ability to administer to another information, knowledge or expertise.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven&gt;French, J. R. P., Raven, B. The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright and A. Zander. Group dynamics. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; (Example: Doctors, lawyers). As a consequence of the expert power or knowledge, a leader is able to convince their subordinates to trust them.  The expertise does not have to be genuine – it is the [[perception]] of expertise that provides the power base.  When individuals perceive or assume that a person possesses superior skills or abilities, they award power to that person.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt;

==== Positive ====
Expert power in a positive form influences the target to act accordingly as instructed by the expert, based on the assumption of the expert's correct knowledge.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

====  Negative ====
Expert power in a negative form can result from a person acting in opposition to the experts instructions if the target feels that the expert has personal gain motives.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Some examples include: (a) a violinist demonstrating through audition skill with music; (b) a professor submits school transcripts to demonstrate discipline expertise; (c) a bricklayer relies on 20+ years of experience to prove expertise. Some pitfalls can emerge when too heavy a reliance is made on expertise; these include: (a) sometimes inferences are made suggesting expertise is wider in scope than it actually is; for example, an expert in antique vases may have little expertise in antique lamps; (b) one's expertise is not everlasting; for example, a physician who fails to keep up with medical technology and advances may lose expertise; and (c) expertise does not necessarily carry with it [[common sense]] or [[ethics|ethical judgement]].&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

=== Informational power ===
French and Raven's original five powers brought about change after many years, by which Raven added a sixth base of power. Informational is the ability of an [[agent of influence]] to bring about change through the resource of information.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Raven arguably believed that power as a potential influence logically meant that information was a form of influence and the social power base of Information Power was derived.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Informational influence results in [[cognition]] and acceptance by the target of influence. The ability for altered behavior initiated through information rather than a specific change agent is called socially independent change.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; In order to establish Information Power, an agent of influence would likely provide a baseline of information to a target of influence to lay the groundwork in order to be effective with future [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; A link between informational power, control, cooperation, and satisfaction have been hypothesized and tested in a lab study. The findings indicate that a channel member's control over another's strategy increases with its informational power source.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; According to Raven, there will be more use of Information power if the motive is a need for achievement and can also be affected by an agent's [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Feldman summarizes informational power as the most transitory type of power. If one gives information away, then the power is given away, which differs from other forms of power because it's grounded in what you know about the content of a specific situation. Other forms of power are independent of the content.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, R.S. (1985). Social Psychology: Theories, Research, and Applications.  McGraw Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information power comes as a result of possessing knowledge that others need or want.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; In the age of [[Information technology]], information power is increasingly relevant as an abundance of information is readily available.  There may be a [[cost-benefit analysis]] by an agent of influence to determine if Information Power or influence is the best strategy.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Informational influence or persuasion would generally be favorable however it may not be best suited if timing and effort lacks.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Information possessed that no one needs or wants is powerless. Information power extends to the ability to get information not presently held such as a case with a librarian or data base manager. Not all information is readily available; some information is closely controlled by few people.  Examples of information that is sensitive or limits accessibility: (a) national security data; (b) personnel information for government or business; (c) corporate trade secrets; (d) juvenile court records; (e) many privately settled lawsuit documents; (f) Swiss bank account owners; and (g) private phone conversations. Of course, legally obtained phone tap warrants, spying, eavesdropping, group and group member leaks can allow others not intended to be privy to information.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Possessing information is not, typically, the vital act; it is what one can and does do or potentially can do with the information that typically is of vital importance. Information can, and often is, used as a weapon as in a divorce, a child custody case, business dissolution, or in civil suits discoveries. Information has been used by some to extort action, utterance, agreement, or settlement by others.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Information power is a form of personal or collective power that is based on controlling information needed by others in order to reach an important goal.  Our society is now reliant on information power as knowledge for influence, decision making, credibility, and control.  Timely and relevant information delivered on demand can be the most influential way to acquire power.  Information may be readily available through public records, research, and but information is sometimes assumed privileged or confidential. The target of influence accepts,comprehends and internalizes the change independently, without have to go back to the influencing agent.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt;

Informational power is based on the potential to utilize information.  Providing rational arguments, using information to persuade others, using facts and manipulating information can create a power base.  How information is used – sharing it with others, limiting it to key people, keeping it secret from key people, organizing it, increasing it, or even falsifying it – can create a shift in power within a group.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt;

==== Direct ====

Information presented by the influencing agent directly to the target of change.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Indirect ====

Information presented influencing agent indirectly to the target of change void of attempting influence, such as hints or suggestions.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Socially independent of change====

The ability for altered behavior initiated through information rather than a specific change agent is called socially independent change.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Power socially independent of change may reflect the target continuing changed behavior without referring to, or even remembering, the supervisor or individual of authority as an agent of change because the target understands and accepts the reasoning of information received.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

==== Accessibility ====

Raven acknowledged leaders can attempt to influence subordinates by access and control of information. Information power may be used in both personal and positional classifications and is among the most preferable power bases.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, D. E. and Stahelski, A. J. The systematic measurement of French &amp; Raven's bases of social power in workgroups. Journal of Applied Social Psychology vol. 18 (1988) pp. 375–389&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tools/mechanisms ====

Informational power includes not only possessing information, but also the ability to obtain relevant information in a timely way to amass a power base.  The use of tools or technological mechanisms such as [[internet]], smart phones, and [[Social media]] progresses society's access to information but informational power as a base is derived by determining the usefulness and appropriateness of the information.&lt;ref&gt;Dessler, G. and Phillips, J. (2008). Managing Now. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power as a function of leadership and leadership styles ==
Tradition power is that force that is exerted upon us to conform to traditional ways. Traditions, for the most part, are social constructs; they invite, seduce, or compel us to conform and act in predictable, patterned ways. Breaking with traditions put people at risk of social alienation. Traditions can blunt rationality; they can block innovation; and they can appear to outsiders as silly when original traditions' rationales become outdated or forgotten.

The power of traditions, rather than being typically vested in particular individuals, is ordinarily focused on group conformity&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Charismatic power is that aura possessed by only a few individuals in our midst; it is characterized by super confidence, typical physical attractiveness, social adroitness, amiability, sharpened leadership skills, and heightened charm. Some [[charisma]] has dark and sinister overtones such as that shown by [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jim Jones]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[David Koresh]], and many [[confidence trickster]]s. Others demonstrate more positive displays of charisma such as that displayed by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], [[Michael Jordan]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Charisma has, in many cases, short circuited rationality; that is, others have been fooled into or lulled into not rationally considering what a charismatic requests or demands but going along as a result of the charismatic attraction. It must be remembered that power is effective only when the target of powerful actions agrees [implicitly or explicitly] to the relevant power dynamic; we are all technically able to resist the power of others; at times, however, we may feel powerless to resist or the social, political, personal, and/or emotional price to be paid is too high or we fear failure in resisting&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

[[File:Mediq Sverige Kungsbacka warehouse.jpg|thumb|Tangible goods stacked in a [[warehouse]]]]
In [[economics]], '''goods''' are materials that satisfy human [[want]]s&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from [[Murray Milgate]], [1987] 2008, "goods and commodities, " ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd ed., preview [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=%22goods+and+commodities%22&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527131113/http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=%22goods+and+commodities%22&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO |date=2013-05-27 }}, in referencing an influential parallel definition of 'goods' by [[Alfred Marshall]], 1891. ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]'', 2nd ed., Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; and provide [[utility]], for example, to a [[consumer]] making a purchase of a satisfying [[Product (business)|product]]. A common distinction is made between goods that are [[tangible property]], and [[Service (economics)|services]], which are non-physical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan V. Deardorff]], 2006. ''Terms Of Trade: Glossary of International Economics'', World Scientific. Online version: Deardorffs' Glossary of International Economics, [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/g.html#good "good"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318101952/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/g.html |date=2013-03-18 }} and [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/s.html#service "service".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701120458/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/s.html |date=2017-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A good may be a consumable item that is useful to people but scarce in relation to its demand, so that human effort is required to obtain it. In contrast, free goods, such as air, are naturally in abundant supply and need no conscious effort to obtain them. Personal goods are things such as televisions, living room furniture, wallets, cellular telephones, almost anything owned or used on a daily basis that is not food related. Commercial goods are construed as any tangible product that is manufactured and then made available for supply to be used in an industry of commerce. Commercial goods could be tractors, commercial vehicles, mobile structures, airplanes and even roofing materials. Commercial and personal goods as categories are very broad and cover almost everything a person sees from the time they awake in their home, on their commute to work and arrival in the work place.

[[Commodity|Commodities]] may be used as a [[synonym]] for economic goods but often refer to marketable [[raw material]]s and [[primary sector of the economy|primary products]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan V. Deardorff, 2006, Deardorffs' Glossary of International Economics [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html#commodity "commodity".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212072813/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html |date=2007-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in economic theory all goods are considered [[tangible]], in reality certain classes of goods, such as [[information]], only take [[intangible asset|intangible]] forms. For example, among other goods an [[apple]] is a tangible object, while [[news]] belongs to an intangible class of goods and can be perceived only by means of an instrument such as [[Publishing|print]] or [[television]].

== Utility and characteristics of goods ==
Goods may increase or decrease their utility directly or indirectly and may be described as having [[marginal utility]]. Some things are useful, but not scarce enough to have [[monetary value]], such as the [[Earth's atmosphere]], these are referred to as '[[free good]]s'.

In economics, a [[bad (economics)|bad]] is the opposite of a good. Ultimately, whether an object is a good or a bad depends on each individual consumer and therefore, it is important to realize that not all goods are good all the time and not all goods are goods to all people.

== Types of goods ==
[[File:Types_of_goods.svg|thumb|296px|Types of goods in economics.]]
Goods' diversity allows for their classification into different categories based on distinctive characteristics, such as tangibility and (ordinal) relative elasticity.  A tangible good like an apple differs from an intangible good like information due to the impossibility of a person to physically hold the latter, whereas the former occupies physical space.  Intangible goods differ from services in that final (intangible) goods are transferable and can be traded, whereas a service cannot.

[[Price elasticity of demand|Price elasticity]] also differentiates types of goods.  An elastic good is one for which there is a relatively large change in quantity due to a relatively small change in price, and therefore is likely to be part of a family of [[substitute good]]s; for example, as pen prices rise, consumers might buy more pencils instead. An inelastic good is one for which there are few or no substitutes, such as tickets to major sporting events{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, original works by famous artists{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, and prescription medicine such as insulin.  [[Complementary good|Complementary goods]] are generally more inelastic than goods in a family of substitutes.  For example, if a rise in the price of beef results in a decrease in the quantity of beef demanded, it is likely that the quantity of hamburger buns demanded will also drop, despite no change in buns' prices.  This is because hamburger buns and beef (in Western culture) are [[Complementary good|complementary goods]].  It is important to note that goods considered complements or substitutes are relative associations and should not be understood in a vacuum.  The degree to which a good is a substitute or a complement depends on its relationship to other goods, rather than an intrinsic characteristic, and can be measured as [[cross elasticity of demand]] by employing statistical techniques such as covariance and correlation.

The following chart illustrates the classification of goods according to their exclusivity and competitiveness.
{{main|Rivalry (economics)}}
{{Good (economics)}}

== Trading of goods ==
{{main|Trade}}
Goods are capable of being physically delivered to a [[consumer]]. Goods that are '''[[Intangible asset|economic intangibles]]''' can only be stored, delivered, and consumed by means of [[media (communication)|media]].

Goods, both tangibles and intangibles, may involve the transfer of product [[ownership]] to the consumer. Services do not normally involve transfer of ownership of the service itself, but may involve transfer of ownership of goods developed or marketed by a service provider in the course of the service. For example, sale of storage related goods, which could consist of storage sheds, storage containers, storage buildings as tangibles or storage supplies such as boxes, bubble wrap, tape, bags and the like which are consumables, or distributing [[electricity]] among consumers is a service provided by an [[electric utility]] company. This service can only be experienced through the consumption of [[electrical energy]], which is available in a variety of [[voltage]]s and, in this case, is the ''economic goods'' produced by the electric utility company . While the service (namely, distribution of electrical energy) is a process that remains in its entirety in the ownership of the electric service provider, the goods (namely, electric energy) is the object of ownership transfer. The consumer becomes electric energy owner by purchase and may use it for any lawful purposes just like any other goods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">'''Greenhouse gas removal''' projects are a type of [[climate engineering]] that seek to remove [[greenhouse gases]] from the atmosphere, and thus they tackle the root cause of [[global warming]].  These techniques either directly remove greenhouse gases, or alternatively seek to influence natural processes to remove greenhouse gases indirectly.  The discipline overlaps with [[carbon capture and storage]] and [[carbon sequestration]], and some projects listed may not be considered to be climate engineering by all commentators, instead being described as [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wigley TM |title=A combined mitigation/geoengineering approach to climate stabilization |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5798 |pages=452–4 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16973840 |doi=10.1126/science.1131728 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16973840 |bibcode=2006Sci...314..452W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon sequestration==
{{main|Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage|Carbon neutral fuel|Carbon sequestration|Carbon dioxide removal}}
A wide range of techniques for [[carbon sequestration]] exist.  These range from ideas to remove [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] from the atmosphere ([[carbon dioxide air capture]]), flue gases ([[carbon capture and storage]]) and by preventing carbon in [[biomass]] from re-entering the atmosphere, such as with [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] (BECCS).

==Chlorofluorocarbon photochemistry==
Atmospheric [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC) removal is an idea which suggests using [[lasers]] to break up CFCs, an important family of greenhouse gases, in the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Stix, T.H.  |title=Removal of chlorofluorocarbons from the troposphere |booktitle=1993 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science |page=135 |publisher=[[IEEE]] |date=7–9 Jun 1993 |location=Vancouver, BC, Canada |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=593398&amp;isnumber=12731 |doi=10.1109/PLASMA.1993.593398 |isbn=0-7803-1360-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30759">'''Human rights movement''' refers to a [[nongovernmental]] [[social movement]] engaged in activism related to the issues of [[human rights]]. The foundations of the global human rights movement involve resistance to: colonialism, imperialism, slavery, racism, apartheid, patriarchy, and oppression of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 19. "In fact, the modern civil rights movement and the complex normative international framework have grown out of a number of transnational and widespread movements. Human rights were invoked and claimed in the contexts of anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism, anti-slavery, anti-apartheid, anti-racism, and feminist and indigenous struggles everywhere."&lt;/ref&gt;

A key principle of the human rights movement is its appeal to [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]]: the idea that all human beings should struggle in [[solidarity]] for a common set of basic conditions that has to be followed by all.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 19–20. "...the sense of solidarity amongst those who believe they are the victims of a human rights violation can transcend class, gender, and other distinctions. This sense of connectedness is critical to understanding the changing world of human rights."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of human rights}}
Human rights activism predates the 20th century, and includes, for example, the [[abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]].&lt;ref name="Leonard2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical movements were usually concerned with a limited set of issues, and they were more local than global.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-7-9"/&gt; One account identifies the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1899|1899 Hague Convention]] as a starting point for the idea that humans have rights independent of the states that control them.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 40–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The activities of the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (originally the International Labor Organization)—founded in France by the international labor movement in the 1920s—can be seen as a precursor to the modern movements.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-7-9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; This organization was quickly embraced by the United States and European powers, perhaps as a way to counteract the [[Bolshevik]] call for global solidarity among workers.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-colonialism===
[[File:MutilatedChildrenFromCongo.jpg|thumb|300px|Human rights activists circulated images of mutilated Congolese children among concerned Europeans and Americans, pressuring the Belgium government to make political reforms]]
Another major global human rights movement grew out of [[Anti-colonialism|resistance to colonialism]]. The [[Congo Reform Association]], founded in 1904, has also been described as a foundational modern human rights movement. This group used photographs to document terror wrought by Belgians in the course of demanding rubber production in the Congo. These photographs were passed among sympathetic Europeans and Americans, including [[E. D. Morel|Edmund Morel]], [[Joseph Conrad]], and [[Mark Twain]]—who [[King Leopold's Soliloquy|wrote satirically as King Leopold]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...oh well, the pictures get sneaked around everywhere, in spite of all we can do to ferret them out and suppress them. Ten thousand pulpits and ten thousand presses are saying the good word for me all the time and placidly and convincingly denying the mutilations. Then that trivial little kodak, that a child can carry in its pocket, gets up, uttering never a word, and knocks them dumb!&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Twain]], ''[[King Leopold's Soliloquy]]'', quoted in: Bruce Michelson, ''Printer's Devil: Mark Twain and the American Publishing Revolution'', University of California Press, {{ISBN|9780520247598}}, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The photos and subsequent literature triggered international outrage at Belgian crimes committed against the Congolese.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Sliwinski, "[http://tps.jkdweb.biz/sites/default/files/uploads/Sliwinski_Kodak_Congo.pdf The Childhood of Human Rights: The Kodak on the Congo]", ''Journal of Visual Culture'' 5(3), 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the century went on, African Americans including [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]], and Paul Robeson joined with leaders of the [[African diaspora]] (from Haiti, Liberia, the Philippines, and elsewhere) to make a global demand for basic rights.&lt;ref&gt;Von Eschen, ''Race Against Empire'' (1997), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skretny&gt;John David Skretny, "The effect of the Cold War on African-American civil rights: America and the world audience, 1945–1968", ''Theory and Society'' 27(2), 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the origins of this movement were multifaceted (owing strength both to the capitalist [[Marcus Garvey]] and to the more left-wing [[African Blood Brotherhood]]), a definitive moment of international solidarity came after [[Second Italo–Ethiopian War|Italy's annexation of Ethiopia]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Von Eschen, ''Race Against Empire'' (1997), pp. 10–11. "The Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 marked an especially critical moment in the articulation of diaspora thought and politics. Paul Robeson claimed it was a watershed for black American consciousness, since it exposed 'the parallel between [black American] interests and those of oppressed peoples abroad.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II and the United Nations===
In the [[aftermath of World War II]], the Pan-Africanist contingent played a major role in causing the United Nations to explicitly protect "human rights" in its founding documents. Du Bois compared colonies across the world to ghettos in the United States and called for a world document affirming the human rights of all people.&lt;ref name="Skretny"/&gt;

Representatives of small countries (particularly from Latin America), as well as Du Bois and other activists, were unhappy with the version of human rights envisioned for the UN Charter at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois stated at the time that, evidently, "the only way to human equality is through the philanthropy of the masters".&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the US government supported powerful domestic organizations willing to promote its concept of human rights, such as the [[American Bar Association]] and the [[American Jewish Committee]]. These organizations won public approval of the United Nations and the human rights concept.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of human rights was indeed built into [[United Nations]] with institutions such as the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Active diplomacy by Latin American countries was instrumental to the process of promoting these ideas and drafting the relevant agreements. As a result of this pressure, more human rights language was adopted at the 1945 [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|San Francisco Conference]] to create the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 118. "These proposals were reintroduced in San Francisco during the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Latin America's significant intellectual production supporting human rights is a major reason the region has been called 'the forgotten crucible' of universal human rights. Latin American jurisprudence was particularly well suited to bridging cultural divides in human rights by linking civil and political rights with economic and social rights."&lt;/ref&gt; Revelations about the [[Holocaust]], followed by the [[Nuremberg Trials]], also had a major influence on the movement,&lt;ref name="Neier2012-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Langley1999"/&gt; particularly among Jewish and Christian lobbying groups.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Some NGO's represented the UN charter as a victory for the human rights movement, while other activists argued that it paid lipservice to human rights while basically serving the interests of the great powers.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 136–138. "A few activists, in particular those whose agenda focused on racial equality and decolonization, were dismayed by the results of San Francisco. The NAACP and allied groups, which had invested significant time, resources, and hopes in using the global forum to highlight the evils of entrenched racism inside the United States and internationally, were bitterly disappointed at the outcome. To no avail, they criticized the failure to dent the vastly unequal power relations operating both between states and within their borders. Rayford Logan, civil rights activist and chair of the history department at Howard University, characterized the human rights articles in the Charter as a 'tragic joke'. But these were minority voices. Just as Roosevelt anticipated, the NGO consultants were thrilled with the role they had played in establishing the organization and fanned out across the country to spread the good news."&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the [[Cold War]], the "human rights" concept was used to promote the ideological agendas of the superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] argued that people in colonized lands around the world had been exploited by Western powers. A large percentage of [[Soviet propaganda]] to the [[Third World]] centered on charges of racism and human rights violations. The United States countered with its own propaganda, describing its own society as free and the Soviet Union's as unfree. Human rights language became an international standard, which could be used by great powers or by people's movements to make demands.&lt;ref name=Skretny/&gt;

===Global human rights struggles===
Within the United States, participants in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] called for human rights in addition to civil rights. Du Bois, the [[National Negro Congress]] (NNC), the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), the [[Civil Rights Congress]] (CRC), and other activists, soon began charging the U.S. with human rights violations at the U.N. In 1951, Du Bois, [[William L. Patterson|William Patterson]] and the CRC presented a document called "[[We Charge Genocide]]" which accused the US of complicity with ongoing systematic violence against [[African American]]s.&lt;ref name=Skretny/&gt;

[[An Appeal for Human Rights]], published by Atlanta students in 1960, is cited as a key moment in beginning the wave of [[nonviolent direct action]]s that swept the [[American South]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Hatfield, "[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3615 Atlanta Sit-ins]", ''The New Georgia Encyclopedia'', 28 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, less than a year before he was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassinated]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] began to argue that the concept of "civil rights" was laden with isolating, individualistic [[Capitalism|capitalist]] values. He said: "It is necessary for us to realize that we have moved from the era of civil rights to the era of human rights. When you deal with human rights you are not dealing with something clearly defined in the Constitution. They are rights that are clearly defined by the mandates of a humanitarian concern."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Trumbore, "[http://blog.timesunion.com/trumbore/from-civil-rights-to-human-rights-kings-legacy-for-us/986/ From Civil Rights to Human Rights, King’s Legacy For Us]", ''Times Union'', 15 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For King, who began to organize the multi-racial [[Poor People's Campaign]] at the end of his life, human rights required [[economic justice]] in addition to [[de jure]] equality.&lt;ref&gt;Tomas F. Jackson, ''From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., And the Struggle for Economic Justice'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007. {{ISBN|9780812239690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[decolonization of Africa]] and [[Decolonization of Asia|of Asia]], former colonies gained majority status in the UN's Commission on Human Rights, and focused their attention on global [[white supremacy]] and [[economic inequality]]—in doing so, choosing to admit other types of human rights abuses. Some of these nations argued that focusing on civil rights, as opposed to human rights, was a privilege available only to the wealthy nations that had benefited from colonialism.&lt;ref name=Skretny/&gt; Demands for human rights in the [[Third World]] increased throughout the 1960s, even as the global superpowers turned their attention elsewhere.&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka&gt;Kiyoteru Tsutsui and Christine Min Wotipka, "Global Civil Society and the International Human Rights Movement: Citizen Participation in Human Rights International Nongovernmental Organization", ''Social Forces'' 83(2), 2004; accessed [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3598341 via JStor], DOI: 10.1353/sof.2005.0022.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in the 1970s===
Since the 1970s the human rights movement has played an increasingly important role on the international scene.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.)Bertucci1996"/&gt; Although government support for human rights decreased, international organizations increased in strength and number.&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka/&gt; Some of the events of the 1970s, which gave global prominence to the human movements issue, included the abuses of Chilean [[Augusto Pinochet]] and American [[Richard Nixon]] administrations; the signing of the [[Helsinki Accords]] (1975) between [[Western world|the West]] and the [[USSR]]; the [[Soweto riots]] in [[South Africa]]; awarding of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to [[Amnesty International]] (1977); and the emergence of the [[Democracy Wall]] movement in China.&lt;ref name="H.)Bertucci1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neier2012-3-4"/&gt; Nixon was succeeded by the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration, much more supportive of the human rights issues.

Pressure from the international human rights movement brought human rights increasingly to the political agenda of numerous countries and diplomatic negotiations.&lt;ref name="H.)Bertucci1996"/&gt; As the issue of human rights became important for [[dissidents]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] ([[Human rights movement in the Soviet Union|Soviet human rights movement]], [[Charter 77]], [[Workers' Defence Committee]]), this period also saw a growing [[framing (sociology)|reframing]] of the struggle between the West and USSR from the economic terms ("[[communism]] versus [[free market]]") into a struggle for human rights ("[[totalitarianism]] versus [[liberty]]").&lt;ref name="Neier2012-13"/&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]], the issues of human rights have been present in a number of major political and military conflicts, debated by global public opinion, from [[Kosovo]] to [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Darfur]].&lt;ref name="Neier2012-17"/&gt;

Originally, most international human rights organizations came from France and the UK; since the 1970s American organizations moved beyond rights for Americans to partake in the international scene, and around the turn of the century, as noted by Neier, "the movement became so global in character that it is no longer possible to ascribe leadership to any particular [national or regional] segment".&lt;ref name="Neier2012-10-11"/&gt; However, others, like [[Bonny Ibhawoh|Ibhawoh]], point out that there still is a gap between regions, particularly as most of the international human rights movement organizations are located in the [[global North]], and thus continuous concerns are raised about their understanding of the situations in the [[global South]].&lt;ref name="BellCoicaud2006"/&gt;

===Since the 1990s===
The global human rights movement has become more expansive since the 1990s, including greater representation of women's rights and economic justice as part of the human rights umbrella. [[Economic, social and cultural rights|Economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights]] gained new prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Dorsey, ''New Rights Advocacy'' (2008), p. 14. "Since the mid-1990s the human rights movement has begun to take seriously the economic and social rights guaranteed in the international human rights covenants; development and human rights NGOs have joined in human rights–driven social movements for food, health, education, water, and other rights, often challenging development orthodoxy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for women's human rights (sometimes identifying as part of the [[feminist movement]]), criticized the early human rights movement for focusing on male concerns and artificially excluding women's issues from the [[public sphere]]. Women's rights have nevertheless gained prominence in the international human rights movement, particularly insofar as they include protection from [[gender-based violence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlotte Bunch]], "Transforming Human Rights From a Feminist Perspective", in ''Women's Rights, Human Rights'', (1995) ed. Stone &amp; Wolper.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Latin America]], the issue of women's human rights intersects with the struggle against authoritarian governments. In many cases (see: the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]]) women's groups were some of the most prominent advocates of human rights in general.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;Elisabeth Friedman, "Women's Human Rights: The Emergence of a Movement", in ''Women's Rights, Human Rights'', (1995) ed. Stone &amp; Wolper.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream acceptance of women's human rights within the international human rights movement has increased since 1989.&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;

The authority of the United Nations human rights framework diminished in the 1990s, partly due to the emphasis on economic liberalization that followed the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Dorsey, ''New Rights Advocacy'' (2008), p. 51. "The 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna was expected by some to be a celebration of the post–cold war era, the new freedom of the United Nations to operate in a less politicized international environment, and NGO human rights successes. Instead it marked a watershed moment for the integrity of the human rights system, as NGOs battled a coalition of governments determined to undermine the principle of the universality of human rights standards and weaken the UN human rights system. [...] The challenge to shore up the fundamental concept of universality of rights was compounded by shifts in the foreign policy priorities of Western governments. A new Democratic administration in the United States made promoting free-market democracies, rather than human rights, its top priority, resulting in human rights regressions, including the delinking of trade and aid from human rights guarantees (Mann 1999)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s also saw a call to "defend the defenders" of human rights—to protect human rights activists from violence and repression.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Dorsey, ''New Rights Advocacy'' (2008), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there has been an increase in the number of attacks on the activists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has come to a standstill as individuals continue to push for liberation but are unable to report their findings out of fear of harm or death. The number of female activists has been growing since the beginning of the Feminist movement however, there have been increased number of attacks on women. Recently, the Taliban targeted the female activists to send a message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[internet]] has expanded the power of the human rights movement by improving communication between activists in different physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;Halpin and Hoskins,  ''Human Rights and the Internet'' (2000), pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as mediated mobilization. Individuals who are using their voices to communicate about the injustices are now able to communicate with like minded people who use their voices through participatory journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The human rights movement has historically focused on abuses by states, and some have argued that it has not attended closely enough to the actions of corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. xix. "...business corporations (especially transnational ones) are often more powerful than states, and therefore enjoy the capacity to promote or undermine the rights and well-being of individuals and groups. Yet, the human rights movement, as it initially developed, did not seek to make business corporations accountable for human rights abuses, such as child labor, business-supported political repression, environmental degradation, and sexual harassment..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some first steps were taken towards holding corporations accountable for human rights abuses. For example, the Parliament of Britain approved a resolution to censure [[British Petroleum]] for funding Colombian death squads.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and activities==
[[File:United Workers picketers.jpg|thumb|270px|[[United Workers]] demonstrating for human rights and fair development in Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]].]]
The international human rights movement is concerned with issues such as deprivation of life and liberty, deprivation of the right of [[free speech|free and peaceful expressions]], gatherings and worship,&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; equal treatment regardless of individual background, and opposition to unjust and cruel practices such as [[torture]].&lt;ref name="Neier2012-2-3"/ 
Other issues include opposition to the death penalty&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 41, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; and to child labor.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the human rights movement is local in nature, concerned with human rights violations in their own countries, but they rely on an international network of support.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-11"/&gt; The international nature of the movement allows local activists to broadcast their concerns, sometimes generating international pressure on their home government.&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka/&gt; The movement generally espouses the principle that sovereignty ends where human rights begin. This principle justifies intervention across borders to rectify perceived violations.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The human rights movement is also credited with supplying local activists with a vocabulary to use in support of their claims.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;[[David Kennedy (jurist)|David Kennedy]], "[http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dkennedy/publications/humanrights.pdf The International Human Rights Movement: Part of the Problem?]" 15 ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'' 101, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and criticism==
One major schism within the international human rights movement has been between NGOs and activists from the [[First World|First]] and [[Third World|Third]] Worlds. Critics of the mainstream movement have argued that it suffers from systemic biases and is unwilling to confront inequality on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some critique the role of neoliberal capitalism in creating economic conditions that engender 'human rights violations', arguing that the dominant human rights movement is blind to these dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 325–326.&lt;/ref&gt; (''See also:'' [[structural adjustment]].) [[Makau W. Mutua|Makau Mutua]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As currently constituted and deployed, the human rights movement will ultimately fail because it is perceived as an alien ideology in non-Western societies. The movement does not deeply resonate in the cultural fabrics of non-Western states, except among hypocritical elites steeped in Western ideas. In order ultimately to prevail, the human rights movement must be moored in the cultures of all peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[Makau W. Mutua|Makau Mutua]], ''Human Rights: A Political and Cultural Critique'' (2002), quoted in Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Kennedy (jurist)|David Kennedy]] has criticized a tendency of the international human rights movement to "treat human rights as an object of devotion rather than calculation", arguing that human rights language is vague and may impede [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] assessments of a situation. Kennedy also argues that this vocabulary can be "misused, distorted, or co-opted", and that framing issues in terms of human rights may narrow the field of possibility and exclude other narratives.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; Others have also critiqued the movement and its language as vague.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that the human rights movement has a tendency to subtly debase people by portraying them as victims of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), pp. 160–161. "Some critics argue that human rights organizations may tend to generate a narrative that reinforces images of helpless victims oppressed by an alien culture; in turn, this could be said to continue imperialism by other means."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Particularly since the 1970s, the international human rights movement has been mediated by [[nongovernmental organization]]s (NGOs).&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka/&gt;

Major international human rights organizations include [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="Neier2012-186"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neier2012-204"/&gt;

Historically, the influence of the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] is seen as highly important on the movement.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-7-9"/&gt;

The creation of the [[International Criminal Court]] at the turn of the 21st century is seen as another achievement of the international human rights activists.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-18"/&gt;

'''Informative modelling''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]  methodological approach 
linking [[information technologies]] with architectural analysis and [[Architectural model|modelling]] 
(at various scales, from architectural elements to [[building]]s and structures). 
Informative modelling aims at improving the way [[information]] and evidences about how architectural objects evolved through time can be visually displayed.

Informative modelling applies to the study of historic architecture, where objects have most often been widely transformed, and consequently where what is known about objects remains partial. As a consequence, whereas in traditional architectural modelling a realistic representation 
of objects is considered as an end, in the informative modelling methodology the representation of architectural objects is used primarily as support for [[scientific visualization|information search and visualisation]], [[reasoning]] and [[cognition]]:
it does not strive for realism.

Abstraction (the ''infovis'' legacy) and figuration (the ''architectural representation'' legacy) are integrated as alternative/mixable modes of representation, allowing partial knowledge to be communicated and important notions in historic sciences such as data [[uncertainty]] to be conveyed graphically.

Informative modelling puts the data about evolutions of architectural artefacts first, 
and provides rules for outputting [[2D computer graphics|2D]]/[[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics thought to become sustainable investigation 
and [[Software visualization|visualization]] tools (knowledge and discovery tools, as J.Bertin says it), striving for the readability 
of a dynamic geographical map. Examples of such rules are accessibility of the underlying documentary 
justification (archives, research material, etc.), information credibility assessment, visual underlining 
of lacking information, relation to an exogenous theoretical model of architectural elements, dynamic visualisation, 
research process progress assessment, etc.

Informative modelling has roots in architectural modelling, [[:Category:3D imaging]], [[:Category:3D computer graphics]], [[Georeference]], [[database]], 
[[scientific modelling]], [[scientific visualization]], [[knowledge visualization]], [[Knowledge management]], [[information retrieval]], [[Information science]], [[Computer graphics]], [[Information graphics]], 
and intersects methods and issues stemming from these disciplines.

{{Islam|history}}
'''Islam and modernity''' is a topic of discussion in contemporary [[sociology of religion]]. The [[history of Islam]] chronicles different interpretations and approaches.  [[Modernity]] is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon rather than a unified and coherent one.  It has historically had different schools of thought moving in many directions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Responsibilities of the Muslim Intellectual in the 21st Century'', [[Abdolkarim Soroush]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial Revolution's impact on Islam ==

In the 18th century [[Europe]] was undergoing major transformations as the new ideas of [[the Enlightenment]], which stressed the importance of science, rationality, and human reason, and the new technologies of the [[Industrial Revolution]] swept across Europe, giving Europeans great power and influence. In the last quarter of the 18th century, the gap widened between the technical skills of some western and northern European countries and those of the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hourani | first1 = Albert | title = A History of the Arab Peoples | year = 1991 | pages = 259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of modern Europe coincided with what many scholars refer to as the decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which by the 18th century was facing political, military, and economic breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Esposito | first1 = Jonh L. | title = Islam: The Straight Path | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; While prior to the 18th century the Ottomans had regarded themselves to be either of superior or, by the mid-18th century, of equal strength to Europe, by the end of the 18th century the power relationship between the Ottoman Empire and Europe began to shift in Europe's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hourani | first1 = Albert | title = A History of the Arab Peoples | year = 1991 | pages = 258–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French occupation of the Ottoman Empire===
In 1798 [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army occupied the Ottoman province of [[Egypt]] and killed roughly 3000 Egyptians. Although the occupation was only three years, followed by lingering hostility to the French, the experience ultimately exposed the Egyptian people to Enlightenment ideas and Europe's new technology.&lt;ref name="The Arabs: A History"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rogan | first1 = Eugene | title = The Arabs: A History | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2009 | pages = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman scholars in Europe===
The exposure to European power and ideas would later inspire the new governor of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], to draw on this technology to modernize Egypt, setting an example for the rest of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman government began to open [[embassies]] and send officials to study in Europe. This created conditions for the "gradual formation of a group of reformers with a certain knowledge of the modern world and a conviction that the empire must belong to it or perish".&lt;ref name="AH1983: 43"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.43&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the scholars sent by Muhammad Ali to Europe in 1826 was [[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi|Rifa'a Rafi' al-Tahtawi]]. The five years he spent in [[Paris]] left a permanent mark on him. After his return to Egypt he wrote about his impressions of France and translated numerous European works into [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Tahtawi was impressed with Europe's technological and scientific advancement and political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rogan | first1 = Eugene | title = The Arabs: A History | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2009 | pages = 86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having studied [[Islamic Law]], he argued that "it was necessary to adapt the [[Sharia]] to new circumstances" and that there was not much difference between "the principles of Islamic law and those principles of 'natural law' on which the codes of modern Europe were based".&lt;ref name="AH1983: 75"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Tahtawi, Khayr al-Din was also sent to Paris where he spent four years. After his return from Europe he wrote a book in which he argued that the only way to strengthen the Muslim States was by borrowing ideas and institutions from Europe, and that this did not contradict the spirit of the Sharia.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 88"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: pp.88&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modernization reforms in the Ottoman Empire ===
In the period between 1839 and 1876 the Ottoman government began instituting large-scale reforms as a way to modernize and strengthen the empire.{{clarify||This subsection needs work. Since the Empire was widely called "The Sick Man of Europe" the reforms didn't work. So an analyst needs to tell us why|date=December 2010}} Known as the [[Tanzimat]], many of these reforms involved adopting successful European practices that were considered antithetical to conservative Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rogan | first1 = Eugene | title = The Arabs: A History | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2009 | pages = 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to military and administrative reforms, Ottoman rulers implemented reforms in the sphere of education, law, and the economy. This included new universities and changes in curricula, as well new economic systems and institutions. There were also European-inspired changes to law that restricted Islamic law to family affairs such as marriage and inheritance.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esposito|first1=John L., |chapter="Contemporary Islam" |title=The Oxford History of Islam|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/book/islam-9780195107999/islam-9780195107999-chapter-15 |editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Ottoman Empire]] was the first{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Muslim country]] where modernity surfaced, with major shifts in scientific and legal thought.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 970"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.970&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1834, [[Ishak Efendi]] published ''Mecmua-i Ulum-i Riyaziye'', a four volume text introducing many modern scientific concepts to the Muslim world. [[Kudsi Efendi]] also published ''Asrar al-Malakut'' in 1846 in an attempt to reconcile [[Copernican revolution|Copernican astronomy]] with Islam. The first modern Turkish chemistry text was published in 1848, and the first modern Biology text in 1865.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.971&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the Turks adopted the metric system in 1869. These shifts in scientific thought coincided with [[Tanzimat]], a reform policy undertaken by the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire that was inspired by French [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. This reform confined [[sharia]] to family law.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 970"/&gt; The key figure in the Turkish modernist movement was [[Namik Kemal]], the editor of a journal called ''Freedom''. His goal was to promote [[freedom of the press]], the [[separation of powers]], [[equality before the law]], scientific freedom, and a reconciliation between [[parliamentary democracy]] and the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 970"/&gt;

===The Greater Muslim world===
The influence of modernism in the Muslim world resulted in a cultural revival.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"/&gt; Dramatic plays became more common, as did newspapers. Notable European works were analyzed and translated.

Legal reform was attempted in Egypt, Tunisia, the Ottoman Empire, and Iran, and in some cases these reforms were adopted.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 974"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.974&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to restrict the power of government. Polygamy was ended in India.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 975"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.975&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan granted suffrage to women in 1918 (before several European countries).&lt;ref name="PW2001: 975"/&gt;

At the recommendations of reform-minded Islamic scholars, western sciences were taught in new schools.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 974"/&gt; Much of this had to do with the intellectual appeal of [[social Darwinism]], since it led to the conclusion that an old-fashioned Muslim society could not compete in the modern world.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 974"/&gt;

In 19th century [[Iran]], [[Mirza Malkom Khan]] arrived after being educated in [[Paris]]. He created a newspaper called ''Qanun'', where he advocated the [[separation of powers]], secular law, and a [[bill of rights]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"/&gt; [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]], who was politically active in the Islamic world and published the pamphlet "Al-'Urwa al-Wuthqà" during a brief spell in France, proclaiming that Europe had become successful due to its laws and its science. He became critical of other Muslim scholars for stifling scientific thought,&lt;ref name="PW2001: 972"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.972&lt;/ref&gt; and hoped to encourage scientific inquiry in the [[Muslim world]].

== Modernism, religion and ideology==
 {{Aqidah|Five Pillars}}

===Islamic Modernism===
{{main article|Islamic Modernism}}
Modernism impacted interpretations of Islam. One movement was Islamic Modernism, which was both an attempt to provide an Islamic response to the challenges presented by European colonial expansion, and an effort to reinvigorate and reform Islam from within as a way to counter the perceived weakness and decline of Muslim societies in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It called for "a 'reformation' or reinterpretation ([[ijtihad]]) of Islam", and emerged in the Muslim world from Egypt to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

Islamic modernists argued that Islam and modernity were compatible and "asserted the need to reinterpret and reapply the principles and ideals of Islam to formulate new responses to the political, scientific, and cultural challenges of the West and of modern life".&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt; The reforms they proposed challenged the status quo maintained by the conservative Muslims scholars ([[ulama]]), who saw the established law as the ideal order that had to be followed and upheld the doctrine of [[taqlid]] (imitation / blind following). Islamic modernists saw the resistance to change on the part of the conservative ulama as a major cause for the problems the Muslim community was facing as well as its inability to counter western hegemony.

====Modernists====
[[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] (1838–1897) is regarded as one of the pioneers of Islamic modernism. He believed that Islam was compatible with science and reason and that in order to counter European power the Muslim world had to embrace progress.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 103–129"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: pp.103–129&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Abduh]] (1849–1905) was a disciple and collaborator of al-Afghani. He was even more influential than his master and is often referred to as the founder of Islamic modernism. Abduh was born and raised in Egypt and was a scholar of Islam (alim). He taught at [[al-Azhar]] and other institutions and in 1899 became [[Mufti]] of Egypt. Abduh believed that the Islamic world was suffering from an inner decay and was in need of a revival.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 136"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.136&lt;/ref&gt; Asserting that "Islam could be the moral basis of a modern and progressive society",&lt;ref name="AH1983: 140"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.140&lt;/ref&gt; he was critical of both [[secularists]] and the conservative ulama. He called for a legal reform and the reinterpretation (ijtihad) of Islamic law according to modern conditions. While critical of the West, he believed that it was necessary to borrow or assimilate what was good from it.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 156"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.156&lt;/ref&gt;  Abduh became a leading judge in [[Egypt]] after political activities in Paris as al-Afghani's assistant. He pushed for secular law, religious reform, and education for girls.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 972"/&gt; He hoped that Egypt would ultimately become a free republic, much like how France had transformed from an absolute monarchy.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.973&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Rashid Rida]] (1869–1935) also became active in the Egyptian modernization movement as Abduh's disciple, although he was born and educated in [[Syria]]. ''Al-Manar'' was his journal, through which he initially advocated greater openness to science and foreign influence.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"/&gt; He also stated that sharia was relatively silent about agriculture, industry, and trade, and that these areas of knowledge needed renewal.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"/&gt; He would eventually evolve to conservative positions close to Wahhabism. [[Qasim Amin]] was another reformer in Egypt and Abduh's disciple who was heavily concerned with the rights of women.

Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi was similarly educated in Paris around the same time. He surveyed the political systems of 21 European countries in an effort to reform [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"/&gt;

Notable Modernists on the Indian subcontinent include [[Sayyid Ahmad Khan]] (1817–1898) and [[Muhammad Iqbal]] (1877–1938) in the Indian subcontinent (the latter was also the conceiver of the modern state of [[Pakistan]]). Like al-Afghani and Abduh, they rejected the doctrine of taqlid and asserted the need for Islam to be reinterpreted according to modern conditions.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

Other Modernists include [[Mahmud Tarzi]] of [[Afghanistan]], [[Chiragh Ali]] of [[India]], [[Ahmad Dahlan]] of [[Java]], and [[Wang Jingzhai]] of [[China]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"/&gt;

Although Islamic modernists were subject to the criticism that the reforms they promoted amounted to westernizing Islam, their legacy was significant and their thought influenced future generations of reformers.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

==== Pakistan and Turkey ====

[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the founder of [[Pakistan]], was also a prominent Muslim modernist of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dawn.com/2012/12/25/muslim-modernism-and-jinnah/|title=Muslim modernism and Jinnah|work=Dawn|date=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/awpreview/pDetails.aspx?pType=PressRelease&amp;pID=82|title=Jinnah's vision of Pakistan|work=Pakistan Army|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Islamism sidebar|Manifestations}}
In some parts of the world, the project of Islamic modernity continued from the same trajectory before World War I. This was especially the case in the new [[Republic of Turkey]], under [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. But in Egypt, [[Hassan al-Banna]] founded the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the first [[Islamist]] organization, which had no interest in reinterpreting Islam to make it compatible with modernity.

Turkey has continued to be at the forefront of modernising Islam. In 2008 its Department of Religious Affairs launched a review of all the [[hadith]]s, the sayings of [[Mohammed]] upon which most of [[sharia|Islamic law]] is based. The School of Theology at [[Ankara University]] undertook this forensic examination with the intent of removing centuries of often conservative cultural baggage and rediscovering the spirit of reason in the original message of Islam. One expert at London's [[Chatham House]] compared these revisions to the Christian [[Protestant Reformation]]. Turkey has also trained hundreds of women as theologians, and sent them senior [[imam]]s known as ''vaizes'' all over the country, away from the relatively liberal capital and coastal cities, to explain these re-interpretations at town hall meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7264903.stm "Turkey in radical revision of Islamic texts"]  Robert Pigott, Religious affairs correspondent, [[BBC News]], 26 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After World War I ===
The aftermath of [[World War I]] resulted in the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|fall of the Ottoman Empire]] and the [[History of the middle east#European domination|domination]] of the Middle East by European powers such as Britain and France. Intellectual historians such as [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] suggest that World War I marks the end of the main Islamic modernist movements, and that this is the point where many Muslims "lost faith with the culture of science and materialism",&lt;ref name="PW2001: 1096"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.1096&lt;/ref&gt; but that several parallel intellectual streams emerged thereafter.

=== Arab socialism ===
{{Main article|Arab socialism}}

[[Arab socialism]] of the [[Baath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] and [[Nasserism|Nasserite]] movement emerged as a stream of thought during decolonialization of Arab countries. It emphasized ethnicity, culture, politics and played down the role of religion.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 1096"/&gt; Its popularity peaked in the 50s and 60s.

As a political ideology based on an amalgamation of [[Pan-Arabism]] and socialism, Arab socialism is distinct from the much broader tradition of socialist thought in the Arab world which predates Arab socialism by as much as 50 years. [[Michel Aflaq]], the principal founder of ba'athism and the Ba'ath Party, coined the term in order to distinguish his version of socialist ideology from the [[Marxism|Marxist socialism]] in Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia, and [[social democracy]] in Western Europe.

The [[Six-Day War]] between [[Israel]] and its neighbours ended in a decisive loss for the Muslim side. Many in the Islamic world saw this as the failure of socialism. It was at this point that "fundamental and militant Islam began to fill the political vacuum created".&lt;ref name="PW2001: 1096"/&gt;

=== Islamic fundamentalism ===
{{Further information|Islamic revival}}

In the late 20th century an Islamic Revival or Islamic Awakening developed in the [[Muslim World]]. (Islamic fundamentalism is the common term in the West used to refer to contemporary Islamic revivalism, according to John Esposito.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esposito|first1=John L.|title=Islamic Fundamentalism|url=http://www.notredamedesion.org/en/dialogue_docs.php?a=3b&amp;id=16|website=Notre Dame de Sion|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

It was manifested in greater religious piety and in a growing adoption of [[Islamic culture]].&lt;ref name="Lapidus 11"&gt;Lapidus, p.823&lt;/ref&gt; One striking example of it is the increase in attendance at the ''[[Hajj]]'', the annual pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], which grew from 90,000 in 1926 to 2 million in 1979.&lt;ref name=Kepel-75&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''Jihad: on the Trail of Political Islam'', Harvard University Press, 2002, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; But the said increase in the number of pilgrims may also be attributed to other factors such as increase in populations, modern transportation facilities and to some extent the over all financial prosperity of the Muslims all over the world thus making the Pilgrimage affordable to more and more Muslim populations.

Two of the most important events that fueled or inspired the resurgence were the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo]] and subsequent quadrupling of the price of oil in the mid-1970s, and the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] that established an [[Islamic republic]] in [[Iran]] under [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]]. The first created a flow of many billions of dollars from [[Saudi Arabia]] to fund Islamic books, scholarships, fellowships, and [[mosque]]s around the world; the second undermined the assumption that [[Westernization]] strengthened [[List of Muslim majority countries|Muslim countries]] and was the irreversible trend of the future.&lt;ref name=Kepel-75/&gt;

The revival is a reversal of the Westernisation approach common in Arab and Asian governments earlier in the 20th century. It is often associated with the political Islamic movement, [[Islamism]], and other forms of [[Islamization|re-Islamisation]]. While the revival has also been accompanied by some religious extremism and attacks on civilians and military targets by the extremists, this represents only a small part of the revival.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!-- per the IP editor --&gt;

The revival has also seen a proliferation of [[Islamic extremist groups]] in the [[Middle East]] and elsewhere in the Muslim World, who have voiced their anger at perceived exploitation as well as  materialism, Westernization, [[democracy]] and modernity, which are most commonly associated with accepting Western secular beliefs and values. The spread of secularism has caused great concerns among many [[Islamic political groups]]. It has been the reasoning for the Islamization of politics and protest, due to the large Muslim majority in the Middle East as well as the region's imperial past.&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, L (2005) ''International Relations of the Middle East'', UK: Oxford University Press, p 72&lt;/ref&gt; For Islamic countries in the Middle East, there is not necessarily a problem as such with modernity, however, "the problem is when modernity comes wrapped with westernization, with absolutely and utterly rampant materialism".&lt;ref&gt;BBC News online, ''Islam and the West'', Monday, 12 August 2002, 14:11 GMT 15:11 UK&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'' (1994), the author N. Ayubi explained what he believes to be the two main concerns of Islamic political movements and extremist groups in the Middle East; 1) the Western belief in a bureaucratic state and 2) the secular values and beliefs associated with concepts such as modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Ayubi, N. N. M. (1994) ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'', London: Routledge p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Esposito:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The tendency to judge the actions of Muslims in splendid isolation, to generalize from the actions of the few to the many, to disregard similar excesses committed in the name of other religions and ideologies ... is not new.&lt;ref&gt;Milton-Edwards, B(1999) ''Islamic Politics in Palestine'', UK: I. B. Tauris &amp; Co Ltd, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of militant Islamic movements calling for "an Islamic state and the end of Western influence" is relatively small.&lt;ref&gt;Ayubi, N. N. M. (1994) ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'', London: Routledge p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; According to polls taken in 2008 and 2010 by Pew and Gallop, pluralities of the population in Muslim-majority countries are undecided as to what extent religion (and certain interpretations of) should influence public life, politics, and the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/press/109693/Islam-Democracy.aspx/ "Islam and Democracy"]"Gallup Poll", February 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ "Most Embrace a Role for Islam in Politics, Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah"].

'''Ivan Tyrrell''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪr|əl}}; born 18 October 1943) is a British educator, writer, and artist. He lives with his wife Véronique in the [[Cotswolds]], England.

== Artist ==

Tyrrell left [[Wallington County Grammar School]] to study art as an apprentice at F.G. Marshal in 1959. In 1962 he began a fine arts course at [[Croydon Art College]] and was taught painting by [[Bridget Riley]], [[Barry Fantoni]] and [[John Hoyland]] among others. He left college disillusioned with the art world and worked in London advertising studios before setting up a [[graphic design]] company in 1971 on the [[South Coast of England|South Coast]] in Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;Carver Tyrrell Ltd. Company number 1105253. Registered address: 97 Church St, Brighton E Sussex BN1 1UJ. Information from Companies House, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two silk-screen posters produced with fellow artist Frederick Carver featured in ''Les Sixties'', a Paris exhibition of [[psychedelic art]] that then transferred to the [[Brighton Festival]] and… “the spectral, hallucinatory scenarios of [[J.G. Ballard]], especially in his novel ''[[The Crystal World]]'' – bodied forth in Tyrrell’s apocalyptic poster design."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sixties. Britain and France, 1962–1973. The Utopian Years'', edited by [[David Alan Mellor]] and [[Laurent Gervereau]]. Published by Phillip Wilson Publishers, London. {{ISBN|978-0856674679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 Tyrrell, whilst still a student, had met the writer, [[Idries Shah]], who had begun introducing timeless ideas from the [[Sufi]] tradition into the Western world. In 1969 he was invited to attend regular gatherings of writers, poets, actors, businessmen, diplomats, academics, craftsmen and others at Shah’s home in Kent.&lt;ref&gt;This period was discussed in an interview with [[Doris Lessing]]. ''The Therapist'' (1993) Vol. 1 Issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined [[The Institute for Cultural Research]] in 1970. In 1977 Tyrrell art directed thirty-six illustrators for the first edition of ''[[World Tales]]'' by [[Idries Shah]] and contributed some illustrations himself.&lt;ref&gt;See the introductory note to the illustrations by Ivan Tyrrell in the illustrated edition of Idries Shah’s, ''World Tales'', (1979). Allan Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==

In 1987 he closed his graphic design service due to [[Black Monday (1987)|the recession]] and began learning about [[psychotherapy]]. He was shocked to discover how bad training was: most psychotherapists had little basic knowledge of psychology and worked mainly from simplistic and cult-like therapy movements.&lt;ref name="Shattered lives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.humangivens.com/2012/06/hg-library-shattered-lives-interview.html|title=Shattered lives interview - hypnosis, suggestibility, cult formation and psychotherapy malpractice|date=26 June 2012|work=Human Givens Blog|publisher=HG Library|accessdate=29 March 2014}}Ivan Tyrrell’s discussion with [[Mark Pendergrast]] and Frances Hill in ''The Therapist'', 1997, Volume 4, No 3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human Givens Journal ===

In 1993, encouraged by the psychiatrist and writer [[Robin Skynner]], author [[Doris Lessing]], psychologist Joe Griffin and Idries Shah, he launched a journal, ''The Therapist'', in an attempt to inject some scientific rigour and common sense into the field. Medical journalist Denise Winn was appointed Editor in 1997 and Ivan Tyrrell became General Editor. In 2000 its name was changed to ''Human Givens'', to reflect the growing interest in the Human Givens approach to psychotherapy, behaviour and education that he was developing with Griffin. Human Givens is now the official journal of the Human Givens Institute. The journal gave him the opportunity of publishing interviews with people whose ideas interested him such as: [[Richard Bentall]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Robin Skynner]], [[Margaret Heffernan]], [[John Cacioppo]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hgi.org.uk/archive/interviews.htm Archive in HGI website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching ===

Tyrrell began teaching courses in psychology and psychotherapy in 1996 and is now director with [[Joe Griffin (psychologist)|Joe Griffin]] of Human Givens College. The Griffin/Tyrrell collaboration contributed to psychotherapy and consciousness studies and publications. Their [[Human givens|human givens approach]] is now endorsed by [[Human givens#Research and evidence|peer-reviewed papers]].

'''Japanese values''' are cultural assumptions and ideals particular to [[Japanese culture]]. The [[Honne and tatemae|honne/tatemae divide]] between public expression and private thoughts/feelings is considered to be of paramount importance in [[Japanese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Takeo Doi, ''The Anatomy of Dependence: Exploring an area of the Japanese psyche – feelings of indulgence''. Kodansha International Ltd.: 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japanese mythology]], the gods display human emotions, such as [[love]] and [[anger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B.H. |last=Chamberlain |authorlink=Basil Hall Chamberlain |year=1883 |title=A Translation of the "Ko-Ji-Ki"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these stories, behaviour that results in positive relations with others is rewarded, and empathy, identifying oneself with another, is highly valued. By contrast, those actions that are individualistic or antisocial (those that harm others) are condemned. Hurtful behaviour is punished in the myths by ostracizing the offender.

No society can exist that does not manage and integrate [[antisocial behavior]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Japanese children learn from their earliest days that human fulfillment comes from close association with others. Children learn early to recognize that they are part of an interdependent society, beginning in the family and later extending to larger groups such as neighborhood, school, playground, community, and company. Dependence on others is a natural part of the human condition; it is viewed negatively only when the social obligations ([[Giri (Japanese)|giri]]) it creates are too onerous to fulfill, leading to, for example, [[Suicide in Japan|suicide]], which is a topic of great elaboration in [[History of Japan|Japanese history]] and [[Japanese culture|culture]]. However, in the early part of the 21st century, school [[bullying]] has become a topic of very great concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School bullying in Japan |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/newsenglish/witn/2006/11/061115_bullying.shtml |accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In interpersonal relationships, most Japanese tend to avoid open [[competition]] and [[wikt:confrontation|confrontation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]], The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, 1946, page154&lt;/ref&gt; Working with others requires self-control, but it carries the rewards of pride in contributing to the group, emotional security, and social identity. [[Wa (Japanese culture)|Wa]] ({{lang|ja|和}}), the notion of harmony within a group, requires an attitude of cooperation and a recognition of social roles. If each individual in the group understands personal obligations and empathizes with the situations of others, then the group as a whole benefits. Success can come only if all put forth their best individual efforts. Decisions are often made only after consulting with everyone in the group. [[Consensus]] does not imply that there has been universal agreement, but this style of consultative decision-making involves each member of the group in an information exchange, reinforces feelings of group identity, and makes implementation of the decision smoother. Cooperation within a group also is often focused on competition between that group and a parallel one, whether the issue is one of educational success or market share. Symbols such as [[uniform]]s, names, banners, and songs identify the group as distinct from others both to outsiders and to those within the group. Participation in group activities, whether official or unofficial, is a symbolic statement that an individual wishes to be considered part of the group. Thus, [[nomikai|after-work bar hopping]] provides not only instrumental opportunities for the exchange of information and release of social tensions but also opportunities to express nonverbally a desire for continued affiliation.

Working in a group in Japan requires the development of successful channels of [[communication]], which reinforce group interdependence, and the sense of difference from those who are not members of the group. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Yet social interaction beyond that which occurs with individuals with whom one lives and works is a necessity in contemporary society. If the exchange is brief and relatively insignificant, such as buying a newspaper, anonymity will be maintained. But if the relationship is expected to continue over a long period, whether in business, marriage, employment, or neighborhood, great care is likely to be invested in establishing and maintaining good relationships. Such relationships are often begun by using the social networks of a relative, friend, or colleague who can provide an introduction to the desired person or serve as {{nihongo|go-between|仲人|nakoudo}}. The nakoudo most often refers to the person (or people) who negotiates [[omiai|marriage arrangements]], including checking each family's background, conveying questions and criticisms, and smoothing out difficulties. But this kind of personal mediation is common in many aspects of Japanese life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]], The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, 1946, page155&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4800">A '''law''' is a [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] principle that describes the fundamental nature of something, the universal properties and the relationships between things, or a description that purports to explain these principles and relationships.

== "Laws of nature " ==

{{See|Physical law}}

For example, "physical laws" such as the "[[gravity|law of gravity]]" or "[[science|scientific laws]]" attempt to describe the fundamental nature of the universe itself. Laws of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] describe the nature of rational thought and inference ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[transcendental idealism]], and differently [[G. Spencer-Brown]]'s work ''[[Laws of Form]]'', was precisely a determination of the ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' laws governing human thought before any interaction whatsoever with experience).

Within most fields of study, and in science in particular, the elevation of some principle of that field to the status of "law" usually takes place after a very long time during which the principle is used and tested and verified; though in some fields of study such laws are simply postulated as a foundation and assumed. Mathematical laws are somewhere in between: they are often arbitrary and unproven in themselves, but they are sometimes judged by how useful they are in making predictions about the real world. However, they ultimately rely on arbitrary [[axioms]].  

== "Laws of fundamentals in mathematics" ==

Some fundamental law of mathematics was introduced by '''Harsha
'''.                                                                 

'''First law of fundamentals:''' If we consider '''k''' as a constant and '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers of which the product of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''' but the product of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt;and  &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt;is not equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k}&lt;/math&gt;.    

'''Complemantry of first law of fundamentals:'''As per first law '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers and '''k''' is any constant the product of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''',then the product of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Second law of fundamentals:'''If we consider '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers and '''k''' be any constant the division of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''' and the division of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k}&lt;/math&gt; but equal    
to '''c'''.

== "Laws" in social sciences ==

Laws of [[economics]] are an attempt in [[modelization]] of economic behavior. [[Marxism]] criticized the [[belief]] in eternal "laws of economics", which it considered a product of the [[ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|dominant ideology]]. It claimed that in fact, those so-called "laws of economics" were only the historical laws of [[capitalism]], that is of a particular historical social formation. With the advent, in the 20th century, of the application of mathematical, statistical, and experimental techniques to economics, economic theory matured into a corpus of knowledge rooted in the scientific method rather than in philosophical argument.

==Miscellaneous==

Finally, the term is sometimes applied to less rigorous ideas that may be interesting observations or relationships, practical or ethical guidelines (also called [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]]), and even humorous parodies of such laws.

Examples of scientific laws include [[Boyle's law]] of gases, [[conservation law]]s, [[Ohm's law]], and others. Laws of other fields of study include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of [[philosophy]] and [[Say's law]] in [[economics]]. Examples of observed phenomena often described as laws include the [[Titius-Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, [[Thomas Malthus]]'s Principle of Population or [[Malthusian Growth Model]], [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[Unintended consequences|law of unintended consequences]].

Some humorous parodies of such laws include [[adage]]s such as [[Murphy's law]] and its many variants, and [[Godwin's Law]] of [[Internet]] conversations.

He became disciple of Buddha and  is one of the five hundred Arahants who will be born as future [[Buddha]]s, according to the [[Buddhist]] beliefs.

==Biography==
Kapphina was born in a city called Kukkata (Kukkutavati according to some accounts) in a [[Monarchy|kingdom]], three hundred yojanas in extent.&lt;ref&gt;See: Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, pp 614, 613, and see also p 473, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to G. P. Malalasekera, Kukkuta was probably the name of the kingdom and Kukkatavati that of its capital (See: Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, pp 614, G. P. Malalasekera).&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[frontier]] kingdom,&lt;ref name="Pali Proper Names 2003, p 473"&gt;Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 473, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A History of Pāli Literature, 2000, p 497, B. C. Law.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northern India According to the Shui-ching-chu, 1950, p 66, Luciano Petech, Daoyuan Li.&lt;/ref&gt; located near Himavanta or ''[[Himalaya]]''&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 613, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Himalaya of the ancient texts and traditions extended from eastern ocean to western ocean and, thus included Hindukush and Karakoram ranges as well (Ref: Sumangavilasini,I.1; Geographical Data in Early Puranas, 1972, p 65).&lt;/ref&gt; and was ruled by his father on whose death, he became its ruler under the name  Maha Kapphina—Kapphina or Kappina being probably his appellative rather than a given name. His chief queen ''Anoja'' was a [[princess]] from ''Sagala'' of the [[Madra]] kingdom.
Soon after ascending the throne, Kappina got attracted towards [[Buddhism]] through the medium of traders from Savatthi (Sarasvati in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh|UP]])&lt;ref&gt;Ancient capital of Kosala.&lt;/ref&gt; who had visited Kukkatavati and told him about of the appearance in the world of Buddha, the Law, and the Sangha. Immediately on hearing this news, King Maha Kapphina and his thousand courtiers and [[Queen Anoja]] and her thousand ladies-in-waiting had given splendid gifts and set out to visit and see the Buddha in person. In this manner they crossed three rivers on dry foot: the Aravacchā, the Nilavāhana, and the Chandrabhaga on making Acts of Truth. The Buddha perceived them coming with his divine eye, and after he had eaten at Savatthi, went through the air to the banks of river Chandrabhaga ([[Chenab]]) and sat down under the great [[banyan]] tree facing the landing stage of the river. Maha Kapphina and his men saw the Buddha and prostrated themselves before him. The Buddha taught them the Doctrine and they all retired from the world, became arahants and joined the Order. Maha Kapphina exclaims wherever he goes:  ''"aho sukham!, aho sukham"!!'' (''Oh happiness!'', ''Oh happiness!!''!).  The [[monk]]s conclude that Kapphina has in mind the happiness of ruling. The Buddha informs that Kapphina refers to the happiness of Nibhana.&lt;ref&gt;Book VI, Pandita Vagga, The Wiseman, 4=79; [[Harvard Oriental Series]], 1921, p 101, Harvard University - Sanskrit literature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 474, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country of origin==
Nothing definite is known about Maha Kapphina. He is mentioned both in the [[Buddhist]]&lt;ref&gt;''Manorathapurani'' and in the commentary on [[Dhammapada]] (Book VI. The Wise man, Pandita Vagga, 4=79) etc.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Sanskrit]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Kapphinabhuyudaya in Avadanashatika by Sivaswami, XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="All-India Oriental Conference 1933, p 117"&gt;Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1933, p 117, All-India Oriental Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian Linguistics 1966, p 499"&gt;Indian Linguistics, 1966, p 499,  Linguistic Society of India.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhist literature, he is stated to be king of Kukkatavati located  beyond river [[Indus]] either in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] (NWFP) of Pakistan, in North-east [[Afghanistan]]&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt; or in [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;Śivasvāmin's Kapphiṇābhyudaya, or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa: or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa, 1989, Gauri Shankar, Michael Hahn; Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1933, p 118, All-India Oriental Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; But Medieval age Buddhist writer Śivasvāmin, the court poet of Avantivarman (855 AD - 883 AD), in his poetical composition (Avadanashatika) refers to Maha Kapphina as the king of ''Lilavati'', the lord of [[Vindhya]] as well as king of ''Daksinatya'' etc.&lt;ref&gt;Kapphinabhuyudaya in Avadanashatika by Sivaswami, XVIII.104; XX.1;  Cf: Indian Kavya Literature, 1988, p 175,  A. K. Warder; Cf: A History of Indian Literature, 500-1399: From Courtly to the Popular, 2005, p 81,  Sisir Kumar Das.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Śivasvāmin is a very belated author (9th century AD), the scholar community does not give much credence to his version of Maha Kapphina legend compared to that from the ancient Buddhist texts.

The internal evidence of Kapphina legend  tends to locate Kukkatavati somewhere near Pukkhlavati or Mashkavati in NWFP.  It is notable that several similar ending names such as ''Utpalavati, Hamsavati, Oghavati (Apaga), Pokkharavatī'' ([[Sanskrit]] ''Pushkavati'') and [[Pāṇini]]an ''Mashkavati'' (i.e. Massaga of [[Arrian]]) are documented in the NWFP.

[[Divyavadana]] attests a city called Utpalavati located in Uttarapatha.&lt;ref&gt;Divyavadana, p 470; Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 363, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient name of Sanskrit Pushkalavati, Pali Pokkharavati or Pushkaravati is said to have been Utpalavati&lt;ref&gt;The geographical dictionary of ancient and mediaeval India, 1979, pp  163, 200, Nundo Lal Dey;  India as Described in Early Texts of Buddhism and Jainism, 1980, p 87, B. C. Law; A History of Indian Civilization, 1958, pp 62, 462,  Radhakamal Mukerjee;  Foreign Influence on Ancient India, 1992, p 309, Krishna Chandra Sagar; Gandhara and Its Art Tradition, 1978, p 15,  Ajit Ghose; Buddhist Remains in Afghanistan, 1991, p 25,  R. B. Narain - Buddhism; The Society of the Ramayana, 1991, p 79,  Ananda W. P. Guruge; The Sanskrit Buddhist Literature of Nepal, 1882, p 316,  Rājendralāla Mitra, Asiatic Society (Calcutta, India). Library, Asiatic Society of Bengal, Asiatic Society of Bengal Oriental Library;  History of Buddhism in Afghanistan, 1990, p 207, Buddhism; Bhāratī: Bulletin of the College of Indology, 1983, p 92, Banaras Hindu University College of Indology, Banaras Hindu University Dept. of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology.&lt;/ref&gt; and was located above the confluence of [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] and [[Kabul]] river, modern Charasadda. The story of Rupavati (''Rupavatyavadana'') specifically equates this ''Utpalavati'' to  the ''Pushkalavati'' (modern [[Charasaddha]], north of [[Peshawar]]). Thus, it has been conjectured that city of Kukkatavati may have been in NWFP of Pakistan or somewhere near Pushkalavati or Mashkavati (Massaga), or in north-east [[Afghanistan]], in the land of [[Ashvaka]] [[Kambojas]]. The marriage of king Kapphina to Anoja, the princess  of Madda ([[Madra]]) kingdom also points to this direction.

==Kapphina related to Kapin/Kipin/Kophene (Kabul/Kapisa or Kamboja)==
It has been suggested that the very name Kapphina or Kappina may be related to [[China|Chinese]] ''Kipin or Kapin or  [[greece|Greek]] Kophene''. Kipin of Chinese is the same as Kophene of the Greek writings and  the Kubha  and/or Kapisa of the [[Sanskrit]] literature.&lt;ref name="All-India Oriental Conference 1933, p 117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian Linguistics 1966, p 499"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Śivasvāmin's Kapphiṇābhyudaya, or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa: or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa, 1989,  Gauri Shankar, Michael Hahn; Northern India According to the Shui-ching-chu, 1950, p 66-67, Luciano Petech, Daoyuan Li.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Geography of India: By Alexander Cunningham. New Enl. Ed. / Foreword by B. Ch. Chhabra ; Introd. by Asim Kumar Chatterjee ; Additional Notes by Jamna Das Akhtar, 1975, p xxvii, Alexander Cunningham.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pāṇini]] teaches that  the name of the Kamboja king could be same as the name of his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Ashtadhyayi IV.1.175.&lt;/ref&gt;  It therefore looks quite probable that name Kapphina was not a proper name but an appellation of its ruler and likewise may be related to name Kipin, Kapin and Kophene which are the [[China|Chinese]] and the [[Greek language|Greek]] versions of the Sanskrit Kubha (Kabul) and [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]] respectively.  Equivalence of [[Kabul]] and  Kapisa with Kamboja has also been accepted by scholar community.&lt;ref&gt;For Kabul = Kamboj equivalence, see refs: Ethnologische Forschungen und Sammlung von Material für dieselben, 1871, p 244, Adolf Bastian – Ethnology; The People of India: A Series of Photographic Illustrations, with Descriptive Letterpress, of the Races and Tribes of Hindustan, Originally Prepared Under the Authority of the Government of India, and Reproduced by Order of the Secretary of State for India in Council, 1868, p 155, John William Kaye, Meadows Taylor, Great Britain India Office – Ethnology; Supplementary Glossary, p. 304, H.

[[Alexander Cunningham]] writes: ''"Kipin is one of the most famous but also most puzzling terms of the Chinese geography of north-western India (now Pakistan). As a geographical term the word 'Kipin' is not to be found in Indian literature. We come acrorss King Maha Kapphina or Maha Kaphina, the hero of the many [[Buddhist]] legends. He is described as ruling in Kukutavati, a frontier region and this region is definitely localized in the extreme north-west of India (now Pakistan).  According to Buddhist traditions, Kaphina was a [[Brahman]]. He met the [[Buddha]] during the latter's journey to the north-west. Kukatagiri, as mentioned by [[Pāṇini]] (V. 4. 147) seems to represent some low peaks of [[Hindukush]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Thus, Kipin or Kukutawati was situated in Afghanistan near the borders of Pakistan. It is probably Huphina of [[Hiuen Tsang]] or Huppian which is Kophen (=the kingdom of Kabul). King Kapphina of the Buddhist legends was the king of this region"''.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;The Ancient Geography of India: 1975, p xxvii, Alexander Cunningham.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Maha Kapphina was, in all probability a powerful ruler whose kingdom besides Kabul (Kophene), probably also included parts of [[Gandhara]]. Kipin described in the Hou Han-shu may represent the region NWFP (now in Pakistan) dominated in turn by the [[Greeks]],  the [[Sakas]],  the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and the [[Kushana]]s''.&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt;

Maha Kapphina is said to have met Buddha after crossing three northern rivers&lt;ref name="Pali Proper Names 2003, p 473"/&gt;  i.e. river Aravacchā (probably ''Swat?''), the Nīlavāhana and the Chandrabhaga.  This shows that he must have come from north/north-west as river Chandrabhaga is identified with  river [[Chenab]] and Nīlavāhana with river [[Indus]] (Nilab).

According to scholars like D. D. Kosambi, Kapphina was of a [[Kshatriya]] varna&lt;ref&gt;The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India in Historical Outline,  2000, p 120; Ancient India: A History of Its Culture and Civilization, 1965, Damodar Dharmanand Kosambi.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to Alexander Cunningham, Kapphina was of a [[Brahman]] varna.&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Geography of India: By Alexander Cunningham. New Enl. Ed. / Foreword by B. Ch. Chhabra; Introd. by Asim Kumar Chatterjee ; Additional Notes by Jamna Das Akhtar, 1975, p xxvii, Alexander Cunningham.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ānanda: Papers on Buddhism and Indology: a Felicitation Volume Presented to Ananda Weihena Palliya Guruge on His Sixtieth Birthday, 1990, p 175, Ananda W. P. Guruge, [[Y Karunadasa]] - Buddhism.&lt;/ref&gt; But these conflicting views are least problematic here since Kambojas in ancient times  were given to both [[Kshatrya]] as well as [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanical]] pursuits. Pali texts' legend of Maha Kapphina however, does not specify anywhere that Kapphina was a Brahmin or a Kshatriya.&lt;ref&gt;See: Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 473 seq, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt; But internal evidence of Kapphina legend points to his belonging to the Kshatriya varna.

Maha Kapphina is described by Buddha as pale (or white) (''? odata''), thin and having a characteristic thin and prominent nose (''tanukam tunganasikam'').&lt;ref&gt;Jataka ii. 284; Kindered Sayings II, pp 193-94; Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, Item notes: 7th 1933, p 118, Published by Bihar and Orissa Research Society; The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India in Historical Outline,  2000, p 120, D. D. Kosambi; Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 475, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the personal features, especially the [[Aryan]] nose also resemble that of a man from the North/north-west&lt;ref&gt;Indian Linguistics, 1966, p 499,  Linguistic Society of India; Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1933, p 118, All-India Oriental Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore the Kambojas/Gandharas.

==Pukkusati of Gandhara vs Maha Kapphina of Kukkutavati==
[[Anguttara Nikaya]] mentions sixteen great countries that flourished during Buddha's time of which only two i.e.  the ‘Gandhara–[[Kashmira]]’ and the ‘[[Kambojas|Kamboja]]’ were located in [[Uttarapatha]].&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, pp 363,  526,  G. P. Malalasekera. See also entry under Mahajanapada.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Culla-Niddesa'' adds the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] to the sixteen and substitutes [[Yona]] for the Gandhāra&lt;ref&gt;Culla-Niddesa, (P.T.S.), p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; thus showing that when Chulla-Niddesa was composed, Kamboja Mahajanapada in the Uttarapatha was more important than even the Gandhara and further indicates that Gandhara may have formed part of the Kamboja Mahajanapada at this time. ''In Buddha's time, Gandhāra and Kasmira formed one country since the two countries are always mentioned together in one expression as "Kasmīra-Gandhāra" in the [[Pali]] texts''.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, pp 543, 749,  G. P. Malalasekera; See also: Asoka and His Inscriptions, 1968, p 93, Beni Madhab Barua, Ishwar Nath Topa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf: "Some Pali texts mention Kasmira and Gandhara as one country ruled by one king" (Asoka and His Inscriptions, 1968, p 93, [[Dr. Benimadhab Barua]], Ishwar Nath Topa).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gandhara Jataka]], Kasmira was included in Gandhara.&lt;ref&gt;Jataka No 406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asoka and His Inscriptions, 1968, p 93, [[Dr. Benimadhab Barua]], Ishwar Nath Topa.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddha's time, Pukkusāti, contemporary of the Buddha was the king of Gandhara i.e. '' 'Gandhara-Kasmira' ''. As he learnt about the appearance of Buddha, his Dharama and Sangha from his friend king [[Bimbisara]], Pukkusati immediately decided to become a Buddha follower, ordained himself as a [[monk]], renounced his kingdom and traveled all the way to ''Sāvatthi'' to see the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;See: Papañca Sūdanī, Majjhima Commentary, (Aluvihāa Series, Colombo), ii.979ff); See also: Gandhara in: Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, pp 749,  G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt; Pali texts refer to Maha Kapphina as a great king of the frontier kingdom of Kukkutavati, 300 Yojana in extent, (in Uttarapatha) and also make him contemporary of the Buddha and Pukkusati. Immediately on hearing of the appearance of Buddha and his Law and Sangha, king Maha Kapphina of Kukkatavati renounced the throne, set forth towards Savatthi to see the Buddha, and like king Pukkusati, he too became a Buddha follower and a monk.&lt;ref&gt;See: Maha Kappina Thera in: Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 473 seq, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt; The above Buddhist evidence makes it quite clear that Pukkusati and Maha Kapphina were contemporary rulers, both belonged to the ''Uttarapatha'', both abnegated the throne and both had become monks and Buddha followers soon after the appearance of Buddha's Law and Sangha. Since according to Pali textual evidence, Pukkusati was king of ‘Gandhara-Kasmira’, hence his contemporary king Maha Kapphina, said to be a great ruler of a frontier country (hence also from Uttarapatha), could not have been a king either of Gandhara or of Kasmira, as D. D. Kosambi speculates. This clearly means that Maha Kapphina could only have been a king of Kamboja alone (''the only other [[Mahajanapadas|Mahajanapada]] or great country located in the Uttarapatha division). And being immediate neighbor to Gandhara, king Maha Kapphina had followed king Pukkusati or vice versa and embraced the Buddhist faith.

==Conclusion==
General Alexander Cunningham has identified Kukkatavati kingdom of Maha Kapphina with Chinese Kipin (=Pāṇinian  [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]]) or Greek ''Kophene'' and the ''Kukatagiri'' with some low peak of Hindukush region, which obviously refers to the land of ancient Kambojas. D . D. Kosambi has located Kukkatavati of king Maha Kapphina  near [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] (or [[Kashmir]]).&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to the Study of Indian History, 1996, p 150,  D. D. Kosambi; The Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India in Historical Outline: In Historical Outline, 1965, p 120, D. D. Kosambi.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars like Gauri Shankar and Michael Hahn&lt;ref&gt;Śivasvāmin's Kapphiṇābhyudaya, or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa: or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa, 1989, Gauri Shankar, Michael Hahn.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the authors of ''Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference'' and  of ''Indian Linguistics'' also connect Kipin of the Chinese records with Buddhist name Kapphina but identify Kipin with Kashmir.&lt;ref name="All-India Oriental Conference 1933, p 117"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indian Linguistics, 1966, p 499, Linguistic Society of India - India.&lt;/ref&gt; But it is generally accepted among the scholar community that  the Chinese name Kipin is applied to Kapisa country which was a part of ancient [[Kambojas|Kamboja]]&lt;ref&gt;History and Culture of Indian People, Vol III, pp 122, 617, Dr [[R. C. Majumdar]], Dr A. D. Pusalkar, Dr. K. M. Munshi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indian Antiquaries, 52, part 2, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pre Aryan and Pre Dravidian in India, 1993 edition, p 121, Dr Sylvain Lévi, Dr Jules Bloch, Dr Jean Przyluski, Asian Educational Services.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, p 43, Dr Moti Chandra - India.&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[Kapisa Province]]). Hence Kapphina and Kapin/Kipin must be related not to [[Kashmir]] but to the [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]] (''[[Kafiristan]]/[[Kohistan District, Pakistan|Kohistan]]'') and to Kophene (Kabul) and therefore, to the [[Kambojas|Kamboja]]. Since [[Ashvakas]] of Mashkavati (Massaga) and Kunar valleys were merely a specialized branch (i.e. ''Ashva-Yuddha-Kushalah'') of the more general ethnic term Kamboja, hence D. D.Kosambi's views also reinforce the conclusion that Maha Kaphina was probably a ruler of the Ashvaka country of the Kambojas which around the time of Buddha was only a provincial district of the bigger Kamboja [[Mahajanapada]]. ''It is also not very insignificant to note that there still exists among the modern [[Kamboj]] a clan name known as Kukkar (&lt; Kukkad/Kukkat) who claim to have come to Punjab from north-west across the [[Indus]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26260">{{Theosophy}}
In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the '''Maitreya''' or '''Lord Maitreya''' is an advanced spiritual entity and high-ranking member of a hidden [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], the so-called ''[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]''. According to Theosophical [[doctrine]], one of the Hierarchy's functions is to oversee the evolution of humankind; in accord with this function the Maitreya is said to hold the so-called ''Office of the World Teacher''. Theosophical texts posit that the purpose of this Office is to facilitate the transfer of knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence to humankind. Humanity is thereby assisted on its presumed cyclical, but ever progressive, [[Evolution (term)|evolutionary]] path. Reputedly, one way the knowledge transfer is accomplished is by Maitreya occasionally manifesting or [[Incarnation|incarnating]] in the physical realm; the manifested entity then assumes the role of ''World Teacher'' of Humankind.

The Theosophical concept of Maitreya has many similarities to the earlier [[Maitreya]] doctrine in [[Buddhism]]. However, they differ in important aspects. The Theosophical Maitreya has been assimilated or appropriated by a variety of quasi-theosophical and non-theosophical [[New Age]] and [[Esoteric]] groups and movements.

==Development of the Theosophical concept of the Maitreya==
The first mention of the Maitreya in a Theosophical context occurs in the 1883 work [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] by [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] (1840–1921), an early Theosophical writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|APS1883}} [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett, Alfred Percy]] (1883). [https://books.google.com/books?id=tpUZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Esoteric Buddhism''] (2nd ed.). London: Trübner. p. 144. {{OCLC|2014685}}. [[Google books|Google Books Search]]. Retrieved 2011-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts described by Sinnett were amended, elaborated on, and greatly expanded in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', a book originally published 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|HPB1888}} [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky, Helena]] (1888). ''[[The Secret Doctrine|The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy]]''.

===Maitreya and the Spiritual Hierarchy===
{{Main|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom}}

Following Blavatsky's writings on the subject, other Theosophists progressively elaborated on the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|CWL2007}} [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Leadbeater, Charles W.]] (2007). [Reprint ed. originally published 1925. [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], India: Theosophical Publishing House]. ''The Masters and the Path''. New York: Cosimo Classics. {{ISBN|978-1602063334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are presented as guardians and guides of Earth's total evolutionary process,&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] pp. 296–297.&lt;/ref&gt; known in Theosophical [[cosmology]] as the doctrine of ''[[Round (Theosophy)|Planetary Rounds]]''. According to Theosophists, evolution includes an [[occult]] or spiritual component that is considered of a higher order of importance than the related physical evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#APS1883|Sinnett 1883]] "Chapter IV: The World Periods" pp. 45–65. [[#HPB1888|Blavatsky 1888]]. "Our world, its growth and development"; "Theosophical misconceptions"; "Explanations concerning the Globes and Monads". '''Volume I: Cosmogenesis'''.  pp. 136–191 [cumulative].&lt;/ref&gt; The Hierarchy presumably consists of spiritual entities at various evolutionary stages – these stages correspond to ever increasing ranks within the Hierarchy. Lower ranks are populated by individuals who can function more or less normally on the physical plane, while in the highest known rankings are highly evolved beings of the purest spiritual essence and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] pp. 4–5, 10, 34; "Part IV: The Hierarchy" pp. 211–301.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Theosophical exposition, in the current stage of Planetary Evolution the position of Maitreya in Earth's Hierarchy is that of the so-called ''[[Boddhisatva]]'', originally a Buddhist concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] pp. 31-32, 36, 277–278. Like other aspects of Theosophy, the doctrine of Earth's Spiritual Hierarchy expands or interprets many Buddhist and Hindu concepts within an [[occult]] or [[esoteric]] framework.&lt;/ref&gt; Since this position is thought to be at an exalted state, the Maitreya may have no direct or sustained contact with the physical realm. At this evolutionary level he is below only two other beings in the current Hierarchy: at its apex, the [[Sanat Kumara]], (also referred to as ''The Lord of the World''), followed by the [[Buddha]]; as such the Maitreya is held in high reverence and regard by Theosophists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] "Diagram 8" p. 256; "Chapter XIV: The Wisdom in the Triangles" pp. 261-295.&lt;/ref&gt; He is additionally described as having among other duties overall responsibility for humanity's development, including its education, civilization, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] pp. 74, 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blavatsky held that members of the Hierarchy, often called ''the Masters'' or ''[[Mahātmā#Theosophy|the Mahātmās]]'' in Theosophical literature, were the ultimate guides of the Theosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;In this context, ''the Masters'' refer to specific members of the Hierarchy, and not to the Masters of Ancient Wisdom as a group.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society itself was said to be the result of one of the "impulses" from the Hierarchy. These "impulses" are believed to be a regular occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HPB1889|Blavatsky 1889]]. "But I must tell you that during the last quarter of every hundred years an attempt is made by those 'Masters,' of whom I have spoken, to help on the spiritual progress of Humanity in a marked and definite way. Towards the close of each century you will invariably find that an outpouring or upheaval of spirituality – or call it mysticism if you prefer – has taken place. Some one or more persons have appeared in the world as their agents, and a greater or less amount of occult knowledge and teaching has been given out." [p. 306]. In the same work Blavatsky lamented the fact that the idea of mysterious "Masters" dispensing [[occult]] "impulses" had become the foundation for unscrupulous practices. "Every bogus swindling Society, for commercial purposes, now claims to be guided and directed by 'Masters,' ..." [p. 301].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Blavatsky commented in her widely read 1889 work ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' on the next impulse, the "effort of the XXth century" which would involve another "torch bearer of Truth". In this effort the Theosophical Society was poised to possibly play a major role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HPB1889|Blavatsky 1889]]. Context at pp. 306–307.&lt;/ref&gt; More information regarding the future "impulse" was the purview of the Theosophical Society's ''[[Esoteric|Esoteric Section]]'' which was founded by Blavatsky and was originally led by her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky, Helena]] (August 1931).

([[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]]: Theosophical Publishing House). {{ISSN|0040-5892}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members had access to [[occult]] instruction and more detailed knowledge of the "inner order" and mission of the Society, and of its reputed hidden guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|ML1975}} [[Mary Lutyens|Lutyens, Mary]] (1975).

===Maitreya and the "Christ Principle"===
Blavatsky also elaborated on a so-called ''Christ Principle'', which in her view corresponds to the spiritual essence of every human being.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HPB1889|Blavatsky 1889]] pp. 67, 71, 155; [http://theosophy.org/Blavatsky/Key%20to%20Theosophy/aKEY.htm#c "Glossary: C": ''Chrestos'']. [[Wheaton, Maryland]]: theosophy.org. Retrieved 2011-04-13.&lt;/ref&gt; After Blavatsky’s death in 1891 influential Theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] (1854–1934), whose knowledge on [[occult]] matters was highly respected by the Society's leadership, formulated a [[Christology]] in which he identified Christ with the Theosophical representation of the [[Buddhist]] deity [[Maitreya]]. He maintained that an aspect of Maitreya was the prototype for the ''Christ Principle'' described by Blavatsky. Leadbeater believed that ''Maitreya-as-Christ'' had previously manifested on Earth, often through specially prepared people who acted as the entity's "vehicles". The manifested  Maitreya then assumed the role of World Teacher, dispensing knowledge regarding underlying truths of Existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] pp. 31, 192, 232; "Chapter XII: The Trinity and the Triangles" pp. 250-260.&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge, which according to Theosophists eventually crystallized in religious, scientific and cultural practices, had been reputedly disseminated to groups as small as a few carefully selected Initiates and as large as Humanity as a whole.

===Maitreya's incarnations===
In Theosophical texts, the Maitreya is said to have had numerous manifestations or incarnations: in the theorized ancient continent of [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]]; as a [[Hierophant]] in [[Ancient Egypt]];&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|ABCWL1913}} [[Annie Besant|Besant, Annie]] &amp; [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Leadbeater, Charles W.]] (1913). [[Man: whence, how and whither, a record of clairvoyant investigation|''Man: How, Whence, and Whither; a record of clairvoyant investigation'']]. [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], India: Theosophical Publishing House. p. 520. {{OCLC|871602}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Hindu deity [[Krishna]];&lt;ref name="CWL2007p278"&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; as a high priest in Ancient India;&lt;ref&gt;[[#ABCWL1913|Besant-Leadbeater 1913]] p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[Christ]] during the three years of the [[Ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="CWL2007p278"/&gt;

===Maitreya's reappearance===
[[Annie Besant]] (1847–1933), another well-known and influential Theosophist (and future President of the Society) had also developed an interest in this area of Theosophy. In the decades of the 1890s and 1900s, along with Leadbeater (who became a close associate) and others, she became progressively convinced that the "next impulse" from the Hierarchy would happen sooner than Blavatsky's timetable. These Theosophists came to believe it would involve the imminent reappearance of Maitreya as World Teacher, a monumental event in the Theosophical scheme of things.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky's views on the specific matter of the reappearance of Maitreya (as opposed to the regular appearances of other, lower-ranked emissaries) were thought to be in general agreement with mainstream Buddhist [[eschatology]]. [[#HPB1888|Blavatsky 1888]] '''Volume I: Cosmogenesis''' p. 470. "He will appear as Maitreya Buddha, the last of the Avatars and Buddhas, in the seventh Race. This belief and expectation are universal throughout the East. Only it is not in the ''Kali yug'', our present terrifically materialistic age of Darkness, the 'Black Age,' that a new Saviour of Humanity can ever appear." [Emphasis in original].&lt;/ref&gt; Besant had started commenting on the possible imminent arrival of the next "emissary" in 1896, several years before her assumption of the Society's presidency in 1907. By 1909 the "coming" Teacher was a main topic of her lectures and writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ML1975|M. Lutyens]] pp. 11–12, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Besant became President of the Society the belief in Maitreya's imminent manifestation took on considerable weight. The subject was widely discussed and became a commonly held expectation among Theosophists. However, not all Theosophical Society members accepted Leadbeater's and Besant's ideas on this; the dissidents charged them with straying from Theosophical [[orthodoxy]] and, along with other concepts developed by the two, Leadbeater's and Besant's writings on the Maitreya were derisively labeled ''[[Neo-Theosophy]]'' by their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Margaret A.

Retrieved 2011-05-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]] (India)-based international leadership of the Society eventually overcame the protests and by the late-1920s the organization had stabilized, but in the meantime additional World Teacher-related trouble was brewing.

In 1909 Leadbeater encountered fourteen-year-old [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] (1895–1986) near the Theosophical Society headquarters at Adyar, and came to believe the boy was a suitable candidate for the "vehicle" of the expected World Teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ML1975|M. Lutyens]] pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Leadbeater placed Krishnamurti under his and the Society's wing.

The project received widespread publicity and enjoyed worldwide following, chiefly among Theosophists. However it also encountered opposition within and without the Theosophical Society, and led to years of upheaval, serious splits within the Society, and doctrinal schisms in Theosophy.

==Later concepts of Maitreya==
Following the Krishnamurti debacle, major Theosophical organizations and writers became increasingly muted, at least publicly, on the subject of the reappearance of Maitreya and on the possible next "impulse" from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="Vernonp188"/&gt; However the concepts of World Teacher, of a hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, and of Masters of Occult Wisdom as described in Theosophical literature, continued to have vocal supporters. These were found among Theosophical Society members and increasingly, among near-theosophical and non-theosophical [[New Age]] adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Schuller, Govert W. (1999).

===Alice A. Bailey===

A major proponent was [[Alice Bailey]] (1880–1949), who left the Theosophical Society in the 1920s to establish the quasi-theosophical ''Arcane School''. She expanded Leadbeater's work and his Christology,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alice Bailey|Bailey, Alice A.]] (1989). [Originally published 1957]. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' (4th ed.).

===Ascended Master Teachings===
The Theosophical Maitreya also holds a prominent position in the so-called ''[[Ascended Master Teachings]]''. These encompass original Theosophical literature, as well as later additions and interpretations by various non-Theosophical commentators and groups – such as the [[I AM Activity]],&lt;ref&gt;Godfré Ray King &amp;#91;[[pseudonym]] of [[Guy Ballard]]&amp;#93; (1934).

[[File:Peterborough Psalter c 1220-25 Mercy and Truth.jpg|thumb|''Mercy and Truth'' are shown together in a 13th-century representation of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Psalms#85|Psalm 85 (10)]]]]
'''Mercy''' ([[Middle English]], from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] ''merci'', from [[Medieval Latin]] ''merced-'', ''merces'', from [[Latin]], "price paid, wages", from ''merc-'', ''merxi'' "merchandise") is [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[forgiveness]], and [[kindness]] in a variety of ethical, religious, social, and [[Law|legal]] contexts.

The concept of a merciful God appears in various religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]. Performing acts of mercy as a component of religious beliefs is also emphasized through actions such as the giving of alms, and care for the sick and [[Works of Mercy]].

In the social and legal context, mercy may refer both to compassionate behavior on the part of those in power (e.g. mercy shown by a judge toward a convict), or on the part of a humanitarian third party, e.g., a mission of mercy aiming to treat war victims.&lt;ref name=Sarat &gt;Sarat, Austin and Hussain, Nasser. ''Forgiveness, mercy, and clemency'', 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-5333-4}} pp. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Menke&gt;Menke, Christopher. ''Reflections of equality'' by Christoph Menke 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-4474-2}} p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
"Mercy" can be defined as "compassion or forbearance shown especially to an offender or to one subject to one's power"; and  also "a blessing that is an act of divine favor or compassion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mercy "Mercy", Merriam-Webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; "To be at someone's mercy" indicates a person being "without defense against someone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/at+the+mercy+of "At the mercy of", McGraw-Hill Dictionary of American Idioms and Phrasal Verbs. © 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and ethics==
[[File:Spirit of Compassion.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''Spirit of Compassion'', commemorating [[World War I]], [[National War Memorial (South Australia)|South Australia]], 1931]]
In a judicial context mercy is often termed "clemency". It is a sovereign prerogative that resides in the executive and is entirely discretionary. [[John Locke]] defined it as "the power to act according to discretion, for the public good, without the prescription of the Law, and sometimes even against it."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Second Treatise on Civil Government'', (C.B MacPherson, ed.), Indianapolis, Indiana. Hackett, 1980, §§ 159-160&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] explained that "The very nature of clemency is that it is grounded solely in the will of the dispenser of clemency. He need give no reasons for granting it or for denying it."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Sapp'', 118 F. 3d 460, 465 (6th Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
===Christianity===
{{see also|Works of Mercy}}
Hebrews 4:16 says, "So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help."&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 4:16, NAB&lt;/ref&gt; Grace and mercy are similar in that both are free gifts of God and both are dispensed absent any merit on the part of the recipient. Grace is the favor of God, a divine assistance. Grace is what one receives that they do not deserve while mercy is what one receives when they do ''not'' get that which they deserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christiancrier/2014/03/17/what-is-the-difference-between-mercy-and-grace/ Wellman, Jack. "What Is The Difference Between Mercy and Grace?"], ''Patheos'', March 17, 2104&lt;/ref&gt; 

An emphasis on mercy appears in the [[New Testament]], for example in the [[Magnificat]] &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:46-55|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] (Song of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:68-79|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Luke's Gospel]], and in the [[Beatitudes]] in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:7|Matthew 5:7]]: "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy".&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 /&gt; In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Ephesians#2:4|Ephesians 2:4]] [[Apostle Paul]] refers to the mercy of God in terms of salvation: "God, being rich in mercy,... even when we were dead through our sins, made us alive together with Christ".

[[Psalm 117]] calls upon all nations to praise the Lord, and that on account of his "merciful kindness". This is quoted by the Apostle Paul in Romans 15:11 to show that God has now fulfilled this prophecy and promise through Jesus Christ, who has been merciful in giving his life as a sacrifice for his people, both Jew and Gentile. Thus St Peter writes in 1 Peter 2:9,10:
:''But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.''

This devotional element of mercy as part of the Christian tradition was echoed by [[Saint Augustine]] who called mercy "ever ancient, ever new".&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 &gt;''Mercies Remembered'' by Matthew R Mauriello 2011 {{ISBN|1-61215-005-5}} page 149-160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine]], ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', Book X, 27&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Works of Mercy]] (seven corporal and seven spiritual works) are part of the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] traditions.&lt;ref name=Apostoli105 /&gt;

[[File:Kazimirowski Eugeniusz, Divine Mercy, 1934.jpg|thumb|180px|The first ''[[Divine Mercy image]]'' (circa 1934) painted according to the apparitions of [[Faustina Kowalska]] by [[Eugene Kazimierowski]].

In the encyclical ''[[Dives in misericordia]]'' ("Rich in Mercy") Pope John Paul II examines the role of mercy—both God's mercy, and also the need for human mercy.&lt;ref name=Dives&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30111980_dives-in-misericordia_en.html Pope John Paul II. ''Dives in misericordia'', November 30, 1980, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees in the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:11|Luke 15:11-32]]) "the essence of the divine mercy".&lt;ref name=Dives/&gt; Having squandered his patrimony, justice would dictate that the prodigal should only expect to be received back as a hireling. The figure of the father is analogous to God as Father, who goes beyond the requirements of justice to welcome his son with compassion.

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] emphasizes the importance of the [[Works of Mercy]] (item 2447) and in [[Roman Catholic]] teachings, the mercy of God flows through the work of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Apostoli105 &gt;''We Believe in the Holy Spirit'' by Andrew Apostoli 2002 {{ISBN|1-931709-31-9}} pages 105-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Catechism2447 &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a7.htm#2447 Vatican website Catechism item 2447]&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic [[liturgy]] includes frequent references to mercy, e.g., as in ''[[Kyrie|Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison]]'': Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08714a.htm Catholic encyclopedia: ''Kyrie Eleison'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy has also been an important subject of Christian [[iconography]]. Since the [[Middle Ages]], many representations in art encouraged people to practice the [[works of mercy]] and, as the art historian [[Ralf van Bühren]] explains using the example of [[Caravaggio]], helped "the audience to explore mercy in their own lives".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf van Bühren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples. The relevance of art history to cultural journalism]'', in ''Church, Communication and Culture'' 2 (2017), pp. 63-87, quotation from pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, there was new focus on mercy in the Roman Catholic Church, partly due to the [[Divine Mercy]] devotion.&lt;ref name=Withyou548 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball175 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; The primary focus of the Divine Mercy devotion is the merciful love of God and the desire to let that love and mercy flow through one's own heart towards those in need of it.&lt;ref name=Ball175 &gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 175&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Pope John Paul II]] was a follower of the Divine Mercy devotion, due to Saint [[Mary Faustina Kowalska]] (1905–1938), who is known as the ''[[Faustina Kowalska|Apostle of Mercy]]''.&lt;ref name=Butler &gt;''Butler's lives of the saints: the third millennium'' by Paul Burns, Alban Butler 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-86012-383-5}} page 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drake85 &gt;''Saints of the Jubilee'' by Tim Drake 2002 {{ISBN|978-1-4033-1009-5}} pages 85-95&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of Roman Catholic [[shrines]] are specifically dedicated to Divine Mercy, e.g.
the [[Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Krakow)|Basilica of Divine Mercy]] in Krakow Poland, and the [[National Shrine of The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_07061997_sr-faustina_en.html Vatican website: Shrine of Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt; During the dedication of the Basilica of Divine Mercy John Paul II quoted [[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul|the Diary of Faustina]] and called mercy the "greatest attribute of God Almighty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20020817_shrine-divine-mercy_en.html  Vatican website: Dedication of the Shrine of Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''World Apostolic Congress on Mercy'' was held in Rome in April 2008 and was inaugurated by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407083540/http://www.zenit.org/article-22184?l=english |title=Zenit April 2, 2008 |date=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080408194854/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0801799.htm |title=Catholic News Service, APril 3, 2008 |date=2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April, 2015, at St. Peter's Basillica, in a Papal Bull of Indiction entitled ''Misericordiae Vultus'' ("The Face of Mercy"), [[Pope Francis]] proclaimed a Special and Extraordinary Holy Year [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee Year]] of Mercy, from December 8, 2015: [[Solemnity]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], until November 21, 2016: the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus [[Christ the King]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/bulls/documents/papa-francesco_bolla_20150411_misericordiae-vultus.html Pope Francis, ''Misericordiae Vultus'', April 11, 2015, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of the Extraordinary Jubilee is taken from Luke 6:36, "Merciful, Like the Father".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-declares-2016-to-be-a-jubilee-for-mercy-84325/ Harris, Elise.

===Islam===
In [[Islam]] the title "Most Merciful" (al-Rahman) is one of the [[names of Allah]] and Compassionate (al-Rahim), is the most common name occurring in the [[Quran]]. Rahman and Rahim both derive from the root Rahmat, which refers to tenderness and benevolence.&lt;ref name=Rafiabadi &gt;''World religions and Islam: a critical study, Part 1'' by Hamid Naseem Rafiabadi, 2003 Sarup and Sons Publishers {{ISBN|81-7625-414-2}} page 211&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of mercy, the giving of alms ([[zakat]]) is the fourth of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]] and one of the requirements for the faithful.&lt;ref name=Hooker&gt;Hooker, Richard (July 14, 1999). "arkan ad-din the five pillars of religion". Washington State University. {{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203124633/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The Hebrew word  for mercy is ''Rachamim'' which is always in plural form so that it literally means "mercies". "Mercy includes showing kindness to those who don’t deserve it, and forgiving those that deserve punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shema.com/gods-attributes-the-mercy-of-god-3043/ Rabbi Loren. "God’s Attributes: The Mercy of God", Congregation Shema Yisrael]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy is one of the defining characteristics of [[God]]. Exodus 34:6 says: "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness."&lt;ref&gt;''After the exile'' by John Barton, David James Reimer 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-86554-524-3}} page 90&lt;/ref&gt; This is also emphasized in the context of the Babylonian exile in Isaiah: "For the Lord has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his suffering ones. But Zion said, 'The Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.' Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you." (Isaiah 49:13-15) Also: "It is good to pray and fast, to be merciful and just." (Tobit 12:8) 

When [[David]], because of his sin, was told to choose between a three-year famine, pursuit by his enemies for three months, or a three-day pestilence, he chose the pestilence saying, "Let us fall by the hand of God, for he is most merciful; but let me not fall by the hand of man."&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 24:14, NAB&lt;/ref&gt; Psalm 103:8 praises God for his mercy.

===Other religions and beliefs===
[[Kwan Yin]] the bodhisattva of mercy and compassion, is one of the best known and most venerated [[Bodhisattva]] in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''Guan Yin: goddess of compassion'' by Kok Kiang Koh 2004 {{ISBN|981-229-379-5}} pages 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karuṇā]] (often translated as "compassion") is part of the beliefs of both [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. Karuṇā is present in all schools of Buddhism and in Jainism it is viewed as one of the reflections of universal friendship.

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described God as being "all-merciful and eternally benevolent" in his [[Parvardigar Prayer|O Parvardigar]] prayer, and he held that we can approach God through the "invocation of His mercy."&lt;ref&gt; Kalchuri, Bhau (1986). ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher''. '''18'''. Myrtle Beach: Manifestation, Inc. p. 5986.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mudra''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-mudra-2.ogg|m|u|ˈ|d|r|ɑː}}; [[Sanskrit]] "seal", "mark", or "gesture"; {{bo|t=ཕྱག་རྒྱ་|s=chakgya}}) is a symbolic or ritual gesture in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. (2010). [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/396017/mudra "mudra (symbolic gestures)"]. Retrieved October 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While some mudras involve the entire body, most are performed with the hands and fingers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/m.html Word ''mudrā'' on Monier-William Sanskrit-English on-line dictionary: "N. of partic. positions or intertwinings of the fingers (24 in number, commonly practised in religious worship, and supposed to possess an occult meaning and magical efficacy ''Daś'' (''Daśakumāra-carita''). ''Sarvad''. ''Kāraṇḍ''. RTL. 204 ; 406)"]&lt;/ref&gt; A mudrā is a spiritual gesture and an energetic seal of authenticity employed in the [[iconography]] and [[spiritual practice]] of [[Indian religions]].

In [[hatha yoga]], mudras are used in conjunction with [[pranayama]] (yogic breathing exercises), generally while in a seated posture, to stimulate different parts of the body involved with breathing and to affect the flow of [[prana]], [[shukra|bindu]] (male psycho-sexual energy), boddhicitta, [[amrita]] or consciousness in the body. Unlike older tantric mudras, hatha yogic mudras are generally internal actions, involving the pelvic floor, diaphragm, throat, eyes, tongue, anus, genitals, abdomen, and other parts of the body. Examples are [[Mula Bandha]], [[Mahamudra (Hatha Yoga)]], [[Viparita Karani]], [[Khecarī mudrā]], and [[shambavi]]. These expanded in number from 3 in the Amritasiddhi, to 25 in the [[Gheranda Samhita]], with a classical set of ten arising in the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]].

==Nomenclature==
The Chinese translation is ''yin'' ({{zh|c=印|p=yìn}}) or ''yinxiang'' ({{zh|c=印相|p=yìnxiàng}}). Both these Chinese words also appear as loanwords in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (as ''in'' and ''inzō'' or ''insō'', respectively) and [[Korean language|Korean]] (as ''in'' and ''insang'', respectively). Two other Chinese-based compounds, 印契 (read as ''ingei'' or ''inkei'' in Japanese and as ''ingye'' in Korean) and 密印 (read as ''mitsuin'' or ''mitchin'' in Japanese and as ''mirin'' in Korean), are also used. In Japanese, the former compound may also be used with the order of the characters reversed (''i.e.'' 契印 ''keiin'').

==Iconography==
Mudra is used in the [[iconography]] of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist art]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and described in the scriptures, such as [[Natya Shastra|Nātyaśāstra]], which lists 24 ''{{IAST|asaṁyuta}}'' ("separated", meaning "one-hand") and 13 ''{{IAST|saṁyuta}}'' ("joined", meaning "two-hand") mudras. Mudra positions are usually formed by both the hand and the fingers. Along with ''[[asana|āsanas]]'' ("seated postures"), they are employed statically in the [[meditation]] and dynamically in the {{IAST|Nāṭya}} practice of Hinduism.

Hindu and Buddhist iconography share some mudras. In some regions, for example [[Iconography of Gautama Buddha in Laos and Thailand|in Laos and Thailand]], these are distinct but share related iconographic conventions.

According to [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgotn Kongtrul]] in his commentary on the ''[[Hevajra|Hevajra Tantra]]'', the ornaments of [[wrathful deities]] and witches made of human bones (Skt: {{IAST|aṣṭhimudrā}}; {{bo|w=rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya}}) are also known as mudra "seals".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jamgon Kongtrul|Kongtrul, Jamgön]] (author); (English translators: Guarisco, Elio; McLeod, Ingrid) (2005).

==Indian classical dance==
{{See also|List of mudras (dance)}}
In [[Indian classical dance]], the term "Hasta Mudra" is used. The ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' describes 24 mudras, while the ''Abhinaya Darpana'' of [[Nandikeshvara]] gives 28.&lt;ref&gt;Devi, Ragini. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KRz5ykKRVAEC Dance dialects of India]''. Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990. {{ISBN|81-208-0674-3}}. Pp. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In all their forms of Indian classical dance, the mudras are similar, though the names and uses vary. There are 28 (or 32) root mudras in [[Bharatanatyam]], 24 in [[Kathakali]] and 20 in [[Odissi]]. These root mudras are combined in different ways, like one hand, two hands, arm movements, body and facial expressions. In [[Kathakali]], which has the greatest number of combinations, the vocabulary adds up to c. 900. Sanyukta mudras use both hands and asanyukta mudras use one hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barba|1991|pp=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogic mudras==
{{See also|List of mudras (yoga)}}
The classical sources for the mudras in yoga are the ''[[Gheranda Samhita]]'' and the ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]''.&lt;ref name=APMB1997&gt;{{cite book|last=Saraswati|first=Satyananda|title=Asana Pranayama Mudrā Bandha|year=1997|publisher=Bihar Yoga Bharti|location=Munger, Bihar India|isbn=81-86336-04-4|page=422|url=https://www.amazon.com/Asana-Pranayama-Bandha-Fourth-Revised/dp/8186336141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hatha Yoga Pradipika states the importance of mudras in yoga practice:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Therefore the goddess sleeping at the entrance of Brahma's door should be constantly aroused with all effort, by performing mudra thoroughly.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the 20th and 21st centuries, the yoga teacher [[Satyananda Saraswati]], founder of the [[Bihar School of Yoga]], continued to emphasize the importance of mudras in his instructional text ''Asana, Pranayama, Mudrā, Bandha''.&lt;ref name=APMB1997/&gt;

=== Basic mudra: Chin Mudrā ===
[[File:JagadguruRamabhadracharya010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rambhadracharya|Rāmabhadrācārya]] meditating on the banks of the [[Mandakini River]] with fingers folded in the chin mudrā.|200px]]
The thumb and forefinger on each of the hands are joined, forming a zero. The rest of the fingers are extended. The hands are placed palms-up on the thighs or knees while sitting in [[Vajrasana (yoga)|vajrasana]] for meditation, or palm-down for pranayama. This mudrā supposedly activates the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], making for deep "stomach-breathing" as the diaphragm pushes out the internal organs when it descends towards the pelvis on inhalation{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Slow breathing in a 5-2-4-2 mentally counted rhythm (counting to 5 during the exhalation, to 2 while holding the breath, and to 4 on the inhalation) causes [[prana]] flow in the pelvis and in the legs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Basic mudra: Chinmaya Mudrā ===
The thumb and forefinger are the same as in Chin Mudrā. The rest of the fingers are folded into a fist. The non-folded part of the forefinger and the middle finger should still be touching. As in Chin Mudrā, the hands are placed palms-up on the thighs while sitting in [[Vajrasana (yoga)|Vajrasana]] for meditation, or palm-down for pranayama. This mudra supposedly activates the ribs, making them expand sideways on inhalation. Slow breathing in a 5-2-4-2 counted rhythm (counting to 5 during the exhalation, to 2 while holding the breath, and to 4 on the inhalation) causes [[prana]] flow in the torso and in the throat.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Basic mudra: Adi Mudrā ===
The thumb is folded into the palm, touching the base of the small finger. The rest of the fingers are folded over the thumb, to create a fist. The hands are placed palms down on the thighs while sitting in [[Vajrasana (yoga)|Vajrasana]]. This mudra supposedly activates the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] muscles, making the chest expand forward on inhalation. Slow breathing in a 5-2-4-2 counted rhythm (counting to 5 during the exhalation, to 2 while holding the breath, and to 4 on the inhalation) makes [[prana]] flow in the throat and in the head.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Basic compact mudra: Brahma Mudrā ===
The hands are as in Adi Mudrā, but the palms face upwards and are located at the level of the navel, with the left and right knuckles and first finger joints touching. This is done while sitting in [[Vajrasana (yoga)|Vajrasana]]. Breathing becomes full: in inhalation, the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] descends, the ribs then expand, and then the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] muscles move forward. Exhalation works in the same order, which creates a "wave" or ripple effect{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

=== Advanced compact mudra: Prana Mudrā ===
A complicated mudra combining hand gestures, synchronized movement from gesture to gesture within the breath cycle, and meditation. The mudrā is practiced sitting in [[Siddhasana]]. Even a single breath cycle of this mudra can significantly stimulate the body{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. It is described in the book, ''Theories of the Chakras'', by [[Hiroshi Motoyama]].

==Common Buddhist mudrās==

=== Abhaya Mudrā ===
[[File:「연가 칠년」이 새겨진 금동불입상 02.jpg|right|thumb|[[Korea]]'s National Treasure 119. The right hand shows abhaya mudra while the left is in the varada mudra.]]
The ''[[Abhayamudra]]'' "gesture of fearlessness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691157863|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents protection, peace, benevolence and the dispelling of fear. In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] it is usually made while standing with the right arm bent and raised to shoulder height, the palm facing forward, the fingers closed, pointing upright and the left hand resting by the side. In Thailand and Laos, this mudra is associated with the walking Buddha, often shown having both hands making a double abhaya mudra that is uniform.

This mudra was probably used before the onset of Buddhism as a symbol of good intentions proposing friendship when approaching strangers. In [[Gandhara]]n art, it is seen when showing the action of preaching. It was also used in China during the [[Northern Wei|Wei]] and [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] eras of the 4th and 7th centuries.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

This gesture was used by the Buddha when attacked by an elephant, subduing it as shown in several [[fresco]]es and scripts.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], the northern schools' deities often paired it with another mudra using the other hand.

===Bhūmisparśa Mudrā===
[[File:Buddha sitting-MGR Lyon-IMG 9878.jpg|thumb|left|Buddha sitting in bhūmisparśa mudrā. Birmany. White marble with traces of polychromy. [[Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon-Fourvière]]]]
The ''bhūmisparśa'' or "earth witness" mudra of [[Gautama Buddha]] is one of the most common iconic images of Buddhism. It depicts the Buddha sitting in meditation with his left hand, palm upright, in his lap, and his right hand touching the earth. It represents the Buddha asking [[Prithvi|Pṛthivi]], the [[devi]] of the earth, that she witness his enlightenment when he was threatened by demon king Mara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Miranda Eberle|title=Buddhist Goddesses of India|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|pages=17–27|isbn=978-0-691-12758-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvDKOK1h3zMC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bodhyangi Mudrā===
[[File:철원_도피안사_철조비로자나불좌상.jpg|thumb|right|Bodhyangi Mudrā]]
The ''Bodhyangi mudrā'', the "mudrā of the six elements," or the "fist of wisdom,"&lt;ref name="LLD.Charles2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T.W. Rhys Davids Ph.D. LLD.|author2=Victoria Charles|title=1000 Buddhas of Genius|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jV3vBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA515|date=24 November 2014|publisher=Parkstone International|isbn=978-1-78310-463-5|pages=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a gesture entailing the left-hand index finger being grasped with the right hand. It is commonly seen on statues of the [[Vairocana]] Buddha.

===Dharmachakra Mudrā===
[[File:Buddha in Sarnath Museum (Dhammajak Mutra).jpg|thumb|left|A statue of the Buddha from [[Sarnath]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India, 4th century CE. The Buddha is depicted teaching, while making the Dharmacakra mudrā.]]
The Buddha preached his first sermon after his Enlightenment in Deer Park in [[Sarnath]]. The [[dharmachakra]] or "turning of the wheel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhas-online.com/mudras.html explanation of Buddhist Mudras]&lt;/ref&gt; mudrā represents that moment. In general, only Gautama Buddha is shown making this mudrā except [[Maitreya]] as the dispenser of the Law. Dharmachakra mudrā is two hands close together in front of the chest in [[vitarka]] with the right palm forward and the left palm upward, sometimes facing the chest.
There are several variants such as in the [[Ajanta Caves]] frescoes, where the two hands are separated and the fingers do not touch. In the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek style]] of [[Gandhara]], the clenched fist of the right hand seemingly overlies the fingers joined to the thumb on the left hand. In pictorials of [[Hōryū-ji]] in Japan the right hand is superimposed on the left. Certain figures of [[Amitābha]], Japan are seen using this mudra before the 9th century.

===Dhyāna Mudrā===
[[File:Amitabha_of_Phat_Tich_pagoda_(reproduction),_Bac_Ninh_province,_1057_AD_DSC04844.JPG|thumb|right|Reproduction of the [[Amitābha]] statue of [[Phật Tích Temple]], [[Hanoi]], demonstrating the [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]] mudrā]]
[[File:KamakuraDaibutsu3969.jpg|thumb|right|Hands of [[Amitābha]] statue at [[Kōtoku-in]], [[Kamakura]], demonstrating ''mida no jōin'', a variation of the [[Mudra#Dhyāna_Mudrā|Dhyāna Mudrā]]]]

The ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]] mudrā'' ("meditation mudra") is the gesture of meditation, of the concentration of the Good Law and the [[sangha]]. The two hands are placed on the lap, left hand on right with fingers fully stretched (four fingers resting on each other and the thumbs facing upwards towards one another diagonally), palms facing upwards; in this manner, the hands and fingers form the shape of a triangle, which is symbolic of the spiritual fire or the [[Refuge (Buddhism)|Three Jewels]].
This mudra is used in representations of [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Amitābha]]. Sometimes the dhyāna mudrā is used in certain representations of {{IAST|Bhaiṣajyaguru}} as the "Medicine Buddha", with a medicine bowl placed on the hands. It originated in India most likely in [[Gandhāra]] and in China during the [[Northern Wei]].

It is heavily used in Southeast Asia in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]; however, the thumbs are placed against the palms. Dhyāna mudrā is also known as "[[samadhi|samādhi]] mudrā" or "yoga mudrā", {{cjkv|p=[Chán]dìng yìn|r=jōin, jōkai jōin|c=禅定印}}.

The ''mida no jōin'' (弥陀定印) is the Japanese name of a variation of the dhyāna mudra, where the index fingers are brought together with the thumbs. This was predominately used in Japan in an effort to distinguish Amitābha (hence "mida" from Amida) from the Vairocana Buddha,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]]''. [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/m/midanojouin.htm "JAANUS / mida-no-jouin  弥陀定印"]. Retrieved 2 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and was rarely used elsewhere.

=== Varada Mudrā ===
The ''[[Varadamudra|Varadamudrā]]'' "generosity gesture" signifies offering, welcome, charity, giving, compassion and sincerity. It is nearly always shown made with the left hand by a revered figure devoted to human salvation from greed, anger and delusion. It can be made with the arm crooked and the palm offered slightly turned up or in the case of the arm facing down the palm presented with the fingers upright or slightly bent. The Varada mudrā is rarely seen without another mudra used by the right hand, typically abhaya mudrā. It is often confused with vitarka mudrā, which it closely resembles. In China and Japan during the [[Northern Wei]] and [[Asuka period]]s, respectively, the fingers are stiff and then gradually begin to loosen as it developed over time, eventually leading to the [[Tang dynasty]] standard where the fingers are naturally curved.

In [[India]], varada mudra is used in images of [[Avalokiteśvara]] from the [[Gupta Empire]] (4th and 5th centuries). Varada mudrā is extensively used in the statues of [[Southeast Asia]].

===Vajra Mudrā===
[[File:VajraMudra.JPG|thumb|left|Vajra Mudrā]]

The ''[[Vajra]] mudrā'' "thunder gesture" is the gesture of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=written|last2=Beer|first2=illustrated by Robert|title=The handbook of tibetan buddhist symbols|date=2003|publisher=Serindia|location=Chicago (Ill.)|isbn=978-1932476033|page=228|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the application of the Vajra mudrā is the seventh technique (out of nine) of the ''[[Kuji-in|Nine Syllable Seals]]''.

===Vitarka Mudrā===
[[File:VitarkaMudra.JPG|thumb|right|Vitarka mudrā, [[Tarim Basin]], 9th century]]

The ''Vitarka mudrā'' "mudra of discussion" is the gesture of discussion and transmission of Buddhist teaching. It is done by joining the tips of the thumb and the index together, and keeping the other fingers straight very much like the abhaya and varada mudrās but with the thumbs touching the index fingers. This mudra has a great number of variants in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]]. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], it is the mystic gesture of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]]s and [[bodhisattva]]s with some differences by the deities in [[Yab-Yum]]. Vitarka mudrā is also known as ''Vyākhyāna mudrā'' ("mudra of explanation").

===Gyana Mudrā===
The ''gyāna mudrā'' ("mudra of wisdom") is done by touching the tips of the thumb and the index together, forming a circle, and the hand is held with the palm inward toward the heart.&lt;ref&gt;For translation of ''{{IAST|jñānamudrā}}'' as "gesture of knowledge" see: {{Harvnb|Stutley|2003|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karana Mudrā===
[[File:Pressapochista14.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseon]] figure on the left makes the karana mudrā.]]
The ''karana mudrā'' is the mudra which expels demons and removes obstacles such as sickness or negative thoughts. It is made by raising the index and the little finger, and folding the other fingers. It is nearly the same as the Western "[[sign of the horns]]", the difference is that in the Karana mudra the thumb does not hold down the middle and ring finger. This mudra is also known as ''tarjanī mudrā''; Japanese: ''Funnu-in'', ''[[Acala|Fudō]]-in''.

==Martial arts and mudra==
Various [[List of martial arts#Asia|Asian martial arts]] forms contain positions identical to these mudras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|2000|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muromoto (2003) in discussing his experience of mudra in relation to his martial arts training makes reference to [[Mikkyō]], [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism]]:
{{quote|One of the more curious things that I encountered in my martial arts training was the use of mudra in combative arts. Mudra (Japanese: in), for those who aren't familiar with them, are these weird hand gestures that are derived from esoteric Buddhism (mikkyo), particularly the Tendai and Shingon sects. These gestures are supposed to generate spiritual focus and power which then are manifested in some way externally.&lt;ref name="Muromoto, Wayne 2007"&gt;Muromoto, Wayne (2003) ''[http://www.furyu.com/onlinearticles/mudra.html Mudra in the Martial Arts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215031615/http://www.furyu.com/onlinearticles/mudra.html |date=2007-12-15 }}''. . Retrieved December 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Muromoto (2003) states a lineage of mudra in martial arts and evokes [[Koryū]], [[Ryū (school)|Ryū]], [[Kantō region|Kantō]], [[Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū]], [[:fi:Risuke Ōtake|Risuke Ōtake]] and [[Donn F. Draeger]]:
{{quote|In any case, I had known of the use of mudra in koryu ("old" martial arts) since the time I was privy to a discussion with the training master of the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto-ryu, Otake Risuke, and the late Donn F. Draeger. Otake sensei described some of the mudra used in his school, which is one of the oldest martial ryu still in existence in Kanto (Eastern) Japan.&lt;ref name="Muromoto, Wayne 2007"/&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2018}}}}
In relation to charting a historical tributary to mudra within Japanese fighting culture, Muromoto (2003) incorporates [[Shinto|Shintō]], [[Samurai]], [[Tokugawa shogunate]], [[Neo-Confucianism]], [[Zen]], the [[Kamakura shogunate]], the [[Edo]] period, [[Takuan Sōhō]] and [[Hakuin Ekaku]]:
{{quote|The use of mudra and other aspects of mikkyo are found in many instances in many koryu, because mikkyo and Shinto were the religions of the samurai who founded those ryu that were created before the 17th century. Subsequent ryu developed after the imposition of the Tokugawa government were heavily influenced by Neo-Confucianism, and then later by Zen Buddhism. Although Zen was popularized among the warrior class in the Kamakura period, the 14th century, it did not greatly affect martial arts until the latter part of the Edo Period, with the writings of the Zen priests Takuan and Hakuin. And even at that, Edo Period (1600-1868) martial arts were equally influenced by Neo-Confucianism and even, in the latter part, mystical Shinto.&lt;ref name="Muromoto, Wayne 2007"/&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2018}}}}
Muromoto (2003) textually maps the execution of the [[knifehand strike]] mudrā:
{{quote|Mikkyo uses mudra most often in combination with various rituals, chants and so on. One common mudra is that of the "knife hand," or shuto. The first two fingers are extended while the thumb and other fingers are clenched. If you look closely, you may see this movement subtly hidden in some koryu kata, especially by old schools such as the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto-ryu, or in statues of divine Buddhist beings. This represents the sword of enlightenment, which cuts away all delusions. Sometimes the tips of the extended fingers are grasped in the fist of the other hand. There is a symbolic meaning for this, derived from mikkyo.&lt;ref name="Muromoto, Wayne 2007"/&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2018}}}}

In [[esoteric cosmology]], a '''plane''' is conceived as a subtle state, level, or region of reality, each plane corresponding to some type, kind, or category of [[being]].

The concept may be found in [[religious]] and [[esotericism|esoteric]] teachings—''e.g.'' [[Vedanta]] ([[Advaita Vedanta]]), [[Ayyavazhi]], [[shamanism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Kashmir Shaivism]], [[Sant Mat]]/[[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[Druze]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]], [[Rosicrucianism]] ([[Esoteric Christianity|Esoteric Christian]]), [[Eckankar]], [[Ascended Master Teachings]], etc.—which propound the idea of a whole series of subtle planes or worlds or dimensions which, from a center, interpenetrate themselves and the physical [[planet]] in which we live, the [[planetary system|solar systems]], and all the physical structures of the universe. This interpenetration of planes culminates in the universe itself as a physical structured, dynamic and evolutive expression emanated through a series of steadily denser stages, becoming progressively more material and embodied.

The [[emanationism|emanation]] is conceived, according to esoteric teachings, to have originated, at the dawn of the universe's manifestation, in ''[[Great Architect of the Universe|The Supreme Being]]'' who sent out—from the unmanifested ''[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]'' beyond comprehension—the dynamic force of creative energy, as ''sound-vibration'' ("the Word"), into the abyss of space. Alternatively, it states that this dynamic force is being sent forth, through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit the universe.

==Origins of the concept==
The concept of planes of existence might be seen as deriving from shamanic and traditional mythological ideas of a vertical world-axis&amp;mdash;for example a cosmic [[mountain]], [[tree]], or pole (such as [[Yggdrasil]] or [[Mount Meru]])&amp;mdash;or a philosophical conception of a [[Great Chain of Being]], arranged metaphorically from [[God]] down to inanimate matter.

However the original source of the word ''plane'' in this context is the late [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] [[Proclus]], who refers to ''to platos'', "breadth", which was the equivalent of the 19th-century theosophical use. An example is the phrase ''en to psychiko platei''.&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, cited in Poortman, 1978, vol II, p.&amp;nbsp;54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions in ancient traditions==
Directly equivalent concepts in Indian thought are [[loka]]s and bhuvanas. In [[Hindu]] cosmology, there are many lokas or worlds, that are identified with both traditional cosmology and states of [[meditation]].

Planes of existence may have been referred to by the use of the term corresponding to the word "egg" in English. For example, the Sanskrit term [[Brahmanda]] translates to "The entire creation" as opposed to the lazy inference "The Egg of Creation". Certain Puranic accounts posit that the Brahmanda is the superset of a set of fractal smaller Eggs, as is seen in the assertion of the equivalence of the Brahmanda and the [[Pinda (riceball)|Pinda]].&lt;ref&gt;Kak, Subhash: ''The Architecture of Knowledge''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Norse mythology gave the name "[[Ginnungagap]]" to the primordial "Chaos," which was bounded upon the northern side by the cold and foggy "[[Niflheim]]"—the land of mist and fog—and upon the south side by the fire "[[Muspelheim]]." When heat and cold entered into space which was occupied by Chaos or Ginnungagap, they caused the crystallization of the visible universe.

In the medieval West and Middle East, one finds reference to four worlds (''olam'') in [[Kabbalah]], or five in [[Sufism]] (where they are also called ''[[tanazzulat]]''; "descents"), and also in [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic Kabbalah]]. In Kabbalah, each of the four or five worlds are themselves divided into ten [[Sephirah|sefirot]], or else divided in other ways.

==Esoteric conceptions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Charles Leadbeater Planes.jpg|thumb|300px|right| The planes according to [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]].]] --&gt;
The [[alchemy|alchemists]] of the [[Middle Ages]] proposed ideas about the constitution of the universe through a [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] language full of esoteric words, phrases, and signs designed to cloak their meaning from those not initiated into the ways of alchemy. In his "Physica" (1633), the Rosicrucian alchemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]], wrote: "Ad huc spiritum incognitum Gas voco" q.e., "This hitherto unknown Spirit I call Gas." Further on in the same work he says, "This vapor which I have called Gas is not far removed from the [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]] the ancients spoke of." Later on, similar ideas would evolve around the idea of aether.

In the late 19th century, the metaphysical term "planes" was popularised by the theosophy of [[H.P. Blavatsky]], who in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' and other writings propounded a complex cosmology consisting of seven planes and subplanes, based on a synthesis of Eastern and Western ideas. From theosophy the term made its way to later esoteric systems such as that of [[Alice Bailey]], who was very influential in shaping the worldview of the [[New Age]] movement. The term is also found in some Eastern teachings that have some Western influence, such as the cosmology of [[Sri Aurobindo]] and some of the later [[Sant Mat]], and also in some descriptions of Buddhist cosmology. The teachings of [[Surat Shabd Yoga]] also include several planes of the creation within both the [[macrocosm and microcosm]], including the Bramanda egg contained within the Sach Khand egg. [[Max Theon]] used the word "States" (French ''Etat'') rather than "Planes", in his [[cosmic philosophy]], but the meaning is the same.

The planes in Theosophy were further systematized in the writings of [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]].

In the early 20th century, [[Max Heindel]] presented in ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]'' a cosmology related to the scheme of evolution in general and the evolution of the [[solar system]] and the [[Earth]] in particular, according to the Rosicrucians. He establishes, through the conceptions presented, a bridge between modern [[science]] (currently starting research into the subtler [[Etheric plane|''etheric'']] plane of existence behind the physical) and [[religion]], in order that this last one may be able to address man's ''[[spirituality|inner]]'' questions raised by scientific advancement.

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] proposed that there are six planes of consciousness that must be experienced before one can attain [[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realization]] on the seventh plane: "Each definite stage of advancement represents a state of consciousness, and advancement from one state of consciousness to another proceeds side by side with crossing the inner planes. Thus six intermediate planes and states of consciousness have to be experienced before reaching the seventh plane which is the end of the journey and where there is final realisation of the God-state."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 22. {{ISBN|978-1-880619-09-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emanation vs. Big Bang==

Most cosmologists today believe that the [[universe]] expanded from a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, in [[esoteric cosmology]] expansion refers to the [[emanation]] or unfolding of steadily denser planes or spheres from the spiritual summit, what Greek philosophy called ''[[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]]'', until the lowest and most material world is reached.
	 
According to [[Rosicrucian]]s, another difference is that there is no such thing as empty or void space. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The space is Spirit in its attenuated form; while matter is crystallized space or Spirit. Spirit in manifestation is dual, that which we see as Form is the negative manifestation of Spirit--crystallized and inert. The positive pole of Spirit manifests as Life, galvanizing the negative Form into action, but both Life and Form originated in Spirit, Space, Chaos! On the other hand, Chaos is not a state which has existed in the past and has now entirely disappeared. It is all around us at the present moment. Were it not that old forms--having outlived their usefulness--are constantly being resolved back into that Chaos, which is also as constantly giving birth to new forms, there could be no progress; the work of evolution would cease and stagnation would prevent the possibility of advancement."&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]'' (Chapter XI: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng11.htm The Genesis and Evolution of our Solar System]), 1909, {{ISBN|0-911274-34-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The planes==
In occult teachings and as held by psychics and other esoteric authors there are seven planes of existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetadnaactivation.com/medical2.html Seven Planes of Existence - Theta Medical Intuition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most occult and esoteric teachings are in agreement that seven planes of existence exist; however, many different occult and metaphysical schools label the planes of existence with different terminology.

===Physical plane===
The '''physical plane''' or '''physical universe''', in [[emanation]]ist metaphysics taught in [[Neoplatonism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], refers to the visible [[reality]] of [[space]] and [[time]], [[energy]] and [[matter]]: the physical universe in [[Occultism]] and [[esoteric cosmology]] is the lowest or [[density|densest]] of a series of planes of existence.

According to Theosophists, after the physical plane is the '''etheric plane''' and both of these planes are connected to make up the first plane.&lt;ref&gt;John Friedlander, Gloria Hemsher ''Psychic Psychology: Energy Skills for Life and Relationships'' 2011, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy also teaches that when the [[physical body]] dies the [[etheric body]] is left behind and the [[soul]] forms into an [[astral body]] on the astral plane.&lt;ref&gt;Norman C. McClelland ''Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma'' 2010, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical researcher [[F. W. H. Myers]] proposed the existence of a “[[metetherial world]]”, which he wrote to be a world of images lying beyond the physical world. He wrote that apparitions have a real existence in the metetherial world which he described as a dream-like world.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, F. H. W. (1903). Human personality and its survival of death. London: Longmans.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astral plane===
[[File:Oresme Spheres crop.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''The astral spheres were thought to be planes of angelic existence intermediate between Earth and [[heaven]]'']]
The '''[[astral plane]]''', also known as the '''emotional plane''' is where consciousness goes after physical death. According to [[occult]] philosophy man possesses an [[astral body]]. The astral plane (also known as the astral world) was postulated by classical (particularly [[neo-Platonic|neoplatonic]]), medieval, oriental, and [[esotericism|esoteric]] philosophies and [[mystery cult|mystery religions]].&lt;ref name="G.R.S.Mead, 1919"&gt;G.R.S.Mead, ''The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition'', Watkins 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world of the [[celestial spheres|planetary spheres]], crossed by the soul in its [[astral body]] on the way to being born and [[afterlife|after death]], and generally said to be populated by [[angel]]s, spirits, or other immaterial beings.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', trans. Desmond Lee, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 19th and early 20th century the term was popularised by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and neo-[[Rosicrucianism]].

Throughout the [[Renaissance]], philosophers, [[Paracelsus|Paracelsians]], [[Rosicrucians]] and alchemists continued to discuss the nature of the astral world intermediate between Earth and the divine. The ''[[Barzakh]]'', ''olam mithal'' or intermediate world in [[Islam]] and the "World of ''[[Yetzirah]]''" in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] are related concepts.

According to occult teachings the astral plane can be visited consciously through [[astral projection]], [[meditation]], and [[mantra]], [[near death experience|near-death experience]], [[lucid dreaming]], or other means.  Individuals that are trained in the use of the astral vehicle can separate their consciousness in the astral vehicle from the physical body at will.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Brennan, ''Astral Doorways'', Thoth Publications 1996 {{ISBN|978-1-870450-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theosophist]] author [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]] wrote: "When a person dies, they become fully conscious in the astral body. After a certain time, the astral body disintegrates, and the person then becomes conscious on the mental plane." &lt;ref&gt;First Principles of Theosophy, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

Occultist [[George Arundale]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the astral world exist temporarily all those physical entities, men and animals, for whom sleep involves a separation of the physical body for a time from the higher bodies. While we "sleep", we live in our astral bodies, either fully conscious and active, or partly conscious and semi-dormant, as the case may be, according to our evolutionary growth; when we "wake", the physical and the higher bodies are interlocked again, and we cease to be inhabitants of the astral world.” &lt;ref&gt;Curuppumullagē Jinarājadāsa ''First Principles of Theosophy'' Theosophical Publishing House, 1922, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some writers have claimed the astral plane can be reached by [[dream]]ing. [[Sylvan Muldoon]] and psychical researcher [[Hereward Carrington]] in their book ''The Projection of the Astral Body'' (1929) wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"When you are dreaming you are not really in the same world as when you are conscious – in the physical – although the two worlds merge into one another. While dreaming, you really are in the astral plane, and usually your astral body is in the zone of quietude."&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan J. Muldoon and Hereward Carrington ''Projection of the Astral Body'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Astral projection]] author Robert Bruce describes the astral as seven planes that take the form of planar surfaces when approached from a distance, separated by immense coloured "buffer zones".  These planes are endlessly repeating ruled [[Cartesian coordinate system]] grids, tiled with a single signature pattern that is different for each plane. Higher planes have bright, colourful patterns, whereas lower planes appear far duller. Every detail of these patterns acts as a consistent portal to a different kingdom inside the plane, which itself comprises many separate realms. Bruce notes that the astral may also be entered by means of long tubes that bear visual similarity to these planes, and conjectures that the grids and tubes are in fact the same structures approached from a different perceptual angle.

In his book ''[[wikisource:Autobiography of a Yogi|Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', [[Paramhansa Yogananda]] provides details about the astral planes learned from his resurrected guru [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]].&lt;ref name="Paramhansa Yogananda 1946"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iN6fdZR6rXkC&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400|title=Autobiography of a Yogi (Google books)|author=Paramhansa Yogananda|year=1946|work=|publisher=The Philosophical Library, Inc|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogananda reveals that nearly all individuals enter the astral planes after death. There they work out the seeds of past [[karma (Hinduism)|karma]] through astral incarnations, or (if their karma requires) they return to earthly incarnations for further refinement. Once an individual has attained the meditative state of [[nirvikalpa|nirvikalpa samadhi]] in an earthy or astral incarnation, the soul may progress upward to the "illumined astral planet" of Hiranyaloka.&lt;ref name="Paramhansa Yogananda 1946"/&gt; After this transitional stage, the soul may then move upward to the more subtle causal spheres where many incarnations allow them to further refine until [[Satcitananda|final unification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reluctant-messenger.com/yogananda/chapter_43.htm|title=Autobiography of a Yogi|author=Paramhansa Yogananda|year=1946|work=|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental plane===
The '''mental plane''', also known as the '''causal plane''' is the third lowest plane according to Theosophy. The mental plane is divided into seven sub-planes.

[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the mental world one formulates a thought and it is instantly transmitted to the mind of another without any expression in the form of words. Therefore on that plane language does not matter in the least; but helpers working in the astral world, who have not yet the power to use the mental vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater, The Inner Life, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Annie Besant]] wrote that "The mental plane, as its name implies, is that which belongs to consciousness working as thought; not of the mind as it works through the brain, but as it works through its own world, unencumbered with physical spirit-matter.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant ''The Ancient Wisdom: An Outline of Theosophical Teachings'' 1939, Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed description of the mental plane, along with the mental body, is provided by [[Arthur E. Powell]], who has compiled information in the works of Besant and Leadbeater in a series of books on each of the subtle bodies.

According to [[Hindu]] occultism the mental plane consists of two divisions, the lower division is known as heaven (''swarglok'') and the upper division is known as the causal plane (''maharlok'').&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar, Jytte Larsen ''The Kundalini book of living and dying: gateways to a higher consciousness'' 2004, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] wrote:

:''"The causal plane is the world of light and blessedness, the highest of heavenly regions, extolled in the scriptures of all faiths. It is the foundation of existence, the source of visions, the point of conception, the apex of creation. The causal plane is the abode of Lord Siva and His entourage of Mahadevas and other highly evolved souls who exist in their own self-effulgent form--radiant bodies of centillions of quantum light particles."&lt;ref&gt;[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]], ''Dancing With Siva : Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism'', 1996, xxxv, 1008 p., ill., Sixth Edition, First Printing, 2003 Himalayan Academy [http://himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/dws/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;''

[[Sri Aurobindo]] developed a very different concept of the mental plane, through his own synthesis of Vedanta (including the Taittiriya Upanishad), Tantra, Theosophy, and [[Max Théon]] ideas (which he received via [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]], who was Theon's student in occultism for two years).  In this cosmology, there are seven cosmic planes, three lower, corresponding to relative existence (the [[Physical (Sri Aurobindo)|Physical]], [[Vital (Sri Aurobindo)|Vital]], and [[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|Mental]]), and four higher, representing infinite divine reality (''[[The Life Divine|Life Divine]]'' bk.1 ch.27)  The Aurobindonian Mind or Mental Plane constitutes a large zone of being from the mental vital to the [[Overmind (Sri Aurobindo)|overmental]] divine region (''[[Letters on Yoga]]'', Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984), but as with the later Theosophical concept it constitutes an objective reality of sheer mind or thought.

===Buddhic plane (also known as unity plane)===
The ''buddhic plane'' is described as a realm of pure [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua David Stone, Janna Shelley ''A Beginner's Guide to the Path of Ascension'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theosophy the buddhic plane exists to develop buddhic consciousness which means to become unselfish and solve any problems with the ego.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater ''Inner Life'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Leadbeater]] wrote that in the buddhic plane man casts off the delusion of the self and enters a realization of unity.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater ''The Masters and the Path'' 2007, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Annie Besant]] defined the buddhic plane as

&lt;blockquote&gt;Persistent, conscious, spiritual awareness. This is the full consciousness of the buddhic or intuitional level. This is the perceptive consciousness which is the outstanding characteristic of the Hierarchy. The life focus of the man shifts to the buddhic plane. This is the fourth or middle state of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bailey ''The Rays and the Initiations'' 1971, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sri Aurobindo]] calls the level above the mental plane the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|supermind]].&lt;ref&gt;Madis Senner ''The Way Home: Making Heaven on Earth'' 2009, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual plane===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}
[[George Winslow Plummer]] wrote that the ''spiritual plane'' is split into many sub-planes and that on these planes live spiritual beings who are more advanced in development and status than ordinary man.&lt;ref&gt;George Winslow Plummer ''Mercury: An Official Organ of the Societas Rosicruciana in America 1916-1921'' Kessinger reprint edition, 1998, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] teachings the goal of the spiritual plane is to gain spiritual knowledge and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond T. Kranyak ''Metaphysical Secrets for Health and Success in Life'' 2009, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine plane===
According to some occult teachings, all [[souls]] are born on the ''divine plane'' and then descend down through the lower planes; however souls will work their way back to the divine plane.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Poinsot ''Complete Book of the Occult and Fortune Telling'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of occult sciences'', R. M. McBride and company, 1939, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; On the divine plane souls can be opened to conscious communication with the sphere of the divine known as the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] and receive knowledge about the nature of reality.&lt;ref&gt;John Hamlin Dewey ''New Testament of Occultism'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosicrucianism]] teaches that the divine plane is where [[Jesus]] dwelt in [[Christ consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;The Rosicrucian Digest September 1932, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logoic plane (also known as monadic plane)===
The ''logoic plane'' is the highest plane, it has been described as a plane of total oneness, the "I AM Presence". [[Joshua David Stone]] describes the plane as complete unity with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua David Stone, Janna Shelley Parker ''A Beginner's Guide to the Path of Ascension'' 1998, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''monadic plane (hyperplane)'' or continuum/universe, enclosing and interpenetrating grosser hyperplanes, respectively is the plane in which the monad or holy spirit or oversoul is said to exist.

==31 planes==
{{main|Buddhist cosmology}}
In Buddhism, the world is made up of 31 planes of existence that one can be reborn into, separated into 3 realms.

==The Summerland==
{{main|The Summerland}}
The Summerland is the name given by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]], [[Spiritualists]], [[Wicca]]ns, and some earth-based [[paganism (contemporary)|contemporary pagan]] religions to their conceptualization of existence on a plane in an [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativespirit.net/spiritworld/ The Spirit World Descriptions by Early Spiritualists by Barbara N. Starr]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772) inspired [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] (1826–1910), in his major work ''The Great Harmonia'' to say that Summerland is the pinnacle of spiritual achievement in the afterlife; that is, it is the highest level, or ''sphere'', of the afterlife we can hope to enter. The common portrayal of the Summerland is as a place of rest for souls after or between their earthly incarnations. Some believe [[spirits]] will stay in the Summerland for an eternal afterlife, though others believe after an amount of time some spirits will [[reincarnate]]. The Summerland is also envisioned as a place for recollection and reunion with deceased loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fst.org/sptwld1.htm Life in the Spirit World: Part One General Introduction By Rev. Simeon Stefanidakis]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name suggests, it is often imagined as a place of beauty and peace, where everything people hold close to their hearts is preserved in its fullest beauty for eternity. It is envisioned as containing wide (possibly eternal) fields  of rolling green hills and lush grass. In many ways, this ideology is similar to the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] view of [[Annwn]] as an afterlife realm. The Summerland is also viewed as the place where one goes in the afterlife in traditions of [[Spiritualism]] and Theosophy, which is where Wicca got the term.

In Theosophy, the term "Summerland" is used without the definite article "the". Summerland, also called the Astral plane Heaven, is depicted as where [[soul]]s who have been good in their previous lives go between incarnations. Those who have been bad go to [[Hell]], which is believed to be located below the surface of the Earth and is on the astral plane and is composed of the densest astral matter; the Spiritual Hierarchy functioning within Earth functions on the etheric plane below the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W ''A Textbook of Theosophy'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Theosophists that most people (those at high levels of initiation) go to a specific Summerland that is set up for people of each religion. For example, [[Christians]] go to a Christian heaven, [[Jews]] go to a Jewish heaven, [[Muslims]] go to a Muslim heaven, [[Hindus]] goes to a Hindu heaven, Theosophists go to a Theosophical heaven, and so forth, each heaven being like that described in the [[scripture]]s of that religion. There is also a generic Summerland for those who were [[atheist]]s or [[agnostic]]s in their previous lives. People who belong to religions that don't believe in [[reincarnation]] are surprised to find out when they get to heaven that they will have to reincarnate again within a few dozen to a few hundred years. Each heaven is believed to be an extensive structure composed of astral matter located on the astral plane about three or four miles (5–6&amp;nbsp;km) above the surface of Earth, above that part of the world where the particular religion that the heaven is meant for is most predominant.

Theosophists also believe there is another higher level of heaven called [[Devachan]], also called the Mental plane Heaven, which some but not all souls reach between incarnations—only those souls that are more highly developed [[spirituality|spiritually]] reach this level, those souls that are at the first, second, and third levels of initiation. Devachan is several miles (around 10&amp;nbsp;km) higher above the surface of Earth than Summerland.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The final permanent eternal afterlife heaven to which Theosophists believe most people will go millions or billions of years in the future, after our cycle of reincarnations in this Round is over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ez2.net/nick29/theosophy/lessons06.htm Various Levels of the Afterlife in Theosophy:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722101232/http://users.ez2.net/nick29/theosophy/lessons06.htm |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to go to Nirvana, it is necessary to have attained the fourth level of initiation or higher, meaning one is an ''[[arhat]]'' and thus no longer needs to reincarnate.

==Inhabitants of the various planes==
Occult writers such as [[Geoffrey Hodson]], Mellie Uyldert, and [[Dora van Gelder]] had attempted to classify different spiritual beings into a hierarchy based on their assumed place and function on the planes of existence.

[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] fundamentally described and incorporated his comprehension of intangible beings for Theosophy. Along with him there are various planes intertwined with the quotidian human world and are all inhabited by multitudes of entities. Each plane is purported as composed of discrete density of ''[[etheric plane|astral or ethereal matter]]'' and frequently the denizens of a plane have no discernment of other ones. Other Theosophical writers such as [[Alice Bailey]], a contemporary of Leadbeater, also gave continuousness to Theosophical concepts of ethereal beings and her works had a great impact over [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Laderman, Luis D.

The ethereal entities of the four kingdoms, Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, are forces of nature.

The Dutch writer [[Mellie Uyldert]], self-proclaimed clairvoyant, characterized the semblance and behavior of ethereal entities on the etheric plane, which, she said, hover above plants and transfer energy for vitalizing the plant, then nourishing themselves on rays of sunlight. She depicted them as asexual gender, and composed of [[etheric body|''etheric'' matter]].
They fly three meters over the ground, some have wings like butterflies while others only have a small face and an [[aura (paranormal)|aura]] waving graciously. Some are huge while others may have the size of one inch.&lt;ref&gt;Mellie Uyldert ''The psychic garden: Plants and their esoteric relationship with man'' Thorsons, 1980 {{ISBN|0-7225-0548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plot v. story en.png|right|thumb|300px|Plot and Story.  Plot is the cause‐and‐effect sequence of events in a story.&lt;ref name="dibell" /&gt;]]

'''Plot''' refers to the sequence of events inside a [[narrative|story]] which affect other events through the principle of [[Causality|cause and effect]]. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of sentences linked by "and so". Plots can vary from simple structures such as in a traditional [[ballad]] to complex interwoven structures sometimes referred to as an ''imbroglio''. The term ''plot'' can serve as a verb and refer to a character planning future actions in the story.

In the narrative sense, the term highlights the important points which have important consequences within the story, according to Ansen Dibell.&lt;ref name="dibell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ansen Dibell, Ph.D.|title=Plot|date=1999-07-15|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|series=Elements of Fiction Writing|pages=5 f.|isbn=978-0-89879-946-0|quote=Plot is built of significant events in a given story – significant because they have important consequences. Taking a shower isn't necessarily plot... Let's call them incidents ... Plot is the things characters do, feel, think or say, that make a difference to what comes afterward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is similar in meaning to the term ''storyline''.&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Dictionary.'' "[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plot?s=t plot]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionaries.'' "[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/storyline?q=storyline storyline]."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
English novelist [[E. M. Forster]] described plot as the cause-and-effect relationship between events in a story. According to Forster, "''The king died, and then the queen died,'' is a story, while ''The king died, and then the queen died of grief,'' is a plot."&lt;ref name="prince"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Gerald|title=A Dictionary of Narratology|publisher=University of Nebraska Press.|edition=Revised|date=2003-12-01|page=73|isbn=978-0-8032-8776-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wales|first=Katie|title=A Dictionary of Stylistics|series=Longman Linguistics|publisher=Routledge|edition=3|date=2011-05-19|page=320|isbn=978-1-4082-3115-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E.M. Aspects of the Novel. Mariner Books. (1956) {{ISBN|978-0156091800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider the following:

::#The prince searches for Cinderella with the glass shoe
::#Cinderella's sisters tried the shoe on but it does not fit
::#The shoe fits Cinderella's foot so the prince finds her

The first event is causally related to the third event, while the second event, though descriptive, does not directly impact the outcome. As a result, according to Dibell, the plot can be described numerically as 1→3 while the story can be described as 1→2→3. A story orders events from beginning to end in a time sequence.&lt;ref name="dibell" /&gt; Teri Shaffer Yamada agrees that a plot does not include memorable [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] within a story which do not relate directly to other events but only "major events that move the action in a narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Teri Shaffer Yamada, Ph.D.|title=ELEMENTS OF FICTION|publisher=[[California State University, Long Beach]]|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~yamadaty/EleFic.html|accessdate=2014-12-20|archivedate=2014-12-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220115428/http://www.csulb.edu/~yamadaty/EleFic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', when Rose climbs on the railing at the front of the ship and spreads her hands as if she's flying, this scene is memorable but does not directly influence other events, so it may not be considered as part of the plot. Another example of a memorable scene which is not part of the plot occurs in the 1980 film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', when Han Solo is frozen in carbonite.&lt;ref name="dibell" /&gt; Steve Alcorn, a fiction-writing coach, said the main plot elements of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' could be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name="alcorn"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Alcorn|title=Know the Difference Between Plot and Story|publisher=Tejix|url=http://www.tejix.com/en/PaperPlot.html|accessdate=2014-08-24|archivedate= 2014-08-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823193203/http://www.tejix.com/en/PaperPlot.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fabula and syuzhet ===
{{Main|Fabula and syuzhet}}
The literary theory of Russian Formalism in the early 20th century divided a narrative into two elements: the ''fabula'' (фа́була) and the ''syuzhet'' (сюже́т). A fabula is the events in the fictional world, whereas a syuzhet is a perspective of those events. Formalist followers eventually translated the fabula/syuzhet to the concept of story/plot. This definition is usually used in narratology, in parallel with Forster's definition. The ''fabula'' (story) is what happened in chronological order. In contrast, the ''syuzhet'' (plot) means a unique sequence of discourse that was sorted out by the (implied) author. That is, the syuzhet can consist of picking up the fabula events in non-chronological order; for example, fabula is &lt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, …, a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, syuzhet is &lt;a&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;.

== Structure ==
{{See also|Dramatic structure|Three-act structure}}
Today screenwriters generally combine plot with plot structure into what is called a [[Film treatment|treatment]], sometimes referred to as the three-act structure, in which a film is divided into three acts: the ''set-up'', the ''confrontation'' and the ''resolution''. Acts are connected by two [[plot point]]s or turning points, with the first turning point connecting Act I to Act II, and the second connecting Act II to Act III. The conception of the three-act structure has been attributed to American screenwriter [[Syd Field]] who described plot structure in this tripartite way for film analysis.

==Aristotle==
The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]], writing in the fourth century BC in his classic book ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|The Poetics]]'', considered plot or ''mythos'' as the most important element of drama, even more important than character.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|pp=843–844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle wrote that a [[tragedy]], a type of plot, could be divided into three parts: a beginning, a middle, and an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|p=844}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that the events of the plot must causally relate to one another as being either necessary or probable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|pp=846–847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the utmost importance is the plot's ability to arouse emotion in the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] of the audience, he thought. In [[tragedy]], the appropriate emotions are [[fear]] and [[pity]], emotions which he considers in his [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]. (Aristotle's work on comedy has not survived.)

Aristotle goes on to consider whether the tragic character [[pathos|suffers (pathos)]], and whether the tragic character commits the error with knowledge of what he is doing. He illustrates this with the question of a tragic character who is about to kill someone in his family.

::The worst situation [artistically] is when the personage is with full knowledge on the point of doing the deed, and leaves it undone. It is odious and also (through the absence of suffering) untragic; hence it is that no one is made to act thus except in some few instances, e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Haemon]] and [[Creon]] in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''. Next after this comes the actual perpetration of the deed meditated. A better situation than that, however, is for the deed to be done in ignorance, and the relationship discovered afterwards, since there is nothing odious in it, and the discovery will serve to astound us. But the best of all is the last; what we have in [[Cresphontes]], for example, where [[Merope (wife of Cresphontes)|Merope]], on the point of slaying her son, recognizes him in time; in [[Iphigenia]], where sister and brother are in a like position; and in [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], where the son recognizes his mother, when on the point of giving her up to her enemy.([http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-15.html Poetics book 14])

== Freytag ==
[[File:Freytags pyramid.svg|right|thumbnail|265px|Freytag's pyramid]]
{{Main|Dramatic structure}}
In 1863, Gustav Freytag, a German writer, advocated a model based upon Aristotle's theory of tragedy. This is now called "Freytag's pyramid," which divides a drama into five parts, and
provides function to each part.  These parts are: exposition (originally called introduction), rising action (rise), climax, falling action (return or fall), and denouement (catastrophe).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exposition ===
The first phase in Freytag's pyramid is the exposition, which introduces the characters, especially the main character, also known as the protagonist. It shows how the characters relate to one another, their goals and motivations, as well as their moral character. During the exposition, the protagonist learns their main goal and what is at stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rising action ===
Rising action is the second phase in Freytag's five-phase structure. It starts with a conflict, for example, the death of a character. The inciting incident is the point of the plot that begins the conflict. It is the event that catalyzes the protagonist to go into motion and to take action. Rising action involves the buildup of events until the climax.

In this phase, the protagonist understands his or her goal and begins to work toward it. Smaller problems thwart their initial success and their progress is directed primarily against these secondary obstacles. This phase demonstrates how the protagonist overcomes these obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=125-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climax ===
The climax is the turning point or highest point of the story. The protagonist makes the single big decision that defines not only the outcome of the story, but also who they are as a person. Freytag defines the climax as the third of the five dramatic phases which occupies the middle of the story.

At the beginning of this phase, the protagonist finally clears away the preliminary barriers and engages with the adversary. Usually, both the protagonist and the antagonist have a plan to win against the other as they enter this phase. For the first time, the audience sees the pair going against one another in direct or nearly direct conflict.

This struggle usually results in neither character completely winning or losing. In most cases, each character's plan is both partially successful and partially foiled by their adversary. The central struggle between the two characters is unique in that the protagonist makes a decision which shows their moral quality, and ultimately decides their fate. In a tragedy, the protagonist here makes a poor decision or a miscalculation that demonstrates their tragic flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=128-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Falling action ===
According to Freytag, the falling action phase consists of events that lead to the ending. Character's actions resolve the problem. In the beginning of this phase, the antagonist often has the upper hand. The protagonist has never been further from accomplishing their goal. The outcome depends on which side the protagonist has put themselves on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denouement===
In this phase the protagonist and antagonist have solved their problems and either the protagonist or antagonist wins the conflict. The conflict officially ends. Some stories show what happens to the characters after the conflict ends and/or they show what happens to the characters in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=137-140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot devices ==

{{Main|Plot device}}

A plot device is a means of advancing the plot in a story. It is often used to motivate characters, create urgency, or resolve a difficulty. This can be contrasted with moving a story forward with dramatic technique; that is, by making things happen because characters take action for well-developed reasons. An example of a plot device would be when the cavalry shows up at the last moment and saves the day in a battle. In contrast, an adversarial character who has been struggling with himself and saves the day due to a change of heart would be considered dramatic technique.

Familiar types of plot devices include the ''[[deus ex machina]]'', the [[MacGuffin]], the [[red herring]], and [[Chekhov's gun]].

== Plot outline ==
A plot outline is a prose telling of a story which can be turned into a screenplay. Sometimes it is called a "one page" because of its length. It is generally longer and more detailed than a standard synopsis, which is usually only one or two paragraphs, but shorter and less detailed than a treatment or a step outline. In comics, the roughs refer to a stage in the development where the story has been broken down very loosely in a style similar to storyboarding in film development. This stage is also referred to as storyboarding or layouts. In Japanese manga, this stage is called the ''nemu'' (pronounced like the English word "name"). The roughs are quick sketches arranged within a suggested page layout. The main goals of roughs are:

* to lay out the flow of panels across a page
* to ensure the story successfully builds suspense
* to work out points of view, camera angles, and character positions within panels
* to serve as a basis for the next stage of development, the "pencil" stage, which are detailed drawings in a more polished layout which will, in turn, serve as the basis for the inked drawings.

In fiction writing, a plot outline is a laundry list of scenes with each line being a separate plot point, and the outline helps give a story a "solid backbone and structure".

==A-Plot==
An ''A-Plot'' is a [[film|cinema]] and [[television]] term referring to the plotline that drives the story. This does not necessarily mean it is the most important, but rather the one that forces most of the action.

==Plot summary==
A plot summary is a brief description of a piece of literature that explains what happens. In a plot summary, the author and title of the book should be referred to. Also, it is no more than a paragraph long while summarizing the main points of the story. {{needs citation|date=December 2017}}

'''Reference''' is a relation between objects in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The first object in this relation is said to ''refer to'' the second object. It is called a ''[[name]]'' for the second object. The second object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the ''[[referent]]'' of the first object. A name is usually a [[phrase]] or expression, or some other [[Symbol|symbolic representation]]. Its referent may be anything – a material object, a person, an event, an activity, or an abstract concept.

References can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception that is [[Hearing (sense)|audible]] ([[onomatopoeia]]), [[visual perception|visual]] (text), [[olfaction|olfactory]], or tactile, [[emotions|emotional state]], relationship with other,&lt;ref&gt;Treanor, Brian, ''Aspects of alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the contemporary debate'', Fordham University Press, 2006, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; [[spacetime]] coordinate, [[symbolic system|symbolic]] or [[alpha-numeric grid|alpha-numeric]], a physical object or an energy projection. In some cases, methods are used that intentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in [[cryptography]].

References feature in many spheres of human activity and knowledge, and the term adopts shades of meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used. Some of them are described in the sections below.

==Etymology and meanings==
The word ''reference'' is derived from [[Middle English]] ''referren'', from [[Middle French]] ''référer'', from [[Latin]] ''referre'', "to carry back", formed from the [[prefix]] ''re''- and ''ferre'', "to bear".&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest, ''A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the English language'', Vol II, Elsevier publishing company, Amsterdam, 1969, p.1317&lt;/ref&gt; A number of words derive from the same root, including ''refer'', ''[[referee]]'', ''referential'', ''[[referent]]'', ''[[referendum]]''.

The verb ''refer (to)'' and its derivatives may carry the sense of "link to" or "connect to", as in the meanings of ''reference'' described in this article. Another sense is "consult"; this is reflected in such expressions as [[reference work]], [[reference desk]], [[job reference]], etc.

== Semantics ==
{{further|Sense and reference|Theory of reference}}
[[File:Ogden semiotic triangle.png|thumb|right|220px|The [[triangle of reference]], from the influential book ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923) by [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]].]]
In [[semantics]], reference is generally construed as the relationships between [[noun]]s or [[pronoun]]s and objects that are named by them. Hence, the [[word]] "John" refers to the person John. The word "it" refers to some previously specified object. The object referred to is called the ''[[referent]]'' of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Semantics|first = John | last = Saeed|page = 12|publisher = Blackwell |isbn = 0-631-22693-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the word-object relation is called "[[denotation]]"; the word denotes the object. The converse relation, the relation from object to word, is called "[[exemplification]]"; the object exemplifies what the word denotes. In syntactic analysis, if a word refers to a previous word, the previous word is called the "[[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]".

===Meaning===
[[Gottlob Frege]] argued that reference cannot be treated as identical with [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]: "[[Hesperus]]" (an ancient Greek name for the evening star) and "[[Phosphorus]]" (an ancient Greek name for the morning star) both refer to [[Venus]], but the astronomical fact that '"Hesperus" is "Phosphorus"' can still be informative, even if the "meanings" of "Hesperus" and "Phosphorus" are already known. This problem led Frege to distinguish between the [[sense and reference]] of a word. Some cases seem to be too complicated to be classified within this framework; the acceptance of the notion of [[secondary reference]] may be necessary to fill the gap. See also [[Opaque context]].

===Linguistic sign===
The very concept of the [[linguistic sign]] is the combination of content and expression, the former of which may refer entities in the world or refer more abstract concepts, e.g. thought.
Certain parts of speech exist only to express reference, namely [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] such as [[pronoun]]s. The subset of reflexives expresses co-reference of two participants in a sentence.  These could be the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] (actor) and patient (acted on), as in "The man washed himself", the theme and recipient, as in "I showed Mary to herself", or various other possible combinations.

==Computer science==
{{Main|Reference (computer science)}}
In [[computer science]], [[Reference (computer science)|reference]]s are [[data type]]s that refer to an object elsewhere in memory and are used to construct a wide variety of [[data structure]]s, such as [[linked list]]s. Generally, a reference is a value that enables a program to directly access the particular data item. Most [[programming language]]s support some form of reference. For the specific type of reference used in the [[C++]] language, see [[reference (C++)]].

The notion of reference is also important in relational [[database theory]]; see [[referential integrity]].

==Library and information sciences==
{{see also|Reference work|Reference desk}}

References to many types of printed matter may come in an electronic or machine-readable form. For books, there exists the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] and for journal articles, the [[Digital object identifier|Digital object identifier (DOI)]] is gaining relevance. Information on the [[Internet]] may be referred to by a [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]].

==Psychology==
In terms of mental processing, a [[self-reference]] is used in psychology to establish identification with a mental state during self-analysis. This seeks to allow the individual to develop own frames of reference in a greater state of immediate awareness. However, it can also lead to circular reasoning, preventing evolution of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Eric, ''Lex Naturalis, Ius Naturalis: Law as Positive Reasoning &amp; Natural Rationality'', The Rlias Clark Group, Melbourne, 2010, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a reference condition is the state toward which a control system's output tends to alter a controlled quantity. The main proposition is that "All behavior is oriented all of the time around the control of certain quantities with respect to specific reference conditions."&lt;ref&gt;Powers, William, ''Behavior: The Control of Perception'', 2nd ed., Benchmark Publications, New Canaan, Connecticut, 2005, pp.47 &amp; 299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
In academics and scholarship, an author-title-date information in [[Bibliography|bibliographies]] and [[footnote]]s, specifying complete works of other people. Copying of material by another author without proper citation or without required permissions is [[plagiarism]].

Keeping a [[diary]] allows an individual to use references for personal organization, whether or not anyone else understands the systems of reference used. However, scholars have studied methods of reference because of their key role in communication and co-operation between ''different'' people, and also because of misunderstandings that can arise. Modern academic study of reference has been developing since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;
Reimer, Marga (2009). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reference Reference]". ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholarship, a reference may be a [[citation]] of a text that has been used in the creation of a piece of work such as an essay, report, or oration. Its primary purpose is to allow people who read such work to examine the author's sources, either for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] or to learn more about the subject. Such items are often listed at the end of an article or book in a section marked "[[Bibliography]]" or "References". A bibliographical section often contains works not cited by the author, but used as background reading or listed as potentially useful to the reader. A reference section contains only those works cited by the author(s) in the main text.

==Law==
In [[patent]] law, a reference is a document that can be used to show the state of knowledge at a given time and that therefore may make a [[claim (patent)|claim]]ed [[invention]] [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|obvious]] or [[Novelty (patent)#United States|anticipated]]. Examples of references are patents of any country, magazine articles, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] theses that are indexed and thus accessible to those interested in finding information about the subject matter, and to some extent Internet material that is similarly accessible.

==Arts==
In [[art]], a reference is an item from which a work is based. This may include:
* an existing artwork,
* a reproduction (i.e., photo),
* directly observed object (i.e., person), or
* the artist's memory.
Another example of reference is [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of various musical works being incorporated into a new one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11836">In [[mathematics]], a '''semigroup with two elements''' is a [[semigroup]] for which the [[cardinality]] of the [[underlying set]] is [[two]]. There are exactly five [[distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] [[isomorphic|nonisomorphic]] semigroups having two elements:
* O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[null semigroup]] of order two,
* LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and RO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[left zero semigroup]] of order two and [[right zero semigroup]] of order two, respectively,
* ({0,1}, ∧) (where "∧" is the [[logical connective]] "[[Logical conjunction|and]]"), or equivalently the set {0,1} under multiplication: the only [[semilattice]] with two elements and the only non-null semigroup with [[Null semigroup#Zero element in a semigroup|zero]] of order two, also a [[monoid]], and ultimately the [[two-element Boolean algebra]], 
* (Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, +&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (where Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {0,1} and "+&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" is "addition modulo 2"), or equivalently the set {−1,1} under multiplication: the only [[group (mathematics)|group]] of order two. 
The semigroups LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and RO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[antiisomorphic]]. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, {{nowrap|({0,1}, ∧)}} and {{nowrap|(Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, +&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[commutativity|commutative]], LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and RO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are noncommutative. LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, RO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and {{nowrap|({0,1}, ∧)}} are [[band (algebra)|band]]s and also [[inverse semigroup]]s.



==Determination of semigroups with two elements==
Choosing the set {{nowrap begin}}''A'' = { 1, 2 }{{nowrap end}} as the underlying set having two elements, sixteen [[binary operation]]s can be defined in ''A''. These operations are shown in the table below. In the table, a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of the form
&lt;center&gt;

|&amp;nbsp; ''z''&amp;nbsp;

|}
&lt;/center&gt;
indicates a binary operation on ''A'' having the following [[Cayley table]].

In this table:
*The semigroup ({0,1}, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;) denotes the two-element semigroup containing the [[Null semigroup#Zero element in a semigroup|zero element]] 0 and the [[unit element]] 1.  The two binary operations defined by matrices in a green background are associative and pairing either with ''A'' creates a semigroup isomorphic to the semigroup ({0,1}, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;). Every element is [[idempotent]] in this semigroup, so it is a [[Band (mathematics)|band]]. Furthermore, it is commutative (abelian) and thus a [[semilattice]]. The [[Semilattice#Connection_between_both_definitions|order induced]] is a [[linear order]], and so it is in fact a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] and it is also a [[Distributive lattice|distributive]] and [[complemented lattice]], i.e. it is actually the [[two-element Boolean algebra]].
*The two binary operations defined by matrices in a blue background are associative and pairing either with ''A'' creates a semigroup isomorphic to the [[null semigroup]] O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with two elements.
*The  binary operation defined by the matrix in an orange background is associative and pairing it with ''A'' creates a semigroup. This is the [[Null semigroup#Left zero semigroup|left zero semigroup]] LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is not commutative.
*The binary operation defined by the matrix in a purple background is associative and pairing it with ''A'' creates a semigroup. This is the [[Null semigroup#Right zero semigroup|right zero semigroup]] RO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also not commutative.
*The two binary operations defined by matrices in a red background are associative and pairing either with ''A'' creates a semigroup isomorphic to the [[group (mathematics)|group]] (Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, +&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
*The remaining eight [[binary operation]]s defined by matrices in a white background are not [[associative]] and hence none of them create a semigroup when paired with ''A''.

==The two-element semigroup ({0,1}, ∧)==
The [[Cayley table]] for the semigroup ({0,1}, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;) is given below:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;
!&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;
!&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp; '''0'''&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp; '''1'''&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 1&amp;nbsp;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
This is the simplest non-trivial example of a semigroup that is not a group. This semigroup has an identity element, 1, making it a [[monoid]]. It is also commutative. It is not a group because the element 0 does not have an inverse, and is not even a cancellative semigroup because we cannot cancel the 0 in the equation 1·0 = 0·0.

This semigroup arises in various contexts. For instance, if we choose 1 to be the [[truth value]] "[[Truth|true]]" and 0 to be the [[truth value]] "[[False (logic)|false]]" and the operation to be the [[logical connective]] "[[Logical conjunction|and]]", we obtain this semigroup in [[logic]]. It is isomorphic to the monoid {0,1} under multiplication. It is also isomorphic to the semigroup
:&lt;math&gt; 
S = \left\{
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 1 
\end{pmatrix}, 
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
under [[matrix multiplication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PlanetMath reference|id=8498|title=Semigroup with two elements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The two-element semigroup (Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,+&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)==
The [[Cayley table]] for the semigroup (Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,+&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is given below:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!+&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
!&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;
!&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp; '''0'''&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 1&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp; '''1'''&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 1&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

This group is isomorphic to the [[cyclic group]] Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Semigroups of order 3==
{{main|Semigroup with three elements}}
Let ''A'' be the three-element set {1, 2, 3}. Altogether, a total of 3&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = 19683 different binary operations can be defined on ''A''. 113 of the 19683 binary operations determine 24 nonisomorphic semigroups, or 18 non-equivalent semigroups (with equivalence being isomorphism or anti-isomorphism).

A '''sigil''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|dʒ|əl}}; pl. ''sigilla'' or ''sigils'') is a symbol used in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. The term has usually referred to a type of pictorial signature of a [[demon]] or other entity; in modern usage, especially in the context of [[chaos magic]], it refers to a symbolic representation of the magician's desired outcome.

The term ''sigil'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''sigillum'', meaning "[[Seal (emblem)|seal]]".&lt;ref name=Weschcke&gt;[[#refWeschcke|Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn &amp; Slate, Joe H. ''The Llewellyn Complete Book of Psychic Empowerment'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval [[ceremonial magic]], the term ''sigil'' was commonly used to refer to occult signs which represented various [[angels]] and [[demons]] which the magician might summon.&lt;ref name=Weschcke&gt;[[#refWeschcke|Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn &amp; Slate, Joe H. ''The Llewellyn Complete Book of Psychic Empowerment'']]&lt;/ref&gt; The magical training books called [[grimoire]]s often listed pages of such sigils. A particularly well-known list is in ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]'', in which the sigils of the 72 princes of the hierarchy of hell are given for the magician's use. Such sigils were considered to be the equivalent of the [[true name]] of the spirit and thus granted the magician a measure of control over the beings.&lt;ref name="Peterson-intro"&gt;''Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis: The Lesser Key of Solomon, Detailing the Ceremonial Art of Commanding Spirits Both Good and Evil''; ed. Joseph H. Peterson; Weiser Books, Maine; 2001. p.''xi''-''xvii''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sefer raziel segulot.png|thumb|250px|right|An excerpt from ''[[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]]'' featuring various magical sigils (or סגולות, ''segulot'', in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]).]]

A common method of creating the sigils of certain spirits was to use ''[[Magic square#Europe|kameas]]'' ([[magic square]]s) — the names of the spirits were converted to numbers, which were then located on the magic square. The locations were then connected by lines, forming an abstract figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Encyclopedia of The Occult |author=Greer, John Michael |publisher=[[Llewellyn Worldwide]] |year=2003 |isbn=1-56718-336-0 |page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The word sigil... has a long history in [[Magic_(paranormal)|Western magic]]. The members of [[Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn|the Golden Dawn]] were perfectly familiar with it("combining the letters, the colours, the attributions and their Synthesis, thou mayest build up a [[talisman|telesmatic Image]] of a Force. The Sigil shall then serve thee for the tracing of a Current which shall call into action a certain Elemental Force") and it was used in the making of talismans. The sigil was like a signature or sign of an occult entity.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The use of symbols for magical or cultic purposes has been widespread since at least the [[Neolithic]] era. Some examples from other cultures include the ''[[yantra]]'' from  [[Hindu]] [[tantra]], historical [[runic magic]] among the [[Germanic peoples]], or the use of ''[[veve]]s'' in [[Voudon]].

==Austin Osman Spare==

The artist and occultist [[Austin Osman Spare]] developed his own unique method of creating and using sigils, which has had a huge effect on modern occultism. Essentially, Spare turned the Medieval practice of using sigils to evoke entities on its head, arguing that such supernatural beings were simply [[Complex_(psychology)|complexes]] in the unconscious, and could be actively ''created'' through the process of sigilisation. &lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;[[#refSpare1|Spare, Austin Osman. ''The Book of Pleasure'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The big difference with Spare's method was that he dispensed with pre-existing esoterica and external beliefs, so the sigils were no longer for controlling traditional demons, angels and what-have-you, but instead for controlling forces in the unconscious psyche of the individual operator.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Spare's technique became a cornerstone of [[chaos magic]].&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[[#refMorrison|Morrison, Grant. ''Pop Magic!'']]&lt;/ref&gt; It also influenced the artist [[Brion Gysin]], who experimented with combinining Spare's sigil method with the traditional form of magic squares:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Calligraphic magick squares were one of the techniques most commonly applied by Gysin. He would reduce a name or an idea to a "glyph" and then write across the paper from right to left, turn the paper and do the same again, and so on, turning the paper around and around to create a multi-dimensional grid... The same techniques and consciously driven functional intention also permeated his paintings. In a very real sense, everything he created was an act of sorcery.&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2&gt;[[#refP-Orridge2|P-Orridge, Genesis. ''Magick Squares and Future Beats'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Chaos magic==
{{main|Chaos magic#sigils}}
[[File:Sigil shoal.svg|thumb|A shoal of sigils]]


In [[chaos magic]], following Spare, sigils are most commonly created by writing out the intention, then condensing the letters of the statement down to form a sort of [[monogram]]. The chaos magician then uses the [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnostic state]] to "launch" or "charge" the sigil – essentially bypassing the conscious mind to implant the desire in the unconscious.&lt;ref name=Sherwin1&gt;[[#refSherwin1|Sherwin, Ray. ''The Book of Results'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[[#refMorrison|Morrison, Grant. ''Pop Magic!'']]&lt;/ref&gt; To quote [[Ray Sherwin]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The magician acknowledges a desire, he lists the appropriate symbols and arranges them into an easily visualised glyph. Using any of the gnostic techniques he reifies the sigil and then, by force of will, hurls it into his subconscious from where the sigil can begin to work unencumbered by desire.&lt;ref name=Sherwin1&gt;[[#refSherwin1|Sherwin, Ray. ''The Book of Results'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After charging the sigil, it is considered necessary to repress all memory of it: in the words of Spare, there should be "a deliberate striving to forget it".&lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;[[#refSpare1|Spare, Austin Osman. ''The Book of Pleasure'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern chaos magic, when a complex of thoughts, desires and intentions gains such a level of sophistication that it appears to operate autonomously from the magician's consciousness, as if it were an independent being, then such a complex is referred to as a [[Servitor (chaos magic)|servitor]].&lt;ref name=Hine2&gt;[[#refHine2|Hine, Phil. ''Prime Chaos'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marik2&gt;[[#refMarik2|Marik. ''Servitors'']]&lt;/ref&gt; When such a being becomes large enough that it exists independently of any one individual, as a form of "group mind", then it is referred to as an [[egregore]].&lt;ref name=Rysen&gt;[[#refRysen|Rysen, Fenwick ''The Fluid Continuum'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Emerson&gt;[[#refEmerson|Emerson, Gabriel. ''Egregore Definition Compilation'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later chaos magicians have expanded on the basic sigilisation technique. [[Grant Morrison]] coined the term ''hypersigil'' to refer to an extended work of art with magical meaning and willpower, created using adapted processes of sigilization. His [[comic book]] series ''[[The Invisibles]]'' was intended as such a hypersigil.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[[#refMorrison|Morrison, Grant. ''Pop Magic!'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison has also argued that modern [[Logo|corporate logos]] like "the McDonald's Golden Arches, the Nike swoosh and the Virgin autograph" are a form of viral sigil:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Corporate sigils are super-breeders. They attack unbranded imaginative space. They invade Red Square, they infest the cranky streets of Tibet, they etch themselves into hairstyles. They breed across clothing, turning people into advertising hoardings... The logo or brand, like any sigil, is a condensation, a compressed, symbolic summoning up of the world of desire which the corporation intends to represent... Walt Disney died long ago but his sigil, that familiar, cartoonish signature, persists, carrying its own vast weight of meanings, associations, nostalgia and significance.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[[#refMorrison|Morrison, Grant. ''Pop Magic!'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gordon White developed the technique of ''shoaling'', which involves launching a group of sigils for a set of related aims. For example, instead of sigilising for "money", sigilising for a pay rise, new business clients, a promotion, influential new contacts, budget reallocation for your department, etc. – all of which help "shift the probability" towards the overall aim.&lt;ref name=White4&gt;[[#refWhite4|White, Gordon ''Sigils Reboot'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=White2&gt;[[#refWhite2|White, Gordon. ''Shoaling'']]&lt;/ref&gt; White also developed the technique of the ''robofish'', which consists of including a sigil for something that the chaos magician knows will definitely happen, to "lead" the rest of the shoal.&lt;ref name=White3&gt;[[#refWhite3|White, Gordon. ''Magic Secrets as Taught by Robot Fish'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founding===
In June 1878, the ''Association for the Higher Education of Women'' was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the "[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=374}}

Thus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college "in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations."{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=374}}}}{{sfn|Batson|2008|pp=22-3}} This committee was called the "[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=21}}{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=11}} This second committee included [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], [[George William Kitchin]], [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A. H. D. Acland]], [[Thomas Hill Green]], [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mary Ward]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/somerville-stories/mary-ward/|title=Mary Ward|access-date=26 August 2018|publisher=Somerville College, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Sidgwick, [[Henry Nettleship]], [[Walter Pater]] and [[Augustus George Vernon Harcourt|A. G. Vernon Harcourt]].{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=11}}

This new effort resulted in the founding of ''Somerville Hall'', named for the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=374}} It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=23}} She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.

[[Madeleine Shaw Lefevre]] was chosen as the first Principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=24}} Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as "an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution."{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=25}}

[[File:Thomas Phillips - Mary Fairfax, Mrs William Somerville, 1780 - 1872. Writer on science - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Somerville]], 1780–1872, after whom the College is named]]

===Women's college===
When opened, Somerville Hall had twelve students, ranging in age between 17 and 36.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=26}} The first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop on [[Little Clarendon Street]].&lt;ref name="Lannon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Lannon|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/404111.article|title=Her Oxford|publisher=''Times Higher Education''|date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two of the original 12 students admitted in 1879 remained in Oxford for three years, the period for which male students had to remain to complete a [[bachelor's degree]].{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=28}}

Increasingly, however, as the college admitted more students, it became more formalized. Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of 'college' (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the '[[bluestocking]] college', its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=9}}

In the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=xv}}{{sfn|Adams|1996|pp=150-1}} All female students had to be [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]] when in the presence of male students from the college's inception. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a [[curfew]].{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=215}} In 1925, during the principalship of [[Janet Vaughan]], Somerville's college charter was granted.

===World War One===
During [[World War I]] the college was converted into a military hospital as Somerville Section of the 3rd Southern General Hospital, adjacent to the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/|title=Somerville Hospital – Then and Now|access-date=27 August 2018|publisher=Somerville College}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from the Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].

Notable patients who stayed in Somerville include [[Robert Graves]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital. ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''. At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie. About his time at Somerville, he wrote: ''I enjoyed my stay at Somerville. The sun shone, and the discipline was easy''. Officer [[Llewelyn Davies (RFC officer)|Llewelyn Davies]] died at the college. Photographs of the college in this period can be found hanging in Hall, outside the pantry.

Once the war ended, the return to normality between Oriel College and Somerville College was delayed, sparking both frustration and an incident in spring 1919 known as the 'Oriel raid', in which male students made a hole in the wall dividing the sexes. In July 1919 the Principal ([[Emily Penrose]]) and Fellows returned to Somerville.

Alumna [[Vera Brittain]] wrote about the impact of the war in Oxford and paid tribute to the work of the Principal, Miss Penrose, in her memoir ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

===Admission of men===
Starting in the 1970s, the traditionally all-male colleges in Oxford began to admit female students.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=572}} Since it was assumed that recruiting from a wider demographic would guarantee better students, there was pressure on single-sex colleges to change their policy to avoid falling down the rankings.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|pp=577-8}} All-female colleges, like Somerville, found it increasingly difficult to attract good applicants and fell to the bottom of the intercollegiate academic rankings during the period.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=613}}

During the 1980s, there was much debate as to whether women's colleges should become mixed. Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/199/all/1/History.aspx|title=History of Somerville College, Oxford|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218061223/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/199/all/1/History.aspx|archivedate=18 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html|title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year|first=Stephen|last=Pritchard|date=18 November 1993|publisher=''[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somerville became the second-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=573}} With an intake 50% male/female; a gender balance maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.

==Buildings and grounds==
The college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located on [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]]. The front of the college runs between the [[Oxford Oratory]] and the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]]. Somerville has buildings of various architectural styles, many of which bear the names of former principals of the college, located around one of Oxford's biggest [[quadrangle (architecture)|quads]]. Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.

A 2017 [[archaeology|archaeological]] evaluation of the site shows that in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of a [[17th century]] building and earthworks beneath Somerville's site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]]. There are also remains of some [[19th century]] buildings, including a stone-lined well.&lt;ref name=hughes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/the-catherine-hughes-building/|title=The Catherine Hughes Building|access-date=30 August 2018|website=www.some.ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walton House===
[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House from the Quad]]
The original building of Somerville Hall, Walton House (commonly called 'House') was built in 1826 and purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] in 1880 amid fears that the men's colleges might, in the future, repossess the site for their own purposes.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=26}} The house could only accommodate 7 of the 12 students who came up to Oxford in the first year.&lt;ref name="british-history.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63899#n43|title=Somerville College – British History Online|website=british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, Sir [[Thomas Graham Jackson]] was commissioned to build a new south wing which could accommodate eleven more students. In 1892, [[Walter Cave]] added a north wing and an extra storey. He also installed a gatehouse at the Woodstock Road entrance. In 1897/98, the 'Eleanor Smith cottages' were built, adjoining Walton House.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=11}}

Today House is home to some students. It also contains Green Hall, where guests to College are often greeted and in which prospective students are registered and wait for interviews. Until 2014, it housed the college bar. Most of the administration of college and academic [[pigeon-hole messagebox]]es are located in House. A staircase from Green Hall leads up to Hall. Somerville's dining hall has a curved ceiling and wooden panelling and is one of very few in Oxford to contain portraits only of women.

===Park===
[[File:Somerville College Oxford, Park.jpg|thumb|right|Park Building]]
Originally known as West, due to its location within the college, the project to build a second self-contained hall was an attempt to imitate [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885-7 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and Vice-Principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=12}} The second building stage (1888-1895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).&lt;ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/&gt; It was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the Principal from 1980 to 1989.

There are over 60 student rooms and Fellows' rooms within the building. There is a music room and computer room. Park is a [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1369711|title=SOMERVILLE COLLEGE, WEST BUILDING|access-date=16 September 2018|website=[[Historic England]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library===
{{Main|Somerville College Library}}
[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - Library1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Somerville College Library]]]]
Designed by [[Basil Champneys]] in 1903 and opened by [[John Morley]] the following year, Somerville College Library was the first purpose-built library amongst the women's colleges of the university. Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. As such it was designed to serve readers beyond the membership of the college and to contain 60,000 volumes despite the college only possessing 6000 in 1903. The [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed building now contains around 120,000 items and is the second largest college library in the university.

[[Amelia Edwards]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Vera Brittain]] are notable benefactors to the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108093838/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill's personal library in London at the time of his death, with significant annotations in many of the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/special-collections/john-stuart-mill-collection/|title=John Stuart Mill Collection – Somerville College Oxford|publisher=University of Oxford|access-date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle and is open 24 hours, with wifi access which is college-wide, a group study room, and many computers. It has with 100% the highest library satisfaction according to the annual student surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/|website=some.ox.ac.uk|title=Library &amp;#038; IT &amp;mdash; Somerville College Oxford |accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hall and Maitland===
[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - Main quad, summer.JPG|thumb|right|View of Hall and Maitland (right) from the quad]]
[[File:Somerville College Oxford, Hall from High Table.jpg|thumb|right|Hall]]
Until 1911, there was no hall large enough to seat the entire college. The buildings were designed by [[Edmund Fisher]] in [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] and [[Edwardian Baroque architecture]]. Maitland Hall and Maitland were opened by [[H. A. L. Fisher]], the Vice-Chancellor of the University and [[Gilbert Murray]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=22}} Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906. This money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J. Forester in 1897 and bought from [[University College, Oxford|University]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]]s for £4000 and £1,400.&lt;ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/&gt; There was difficulty in the construction of the buildings, which is now thought to have been the result of the outer limit of the Oxford city fortifications running under the site. In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House. In 1947, [[André Gide]] gave a lecture in the hall.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=22}}

Hall and Maitland form the East face of the main quad and are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101369712-somerville-college-hall-and-maltland-block-oxford|title=Somerville College, Hall and Maltland Block|website=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senior Common Room is situated on the ground floor. The first floor is occupied by the pantry and the hall, in which Formal Hall (called guest night) is held weekly during term time.

Maitland houses few students, being mainly occupied by Fellows' offices and the college IT office. The building is named after Principal Agnes Maitland, and is to the south of Hall.&lt;ref name="blogs.some.ox.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Penrose===
The Penrose block was designed by Harold Rogers in 1925 and its first students were installed in 1927. It is situated at the south western end of the main quadrangle on the site of 119 and 119A [[Walton Street, Oxford|Walton Street]].&lt;ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/&gt; A row of [[Populus|poplar]]s had to be removed in 1926 for the construction of Penrose.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=35}}

The building was refurbished in 2014, with carpets replacing the formerly bare wooden floorboards, and new furniture. Penrose is named for Dame [[Emily Penrose]], the third principal of the college. Penrose houses mainly first year accommodation, with around 30 rooms.&lt;ref name="blogs.some.ox.ac.uk"/&gt; Some fellows' rooms are located in Penrose.

===Darbishire===
[[File:Somerville College Darbishire quad 2.png|thumb|right|Darbishire Quad]]
Darbishire Quad was the culmination of a long-standing project to absorb Woodstock Road properties above the [[Oxford Oratory]]. In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of £1,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining 'Waggon and Horses' was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.

[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures with a loan of £12,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and a council room, the New Council Room, were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduate and fellows' rooms.&lt;ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/&gt; The coat of arms of Somerville and that of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by Edmund Ware inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.

Originally it was called the East Quadrangle and it was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it 'a notable addition to buildings of varying styles' (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=26}}

Today Darbishire contains around 50 student rooms mixed with tutors' offices, the college archive and medical room.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[José María Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville, from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaloceancommission.org/about-the-commission/contact/|title=contact – Somerville College Oxford|website=''globaloceancommission.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] and is home to a clock donated by alumna [[Eleanor Rathbone]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=28}}

===Chapel===
{{Main|Somerville College Chapel}}
[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - Chapel.JPG|thumb|right|[[Somerville College Chapel]]]]
Built largely with funds provided by alumna [[Emily Georgiana Kemp]] in 1935, [[Somerville Chapel]] reflects the nondenominational principle on which the college was founded in 1879. No religious texts were used for admission and nondenominational Christian prayers were said in college. The chapel's history, architecture, and artworks give valuable insights into the religious, intellectual, and cultural roots of what would subsequently become a global norm. The chapel can be seen as both a manifestation of the aspirations of liberal Christianity in the interwar years, including the advancement of women and ecumenism, and of the contestation of the role of religion in higher education among elites in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17432200.2017.1418478 A House of Prayer for all Peoples? The Unique Case of Somerville College Chapel, Oxford] 5 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapel does not have a chaplain, but a 'Chapel Director' which is in keeping with its undenominational tradition. The chapel provides opportunities for Christian worship in addition to hosting speakers with a multi-faith range of religious perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/196/all/1/The_Chapel.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018062026/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/196/all/1/The_Chapel.aspx |archivedate=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel also has an excellent mixed-voice choir, the [[Choir of Somerville College, Oxford|Choir of Somerville College]], which tours and produces occasional CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somervillechoir.com/|title=Home|website=The [[Choir of Somerville College, Oxford]]|access-date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hostel and Holtby===
Hostel is a small block between House and Darbishire, completed in 1950 by [[Geddes Hyslop]].{{sfn|Fair|2014|p=357}} It houses 10 students over three floors. The Bursary is on the ground floor.&lt;ref name="blogs.some.ox.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/mcr/college-map/|title=College Map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holtby, designed in 1951 and completed in 1956 by Hyslop,{{sfn|Fair|2014|p=357}} is situated above the library extension, adjacent to Park. It has 10 rooms for undergraduates and is named for alumna [[Winifred Holtby]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/jcr/{{Not a typo|accom|odation}}/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaughan and Margery Fry &amp; Elizabeth Nuffield House===
Designed by [[Sir Philip Dowson]] between 1958 and 1966, [[Janet Vaughan|Vaughan]] and [[Margery Fry]] &amp; [[Elizabeth Nuffield]] House (commonly shortened to Margery Fry) are both named for former principals of the college, whilst Elizabeth Nuffield was an important proponent of women's education and along with her husband [[Lord Nuffield]], a financial benefactor of the college. Margery Fry was opened in 1964 by [[Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit]] and Vaughan was opened in 1966. Constructed in the same architectural style, with an exterior concrete frame standing away from the walls of the interior edifice, the two buildings sit atop a podium containing shops and an arcaded walkway on Little Clarendon Street.

Vaughan is the larger of the two, with 11 rows to its concrete frame compared to the 8 of Margery Fry.&lt;ref name="manchesterhistory.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manchesterhistory.net/architecture/1960/somerville.html|title=Somerville College 1960s, Oxford, UK|website=''manchesterhistory.net''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed building.&lt;ref name=thetab&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetab.com/uk/oxford/2016/01/19/somerville-first-choice-25551|last=Haberfield|first=Catrin|title=Somerville should have been your first choice|publisher=''[[The Tab]]''|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughan contains around 60 undergraduate rooms, which are smaller than those of Margery Fry and house exclusively first year students, along with the junior deans. Vaughan was refurbished in 2013, with new bathroom facilities, including, for the first time, sinks. Beneath the two buildings, a tunnel provides access to Somerville from [[Little Clarendon Street]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Margery Fry serves as the centre of the post graduate student community at Somerville and contains 24 graduate rooms. Other accommodation for graduate students is provided in buildings adjacent to the College.

===Wolfson===
[[File:Wolfson building, Somerville College, Oxford in 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Wolfson building]]
Sir Philip Dowson was commissioned to design a building at the back of the college, to house undergraduates and offices for fellows. Wolfson is, in common with Dowson's other work in Somerville, constructed largely of glass and concrete. It is a [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed building.&lt;ref name="manchesterhistory.net"/&gt; A four-storey building, with five bays of each floor, Wolfson boasts impressive views of [[Walton Street]] from the rear and Somerville's main quadrangle from the front.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Wolfson is named for the building's principal benefactor [[Sir Isaac Wolfson]] and opened in 1967 by Principal [[Barbara Craig]], with [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] and Lord Wolfson giving speeches.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=45}}

The ground floor of the building contains the Flora Anderson Hall or FAH and the Brittain-Williams Room, named for the college's most famous mother-daughter alumnae. The room was designed in 2012 by [[Niall McLaughlin]] Architects and opened on 29 November 2013 by alumna Baroness [[Shirley Williams]] during an event which saw her unveil a portrait of herself, which now hangs in the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/191-6652/all/1/Shirley_Williams_opens_Brittain-Williams_Room_at_Somerville.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818105853/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/191-6652/all/1/Shirley_Williams_opens_Brittain-Williams_Room_at_Somerville.aspx |archivedate=18 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAH is used for lectures and events. Notably it hosts college parties and mock exams known as bops and [[Collection (Oxford colleges)|Collections]] respectively.

===Margaret Thatcher Centre and Dorothy Hodgkin Quadrangle===
Named for the [[Margaret Thatcher|alumna-Prime Minister]], the MTC comprises a lobby, lecture room and ante room used for many meetings, with disabled access. The lecture room enjoys AV facilities and can accommodate 60 seated patrons. The venue is used for certain term time events and is popular with conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conference-oxford.com/venues/conference/somerville-college|title=Somerville College – Conference Oxford|website=conference-oxford.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bust of Margaret Thatcher stands in the lobby, and the meeting room contains portraits of Somerville's two prime-minister alumnae, Margaret Thatcher by [[Michael Noakes]] and Indira Gandhi by Sanjay Bhattacharyya.

The Dorothy Hodgkin Quad (DHQ) was conceived in 1985 and completed in 1991.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=47}} It houses mainly finalists and some second year students. The Quadrangle is above the MTC and designed around self-contained flats of two and four bedrooms with communal kitchens. DHQ is named for Somerville's [[Dorothy Hodgkin|Nobel Prize winning laureate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Architect Geoffrey Beard's scheme was submitted to the [[Oxford City Council]] in 1986 and energies of Sir [[Geoffrey Leigh]] and alumna and former Principal Baroness [[Daphne Park]] brought support from around the world. The buildings were opened in 1991 by Margaret Thatcher, Dorothy Hodgkin, Principal [[Catherine Hughes (civil servant)|Catherine Hughes]] and College Visitor Baron [[Roy Jenkins]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=48}}

===St Paul’s Nursery===
Somerville College was the first Oxford college to provide a [[nursery school|nursery]] for the children of Fellows and staff and is still one of the few colleges to do so. Alumna [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] donated much of her Nobel Prize money to the project.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=49}} St Paul’s Nursery is also open to families who are not connected with the college and cares for 16 children between the ages of 3 months and 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/living-here/st-pauls-nursery/|title=St Paul's Nursery|website=www.some.ox.ac.uk|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radcliffe Observatory Quarter===
[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - ROQ.JPG|thumb|right|ROQ East from outside College]]
[[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter|ROQ]] East and West flank the north side of Somerville and overlook the site of the university's principal development, the [[Blavatnik School of Government]]. Completed in 2011, the ROQ buildings were the first buildings on the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter and have won 4 awards for their architect Niall McLaughlin. The project was also awarded Oxford City Council's David Steel Sustainable Building Award, being commended for its balancing of Somervillian collegiate heritage with the need for energy efficiency to be a consideration for the new building. Energy efficiency measures include renewable technologies such as solar thermal energy and ground source heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/191-6194/all/1/ROQ_accommodation_wins_sustainable_building_award.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818110249/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/191-6194/all/1/ROQ_accommodation_wins_sustainable_building_award.aspx |archivedate=18 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings house 68 students and all rooms are en-suite. There are a number of rooms and facilities specifically designed to help those with disabilities, including lifts and adjoining carer rooms. The buildings were made possible by donations of over £2.7&amp;nbsp;million from over 1000 alumni and friends of the college, and by a significant loan.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There is now an unimpeded view of the Observatory.

===The Terrace===
The most recent construction in Somerville (2013), the college bar in Vaughan replaces the bar in House. The bar is housed in a mainly glass structure, with seating in the college colours of red and black. Following a campaign by the JCR [[Guinness]] is now available on tap, and the pool table costs 50p per frame. The college drink, the "Stone-cold Jane Austen", is made from blue [[alcopop|VK]], [[Southern Comfort]], and [[Magners]] cider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cherwell.org/2007/06/01/drink-the-bar-dry-worcester-st-hughs-sommerville/|title=Drink the bar dry: Worcester, St Hugh's, Sommerville|author=''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]''|date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other college drinks are the "Somerville Sunset" and the "College Triple". The college also has its own 'Somerville wine': red, white and sparkling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.fliphtml5.com/kpdf/yhsh/|title=Somerville College Wine List|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catherine Hughes Building===
Named after Somerville's late Principal from 1989 to 1996, the [[Catherine Hughes (civil servant)|Catherine Hughes]] Building will be completed in October 2019 and will provide 68 additional bedrooms. The new building, designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects, boasts en suite bathrooms, kitchens and accessible rooms on every floor and a new communal study area for students.&lt;ref name=hughes /&gt;

The red brick building will have a frontage on to Walton Street and additional access from the college gardens, aligning with key levels on the adjacent Penrose Building. The bedrooms will be arranged in clusters with kitchens and circulation spaces forming social focal points.

The building's construction has given Somerville sufficient accommodation to allow all students applying from 2017 to live in college for the entirety of their 3 to 4-year undergraduate degree and Somerville is one of only three Oxford colleges able to do so.&lt;ref name=Oxfordwebsite /&gt;&lt;ref name=whychoose /&gt;

===Gardens===
[[File:	Somerville College Oxford, Vaughan in autumn.jpg|thumb|View on Vaughan from Main Quad]]
Somerville is the only Oxford college where students may walk on the grass and it has a vast green space behind the unassuming front gate, looked after by two gardeners.&lt;ref name=gardens&gt;[https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/living-here/gardens/ Somerville Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original site comprised a [[paddock]], an [[orchard]] and a vegetable garden and was bounded by large trees. It was home to a [[donkey]], two [[cow]]s a [[pony]] and a [[pig]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=11}} The paddock was soon transformed into [[tennis court]]s, where huge tents where erected during WWI. During [[World War Two]], large water tanks were dug in the Main Quad and Darbishire Quad, in case or firebombing and the lawns were dug up and planted with vegetables.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=35}}

In the Main Quad there's a [[Cedrus|cedar]] planted by [[Harold Macmillan]] in 1976, after an old cedar was victim of a winter storm. Another tree, a ''[[Picea likiangensis]]'', was planted in 2007 on the chapel lawn, providing Somerville with an outdoor [[Christmas tree]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=35}} The library border of [[lavender]] and ''[[Agapanthus]]'' references the [[bluestocking]] reputation of Somerville and the [[tory]] blue ''[[Ceratostigma willmottianum]]'' is planted outside the Margaret Thatcher Centre. [[Beardtongues]], ''[[Begonia]]'' and 1,200 red and black [[tulip]]s reflect the college's colours. There are nods to Somerville's long-standing links with [[India]], a strip of [[Alpine plant]]s in front of Wolfson, a [[bog garden]], [[herbaceous border]]s and the emblematic Somerville [[thistle]]s (''[[Echinops]]'').&lt;ref name=gardens /&gt;{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=36}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/news/ever-green-robert-washington-celebrates-30-years-at-somerville/|title=EVER GREEN – Robert Washington celebrates 30 years at Somerville|date=11 June 2014|website=www.some.ox.ac.uk|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western wall of Penrose and the northern wall of Vaughan form two faces of the Fellows Garden, previously [[kitchen garden]]s, which is distinct from the main quad and separated from it by a hedge and a wall. The Fellows Garden is home to a sundial, commissioned in 1926, and a [[garden roller]] which was a gift from the parents of tutor [[Rose Sidgwick]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=29}}

In 1962, [[Henry Moore]] lend his item ''Falling Warrior'' to the college and [[Barbara Hepworth]] lent ''Core'' shortly afterwards. Permanent sculptures in Somerville's garden are made by [[Wendy Taylor]], [[Friedrich Werthmann]] and [[Somervillian]] [[Polly Ionides]].

==Student life==
[[File:Somerville College Hall in snow.jpg|thumb|right|Somerville College in snow]]
In 2011 student satisfaction was rated in some categories as the highest in the university.&lt;ref name=satisfaction&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordstudent.com/2012/04/19/somerville-soars-in-satisfaction-survey/|title=Somerville soars in satisfaction survey|first=Jonathan|last=Tomlin|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the college is its large quad, onto which most accommodation blocks back; it is often filled with students in summer. Somerville is the only Oxford college where students (as opposed to just fellows) may walk on the grass.&lt;ref name=bs /&gt;&lt;ref name=thetab /&gt; Somerville is sometimes nicknamed ''The Ville''. [[Formal (university)|Formal Halls]] take place on some Tuesdays and Fridays about six times a term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/mcr/graduate-community/formal-dinners/|title=Formal Dinners|publisher=Somerville College MCR|access-date=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[Academic dress of the University of Oxford#gowns|gowns]] are worn and the [[grace (prayer)|grace]] is 'benedictus benedicat'.

===Sports===
Somerville has a gym situated beneath Vaughan, with treadmills, cross-trainers and weights. Somerville shares a sports ground with [[Wadham College]] and [[St. Hugh's College]], on [[Marston Ferry Road]]. There are clubs and teams in men's and women's [[football]], [[rugby football|rugby]] (with [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]]), mixed [[lacrosse]], [[cricket]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[hockey]], [[netball]], [[basketball]], [[pool (cue sports)|pool]], [[water polo]], [[tennis]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[badminton]], [[cycling]] and [[croquet]].&lt;ref name=sports&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/mcr/graduate-community/sports/|title=Sports - MCR website|first=|last=|date=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/jcr/social/sports/|title=Sports - JCR website|first=|last=|date=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rowing====
[[File:Somerville College Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|thumb|right|Rowing blade design of [[Somerville College Boat Club]]]]
{{Main|Somerville College Boat Club}}
Somerville formed a rowing team in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scbcrowing.com/?page_id=10|title=History – Somerville College Boat Club|website=''scbcrowing.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college competes in both of the annual university [[bumps race]]s, [[Torpids]] and [[Summer Eights]]. The women are the most successful women's rowing team at the University of Oxford, having won the title Head of the River eight times in Summer Eights and five times in Torpids. The club shares the award-winning [[University College Boathouse]] on [[The Isis]] with [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St Peter's College]], [[University College, Oxford|University College]] and [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]].

===Choir===
{{main|Choir of Somerville College, Oxford}}
[[File:Somerville College Oxford, Chapel inside.jpg|thumb|right|[[Somerville College Chapel]]]]
The [[Choir of Somerville College, Oxford|Choir of Somerville College]] is mixed voice and is led by the Director of Chapel Music, Will Dawes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/news/will-dawes-appointed-as-director-of-chapel-music/|title=Will Dawes appointed as Director of Chapel Music – Somerville College Oxford|publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the organ scholars, the choir is central to the musical life of the college.

There are regular concerts and cathedral visits as well as recitals featuring soloists from the choir. In recent years the choir has undertaken tours of Germany (2005 and 2009), Italy (2010) and the USA (2014 and 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somervillechoir.com/tours.html|title=Tours|website=The Choir of Somerville College, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choir sings every Sunday during term time at the evening service. The organ of the college chapel is a traditionally voiced instrument by [[Harrison &amp; Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/NPORView.html?RI=N07885|title=The National Pipe Organ Register – NPOR|website=''npor.org.uk''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somerville offers up to five Choral Exhibitions each year to applicants reading any subject. College Organ Scholars are guaranteed rooms in college for the duration of their course.

The college choir has released two CDs on the [[Stone Records]] label, "Requiem Aeternam" (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classical-iconoclast.blogspot.de/2012/09/durufle-milford-requiem-aeternam-stone.html|title=Milford, Duruflé Requiem Aeternam – Stone Records|website=classical-iconoclast.blogspot.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Advent Calendar" (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stonerecords.co.uk/album/advent-calendar|title=Advent calendar  ::  Stone Records, Independent Classical Music|website=''stonerecords.co.uk''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triennial Ball===
Once every three years Somerville hosts a ball which is organised with [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. The last ball was held in May 2016 and the next ball will be held in 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/news/somerville-jesus-ball-enter-the-subconscious-mind/|title=The Somerville-Jesus Surrealism Ball: Enter the Subconscious Mind|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a capacity of 1500 people.

The 2013 ball, ''The Last Ball'', was mired in controversy, which was reported in national news. The organisers had intended to display a live [[nurse shark]] as entertainment. Permission for the shark was initially granted by principal [[Alice Prochaska]], but was subsequently revoked following student protests. The ball was widely condemned for poor organisation, examples of which included a lack of [[canapé]]s and the presence of only one food stand, serving [[pork]]; the vegetarian options were said to run out quickly and revellers were reportedly set on fire by the pork [[rotisserie]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported 'The ball descended into farce with guests questioning what the organisers had done with the money paid by 1,000 guests.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/24/oxford-cancel-display-shark-ball_n_3144870.html|title=Oxford's Somerville College Cancels Student Plans To Display Living Nurse Shark At Summer Ball|first=Lucy|last=Sherriff|publisher=''[[HuffPost]]''|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/student-life/10013881/Oxford-ball-scraps-shark-plans-after-student-protest.html|title=Oxford ball scraps shark plans after student protest|first=Andrew|last=Marszal|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxfordstudent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetab.com/uk/oxford/2013/05/13/review-somerville-jesus-ball-9515|title=Review: Somerville-Jesus Ball|first=Will|last=Dufton|publisher=''[[The Tab]]''|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2013/05/23/somer-them-say-sorry-for-their-balls-up/|title=Somer' Them Say Sorry For Their Balls Up|first=Sarah|last=Poulten|publisher=''[[The Oxford Student]]''|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cherwell.org/2013/05/09/somervillejesus-last-ball-goers-are-ripped-off/|title=Somerville-Jesus 'Last Ball' goers are "ripped off"|first=Nathalie|last=Wright|publisher=''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]''|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/may/25/student-ball-oxford-university-catastrophe|title=Student ball at Oxford University ends in 'catastrophe'|first=Conal|last=Urquhart|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic reputation===
[[File:Somerville CollegeNorrington Ranking.svg|thumb|Somerville's Position in the Norrington Table since 2006]]
Before men were admitted to the college, and under the principalship of [[Barbara Craig]], Somerville established a position at, or near the head of the Norrington Table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/3351/all/1/From_strength_to_strength.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618061455/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/3351/all/1/From_strength_to_strength.aspx |archivedate=18 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, by academic performance, Somerville is in the lower half of Oxford University colleges. 
For the academic year 2016/17, the college came 22nd out of 30 in the [[Norrington Table]], which lists the University's undergraduate colleges in order of their students' examination performances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ox.ac.uk/about/facts-and-figures/undergraduate-degree-classifications?wssl=1 "2016-17 Final Norrington Table"]. ox.ac.uk.

===University Challenge===
Somerville has recently enjoyed success on TV quiz show ''[[University Challenge]]'' disproportionate to the college's size. The college has won the competition once, triumphing in the [[University Challenge 2001–02]] series and beating [[Imperial College, London|Imperial College]], London by 200 points to 185. [[Croatia]]n quizzer [[Dorjana Širola]] was one of the contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = University Challenge Series Champions in 2002 | url = http://www.blanchflower.org/uc/uc02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, the college team reached the final of the [[University Challenge 2013–14]] series, losing in the final to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], with a score of 134 to 240.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10749365/University-Challenge-the-2014-final-review-Trinity-triumph.html|title=University Challenge, the 2014 final, review: Trinity triumph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinitatis Horribilis 2015===
During Trinity term 2015, Somerville was subject to national media coverage as a result of the efforts of principal [[Alice Prochaska]] to tackle 'a rise in "excessively harassing and intimidating behaviour" towards female students.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-32752506 Somerville College principal warns of sexual harassment], ''[[BBC News]]'', 15 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' quoted Prochaska as describing 'numerous reports of groping at college parties, rape jokes overheard in communal areas'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11604453/Oxford-chief-warns-of-worrying-culture-of-sexual-harassment-and-groping.html Oxford chief warns of worrying culture of sexual harassment and groping], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 14 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The principal wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' of measures taken to address harassment and she expressed her hope that 'a spasm of nastiness among a small minority of students here has been nipped in the bud by the open condemnation of the majority.'&lt;ref name=laddism /&gt;

=== Principals ===
[[File:BaronessRoyallPortrait.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|[[Baroness Royall of Blaisdon]], the current principal]]
{{main|List of Principals of Somerville College, Oxford}}
The first principal of Somerville Hall was [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefèvre]] (from 1879–1889). The first principal of Somerville College was [[Agnes Catherine Maitland]] (1889–1906) when in 1894 it became the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of 'college', the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, the first to set an entrance examination, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]]. She was succeeded by classical scholar [[Emily Penrose]] (1906–1926), who established the ''Mary Somerville Research Fellowship'' in 1903 which was the first to offer women in Oxford opportunities for research.

The current Principal is [[Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon]] who took up the appointment in August 2017, succeeding [[Alice Prochaska]].&lt;ref name="ox" /&gt;

Six principals were alumnae of Somerville, two of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's College]].

==Coat of arms and motto==
Like all Oxford colleges, Somerville has a variety of symbols and colours which are associated with it. The college's colours, which feature on the [[Academic scarf|college scarf]] and on the blades of its boats, are red and black. The combination was originally adopted in the 1890s.{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=47}} Its flag has the shield from the arms on a yellow background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb_ousom.html|title=Oxford University - Somerville College (England)|website=www.crwflags.com|date=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two colours also feature in the college's [[coat of arms]] which depicts three [[Star (heraldry)|mullets]] in [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] reversed [[gules]], between six [[Cross#As emblems and symbols|crosses crosslet fitched]] [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]]. The college's motto is ''Donec rursus impleat orbem'' which was originally the motto of the family of [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=47}} Her family befriended the new hall, allowing it to adopt their arms and motto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oac.web.ox.ac.uk/somerville-college|title=Somerville College|website=Oxford College Archives|access-date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]] motto itself is described as "baffling" as, although it translates as "Until It Should Fill the World Again", what the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence ("it") is left unspecified.{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=47}} The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], which is often omitted, is a hand grasping a [[crescent]] and occasionally a [[helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] with [[mantling]] is added.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16631">The '''space mapping''' methodology for modeling and design optimization of [[engineering systems]] was first discovered by [[John Bandler]] in 1993. It uses relevant existing knowledge to speed up model generation and design [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] of a system. The knowledge is updated with new validation information from the system when available.

==Concept==
The space mapping methodology employs a "quasi-global" formulation that intelligently links companion "coarse" (ideal or low-fidelity) and "fine" (practical or high-fidelity) models of different complexities. In engineering design, space mapping aligns a very fast coarse model with the expensive-to-compute fine model so as to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model. The alignment can be done either off-line (model enhancement) or on-the-fly with surrogate updates (e.g., aggressive space mapping).
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Space Mapping Concept.png|thumb|left|400px|The space mapping concept as it has evolved over the years (Bandler et. al 1994-)&lt;ref name = "feel"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

==Methodology==
At the core of the process is a pair of models: one very accurate but too expensive to use directly with a conventional optimization routine, and one significantly less expensive and, accordingly, less accurate. The latter (fast model) is usually referred to as the "coarse" model ([[Coarse space (numerical analysis)|coarse space]]). The former (slow model) is usually referred to as the "fine" model. A validation space ("reality") represents the fine model, for example, a high-fidelity physics model. The optimization space, where conventional optimization is carried out, incorporates the coarse model (or [[surrogate model]]), for example, the low-fidelity physics or "knowledge" model. In a space-mapping design optimization phase, there is a prediction or "execution" step, where the results of an optimized "mapped coarse model" (updated surrogate) are assigned to the fine model for validation. After the validation process, if the design specifications are not satisfied, relevant data is transferred to the optimization space ("[[feedback]]"), where the mapping-augmented coarse model or surrogate is updated (enhanced, realigned with the fine model) through an iterative optimization process termed "parameter extraction". The mapping formulation itself incorporates "intuition", part of the engineer's so-called "feel" for a problem.&lt;ref name = "feel" /&gt; In particular, the Aggressive Space Mapping (ASM) process displays key characteristics of cognition (an expert's approach to a problem), and is often illustrated in simple cognitive terms.

'''Speech repetition''' is the [[speech|saying]] by one individual of the spoken [[Speech production|vocalizations]] made by another individual. This requires the ability in the person making the copy to map the sensory input they [[Hearing (sense)|hear]] from the other person's vocal [[pronunciation]] into a similar motor output with their own [[vocal tract]].

Such speech input output imitation often occurs independently of speech comprehension such as in [[speech shadowing]] when a person automatically says words heard in [[earphone]]s, and the pathological condition of [[echolalia]] in which people [[reflex]]ively repeat overheard words. This links to speech repetition of words being separate in the [[human brain|brain]] to [[speech perception]]. Speech repetition occurs in the  dorsal speech processing stream while speech perception occurs in the ventral speech processing stream. Repetitions are often incorporated unawares by this route into spontaneous novel sentences immediately or after delay following  storage in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]].

In humans, the ability to map heard input vocalizations into motor output is highly developed due to this copying ability playing a critical role in a child's rapid expansion of their  [[Vocabulary#Vocabulary growth|spoken vocabulary]]. In older children and adults it still remains important as it enables the continued learning of novel words and names and [[Second language acquisition|additional languages]]. Such repetition is also necessary for the propagation of language from generation to generation. It has also been suggested that the phonetic units out of which speech is made have been selected upon by the process of vocabulary expansion and vocabulary [[cultural evolution|transmission]]s  due to  children preferentially copying words in terms of more easily imitated elementary units.

The ability to repeat and imitate speech sounds occurs separately to that of normal speech. Speech shadowing provides evidence of a 'privileged' input/output speech loop that is distinct to the other components of the speech system.&lt;ref name="McLeod"&gt;McLeod P. Posner MI. (1984). Privileged loops from percept to act. In H. Bouma D. Bouwhuis, (Eds), Attention and performance X (pp. 55-66).

===Effector independent===
Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations in spite of vocal tract anatomy differences in size and shape due to [[gender]], [[Human development (biology)|age]] and individual [[anatomical]] variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: [[dentist]]s recognize three basic shapes of [[palate]]: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of [[malocclusion]] between the two [[jaw]]s; nine ways teeth relate to the [[dental arch]] and a wide range of [[maxilla]]ry and [[human mandible|mandible]] deformities.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomer HH. (1971). Speech defects associated with dental malocclusions and related abnormalities. In L. E. (Eds), Handbook of speech pathology and audiology (pp. 715-766), New York, Appleton Century. {{ISBN|978-0-13-381764-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and [[dental caries]]. Other factors that do not impede  the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation  are gross oral deformations such as [[hare-lip]]s, [[cleft palate]]s or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in [[ventriloquism]]). [[Paranasal sinuses]]  vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their  asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Williams RJ. (1967). You are extra-ordinary. New York, Random House.  pp. 26-27. {{OCLC|156187572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vocal traits also vary moreover when people get upper respiratory tract infections  as the shape and size of sinus cavities is further changed with the swelling of mucous membranes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse linguistic vocalizations===
Vocal imitation occurs potentially in regard to a diverse range of phonetic units and types of vocalization. The world's languages use [[consonant|consonantal phone]]s that differ in thirteen imitable vocal tract [[place of articulation]]s (from the [[lip]]s to the [[glottis]]). These phones can potentially be pronounced with eleven types of imitable [[manner of articulation]]s ([[nasal stop]]s to [[lateral click]]s). Speech can be copied in regard to its [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|social accent]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Pitch accent|pitch]] and individuality (as with entertainment [[impersonator]]s). Speech can be articulated in ways which diverge considerably in speed, [[timbre]], pitch, [[loudness]] and [[emotion]]. Speech further exists in different forms such as [[song]], [[Poetry|verse]], [[Vociferation|scream]] and [[whispering|whisper]]. Intelligible speech can be produced with pragmatic intonation and in [[regional dialect]]s and [[Accent (dialect)|foreign accents]]. These aspects are readily copied: people asked to repeat speech-like words imitate not only phones but also accurately other pronunciation aspects such as [[fundamental frequency]],&lt;ref name="Kappes"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kappes | first1 = J. | last2 = Baumgaertner | first2 = A. | last3 = Peschke | first3 = C. | last4 = Ziegler | first4 = W. | title = Unintended imitation in nonword repetition | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2009.08.008 | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 140–151 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19811813| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[schwa]]-syllable expression,&lt;ref name="Kappes"/&gt; voice [[spectrum|spectra]] and lip [[kinematic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 16698051|year= 2007|author1= Gentilucci|first1= M|title= Imitation during phoneme production|journal= Neuropsychologia|volume= 45|issue= 3|pages= 608–15|last2= Bernardis|first2= P|doi= 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[voice onset time]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Mechanism==

Spoken words are sequences of motor movements organized around vocal tract gesture motor targets.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer LH. (1984). Motor programming in language production. In H. Bouma &amp; D. G. Bouwhuis, (Eds), Attention and performance, X. pp. (17-41). London, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-86377-005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalization due to this is copied in terms of the motor goals that organize it rather than the exact movements with which it is produced. These vocal motor goals are auditory. According to James Abbs&lt;ref&gt;Abbs JH. (1986). Invariance and variability in speech production, A distinction between linguistic intent and its neuromotor implementation. In J. S. Perkell, &amp; D. H. Klatt, (Eds), Invariance and variability in speech processes (pp. 202-219). Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-89859-545-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'For speech motor actions, the individual articulatory movements would not appear to be controlled with regard to three- dimensional spatial targets, but rather with regard to their contribution to complex vocal tract goals such as resonance properties (e.g., shape, degree of constriction) and or aerodynamically significant variables'. Speech sounds also have duplicable higher-order characteristics such as rates and shape of modulations and rates and shape of frequency shifts.&lt;ref&gt;Porter RJ. (1987). What is the relation between speech production and speech perception? In: Allport A, MacKay D G, Prinz W G, Scheerer E, eds. Language Perception and Production. London: Academic Press,: 85-106. {{ISBN|978-0-12-052750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such complex auditory goals (which often link—though not always—to internal vocal gestures) are detectable from the speech sound which they create.

==Neurology==

===Dorsal speech processing stream function===

Two cortical processing streams exist: a ventral one which maps sound onto meaning, and a dorsal one, that maps  sound onto motor representations. The dorsal stream projects from the posterior [[Sylvian fissure]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]], onto frontal motor areas, and is not normally involved in speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Carl Wernicke]] identified a pathway between the left posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] (a cerebral cortex region sometimes called the [[Wernicke's area]]) as a centre of the sound "images" of speech and its syllables that connected through the [[arcuate fasciculus]] with part of the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (sometimes called the [[Broca's area]]) responsible for their articulation.&lt;ref name="Wernicke"/&gt;  This pathway is now broadly identified as the dorsal speech pathway, one of the two pathways (together with the ventral pathway) that process speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Mirror neuron]]s have been identified that both process the perception and production of motor movements. This is done not in terms of their exact motor performance but an inference of the intended motor goals with which it is organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the motor theory of speech imitation such speech mirror neurons in infants have selected for motor goals with vocal track gestures that are easy to imitate and this has shaped the nature of the phonetic units out of which spoken words are constructed.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt; Speech is mirrored constantly into its articulations since speakers cannot know in advance that a word is unfamiliar and in need of repetition—which is only learnt after the opportunity to map it into articulations has gone. Thus, speakers if they are to incorporate unfamiliar words into their spoken vocabulary
must by default map all spoken input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Skoyles | first1 = J. R. | title = Mapping of heard speech into articulation information and speech acquisition | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1003007107 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 107 | issue = 18 | pages = E73 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20427741| pmc = 2889576| bibcode = 2010PNAS..107E..73S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motor theory of speech imitation unlike that of [[motor theory of speech perception]] does not link mirror neurons with [[speech perception]].&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;

==Evolution and language==
Human language is a vocabulary-based form of communication that  unlike that of other animals employs tens of thousands of lexicals and names. This requires that young humans new to language have the ability to quickly learn both the pronunciations and use of many thousands of words. If children could not repeat speech without problems,  human language could not exist.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;  This makes the evolution of the capacity of speech repetition a critical innovation needed for the [[origin of speech]]&lt;ref name="skoyles"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motor theory of speech imitation argues that this need for speech to be imitable not speech perception nor [[speech production]] moreover underlies the evolved nature of the [[vowel]] and consonant units of phonetics.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;

==Sign language==
Words in [[sign languages]], unlike those in spoken ones, are made not of sequential units but of [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] configurations of subword unit arrangements, the spatial analogue of the sonic-chronological [[morpheme]]s of spoken language.&lt;ref name="Poizner"&gt;Poizner H. Klima ES. Bellugi U. (1987). What the hands reveal about the brain. MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-66066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These words, like spoken ones, are learnt by imitation.  Indeed, rare cases of compulsive sign-language echolalia exist in otherwise language-deficient deaf autistic individuals born into signing families.&lt;ref name="Poizner"/&gt; At least some cortical areas neurobiologically active during both sign and vocal speech, such as the auditory cortex, are associated with the act of imitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1143">In [[probability theory]] &amp;ndash; specifically in the theory of [[stochastic process]]es, a '''stationary sequence''' is a [[random sequence]] whose [[joint probability distribution]] is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] over time.  If a random sequence ''X''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is stationary then the following holds:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; {} \quad F_{X_n,X_{n+1},\dots,X_{n+N-1}}(x_n, x_{n+1},\dots,x_{n+N-1}) \\
&amp; = F_{X_{n+k},X_{n+k+1},\dots,X_{n+k+N-1}}(x_n, x_{n+1},\dots,x_{n+N-1}),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is the joint [[cumulative distribution function]] of the [[random variable]]s in the subscript.

If a sequence is stationary then it is [[wide-sense stationary]].

If a sequence is stationary then it has a constant [[mean (mathematics)|mean]] (which may not be finite):

: &lt;math&gt;E(X[n]) = \mu \quad \text{for all } n .&lt;/math&gt;

==Description==

Based on a section of a [[topographical map]] of 100 Acres the artwork consists of [[emerald green]] layered platforms that are shaped in a flowing organic manner along the south side of the sculpture parks lake. The artwork consists of [[fiberglass]] grids that sit upon a support system made of [[steel]]. The support system sits at varied heights.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt; Visitors are welcome to walk on, sit, fish at and explore the structure, which is occasionally non-accessible due to flooding.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheets1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rockey"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Indianapolis Museum of Art - Stratum Pier | work=Projects| publisher=Rockey Structures | url=http://www.rockeystructures.com/project20.html | accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

''Stratum Pier'' was created to appear as if it is an extension of the [[shoreline]], exhibiting artist Kendall Buster's desire to merge "the natural and the built environment." A visit to the structure allows one to view the cycles of [[erosion]] and growth in the 100 Acres environment, cycles that are represented in ''Stratum Pier''s layered build.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt;  Fiberglass was chosen due to its light weight allowing it to easily sit in its present location and its durability which allows for heavy use by visitors to the park. Buster started to design the piece after a visit to the park and inspiration from the topographical maps created to document the parks environment.&lt;ref name="IMATV1"&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=19 July 2010 |title=IMA TV: Kendall Buster's Stratum Pier  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_NZdVDfd04 |format=Web|medium=Digital |trans_title= |publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=6 April 2011 |time=  |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buster expects the work to merge with the landscape as the grass and brush that surrounds the area grows into the work.&lt;ref name="Buster"/&gt;

Buster worked with [[architect]] Jeremy Olsen of Wheeler Kearns and project [[engineer]] Chris Rockey of Rockey Structures to create the piece.&lt;ref name="Rockey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buster"&gt;{{cite web | author=Kendall Buster | year=| title=Stratum Pier, 2010 | work=Projects| publisher=Kendall Buster | url=http://www.kendallbuster.com/projects_text/stratumpiertx.html | accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork was commissioned by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] and funded by a grant from [[The Indianapolis Foundation]].&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt; In June 2010 Indianapolis based Motus Dance Theatre performed one day, every 45 minutes, on ''Stratum Pier'' in response to the installation and to celebrate the opening of the park.&lt;ref name="Motus"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Past Performances | work=Performances/Events| publisher=Motus Dance Theatre | url=http://motusdance.com/performancesevents/pastperformances/ | accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supported living''' or '''supportive living''' refers to a range of services designed to help disabled citizens retain their independence in their local communities.

==In the United States==
Supported living has been defined in diverse ways in the US, including early conceptualization in New York as integrated apartment living, and one early definition by the state of Oregon:

"Supported living is defined as persons with disabilities living where and with whom they want, for as long as they want, with the ongoing support needed to sustain that choice."&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy, G.T. &amp; Horner, R.H. (1987). Beyond high school: Residential and employment options after graduation. (p. 506) In: M. Snell (Ed.), "Systematic Instruction of Persons with Severe Handicaps." (3rd edition). Columbus, Ohio: Charles E. Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Supported living...its simplicity is elegant. A person with a disability who requires long-term publicly funded, organized assistance, allies with an agency whose role is to arrange or provide whatever assistance is necessary for the person to live in a decent and secure home of the person's own."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;O'Brien, J. (1993). "Supported Living: What's the Difference?" Lithonia, GA: Responsive Systems Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of community living development, supported living became identified with certain approaches to services and community, including the own home initiatives. These services involved an understanding of "formal" and "informal support" (and their relationship), and changes from "group thinking" approaches (e.g., ten intermediate care facilities for 15 persons each) to planning services for, with and by the person "targeted to be served."&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, S., Racino, J., Knoll, J. &amp; Lutfiyya, Z. (1987). "The Nonrestrictive Environment: On Community Integration for Persons with the Most Severe Disabilities." Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

"Supportive living represents a movement within the (intellectual and) developmental disabilities field to provide support services in regular housing to adults with disabilities. Direct support services can be provided by paid staff, including live-in roommates or boarders, paid neighbors, a person hired as an attendant, a support worker or personal assistant, as well as more traditional agency and (modified) shift(live-in) staffing. Professionals, friends, families, and other "informal supports" can also assist people to live in their homes. Supported living may be joined to a movement toward decent, affordable and accessible housing."&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., Walker, P., O'Connor, S. &amp; Taylor, S. (1993). "Housing, Support and Community: Strategies for Adults with Disabilities". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Racino, J. &amp; Rothenberg, K. (1988). "A Policy Analysis of Private Community Living Arrangements in the State of Connecticut." Syracuse, NY: Center on Human Policy, Syracuse University, Research and Training Center on Community Integration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1993). "Living in the Community Toward Supportive Policies in Housing and Community Services." Report prepared by Community and Policy Studies for the New York State Department of Health on traumatic brain injury technology transfer; adapted by permission. Reprinted in: Racino, J. (1997).

Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported living in the US has multiple known origins, including:
* The development of a service category of community living for people deemed capable of more independent living (also known as semi-independent living).&lt;ref&gt;New York State Association of Community Residence Administrators. (@1980, no known reference). Racino, J. &amp; Schwartz, D. (education co-chairs). "Supportive Living in New York State."

Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a major reform initiative in the US to provide more choices, more integrated and more regular homes and apartments for people with the "most severe disabilities".&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., O'Connor, S., Shoultz, B., Taylor, S. &amp; Walker, P.

* As part of organizational studies during that period (i.e., programs, agencies, and to some extent, state, regional and county systems), including differentiating family support for children and supportive living for adults.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Bogdan, R. &amp; Racino, J. (1991). "Life in the Community: Case Studies Supporting People with Disabilities in the Community." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Racino, J. (1991).

* As state reform and development to a supportive living approach, involving new service structures, program development and financing.&lt;ref name="Racino"&gt;Racino, J., O'Connor, S., Shoultz, B., Taylor, S.J. &amp; Walker, P.

"Supported Living: New Directions in Services for Developmental Disabilities." Alexandria, VA: National Association of State Mental Retardation Program Directors.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a federal initiative to define and fund supportive living (and services and supports, such as personal care, respite care, environmental modifications, case management, chore services, companion services, skilled nursing, supportive living coach).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G. &amp; Gettings, R.

* Finally, as federal, state and provider term applying to "all sorts" of community based living services (i.e., intellectual and developmental disabilities field). Recently, in one state that term even referred to a segregated residential campus, including for children, the antithesis of supportive living ideals and principles.

====Community participation====
First, part of leadership (e.g., federal financing, state leaders, agency providers, knowledge dissemination networks) was back to the broadened concept of "community living" based on emerging concepts and practices in "community participation."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. &amp; Bogdan, R. (1999). "Building Stronger Communities for All: Thoughts about Community Participation for People with Developmental Disabilities." Syracuse, NY: Center on Human Policy, Syracuse University. [President's Committee on Mental Retardation].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Community Participation Book Series [Series Editors: S. Taylor, J. Racino, &amp; B. Shoultz].

Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers, J.A. (1991). Book Review: Life in the Community. "Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps", 16(4), 233-234.&lt;/ref&gt; Supported living linked with the concepts of integrated recreation, inclusive education with community opportunities, community membership, self-determination, "community seeding", "person-centered", and personalized supports.&lt;ref&gt;Dilys Page. (1995). Whose services? Whose needs? "Community Development Journal", 30(2), 217-235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, J. (1995). "The Careless Society: Community and its Counterfeits." New York, NY: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in projects such as the Community Opportunities Project of the Louisiana Developmental Disabilities Council, which were based on roles and relationships such as: Paul becoming a church member, fiancee, health club member, good neighbor, regular at Fred's Country Western and coffee shop, and self-advocate with statewide recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Blaney, B. &amp; Freud, E.

Blaney, "Creating Individual Supports for People with Developmental Disabilities: A Mandate for Change at Many Levels." (pp. 237-253). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Supportive living====
Second, the concept of supportive living was broadened from a service category of a residential program (i.e., facility-based program model with bundled services)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. &amp; Racino, J. (1993). People First: Approaches to housing and support.In: J. Racino, P. Walker, S. O'Connor, &amp; S. Taylor(Eds.), "Housing, Support and Community". (pp. 33-56). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2000). Residential service categories. In: J. Racino,  "Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support." (pp, 67-70). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; to bridge the gap toward the independent living concept of housing and personal assistance services (health-funded), the concept of regular homes with the availability of "intensive support services" (special population groups, "severe disabilities"), a "range of community support services" (e.g., community counseling, recreation support personnel), decent community life (e.g., community employment, financial security), and principles of community and self-determination/choice.&lt;ref&gt;Center on Human Policy. (1989). "A Statement in Support of Adults Living in the Community". Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy, Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Community Integration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1992). Living in the community: Independence, support and transition. In: F.R. Rusch, L. DeStefano, J. Chadsey-Rusch, L. Phelps, &amp; E. Szymanski (Eds.), "Transition from School to Adult Life." (pp. 131-148). Sycamore, IL: Sycamore Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; This agency and systems change work was based on the identification of leading practice of organizations supporting people with disabilities in the community, including the following program design components: the separation of housing and support, home ownership and leasing, individualized and flexible supports, and individual choice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This program design requires "service coordination/case management/service broker/support facilitator",&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J.

====Housing and "homes of our own"====
Generally, though the focus remained on making people's places into "homes of their own"&lt;ref&gt;Biklen, D. (1987). Small homes: Westport Associates. In: S. Taylor, R. Bogdan, &amp; J. Racino (1991). "Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities." (pp.91-104). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1993).

On the service configuration and program design levels, a multi-case study research design was used to explore the five identified characteristics of a "housing and support" approach: the separation of housing and support, "home ownership", including tenancy, close tie among assessment, individual planning and individualized funding, and flexible and individualized support services, and choice.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J.

Heumann]] and late [[Ed Roberts (activist)|Ed Roberts]]; it remains current today (E.g., Center for Personal Assistance Services in the US of San Francisco State University, California; then the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Center for Personal Assistance Services of the World Institute on Disability, 1990).

A state policy study in South Dakota explored the relationship of state systems change necessary to move to a full range of regular housing and support options from the current facility-based service design in comparison to modifying the current small apartment/home structures such as those in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="Racino"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Racino, J. &amp; Rothenberg, K.

==Community support standards in the US==
Supportive living in the US is an important movement within the context of decades of federal policies, sometimes reluctantly, for community support services in communities nationwide as part of [[community integration]], community participation, independent living and inclusion. This movement has been accompanied by a strong emphasis on self-determination, with roots in rehabilitation in the 1950s and also, in education in the 2000s&lt;ref&gt; Wehmeyer, M., Abery, B.H., Mithuag, D., &amp; Stancliffe, R.J. (2003). "Theory in Self Determination". Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, A. &amp; Turnbull, H.R. (2001). Self-determination for individuals with significant cognitive disabilities and their families. "Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps", 26(1): 56-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, this movement emphasized the skill standards of personnel, including direct service workers who were called "human service workers" and their "community managers" (2013, Department of Labor statistics).&lt;ref&gt; Taylor, M., Bradley, V., &amp; Warren, R. (1996). "The Community Support Skill Standards: Tools for Managing Change and Achieving Outcomes" Boston, MA: Human Services Research Institute. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2000). "Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support". Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers. &lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, in 2013 with the consumer-directed services developed in these fields, education and training standards are being revamped within the context of the new US Direct Support Workforce and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare.&lt;ref&gt; Larson, S., Sedlezky, L., Hewitt, A., &amp; Blakeway, C. (in press, 2014). In: J. Racino, "Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US". NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
'''Supported living''' is the term given by local authorities in the [[United Kingdom]] to encompass a range of services designed to help disabled citizens retain their independence in their local community.

Previously, housing and support were usually provided by a [[Charitable organization|charity]] or local council. Now mentally and physically disabled persons can live in their own home and have personal support provided by another organisation or by hiring a personal assistant (paid visiting or live-in carer).

As of 2009, the government in the UK expected "local councils to give people with learning disabilities a genuine opportunity to choose between housing, care and support options that include:
* Supportive living.
* Small-scale ordinary housing.
* Village or intentional communities." (p.&amp;nbsp;73)

"Supportive living" in the "Valuing People, 21st Century" report defined this approach as: "concerned with designing services round the particular needs and wishes of individuals and is less likely to result in housing and support that is designed around congregate living. Department of Health research has shown that supported living is associated with people having greater overall choice and a wider range of community activities." (p.&amp;nbsp;73)&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health of the UK. (2009). "Welcome to Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability in the 21st Century." London, UK: Author. [Original white paper, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teams in the UK===
Local supported living teams can advise what supported housing is available in any given area. Other assistance may include:
* a personal assistant or other care services &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2006). Personal assistance services and direct payments. In: G. Albrecht, ''Encyclopedia on Disability'' (pp. 1235-1238). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE. &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Direct Payments]] &lt;ref&gt; Bornat, J. &amp; Leece, J. (2006). ''Developments in Direct Payments''. Bristol, UK: University of Bristol, Policy Press. &lt;/ref&gt; to pay for privately sourced care services
* mobility equipment
* home adaptations
* security
* emergency call centre
* [[meals on wheels]]

==International collaborations==
As Linda Ward (1995) wrote in her edited text on "Values and Visions: Changing Ideas in Services for People with Learning Difficulties",&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. (1995). Equal citizens: Current issues for people with learning difficulties and their allies. (pp. 3–19). Philpot, T. &amp; Ward, L. (Eds.), "Values and Visions: Changing Ideas in Services for People with Learning Difficulties." Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; "the flaws of the "group home model" were recognised sooner in the USA than the UK." (p. 12). Termed "supportive living", she says these developments have been richly documented by Racino, Walker, O'Connor, &amp; Taylor (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., Walker, P., O'Connor, S. &amp; Taylor, S., "Housing, Support and Community". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Written at the time of the nine-state pilots by the federal government on Community Supported Living Arrangements in the US, she noted great interstate variability in what it was and did identify the primary principles near the 1991 national organizational study (separation of housing and support, one individual at a time, full user choice and control, rejecting no one, and a focus on relationships, with maximum use of informal support and community resources). For comparisons, about the same time, Paul Williams (1995) identified the residential services available in Great Britain, including life sharing, hostels, staffed houses, living alone, lodgings, family placements, group homes, living with families, short term care, hospitals and village communities, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, P. (1995). Residential and day services. In: Malin, N., "Services for People with Learning Disabilities." (pp. 79-110). London and NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important initiatives of the 1980s and 1990s on homes and community living in the United Kingdom was the "influential paper "An Ordinary Life"" which was shared in the US through our internationally known colleague David Towell, then of the King's Fund and Great Britain's National Development Team. &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2016, May 31). Community care and budgeting initiatives, Great Britain, 1983-2008. ''The Rise in Health Care Financing in the Community''. Rome, NY: Community and Policy Studies. &lt;/ref&gt; One of his books, ''An Ordinary Life in Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;Towell, D. (Ed.). (1988). ''An Ordinary Life in the Practice: Developing Comprehensive Community-Based Services for People with Learning Disabilities''. London: King Edward's Hospital Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; was paired with his strategic framework for principled national change.&lt;ref&gt;Towell, D. (1990). "Achieving Strategic Change in Opportunities and Services for People with Learning Difficulties: A Principled Agenda for the 1990s". London: King's Fund College.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the comprehensive book (1988), Richard Brazil and Nan Carle describe an ordinary home life, Linda Ward describes developing opportunities for an ordinary community life, Paul Williams and Alan Tyne values for service development (normalization-based, [[Wolf Wolfensberger]]), Alice Etherington, Keven Hall &amp; Emma Whelan as service users (where I live, where I work), [[Philippa Russell]] on children and families, Jan Porterfield on regular employment, the late James Mansell on training, David Towell on managing strategic change, and Roger Blunden on safeguarding quality, among others.

In 2013, the current framework is inclusive and sustainable housing and communities, similar in both the US and UK with sustainability worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. &amp; Towell, D. (2010). "Conversation about Sustainable and Inclusive Communities: An Invitation". London: Centre for Inclusive Futures.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (in press, 2014). Housing, support and disability: Inclusive, equitable and sustainable communities. "Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US" NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, these inclusion initiatives were discussed in relationship to [[community integration]] theories at the American Society for Public Administration in Atlanta, Georgia (Racino, Rolandi, Huston, &amp; Begman, 2017) &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J., Rolandi, S., Huston, A., &amp; Bergman, A. (2017). ''Expanding Theories of Community Integration to Inclusion, Equity and Sustainability in the Age of Terrorism''. Atlanta, GA: American Society for Public Administration. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27871">The '''value-action gap''' is the space that occurs when the values (personal and cultural) or attitudes of an individual do not correlate to his or her actions. More generally, it is the difference between what people say and what people do. The phrase is associated with environmental geography, relating to attitudes and behaviors surrounding environmental issues.  Usually attitudes affect behavior; however the opposite often seems to be the case with regard to environmental attitudes and values.

The outcome is that there is a gap between the high value people place on the [[natural environment]] and the relatively low level of action taken by individuals to counter environmental problems. This disparity has been termed the ''value-action gap'', the ''attitude-behavior gap'', the ''intention-behavior gap'', the ''KAP-gap'' (acknowledge-attitudes-practice gap) or the ''belief-behavior gap''.&lt;ref name=Kollmuss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kollmuss|first=Anja|author2=Julian Agyeman |title=Mind the Gap: Why do people act environmentally and what are the barriers to pro-environmental behavior?|journal=Environmental Education Research|year=2002|volume=8|issue=3|pages=239–260|doi=10.1080/13504620220145401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diffusion of Innovations (5th ed.)|last=Rogers|first=E.M.|publisher=Free Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Godin|first=Gaston|last2=Conner|first2=Mark|last3=Sheeran|first3=Paschal|date=2005|title=Bridging the intention–behaviour gap: The role of moral norm|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/014466604X17452/abstract|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=497–512|doi=10.1348/014466604X17452|issn=2044-8309|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates surrounding the issue of the value-action gap have mainly taken place within [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] and [[social psychology]] and research is often based within cognitive theories of how attitudes are formed and how this affects individuals’ behavior.&lt;ref name="Blake"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=J.|date=1999|year=|title=Overcoming the 'value-action gap' in environmental policy: Tensions between national policy and local experience|url=|journal=Local Environment: The International Journal of Justice and Sustainability|volume=4|issue=3|pages=257–278|doi=10.1080/13549839908725599|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kowalska-Pyzalska|first=Anna|last2=Maciejowska|first2=Katarzyna|last3=Suszczyński|first3=Karol|last4=Sznajd-Weron|first4=Katarzyna|last5=Weron|first5=Rafał|date=2014|title=Turning green: Agent-based modeling of the adoption of dynamic electricity tariffs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421514002377|journal=Energy Policy|volume=72|issue=|pages=164–174|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2014.04.021|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aims to explain why those with a high regard for environmental issues do not translate this concern into behaviors to solve environmental issues.

The research suggests that there are many internal and external factors that affect behavior and the reasons behind consumer choices. Therefore, it can be difficult to identify the exact reasons for why this gap exists. When purchasing a product for example, many attributes are assessed by the purchaser in order to make their decision such as; price, quality, convenience, and brand familiarity.&lt;ref name=Dickson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dickson|first=M.|title=Utility of no sweat labels for apparel consumers: Profiling label users and predicting their purchases|journal=The Journal of Consumer Affairs|year=2001|volume=35|issue=1|pages=96–119|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6606.2001.tb00104.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors influence the reasons behind buying behavior and environmental considerations are often not taken into account, regardless of the attitudes people have regarding the environment.

Overcoming this gap is of particular importance for environmental policies as finding ways to overcome it should increase the effectiveness of these strategies. This would lead to a fundamental shift in behavior towards the environment and individuals’ use of natural resources, ensuring [[sustainable development]] and conservation of the environment.

== Development of the term ==

=== Summary ===
Theories regarding reasoned action state how attitudes shape and influence behavioral intention, which in term shape actions. The [[theory of reasoned action]] states that behavioral intention is dependent on attitudes surrounding that behavior and social norms.&lt;ref name=Fishbein&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishbein|first=M.|title=Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research.|year=1975|publisher=MA: Addison-Wesley|location=Reading|author2=I. Ajzen }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a person acts or behaves in a way that correlates to their attitudes towards that behavior. Therefore, a person’s voluntary behavior can be predicted by his/her attitudes and values on that behavior.&lt;ref name=Kaiser&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=F.|author2=S.Wolfing,  U. Fuhrer |title=5. Environmental Attitude Andecological Behaviour|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=1999|volume=19|pages=1–19|doi=10.1006/jevp.1998.0107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homer and Kahle (1988) argue that attitudes influence behaviors and can explain the reasons behind human behavior. However, this is often not the case for actions related to environmental behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Homer|first=P.|author2=L. Kahle |title=A Structural Equation Test of the Value–Attitude–Behavior Hierarchy|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|volume=54|issue=4|pages=638–646|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.4.638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barr (2004), in recent decades, public support for environmental protection measures has grown.&lt;ref name=Barr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barr|first=S.|title=Are We All Environmentalists Now? Rhetoric and Reality In Environmental Action|journal=Geoforum|year=2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=231–249|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2003.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been fuelled by pressure groups, consumer groups, and even businesses.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=W. |author2=Hwang K. |author3=McDonald S. |author4=Oates C. |title=Sustainable Consumption: Green Consumer Behaviour When Purchasing Products|journal=Sustainable Development|year=2010|volume=18|pages=20–31|doi=10.1002/sd.394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, increased media coverage of environmental disasters has also resulted in a heightened concern of such issues. This was given a political boost by the publication of the [[Stern Review]] on the Economics of Climate Change. Therefore, people are more aware of environmental issues, such as [[global warming]] or [[climate change]] and it is often reported that many people have a high concern for environmental issues. For example, Dunlap (2002) used survey data which states that 54% of Americans agreed environmental protection was a key priority, even if economic growth was restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunlap|first=R.E.|title=An enduring concern|journal=Public Perspective|date=September–October 2002|pages=10–14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Banerjee and Solomon (2003) also argue that the general support for [[Ecolabel]]s is high among the US public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=A.|author2=Solomon B. |title=Eco-labelling for energy efficiency and sustainability: a meta-evaluation of US programs|journal=Energy Policy|year=2003|volume=31|issue=2|pages=109–123|doi=10.1016/s0301-4215(02)00012-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these studies in mind, it is expected that there would be an increase in pro-environmental behavior, such as recycling or limiting energy usage. However, a significant increase has not been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flynn|first=R.|author2=P. Bellaby |author3=M. Ricci |title=The ‘value-action gap’ in public attitudes towards sustainable energy: the case of hydrogen energy|journal=The Sociological Review|year=2010|volume=57|pages=159–180|doi=10.1111/j.1467-954x.2010.01891.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, attitudes are not always a clear prediction of behavior, resulting in the ‘value-action gap’. The decision-making process is hard to predict as positive attitudes are not followed by positive intentions, and what shapes behavior is a complex process.&lt;ref name=Kollmuss/&gt; Even if values are high, few people take environmental actions which involve changes to their lifestyle and often environmental actions can be unrelated to particular concerns an individual may have. The result is that attitudes are not necessarily a clear determinant of behavior.

== Application ==
Even though many support pro-environmental trade in principle, this is often not taken into consideration as a purchase criterion. Cohen and Murphy (2001) argue that for around 40% of consumers the environmental friendliness of a product will never be a factor in purchasing decisions regardless of positive attitudes towards ethical consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=M|title=Exploring Sustainable Consumption: Environmental Policy and The Social Sciences|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Oxford|author2=Murphy J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many studies which support the existence of a value-action gap. Mostly these can be found within the field of environmental geography. This gap has been illustrated by Lane and Potter (2007) who found a discrepancy between attitudes and behavior regarding the adoption of cleaner vehicles. They reported that those with a concern for the environmental impact of cars did not translate this into behavioral changes at the individual level. Thus, consumers stated intention did not reflect their actual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=B.|author2=Potter S. |title=The Adoption Of Cleaner Vehicles In The UK: Exploring The Consumer Attitude–Action Gap|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|year=2007|volume=15|issue=11|pages=1085–1092|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2006.05.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This gap is also shown within the market share for environmental goods, as [[ethical consumerism]] is still relatively low. Vermeir and Verbeke (2006) point out that initiatives such as legally logged wood, often have market shares of less than 1%, which they argue is partly due to the value-action gap.&lt;ref name=Vermeir&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vermeir|first=I.|author2=Verbeke W. |title=Sustainable Food Consumption: Exploring the Consumer "Attitude – Behavioural Intention" Gap|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics|year=2006|volume=19|issue=2|pages=169–194|doi=10.1007/s10806-005-5485-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even well known, high-profile ethical products still have a small percentage of the market share. Ronchi (2006) reports that the global sales of [[Fairtrade]] were over US$83 million in 2003, yet the total value of Fairtrade sales accounts for little over 0.01% of global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ronchi|first=L.|title=Fairtrade and Market Failures in Agricultural Commodity Markets|journal=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper|year=2006|volume=No. 4011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, consumers’ buying behavior does not reflect their positive attitudes toward ethical products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Pelsmacker|first=P. |author2=Driesen L. |author3=Rayp G.|title=Do Consumers Care about Ethics? Willingness to Pay for Fair-Trade Coffee J|journal=Journal of Consumer Affairs|year=2006|volume=39|issue=2|pages=363–385|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6606.2005.00019.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermeir and Verbeke (2006) also found that there was an inconsistency between the positive attitudes consumer expressed towards sustainability and their behavioral patterns. They found that intentions to buy sustainable dairy products were low regardless of positive attitudes towards these products. They argue that environmental factors are only taken into consideration for a minority of consumers, which means these markets remain small and only attracting a particular niche of consumer. For the majority of consumers other factors are more significant than values relating to the environment when purchasing products. Therefore, positive attitude towards sustainable products are not followed by sustainable actions, contrary to the theory of reasoned action. However, they also found that people’s perceptions of the availability of sustainable dairy products was low, which might explain why intentions to buy was low.&lt;ref name=Vermeir/&gt;

== Key issues ==
The main issues surrounding the value action gap are described below:

=== Factors that affect behavior ===
The key issue is why people's attitudes often fail to materialize into actions.&lt;ref name=Barr /&gt; Many factors exist that lead to an individual’s behavior, and therefore it is not just personal values that affect behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gadenne|first=David|last2=Sharma|first2=Bishnu|last3=Kerr|first3=Don|last4=Smith|first4=Tim|date=2011|title=The influence of consumers' environmental beliefs and attitudes on energy saving behaviours|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511006914|journal=Energy Policy|series=Clean Cooking Fuels and Technologies in Developing Economies|volume=39|issue=12|pages=7684–7694|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2011.09.002|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, people’s values are not fixed and are negotiated, and sometimes contradictory. Thus, cognitive factors alone will not adequately explain environmental action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chung|first=S.S|author2=M. Leung |title=The Value-Action Gap in Waste Recycling: The Case of Undergraduates in Hong Kong|journal=Environmental Management|year=2007|volume=40|issue=4|pages=603–612|doi=10.1007/s00267-006-0363-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake (1999) argues that the relationship between attitudes and behaviors is moderated by the structure of personal attitudes themselves; and external or situational constraints. He argues that if attitudes are based on direct experience then they are more likely to be predictors of behavior and behaviors often result from social norms. Behaviors can also be restricted by external or situational constraints which refer to restrictions outside the individual’s control, such as economic or political factors.&lt;ref name=Blake /&gt;

There are many different theories regarding how consumers make decisions. These can be applied to try to explain why there is a value-action gap for some behaviors. For example, as  Sammer and Wüstenhagen (2006:188) point out [[microeconomic theory]] ([[consumer theory]]) states that, “humans make decisions that maximize their utility”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sammer|first=K.|author2=Wüstenhagen R. |title=The Influence Of Eco-Labelling On Consumer Behaviour – Results Of A Discrete Choice Analysis For Washing Machines|journal=siness Strategy and the Environment Special Issue: Sustainability Marketing|year=2006|volume=15|issue=2|pages=185–199|doi=10.1002/bse.522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if buying environmental products does not maximize an individual’s utility then they will not purchase them, regardless of their attitudes towards these issues.  Making decisions requires a comparison of the costs and benefits of alternative actions within a specific budget, rather than about certain values. Young ''et al.'' (2010) argue that the gap can be due to “brand strength; culture, finance; habit; lack of information; lifestyles; personalities; or, trading off between different ethical factors” (p 22). Moreover, time or convenience can often be the major determinant of consumer behavior, and therefore the value-action gap is understandable for environmental products, as other constraints are more dominant. This means other factors, such as price or quality, are still more important.&lt;ref name=Young /&gt;

Vermeir and Verbeke (2006) argue that consumers are passive with regard to [[sustainable consumption]], and work within their budget rather than following their values . Furthermore, behavior is often based on habit and therefore values concerning the environment are usually not taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=Vermeir /&gt;  People act impulsively and in ways that do not correspond to their declared evaluations and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boulstridge|first=E.|author2=M. Carrigan |title="Do consumers really care about corporate responsibility? Highlighting the attitude—behaviour gap",|journal=Journal of Communication Management|year=2000|volume=4|issue=1|pages=355–368|doi=10.1108/eb023532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Chatzidakis ''et al.'' (2007) argue that consumers use [[Techniques of neutralization|neutralization techniques]] to justify pursuing their more selfish goals instead of purchasing environmental friendly products. Environmental values are usually less dominant in the decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatzidakis|first=A.|author2=Hibbert S |author3=Smith AP |title=Why People Don’t Take their Concerns about Fair Trade to the Supermarket: The Role of Neutralisation|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2007|volume=74|pages=89–100|doi=10.1007/s10551-006-9222-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the main motivation for actions is self-interest rather than altruistic. Therefore, this may account for the low market share of sustainable products.&lt;ref name=McEachern&gt;{{cite journal|last=McEachern|first=m.|author2=P. McClean |title=29. Organic purchasing motivations and attitudes: are they ethical?|journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies|year=2002|volume=26|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1046/j.1470-6431.2002.00199.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information deficit ===
The most effective means to overcome the 'value-action gap' is to translate environmental concern into pro-environmental behavior. This may be achieved through increasing information. Therefore, one key explanation for the discrepancy between attitudes and buying behavior is the lack of information on specific issues.&lt;ref name=Dickson /&gt;

Blake (1999) identifies that the core assumption regarding the value-action gap is that the main barrier between environmental concern and action is the lack of appropriate information. In models of behavior, information generates knowledge, which then shapes attitudes, leading to behavior.&lt;ref name=Blake /&gt;  Eden (1996) argues that polices fail to understand the gap between information and action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eden|first=S.|title=Public participation in environmental policy: considering scientific, counter-scientific and non-scientific contributions|journal=Public Understanding of Science|year=1996|volume=5|pages=183–203|doi=10.1088/0963-6625/5/3/001}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that understanding issues creates awareness and it is this understanding that is the cause of behavior.  Hence, it is often considered that one of the most effective ways to encourage pro-environmental behavior is to highlight important facts relevant to the issues. This is referred to as the ‘information deficit model’ of behavior change, which is based on the assumption that providing knowledge about the consequences of certain actions, would lead to a change in behavior.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess |author2=Harrison C. M. |author3=Filius P|title=Environmental Communication And The Cultural Politics Of Environmental Citizenship,|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=1998|volume=30|pages=1445–1460|doi=10.1068/a301445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental education and new knowledge is one way in which these environmental messages can be delivered, and therefore filling the value-action gap with information could help towards a change public behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gale|first=H.|title=How does drama work in environmental education?|journal=Earth &amp; Environment|year=2008|volume=3|pages=159–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Owens (2000: 1142) argues that “if people had more information about environmental risks, they would become more virtuous”.&lt;ref name=Owens&gt;{{cite journal|last=Owens|first=S.|title=Engaging The Public: Information And Deliberation In Environmental Policy|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=2000|volume=32|pages=1141–1148|doi=10.1068/a3330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional thinking supported this idea that increased knowledge tended to encourage favorable attitudes which, in turn, lead to pro-environmental action.  This relates to broader issues relative to methods of [[environmental governance]]. Attempts by government to affect public behavior have traditionally been based on increasing environmental awareness.  Many [[environmental policies]] are based on this ‘information deficit model’ as policy-makers assume knowledge on certain issues will lead people to act in order to meet policy objectives.&lt;ref name=Blake /&gt;  Owens (2000) points out that governments often aim to encourage action through big publicity campaigns and changing behavior. For example, the UK government’s ‘Are You Doing Your Bit?’ campaign which was launched in 1998 aimed to develop public understanding of sustainable development, and thus, to encourage a change in behavior of individuals. Additionally, many [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) campaign for increasing awareness, on the assumption that this will led to action.&lt;ref name=Kollmuss /&gt; Some argue that to increase environmental action there needs to be educational marketing campaigns on the environmental issues to change people’s attitudes towards these issues, and thus change their behavior.&lt;ref name=McEachern /&gt;

However, the effect of information on behavioral change is debatable. Different people will respond and interpret the same environmental information in various ways and sometimes it is interpreted in an opposite way to what is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=G.|author2=Macnaghten, P. |title=Rhetorics of environmental sustainability: commonplaces and places|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=1998|volume=30|issue=2|doi=10.1068/a300333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barr and Gilg (2002) argue that just increasing information will not lead to a behavior change that would close this gap, and information-intensive campaigns are likely to be unproductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barr|first=S.|author2=A. Gilg|date=|year=1998|title=Sustainable lifestyles: Framing environmental action in and around the home|url=http://www.lifestylesandlifecourses.org/Staff/_private/Barr,%20S.%20&amp;%20Gilg,%20A.W.%20(2006)%20%27Sustainable%20Lifestyles...%27.pdf|journal=Geoforum|volume=37|pages=906-920|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2006.05.002|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increased media attention surrounding environmental issues and organizations such as [[Greenpeace]] having a high profile, it could be argued that there is already a lot of information on these issues, and it is considered that general awareness on environmental issues is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornton|first=A.|title=Public attitudes and behaviours towards the environment – tracker survey: A report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|year=2009|publisher=Defra|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sammer and Wüstenhagen (2006) point out that while people may be aware of environmental issues, this does not necessarily mean that they play a major role in their actions. These findings suggest that the 'value-action gap' cannot be overcome simply by using an 'information deficit' model of individual participation. Increasing information does not itself guarantee action at the individual level and information campaigns intended to raise awareness are not as effective as some may suppose.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=T|title=Motivating Sustainable Consumption: A Review Of Evidence On Consumer Behaviour And Behavioural Change. A report to the Sustainable Development Research Network.|year=2005|publisher=SDRN|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This raises issues regarding the effectiveness of methods used by NGOs, whose activities generally involve awareness campaigns and the use of non-state market driven ([[NSMD]]) forms of governance which rely on consumers to create change. If attitudes are not translated into behavior then these methods are essentially flawed. This would suggest that other methods are more appropriate to encourage environmental action, such as regulation and economic incentives (taxes and grants).&lt;ref name=Retallack&gt;{{cite book|last=Retallack|first=S.|title=Positive Energy: Harnessing people power to prevent climate change – a summary,|year=2007|publisher=IPPR|location=London |author2=T. Lawrence |author3=M. Lockwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barriers to behavior ===
It is widely considered that many other barriers exist, besides a lack of information, which inhibit ethical behavior causing a value-action gap to exist.

Retallack ''et al.'' (2007) identifies other barriers such as uncertainty, skepticism about the issue and distrust of national governments and organizations.&lt;ref name=Retallack /&gt;  Jackson (2005) uses the concept of ‘bounded rationality’ to explain how individuals’ decision making processes are ‘bounded’ by psychological and environmental constraints.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

Blake (1999) points out that various models of behavior are flawed in that they fail to take into consideration the social, individual and institutional constraints.&lt;ref name=Blake /&gt; Various conditions and personal day-to-day responsibilities constrain actions that can be regarded as ethical. Blake identifies that this gap is not empty, but is filled with barriers that block the progress from environmental concern to environmental action. In his model, action is blocked by many factors intruding into the process, rather than just a lack of information.  Thus, the cause of the value-action gap can be explained in terms of personal, social and structural barriers to action. Blake identifies three categories of obstacles that exist between the environmental concern and action: individuality; responsibility and practicality. However, which factors are important will vary for different individuals and environmental actions. Moreover, barriers often overlap and are combined which limits behavioral change. 
  
* Individual barriers refer to environmental concerns being outweighed by other conflicting attitudes. People may perceive themselves as the wrong type of person to carry out ethical actions or have a lack of interest in environmental issues, e.g. a divorce of position.
* Responsibility barriers refers to the idea that people may not act, despite supporting environmental action, because they believe it is not their responsibility to help solve environmental problems. This is supported by Jackson (2005) who identifies that the acceptance of personal responsibility for one’s actions, and their consequences, is the basis for the intention to perform a pro-environmental behavior. People may also not act because they possess a lack of trust for national governments and organizations which aim to tackle environmental issues.,&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; e.g. cynicism.
* Finally, practical constraints prevent people from adopting pro-environmental action, regardless of their attitudes or intentions. These include lack of time, money, physical storage space (in the case of recycling), encouragement and pro-environmental facilities such as recycling and adequate public transport provision. Some people may also be physically unable to carry out some environmental actions, e.g. space limitations.
Therefore, Blake argues that policies need to tackle these barriers, not just provide more information or recycling facilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4936">A '''version vector''' is a mechanism for tracking changes to data in a [[distributed system]], where multiple agents might update the data at different times. The version vector allows the participants to determine if one update preceded another ([[happened-before]]), followed it, or if the two updates happened concurrently (and therefore might conflict with each other). In this way, version vectors enable [[causality]] tracking among data replicas and are a basic mechanism for [[optimistic replication]].  In mathematical terms, the version vector generates a [[preorder]] that tracks the events that precede, and may therefore influence, later updates.

Version vectors maintain state identical to that in a [[vector clock]], but the update rules differ slightly;  in this example, replicas can either experience local updates (e.g., the user editing a file on the local node), or can synchronize with another replica:

* Initially all vector counters are zero.
* Each time a replica experiences a local update event, it increments its own counter in the vector by one.
* Each time two replicas &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; synchronize, they both set the elements in their copy of the vector to the maximum of the element across both counters:  &lt;math&gt;V_a[x] = V_b[x] = max(V_a[x], V_b[x])&lt;/math&gt;.  After synchronization, the two replicas have identical version vectors.

Pairs of replicas, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, can be compared by inspecting their version vectors and determined to be either: identical (&lt;math&gt;a=b&lt;/math&gt;), concurrent (&lt;math&gt;a \parallel b&lt;/math&gt;), or ordered (&lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b &lt; a&lt;/math&gt;).  The ordered relation is defined as:  Vector &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if every element of &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to its corresponding element in &lt;math&gt;V_b&lt;/math&gt;, and at least one of the elements is strictly less than.  If neither &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b &lt; a&lt;/math&gt;, but the vectors are not identical, then the two vectors must be concurrent.

The phrase "'''violence begets violence'''" (or "hate begets hate") means that violent behavior promotes other violent behavior, in return. The phrase has been used since at least the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11184923/violence_begets_violence_1834/|title="Violence begets violence" (1834)|date=1834-11-04|work=The Times|access-date=2017-05-23|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence begets violence is a concept described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], verse 26:52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/matthew-26-52.html|title=Matthew 26:52 Commentary - John Gill's Exposition of the Bible|website=Bible Study Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/matthew/26.html|title=Matthew Henry Commentary on the Whole Bible (Complete) |website=www.biblestudytools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/commentaries/matthew/26-52.htm|title=Matthew 26:52 Commentaries: Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.|website=biblehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage depicts a [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] (identified in the [[Gospel of John]] as [[Saint Peter]]) drawing a sword to defend against the [[arrest of Jesus]] but being told to sheath his weapon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 26:52, New International Version.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Whiteness studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] arena of inquiry that has developed beginning in the United States, particularly since the late 20th century, and is focused on what proponents describe as the cultural, historical and sociological aspects of [[white people|people identified as white]], and the [[social construction]] of "whiteness" as an ideology tied to social status. Pioneers in the field include [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] ("Jefferson Davis as a Representative of Civilization", 1890; ''[[Darkwater]]'', 1920), [[James Baldwin]] (''[[The Fire Next Time]]'', 1963), [[Theodore W. Allen]] (''The Invention of the White Race,'' 1976, expanded in 1995), [[Ruth Frankenberg]] (''White Women, Race Matters: The Social Construction of Whiteness'', 1993), author and literary critic [[Toni Morrison]] (''Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination'', 1992) and historian [[David Roediger]] (''The Wages of Whiteness'', 1991). By the mid-1990s, numerous works across many disciplines analyzed whiteness, and it has since become a topic for academic courses, research and anthologies.

A central tenet of whiteness studies is a reading of history and its effects on the present that is inspired by [[postmodernism]] and [[historicism]], in which the very concept of [[Racism|racial superiority]] is said to have been socially constructed in order to justify discrimination against non-whites. Since the 19th century, some writers have argued that the [[Phenotype|phenotypical]] significances attributed to specific races are without biological association, and that race is therefore not a valid biological concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/01race/race.htm|title=What is Race?|last=Randall|first=Vernellia R.|website=academic.udayton.edu|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientists have demonstrated that racial theories are based upon an arbitrary clustering of phenotypical categories and [[customs]], and can overlook the problem of gradations between categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obasogie|first1=Osagie|title=Return of the race myth?|journal=New Scientist|date=1 July 2009|volume=203|issue=2715|pages=22–23|accessdate=|bibcode=2009NewSc.203...22O|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(09)61767-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas K. Nakayama and Robert L. Krizek write about whiteness as a "strategic rhetoric," asserting, in the essay "Whiteness: A Strategic Rhetoric", that whiteness is a product of "discursive formation" and a "rhetorical construction". Nakayama and Krizek write, "there is no 'true essence' to 'whiteness': there are only historically contingent constructions of that social location."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Nakayama | first1 = Thomas K. | last2 = Krizek | first2 = Ro L.bert | title = Readings in Rhetorical Criticism | chapter = Whiteness: A Strategic Rhetoric | edition = 3 | editors = Carl Burgchardt | isbn = 978-1-891136-12-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nakayama and Krizek also suggest that by naming whiteness, one calls out its centrality and reveals its invisible, central position. Whiteness is considered normal and neutral, therefore, to name whiteness means that one identifies whiteness as a rhetorical construction which can be dissected to unearth its values and beliefs.

Major areas of research in whiteness studies include the nature of [[white privilege]] and white identity, the historical process by which a white racial identity was created, the relation of culture to white identity, and possible processes of social change as they affect white identity.

==Development of the field==
Studies of whiteness as a unique identity could be said to begin among [[black people]], who needed to understand whiteness to survive, particularly in slave societies such as the American colonies and United States.&lt;ref name=hooksRepresentations&gt;[[bell hooks]], "Representations of Whiteness in the Black Imagination", ''Black Looks'' (1992); republished in Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ganley&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ganley | first = Toby | title = What's all this talk about whiteness? | journal = Dialogue | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 12&amp;ndash;30 | publisher = [[University of Queensland]] | date = 2003 | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130428181555/http://www.polsis.uq.edu.au//dialogue/vol-1-2-4.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}} ([https://dialoguejournal.org.au/archives/ Link to journal.])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Roediger | first = David | title = Critical studies of whiteness, USA: origins and arguments | journal = [[Theoria (sociology journal)|Theoria]] | volume = 48 | issue = 98 | pages = 72&amp;ndash;98 | publisher = [[Berghahn Books|Berghahn]] | doi = 10.3167/004058101782485511 | date = 1 December 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.3167/004058101782485511 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important theme in this literature is, beyond the general "invisibility" of blacks to whites, the unwillingness of white people to consider that black people study them anthropologically.&lt;ref name=hooksRepresentations/&gt; American author [[James Weldon Johnson]] wrote in his 1912 novel ''[[The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man]]'' that "colored people of this country know and understand the white people better than the white people know and understand them".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Weldon Johnson]], ''[http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/64/the-autobiography-of-an-ex-colored-man/ The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man]'', Boston: Sherman, French, and Co., 2012; Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[James Baldwin]] wrote and spoke extensively about whiteness, defining it as a central social problem and insisting that it was choice, not a biological identity.&lt;ref&gt;Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998), pp. 20–21. "No thinker so fully brought together the many dimensions of African-American studies of whiteness as James Baldwin. [...] Adopting and treasuring a white identity is, he wrote, 'absolutely a moral choice' since 'there are no white people.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Baldwin, "On being 'white' and other lies", ''Essence'', 1984; republished in Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Fire Next Time]]'' (1963), a non-fiction book on race relations in the United States, Baldwin suggests that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this—which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never—the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Baldwin]], ''The Fire Next Time'', New York: Dial Press, 1963; republished in New York by Vintage International, 1993; p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A major black theory of whiteness connects this identity group with acts of [[terrorism]]—i.e., slavery, rape, torture, and lynching—against black people, who were treated as sub-human.&lt;ref&gt;Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998), pp. 15–16. "Equally compelling African–American studies treat whiteness as a species of terror. [...] [[Paul Gilroy]]'s recent ''The Black Atlantic'' uncompromisingly calls upon the tradition of connecting the terrors of the trade in black bodies, the bloodiness of slave control, and the soul-killing violence of racial exploitation with the total experience of whiteness by people of colors. [[bell hooks]] makes much the same points regarding the circumstances under which African Americans encounter and represent whiteness. Other black thinkers have carried this insight still further. They contend that whiteness is also experienced through terror by whites, who find and reproduce unity by committing and more often by witnessing acts of violence. Slave tales and autobiographies, for example, at times insisted upon the centrality of stealing humans, breaking up families, 'patrolling' plantations, and committing rape to the growth of a white identity."&lt;/ref&gt;

White academics in the United States and the United Kingdom (UK) began to study whiteness as early as 1983, creating the idea of a discipline called "whiteness studies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Albert | title = Omni-Americans: Some Alternatives to the Folklore of White Supremacy | publisher = Vintage | year = 1983 | oclc = 1020212158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[canon wars]]" of the late 1980s and 1990s, a political controversy over the centrality of white authors and perspectives in United States culture, led the scholar [[Shelley Fisher Fishkin]] to ask "how the imaginative construction of 'whiteness' had shaped American literature and American history".&lt;ref name="Fishkin_interrogate"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fishkin | first = Shelley Fisher | author-link = Shelley Fisher Fishkin | title = Interrogating "Whiteness," Complicating "Blackness": Remapping American Culture | journal = [[American Quarterly]] | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 428&amp;ndash;466 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/2713296 | date = September 1995 | url = https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713296 | quote = ''In this essay I will provide a brief overview of over a hundred books and articles from fields including literary criticism, history, cultural studies, anthropology, popular culture, communication studies, music history, art history, dance history, humor studies, philosophy, linguistics, and folklore, all published between 1990 and 1995 or forthcoming shortly. Taken together, I believe, they mark the early 1990s as a defining moment in the study of American culture.'' | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|430}} The field developed a large body of work during the early 1990s, Fishkin describes it extending across the disciplines of "literary criticism, history, cultural studies, sociology, anthropology, popular culture, communication studies, music history, art history, dance history, humor studies, philosophy, linguistics, and folklore".&lt;ref name="Fishkin_interrogate" /&gt;

As of 2004, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', at least 30 institutions in the United States including [[Princeton University]], the [[University of California at Los Angeles]], the [[University of New Mexico]] and [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] offer, or have offered, courses in whiteness studies. Teaching and research around whiteness often overlap with research on [[post-colonial theory]] and [[orientalism]] taking place in the Arts and Humanities, Sociology, Literature, Communications, and Cultural and Media Studies faculties and departments, among others (e.g. Kent, Leeds). Also heavily engaged in whiteness studies are practitioners of [[anti-racism|anti-racist education]], such as [[Betita Martinez]] and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop.

One contribution to White Studies is [[Rich Benjamin]]'s ''[[Searching for Whitopia|Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America]]''. The book examines white social beliefs and white anxiety in the contemporary United States—in the context of enormous demographic, cultural, and social change.  The book is often taught as a primer in White Studies on white racial identity in a "post-racial" US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Benjamin | first = Rich | title = Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America | publisher = Hyperion | location = New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781401322687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major contribution to whiteness studies is the analysis of whiteness as a phenomenon, not just localized to the US and Western Hemisphere, but also in the context of other post-colonial metropoles such as the Netherlands.  [[Gloria Wekker]]’s White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race excavates the immutability and fluidity of white identity and its relationship to innocence in the context of post-colonial Netherlands in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Wekker identifies white innocence as a contemporary construction and denial [aggressive national forgetting] of the Netherlands role and proximity to European imperialism, racial stratification and hierarchy, and its contributions to the making of contemporary constructions of national belonging and cultural normativity (autochtoon vs. allochtonen).

In Wekker’s analysis, although a majority of the residents of the Netherlands are migrants, the process of stratifying Dutch from “Other” is facilitated through skin tone and non-Christian religious practices (“deviant”, non-White religions). In Wekker’s account, the process of racialization is reserved for mid-to-late twentieth century migrant groups [i.e. Muslims, Black Surinamese, Black Antilleans], interchangeably as a means of delineating groups outside the constructed immutable “norms” of Dutch society. Ultimately, Wekker is illuminating the cultural and rhetorical maneuvering that occurs within Dutch popular culture, educational spaces, and national discourses that facilitate a normalizing, non-identity to whiteness and how this very concept is intricately connected to a longer historical nineteenth-century racial grammar that accompanied imperial expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wekker | first = Gloria | title = White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780822360759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of whiteness===
Whiteness studies draws on research into the definition of race, originating with the United States but applying to racial stratification worldwide. This research emphasizes the historically recent [[social construction]] of white identity. As stated by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] in 1920: "The discovery of a personal whiteness among the world's peoples is a very modern thing,—a nineteenth and twentieth century matter, indeed."&lt;ref&gt;W. E. B. Du Bois, ''Darkwater'' (1920); republished in Roediger, ''Black on White'' (1998), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline examines how white, Native, and African/black identities emerged in interaction with the institutions of slavery, colonial settlement, citizenship, and industrial labor. Scholars such as [[Winthrop Jordan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jordan | first = Winthrop D. | author-link = Winthrop Jordan | title = White over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550-1812 | publisher = Omohundro Institute of Early Armerian History and Culture, Wiliamsburg, Virginia | location = Chapel Hill | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781469600765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have traced the evolution of the legally defined line between "blacks" and "whites" to colonial government efforts to prevent cross-racial revolts among unpaid laborers.

Academic Joseph Pugliese is among writers who have applied whiteness studies to an [[Australia|Australian]] context, discussing the ways that [[Indigenous Australians]] were marginalized in the wake of British colonization of Australia, as whiteness came to be defined as central to Australian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perera | first1 = Suvendrini | last2 = Pugliese | first2 = Joseph | title = White Law of the Biopolitical | journal = Journal of the European Association of Studies on Australia | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 87&amp;ndash;100 | publisher = European Association of Studies on Australia | date = 2012 | url = http://www.easa-australianstudies.net/node/295 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.easa-australianstudies.net/files/jeasa4spererajpugliese16.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perera | first1 = Suvendrini | last2 = Pugliese | first2 = Joseph | title = Death in a dry river: black life, white property, parched justice | journal = Somatechnics | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 65&amp;ndash;86 | publisher = [[Edinburgh University Press]] | doi = 10.3366/soma.2011.0007 | date = 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.3366/soma.2011.0007 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} &lt;/ref&gt; Pugliese discusses the 20th-century [[White Australia policy]] as a conscious attempt to preserve the "purity" of whiteness in Australian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pugliese | first = Joseph | title = Race as Category Crisis: Whiteness and the Topical Assignation of Race | journal = Social Semiotics | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 149&amp;ndash;168 | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/103503302760212078 | date = 2002 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/103503302760212078  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Willard | first = Myra | title = History of the White Australia policy to 1920  |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=chuDflqWzlEC | publisher = Frank Cass and Company | location = Carlton, Victoria  |origyear=1923 | year = 1967 | isbn = 9780714610368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise Stefanie Affeldt considers whiteness "a concept not yet fully developed at the time the first convicts and settlers arrived down under" &lt;ref&gt;Affeldt, Stefanie. ''Consuming Whiteness'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; which, as a social relation, had to be negotiated and was driven forward in particular by the labour movement. Eventually, with the Federation of Australia, "[o]verlaying social differences, the shared membership in the 'white race' was the catalyst for the consolidation of the Australian colonies as the Commonwealth of Australia" &lt;ref&gt;Affeldt, Stefanie. ''Consuming Whiteness'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==White privilege==
{{main|White privilege}}
In 1965, drawing from insights from W.E.B. Du Bois and inspired by the Civil Rights movement, [[Theodore W. Allen]] began a forty-year analysis of "white skin privilege", "white race" privilege, and "white" privilege. In a piece he drafted for a "John Brown Commemoration Committee", he urged that "White Americans who want government of the people" and "by the people" to "begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =John Brown Memorial Pilgrimage | publisher = John Brown Commemoration Committee, | date =  December 4, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | last2 = et al | title = July 2010 edition | journal = Cultural Logic: Marxist Theory and Practice, special issue: Culture and Crisis | publisher = Theodore W.

By June 15, 1969, the ''New York Times'' was reporting that the National Office of SDS was calling "for an all-out fight against 'white skin privileges'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ignatin (Ignatiev) | first1 = Noel | last2 = Allen | first2 = Ted | chapter = White Blindspot | chapter-url = http://www.sds-1960s.org/WhiteBlindspot.pdf | editor-last = Davidson | editor-first = Carl | title = Revolutionary Youth &amp; the New Working Class: the Praxis Papers, the Port Authority Statement, the RYM Documents and Other Lost Writings of SDS | pages = 148&amp;ndash;181 | publisher = Changemaker Publications | location = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781257999477 }}

For almost forty years, Allen offered a detailed historical analysis of the origin, maintenance, and functioning of "white-skin privilege" and "white privilege" in such writings as: "White Supremacy in U.S. History" (1973);&lt;ref&gt;Ted (Theodore W.)

In his historical work, Allen asserted that: 
*the "white race" was invented as a ruling class social control formation in the late 17th-/early-18th century Anglo-American [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] colonies (principally Virginia and Maryland); 
*central to this process was the ruling-class plantation bourgeoisie conferring "white race" privileges on European-American working people; 
*these privileges were not only against the interests of African Americans, they were also "poison", "ruinous", a baited hook, to the class interests of working people; 
*[[white supremacy]], reinforced by "white skin privilege", has been the main retardant of working-class consciousness in the US; and
*struggle for radical social change should direct principal efforts at challenging white supremacy and "white skin privileges".&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Perry | first = Jeffrey B. | title = The Developing Conjuncture and Insights from Hubert Harrison and Theodore W.

He also raised important questions about developments in those areas, and he avoided using the term "whiteness", using quotation marks when he did.&lt;ref name="Summary_pt1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 8, 78 n. 187, 80–89}}

Laura Pulido writes about the relation of white privilege to racism. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"White privilege [is] a highly structural and spatial form of racism&amp;nbsp;... I suggest that historical processes of suburbanization and decentralization are instances of white privilege and have contributed to contemporary patterns of environmental racism."&lt;ref name="pulido"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Pulido defines environmental racism as "the idea that nonwhites are disproportionately exposed to pollution".&lt;ref name="pulido"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pulido | first = Laura | title = Rethinking Environmental Racism: Whiteness Privilege and Urban Development in Southern California | journal = [[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]] | volume = 90 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–40 | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00182 | date = 2000 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/0004-5608.00182 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers such as [[Peggy McIntosh]] say that social, political, and cultural advantages are accorded to whites in global society. She argues that these advantages seem invisible to white people, but obvious to non-whites. McIntosh argues that whites utilize their whiteness, consciously or unconsciously, as a framework to classify people and understand their social locations. In addition, even though many white people understand that whiteness is associated with privilege, they do not acknowledge their privilege because they view themselves as average and non-racist. Essentially, whiteness is invisible to white people.&lt;ref name="mcintosh"&gt;{{cite book | last = McIntosh | first = Peggy | author-link = Peggy McIntosh | chapter = White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack | editor-last = Rothenberg | editor-first = Paula S. | title = Race, Class, and Gender in the United States: An Integrated Study | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Worth Publishers/Macmillan Learning | location = New York | year = 2016 | edition = 10th | isbn = 9781464178665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think whites are carefully taught not to recognize white privilege, as males are taught not to recognize [[male privilege]]. So I have begun in an untouched way to ask what it is like to have white privilege. I have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets which I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was 'meant' to remain oblivious" (188).&lt;ref name="mcintosh"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;McIntosh calls for Americans to acknowledge white privilege so that they can more effectively attain [[Social equality|equality]] in American society. She argues, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To redesign social systems we need first to acknowledge their colossal unseen dimensions. The silences and denials surrounding privilege are the key political tool here. They keep the thinking about equality or equity incomplete, protecting unearned advantage and conferred dominance by making these [[taboo]] subjects" (192).&lt;ref name="mcintosh"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

White privilege is also related to "white guilt". As Jackson writes in the article, "''White Noises: On Performing White, On Writing Performance''" (1998), "The rhetorics of white guilt are tiresome, cliche, disingenuous, and everywhere. And now that the stereotype of 'the guilty white' is almost entrenched in its negativity as 'the racist white', people actively try to dis-identify from both."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jackson | first = Shannon | title = White Noises: On Performing White, On Writing Performance | journal = [[The Drama Review]] | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–65 | doi=10.1162/105420498760308670 | date = 1998 | url = https://doi.org/10.1162/105420498760308670 | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical whiteness studies===
An offshoot of [[critical race theory]], theorists of '''critical whiteness studies''' seek to examine the construction and moral implications of whiteness. There is a great deal of overlap between critical whiteness studies and critical race theory, as demonstrated by focus on the legal and historical construction of white identity, and the use of narratives (whether legal discourse, testimony or fiction) as a tool for exposing systems of racial power.&lt;ref&gt;''See, for example'':

==Whiteness and architecture==
In the early 21st century, architectural historians have published studies related to the construction of whiteness in the built environment. Studies have grappled with the exclusionary nature of the architectural profession, which erected barriers for nonwhite practitioners, the ways in which architects and designers have employed motifs, art programs, and color schemes that reflected the aspirations of European-Americans and, most recently, with the racialization of space.&lt;ref&gt;''For studies of whiteness and architecture, see'':

==Whiteness and education==
Whiteness and privilege continue in education after Jim Crow versions of the segregationist ideology have lost their legitimacy due to legal and political failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Irons | first = Jenny | chapter = Conclusion: Legitimacy, Whiteness, and Racism | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0I5mA3Ui6ZQC&amp;pg=PT199 | title = Reconstituting Whiteness: the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission | pages = 198-199 | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press | location = Nashville, Tennessee | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780826516855 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy and individualism discourses mask white fear and newer forms of exclusion in contemporary education according to scholar, Charles R. Lawrence III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lawrence | first = Charles R., III. | title = Forbidden Conversations: On Race, Privacy, and Community (A Continuing Conversation with John Ely on Racism and Democracy) | journal = [[Yale Law Journal]], special issue: Symposium: On Democratic Ground: New Perspectives on John Hart Ely | volume = 114 | issue = 6 | pages = 1359–1377 | jstor = 4135742 | date = 2005 | url = https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/ylj/vol114/iss6/5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4953&amp;context=ylj Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Writer [[David Horowitz]] draws a distinction between whiteness studies and other analogous disciplines. "[[Black Studies|Black studies]] celebrates blackness, [[Chicano Studies|Chicano studies]] celebrates Chicanos, [[women's studies]] celebrates women, and white studies attacks white people as evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Fears | first = Darryl | title = Hue and Cry on 'Whiteness Studies' | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14386-2003Jun19 | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 20 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dagmar R. Myslinska, an Adjunct Associate Professor of Law at [[Fordham University]], argues that whiteness studies overlooks the heterogeneity of whites' experience, be it due to class, immigrant status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myslinska|first1=Dagmar|title=Contemporary First-Generation European-Americans: The Unbearable ‘Whiteness’ of Being|journal=Tulane Law Review|date=2014|volume=88|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2222267|page=559|ssrn=2222267}}&lt;/ref&gt; or geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Myslinska | first = Dagmar | title = Racist Racism: Complicating Whiteness Through the Privilege &amp; Discrimination of Westerners in Japan | journal = Law Review |date=2014|volume=83|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2399984|page=1|ssrn=2399984 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Kay]], a columnist for the ''[[National Post]]'', has sharply criticized whiteness studies, writing that it "points to a new low in moral vacuity and civilizational [[Self-hatred|self-loathing]]" and is an example of "academic pusillanimity." According to Kay, whiteness studies "cuts to the chase: It is all, and only, about white self-hate."&lt;ref name=Kay1&gt;{{cite news | last = Kay | first = Barbara | title = Blaming whitey | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090520052049/http://www.barbarakay.ca/archive/20060913whitey.html | url = http://www.barbarakay.ca/archive/20060913whitey.html | archive-date = 20 May 2009 | work = National Post | date = 13 September 2006 | access-date = 28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kay noted the leanings of the field by quoting Jeff Hitchcock, co-founder and executive director of the Center for the Study of White American Culture (CSWAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.euroamerican.org/ | website = euroamerican.org | publisher = Center for the Study of White American Culture (CSWAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; who stated in a 1998 speech:
{{cquote|There is no crime that whiteness has not committed against people of colour.... We must blame whiteness for the continuing patterns today... which damage and prevent the humanity of those of us within it....We must blame whiteness for the continuing patterns today that deny the rights of those outside of whiteness and which damage and pervert the humanity of those of us within it.&lt;ref name=Kay1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hitchcock | first = Jeff | title = Decentering Whiteness | url = http://www.euroamerican.org/library/confarchive/NCOW3/Hitchcock-speech-NCOW3.pdf | publisher = Center for the Study of White American Culture (CSWAC) | date = 7 November 1998}} Speech given at the 3rd National Conference on Whiteness, [[University of Chicago]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding whiteness studies (WS) more broadly, Kay wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;WS teaches that if you are white, you are branded, literally in the flesh, with evidence of a kind of original sin. You can try to mitigate your evilness, but you can't eradicate it. The goal of WS is to entrench permanent race consciousness in everyone&amp;nbsp;— eternal victimhood for nonwhites, eternal guilt for whites&amp;nbsp;— and was most famously framed by WS chief guru, [[Noel Ignatiev]], former professor at [[Harvard University]] [''sic'', Ignatiev was a Ph.D. student and then a tutor at Harvard, but never a professor], now teaching at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]]: "The key to solving the social problems of our age is to abolish the white race&amp;nbsp;— in other words, to abolish the privileges of the white skin."&lt;ref name=Kay1/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to such criticism in the mass media, whiteness studies has earned a mixed reception from academics in other fields. In 2001, historian Eric Arnesen wrote that "whiteness has become a blank screen onto which those who claim to analyze it can project their own meanings" and that the field "suffers from a number of potentially fatal methodological and conceptual flaws."&lt;ref name="arnesen"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Arnesen | first = Eric | title = Whiteness and the Historian's Imagination | journal = International Labor and Working-Class History | volume = 60 | pages = 3&amp;ndash;32 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | jstor = 27672732 | date = October 2001 | url = https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-labor-and-working-class-history/article/whiteness-and-the-historians-imagination/0C13EEC2BC7AE498B2A869DC6B112DA2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, Arnesen writes that the core theses of whiteness studies—that racial categories are arbitrary social constructs without definite biological basis, and that some white Americans benefit from racist discrimination of non-whites—have been common wisdom in academia for many decades and are hardly as novel or controversial as whiteness studies scholars seem to believe. Additionally, Arnesen accuses whiteness studies scholars of sloppy thinking; of making claims not supported by their sources; of overstating supporting evidence and [[cherry picking]] to neglect contrary information.

He notes that a particular datum almost entirely ignored by whiteness studies scholars is religion, which has played a prominent role in conflicts among various American classes. He says that a type of "keyword literalism" persists in whiteness studies, where important words and phrases from primary sources are taken out of their historical context. Whiteness has so many different definitions that the word is "nothing less than a moving target."&lt;ref name="arnesen"/&gt; Arnesen notes that whiteness studies scholars are entirely on the [[Far-left politics|far left]] of the [[political spectrum]], and suggests that their apparent vitriol towards white Americans is due in part to white workers not fulfilling the predictions of [[Marxist theory]] that the [[proletariat]] would overcome racial, national and class distinctions to unite and overthrow [[capitalism]]. He cites, as an example, [[David Roediger]]’s afterword to the seminal ''Wages of Whiteness'', which asserts that the book was written as a reaction to "the appalling extent to which white male workers voted for [[Reaganism]] in the 1980s."&lt;ref name="arnesen"/&gt; Arnesen argues that in the absence of supporting evidence, whiteness studies often rely on amateurish [[Freudian]] speculation about the motives of white people: "The [[psychoanalysis]] of whiteness here differs from the 'talking cure' of Freudianism partly in its neglect of the speech of those under study." Without more accurate scholarship, Arnesen writes that "it is time to retire whiteness for more precise historical categories and analytical tools."&lt;ref name="arnesen"/&gt;

In 2002 historian [[Peter Kolchin]] offered a more positive assessment and declared that, at its best, whiteness studies has "unfulfilled potential" and offers a novel and valuable means of studying history.&lt;ref name="kolchin"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kolchin | first = Peter | author-link = Peter Kolchin | title = Whiteness Studies: The New History of Race in America | journal = [[Journal of American History]] | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 154&amp;ndash;173 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | jstor = 270078 | doi = 10.2307/2700788 | date = June 2002 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/2700788 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.cwu.edu/diversity/sites/cts.cwu.edu.diversity/files/documents/whiteness.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Particularly, he praises scholarship into the development of the ''concept'' of whiteness in the United States, and notes that the definition and implications of a white racial identity have shifted over the decades. Yet Kolchin describes a "persistent sense of unease " with certain aspects of whiteness studies. There is no consensus definition of whiteness, and thus the word is used in vague and contradictory ways, with some scholars even leaving the term undefined in their articles or essays."&lt;ref name="kolchin"/&gt; Kolchin also objects to "a persistent dualism evident in the work of the best whiteness studies authors," who often claim that whiteness is a social construct while also arguing, paradoxically, that whiteness is an "omnipresent and unchanging" reality existing independent of socialization.&lt;ref name="kolchin"/&gt; Kolchin agrees that entering a post-racial paradigm might be beneficial for humanity, but he challenges the didactic tone of whiteness studies scholars who single out a white racial identification as negative, while praising a black or Asian self-identification. Scholars in whiteness studies sometimes seriously undermine their arguments by interpreting historical evidence independent of its broader context (e.g., Karen Brodkin’s examination of American anti-semitism largely neglects its roots in European anti-semitism). Finally, Kolchin categorically rejects the argument—common amongst many whiteness scholars—that racism and whiteness are intrinsically and uniquely American, and he expresses concern at the "belief in the moral emptiness of whiteness [...] there is a thin line between saying that whiteness is evil and saying that whites are evil."&lt;ref name="kolchin"/&gt;

[[Theodore W. Allen]], pioneering writer on "white skin privilege" and "white privilege" from the 1960s until his death in 2005, offered a critical review "On Roediger’s Wages of Whiteness" (Revised Edition)].&lt;ref name="Wages" /&gt; He personally put "whiteness" in quotes because he shied away from using the term. As Allen explained, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"it’s an abstract noun, it’s an abstraction, it’s an attribute of some people, it’s not the role they play. And the white race is an actual objective thing. It’s not anthropologic, it’s a historically developed identity of European Americans and Anglo-Americans and so it has to be dealt with. It functions... in this history of ours and it has to be recognized as such. . . .to slough it off under the heading of ‘whiteness,’ to me seems to get away from the basic white race identity trauma."&lt;ref name="Wages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 78 n. 187}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
