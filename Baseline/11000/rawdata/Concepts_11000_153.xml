[[Symbol]]s used in [[astrology]] overlap with those used in [[astronomy]] because of the historical overlap between the two subjects. Frequently used symbols include signs of the [[zodiac]] and for the [[classical planet]]s. These have their origin in medieval Byzantiny, but in their current form are a product of the European [[Renaissance astrology|Renaissance]]. Other symbols for [[astrological aspect]]s are used in various astrological traditions.

==History and origin==

Symbols for the [[classical planet]]s, zodiac signs, aspects, lots, and the lunar nodes appear in the medieval Byzantine codices in which many ancient horoscopes were preserved.&lt;ref name=neugebauer-1975&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original papyri of these Greek horoscopes, there were found a circle with the glyph representing shine([[File:Old symbol for sun.svg|x15px|old sun symbol]]) for the Sun and a crescent for the Moon.&lt;ref name=neugebauer-1987&gt;{{cite book

"It is now possible to trace the medieval symbols for at least four of the five planets to forms that occur in some of the latest papyrus horoscopes ([ [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|P.Oxy.]] ] 4272, 4274, 4275 [...]). That for Jupiter is an obvious monogram derived from the initial letter of the Greek name. Saturn's has a similar derivation [...] but underwent simplification. The ideal form of Mars' symbol is uncertain, and perhaps not related to the later circle with an arrow through it. Mercury's is a stylized caduceus."&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols for Jupiter and Saturn are identified as monograms of the initial letters of the corresponding Greek names, and the symbol for Mercury is a stylized [[caduceus]].&lt;ref name=jones-1999 /&gt; A. S. D. Maunder finds antecedents of the planetary symbols in earlier sources, used to represent the gods associated with the classical planets.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram in Johannes Kamateros' 12th century ''Compendium of Astrology'' shows the Sun represented by the circle with a ray, Jupiter by the letter ''zeta'' (the initial of [[Zeus]], Jupiter's counterpart in [[Greek mythology]]), Mars by a shield crossed by a spear, and the remaining classical planets by symbols resembling the modern ones, without the cross-mark seen in modern versions of the symbols.&lt;ref name=maunder /&gt; The modern sun symbol, pictured as a circle with a dot (☉), first appeared in the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=neugebauer-1987 /&gt;

Symbols for Uranus and Neptune were created shortly after their discovery. For Uranus, two variant symbols are seen. One symbol, [[File:Uranus symbol.svg|15px|Uranus]], invented by [[Johann Gottfried Koehler|J. G. Köhler]] and refined by [[Johann Elert Bode|Bode]], was intended to represent the newly discovered metal [[platinum]]; since platinum, sometimes confused with white gold, was found by chemists mixed with iron, the symbol for platinum combines the alchemical symbols for [[iron]], ♂, and [[gold]], ☉.&lt;ref name=bode-uranus&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another symbol, [[File:Uranus's astrological symbol.svg|15px|Uranus]], was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as "un globe surmonté par la première lettre de votre nom" ("a globe surmounted by the first letter of your name").&lt;ref name="Francisca"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Francisca Herschel|date=1917|title=The meaning of the symbol H+o for the planet Uranus|bibcode=1917Obs....40..306H|work=The Observatory}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2007-08-05--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After Neptune was discovered, the Bureau des Longitudes proposed the name Neptune and the familiar trident for the planet's symbol.&lt;ref name=gould-neptune&gt;{{cite book

The astrological symbols for the first three objects discovered at the beginning of the 19th century —[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[3 Juno|Juno]]—were also created after their discovery. Firstly, they were listed as planets, and half a century later, renamed as Asteroids. Shortly after [[Giuseppe Piazzi]]'s discovery of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], a group of astronomers ratified the name, proposed by the discoverer, and chose the sickle as a symbol of the planet.&lt;ref name=bode-1801&gt;{{cite book

The modern astrological symbol for [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] was created by [[Eleanor Bach]],&lt;ref name=suberic-asteroid&gt;{{cite web

| title = Asteroid Symbols

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bach's symbol for Vesta is a simplified version of other representations of Vesta's altar.&lt;ref name=suberic-asteroid /&gt; The original form of the symbol for Vesta, [[File:Simbolo di Vesta.svg|18px|Vesta]], was created by German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. Olbers, having previously discovered and named one new planet (as the asteroids were then classified), gave Gauss the honor of naming his newest discovery. Gauss decided to name the planet for the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], and also specified that the symbol should be the altar of the goddess with the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|sacred fire]] burning on it.&lt;ref name=mcbeh-v15&gt;{{cite book

[[Pluto]], like Uranus, has multiple symbols in use. One symbol, a [[monogram]] of the letters ''PL'' (which could be interpreted to stand for Pluto or for astronomer [[Percival Lowell]]), was announced with the name of the new planet by the discoverers on May 1, 1930.&lt;ref name=popular-astronomy&gt;{{cite journal

| page = 415
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another symbol, which was popularized in Paul Clancy's astrological publications, is based on the symbol for Mercury, with the circle and arc of Mercury trading positions. This symbol is described by [[Dane Rudhyar]] as "suggest[ing] the planetary character of the Pluto mind by the circle, floating above the open cup."  Although, this meaning is readily debatable due to Blavatskian origins, rather than a properly traditional understanding, such as may be found in the hermetic sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The symbol for the [[centaur (minor planet)|centaur]] [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]], a key with the letter K (for discoverer [[Charles T. Kowal]]) was proposed by astrologer Al Morrison, who presented the symbol as "an inspiration shared amongst Al H. Morrison, Joelle K.D. Mahoney, and Marlene Bassoff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Aspects===
{{further information|Astrological aspects}}
In [[astrology]], an '''aspect''' is an [[angle]] the [[Planets in astrology|planets]] make to each other in the [[horoscope]], also to the [[ascendant]], [[midheaven]], [[descendant (astrology)|descendant]], [[Imum coeli|lower midheaven]], and other points of astrological interest. The following symbols are used to note aspect:&lt;ref name="L217020"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17020r2-fdbk-extra-aspect-sym.pdf|title=L2/17-020R2: Feedback on Extra Aspect Symbols for Astrology|date=2017-01-24|first=Michel|last=Suignard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12023">In [[literary theory]] and [[aesthetics]], '''authorial intent''' refers to an [[author]]'s [[intention|intent]] as it is encoded in his or her [[Work of art|work]]. '''Authorial intentionalism''' is the view, according to which an author's intentions should constrain the ways in which it is properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;A. Huddleston, "The Conversation Argument for Actual Intentionalism", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'' '''52'''(3):241–256 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary theory==
===New Criticism===
{{main|New Criticism}}
[[New Criticism]], as espoused by [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[W. K. Wimsatt]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and others, argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature. Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue in their essay "The Intentional Fallacy" that "the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art".&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimsatt|first=W. K.|last2=Beardsley|first2=M. C.|date=1946|title=The Intentional Fallacy|jstor=27537676|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=54|issue=3|pages=468–488}} Revised and republished in {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Verbal_Icon.html?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC|title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry|date=1954|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813128579|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author, they argue, cannot be reconstructed from a [[writing]]—the text is the primary source of [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]], and any details of the author's desires or life are secondary. Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that even details about the work's composition or the author's intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are "private or idiosyncratic; not a part of the work as a linguistic fact" and are thus secondary to the trained reader's rigorous engagement with the text itself.&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley" /&gt;

Wimsatt and Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry (although their analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art){{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} into three categories:

; Internal (or public) evidence: Internal evidence refers to what is presented within a given work. This internal evidence includes strong familiarity with the conventions of language and literature: it "is discovered through the semantics and syntax of a poem, through our habitual knowledge of the language, through grammars, dictionaries, and all the literature which is the source of dictionaries, in general through all that makes a language and culture". Analyzing a work of art based on internal evidence will not result in the intentional fallacy.
   
; External (or private) evidence: What is not literally contained in the work itself is external to that work, including all private or public statements that the artist has made about the work of art, whether in conversations, letters, journals, or other sources. Evidence of this type is directly concerned with what the artist may have intended to do even or especially when it is not apparent from the work itself. Analyzing a work of art based on external evidence will likely result in the intentional fallacy.

; Intermediate evidence:  The third type of evidence, intermediate evidence, includes "private or semiprivate meanings attached to words or topics by an author or by a coterie of which he is a member." Also included are "the history of words" and "the biography of an author, his use of a word, and the associations which the word had for him." Wimsatt and Beardsley argue for the use of intermediate evidence rather than external evidence in the interpretation of a literary work, but they recognize that these two types of evidence "shade into one another so subtly that it is not always easy to draw a line between" the two.

Thus, a text's internal evidence—the words themselves and their meanings—is open for literary analysis. External evidence—anything not contained within the text itself, such as statements made by the poet about the poem that is being interpreted—does not belong to literary criticism. Preoccupation with the authorial intent "leads away from the poem." According to Wimsatt and Beardsley, a poem does not belong to its author but rather "is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public."

===Psychoanalytic criticism===
{{main|Psychoanalytic literary criticism}}
In [[psychoanalytic criticism]], the author's biography and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] state were seen as part of the text, and therefore the author's intent could be revived from a literary text—although the intent might be an unconscious one.

===Cambridge School Contextualism===
{{main|Cambridge School (intellectual history)}}

The [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge School]] of contextualist [[hermeneutics]], a position most elaborated by [[Quentin Skinner]], in the first instances distinguishes linguistic meaning from speech-acts: that is to say, things which the performance of an utterance ''does''. Consider the following. Typically, the ceremony of marriage concludes upon the exchange of the utterance "I do". In such a case, to utter "I do" is not merely to report an internal disposition, but to perform an action, namely, to ''get'' married. The intended force of "I do" in such a circumstance is only ever retrievable through understanding something about the complex social activity of marriage. Indeed, to understand a speech-act is to understand what conventions are regulating its significance. Since actions are always publicly legible—they are done by the speech itself—this presupposes no knowledge about the author's mental states. The task is always thus: with as much contextual information as possible, can we establish which conventions a text was interacting with, and by inference to the best explanation, what the author's intent was.

===Post-structuralism===
{{main|Post-structuralism}}
In [[post-structuralism]], there are a variety of approaches to authorial intent. For some of the theorists deriving from [[Jacques Lacan]], and in particular theories variously called ''[[écriture féminine]]'', gender and sex predetermine the ways that texts will emerge, and the language of textuality itself will present an argument that is potentially counter to the author's conscious intent.

===Marxist criticism===
{{main|Marxist literary criticism}}
For [[Marxist]] literary theorists, the author's intent is always a code for a particular set of ideologies in the author's own day.  For Marxists (especially those of the [[Soviet realism]] type), authorial intent is manifest in the text and must be placed in a context of liberation and the [[materialist dialectic]].  However, Marxist-derived theorists have seen authorial intent in a much more nuanced way.  [[Raymond Williams]], for example, posits literary productions always within a context of emerging, resistant, and synthetic ideological positions.  The author's intent is recoverable from the text, but there are always encoded within it several separate positions.  The author might be arguing consciously for empire, but hidden within that argument will be a response to a counterargument and a presentation of an emerging synthesis.  Some members of the [[reception theory]] group ([[Hans Robert Jauss]], in particular) have approximated the Marxist view by arguing that the forces of cultural reception reveal the ideological positions of both author and readership.

===Reader response===
{{main|Reader response}}
[[Reader response]] critics view the authorial intent variously.  In general, they have argued that the author's intent itself is immaterial and cannot be fully recovered.  However, the author's intent will shape the text and limit the possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s of a work.  The reader's ''impression'' of the author's intent is a working force in interpretation, but the author's actual intent is not.

===Weak intentionalism===
Weak intentionalism combines intentionalism with insights from reader response. [[Mark Bevir]]  in ''The Logic of the History of Ideas'' sees meanings as necessarily intentional but suggests that the relevant intentions can be those of readers as well as those of authors. Weak intentionalists privilege intentionality to emphasize that texts do not have meanings in themselves. They believe that meanings are always meanings for people—albeit the relevant people, whether authors or readers.

==In textual criticism==
Authorial intention is of great practical concern to some [[textual critic]]s. These are known as intentionalists and are identified with the Bowers-Tanselle school of thought. Their editions have as one of their most important goals the recovery of the author's intentions (generally final intentions). When preparing a work for the press, an editor working along the principles outlined by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] will attempt to construct a text that is close to the author's final intentions. For transcription and typesetting, authorial intentionality can be considered paramount.

An intentionalist editor would constantly investigate the [[document]]s for traces of authorial intention. On one hand, it can be argued that the author always intends whatever the author writes and that at different points in time the same author might have very different intentions. On the other hand, an author may in some cases write something he or she did not intend. For example, an intentionalist would consider for emendation the following cases:

*The authorial manuscript misspells a word: an error in intention, it is usually assumed. Editorial procedures for works available in no 'authorized editions' (and even those are not always exempt) often specify correcting such errors.
*The authorial manuscript presents what appears to be a misformat of the text: a sentence has been left in run-on form. It is assumed that the author might have regretted not beginning a new paragraph, but did not see this problem until afterwards, until rereading.
*The authorial manuscript presents a factual error.

In cases such as these where the author is living, they would be questioned by the editor who would then adhere to the intention expressed. In cases where the author is deceased, an intentionalist would attempt to approach authorial intention. The strongest voices countering an emphasis on authorial intent in scholarly editing have been [[D. F. McKenzie]] and [[Jerome McGann]], proponents of a model that accounts for the "social text," tracing material transformations and embodiments of works while not privileging one version over another.

{{Further|Self deception|Deception}}

[[Image:Othello and Iago.gif|thumb|right|[[Iago]] (right) and Othello from ''[[Othello]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].  Much of the tragedy of the play is brought about by advice Iago gives to Othello in bad faith.]]
'''Bad faith''' ([[Latin]]: ''mala fides'') is double mindedness or double heartedness in [[:wikt:duplicity|duplicity]], [[fraud]], or [[deception]].&lt;ref name=WD1913&gt;''"of two hearts ... a sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by another; bad faith"'', Webster's Dictionary, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; It may involve [[intentionality|intentional]] deceit of others, or [[self-deception]].

The expression "bad faith" is associated with "double heartedness",&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; which is also translated as "double mindedness".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/james/1-8.htm|title=James 1:8 Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P119.113" /&gt; A bad faith belief may be formed through self-deception, being double minded, or "of two minds", which is associated with faith, belief, [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], and [[loyalty]]. In the 1913 ''Webster's Dictionary'', bad faith was equated with being double hearted, "of two hearts", or "a sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by another".&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; The concept is similar to [[perfidy]], or being "without faith", in which deception is achieved when one side in a conflict promises to act in good faith (e.g. by raising a flag of surrender) with the intention of breaking that promise once the enemy has exposed himself. After [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s analysis of the concepts of self-deception and bad faith, bad faith has been examined in specialized fields as it pertains to self-deception as two semi-independently acting minds within one mind, with one deceiving the other.

Some examples of bad faith include: a company representative who negotiates with union workers while having no intent of compromising;&lt;ref name="BFN"&gt;"Bad Faith Negotiation," Union Voice, [http://unitas.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/bad-faith-negotiation/].&lt;/ref&gt; a prosecutor who argues a legal position that he knows to be false;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gershman|first1=Bennett L.|title=Bad Faith Exception to Prosecutorial Immunity for Brady Violations|journal=Pace Law Faculty Publications|date=13 January 2010|url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/635|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insurer who uses language and reasoning which are deliberately misleading in order to deny a claim.&lt;ref name=lar&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Insurance Company Bad Faith Following Car Accidents|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/car-accidents/insurance-bad-faith.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad faith may be viewed in some cases to not involve deception, as in some kinds of [[hypochondria]] with actual physical manifestations. There is a question about the truth or falsity of statements made in bad faith self-deception; for example, if a hypochondriac makes a complaint about their psychosomatic condition, is it true or false?&lt;ref name=PMREN/&gt;

In ordinary usage, bad faith is equated with being of "two hearts", or "a sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by another",&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; and is synonymous with double mindedness, with disloyalty, double dealing, hypocrisy, infidelity, breach of contract, unfaithfulness, pharisaism (emphasizing or observing the letter but not the spirit of the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic |title=Pharisaic dictionary definition - Pharisaic defined |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143857/http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Doctrine of absurdity]]), tartuffery (a show or expression of feelings or beliefs one does not actually hold or possess),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GHCX9Z0p2-gC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;dq=tartuffery+definition+%22A+show+or+expression+of+feelings+or+beliefs+one+does+not+actually+hold+or+possess%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Roget's II|publisher=|isbn=9780425156681|last1=Roget|first1=Peter Mark|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; affectation, bigotry, and lip service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/bad+faith|title=Bad faith Synonyms, Bad faith Antonyms - Thesaurus.com|website=www.thesaurus.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
People may hold beliefs in their minds even though they are directly contradicted by facts. These are beliefs held in bad faith. But there is debate as to whether this self-deception is [[intentional]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;''"intentional structure of bad-faith"'', ''Good Faith and other essays'', Joseph S. Catalano, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', the philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] defined bad faith (French: ''mauvaise foi'') as hiding the truth from oneself.&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness, Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental question about bad faith self-deception is how it is possible.&lt;ref&gt;''"Self Deception and the Nature of Mind"'', ''Tropisms and Reason'', Perspectives on self-deception, Brian P. McLaughlin editor, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=p6Psh4rXKTEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22bad+faith%22+psychology&amp;ots=H2xGSnT0gC&amp;sig=UozPd8c6ijIz4CPyN9FZm5WnAnw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bad%20faith%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a liar to successfully lie to the victim of the lie, the liar must know that what is being said is false. In order to be successful at lying, the victim must believe the lie to be true. When a person is in bad faith self-deception, the person is both the liar and the victim of the lie. So at the same time the liar, as liar, believes the lie to be false, and as victim believes it to be true. So there is a contradiction in that a person in bad faith self-deception believes something to be true and false at the same time.&lt;ref name="Self Deception pp. 207-227"&gt;"Self Deception and Bad Faith", Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P. McLaughlin ed., Alan W. Wood, pp. 207-227&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre observed that "the one to whom the lie is told and the one who lies are one and the same person, which means that I must know the truth in my capacity as deceiver, though it is hidden from me in my capacity as the one deceived", adding that "I must know that truth very precisely, in order to hide it from myself the more carefully—and this not at two different moments of temporality ..."

==In theology==
Various commentators and translators have discussed being of two [[beliefs]] or [[faiths]] in being double hearted or double minded.&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P119.113" /&gt; ''Webster's Dictionary'' equates bad faith with "being of two hearts".&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; "Double hearted" is translated also as "double minded", or "of two hearts" or "of two minds" or souls, two beliefs, [[Attitude (psychology)|two attitudes]], [[loyalty|two loyalties]], [[mind|two thinkings]], [[belief|two beliefs]], or being as [[Soul (spirit)|two souls]] at the same time. The [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]] [[Epistle]]s admonish religious believers not to be double minded. In [[Psalm 119|Psalms&amp;nbsp;119:113]], one translation is "I hate double-minded men, but I love your law."&lt;ref name="P119.113"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/psalms/119-113.htm|title=Psalm 119:113 I hate double-minded people, but I love your law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Living Translation]] emphasises divided loyalty translating the passage as "I hate those with divided loyalties, but I love your instructions."&lt;ref name="P119.113"/&gt;

The [[Epistle of James]] warns against trusting a person that "perpetually [[self deception|disagrees with ''himself'']]".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; "Taking the Lord's name in vain", bad faith justifies actions known to be wrong by claiming a direction from God or religious authority to take unethical positions or untrue beliefs, when a person ''should'' know otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion and Morality," Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/].&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on double mindedness in James&amp;nbsp;1 and its relation to [[hypocrisy]] in Matthew&amp;nbsp;6:22, Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary says "double-minded-literally, 'double-souled', the one soul directed towards God, the other to something else ... It is not a hypocrite that is meant, but a fickle, 'wavering' man, as the context shows".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; [[Henry Alford|Alford's]] translation of the Bible uses the ancient Greek literature's "waverer" to express "double minded".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;

In James 1:8, it denotes instability of a cognitive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], "he is a double-minded man, unstable in attitude". In the [[God's Word Translation]], "a person who has doubts is thinking about two different things at the same time and can't make up his mind about anything".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; [[Young's Literal Translation]] translates this as being "two souled".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; In Clarke's Commentary on the Bible, a double-minded man is one of two souls in that one is for earth, and the other for heaven, wishing to secure both worlds at once.&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; [[John Gill (theologian)|Gill's]] exposition of the Bible refers to asking for one thing and meaning another, honoring in word but not in heart, confused in the mind.&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;

[[Clarke's commentary on the Bible]] commented on Deuteronomy 26:17 and [[Jewish theology]] regarding being double hearted, in that Rabbi Tanchum (fol. 84) remarked, "Behold, the Scripture exhorts the Israelites, and tells them when they pray, that they should not have two hearts, one for the holy blessed God, and one for something else."&lt;ref name="James"&gt;[https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/acc/james-1.html James 1 Commentary.]&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke comments that "James refers to those Jews who were endeavoring to incorporate the law with the Gospel, who were divided in their minds and affections, not willing to give up the Levitical rites, and yet unwilling to renounce the Gospel. Such persons could make no progress in Divine things."&lt;ref name="James" /&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] does not consider everyone with heretical views to have bad faith: for example, people who earnestly seek the truth and lead exemplary lives.&lt;ref&gt;''An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies'', Orlando O. Espín and James B. Nickoloff, p.551, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k85JKr1OXcQC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;lpg=PA551&amp;dq=%22bad+faith%22+Theology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=31M2KNLajc&amp;sig=PKjISREYwlrVOR941GCeTtlbeHs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y4RATbipCo_CsAPN6qyUCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bad%20faith%22&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy, psychology, and psychoanalysis==

===Freudian psychoanalysis===
[[Freudian psychoanalysis]] answers how bad faith self-deception is made possible by postulating an unconscious dimension of our being that is amoral, whereas the [[conscious]] is in fact regulated by morality, law, and custom, accomplished by what Freud calls [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref name="Self Deception pp. 207-227"/&gt; The true desires of the subconscious express themselves as [[wish fulfillment]] in dreams, or as an ethical position unconsciously taken to satisfy the wishes of the unconscious mind.&lt;ref name="Self Deception pp. 207-227"/&gt;

===Ethics, phenomenology, existentialism===
{{Further|Ethics of belief|Authenticity (philosophy)|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
Bad faith [[wish fulfillment]] is central to the [[ethics of belief]], which discusses questions at the intersection of [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], Freudian [[psychoanalysis]], and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Self Deception and the Ethics of Belief'', David Wisdo, Journal of Value Inquiry 91, 339–347, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Irony and the Ethics of Belief'', David Wisdo, SUNY, Albany, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"psychological strategies such as ..."bad faith"... become germane in the ethics of belief", ''Ethics of Belief'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Self Deception Unmasked'', Alfred R. Mele, Princeton, NJ: Princeton, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who is not lying to himself is [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]]. "Authenticity" is being faithful to internal rather than external ideas.

Bad faith in ethics may be when an unethical position is taken as ethical, and justified by appeal to being forced to that belief as an excuse, e.g., by God or by that person's natural disposition due to genetics, even though facts disconfirm that belief and [[honesty]] would require it.&lt;ref&gt;''"... required by honesty, and to hide this from ourselves is 'bad faith'. One form of bad faith is to pretend that there is a God who is giving us our tasks. Another is to pretend that there is a 'human nature' that is doing the same thing"'', ''Religion and Morality'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] plays a role leading to discussions of bad faith. It has a role in ethics by an analysis of the structure of [[Will (philosophy)|will]], valuing, happiness, and care for others (in [[empathy]] and [[sympathy]]). Phenomenologist [[Heidegger]] discussed care, [[conscience]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], moving to "[[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]", which in turn led to the [[feminism]] of [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and existentialism of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], both based on phenomenology's considerations of authenticity and its role in bad faith. Sartre analyzed the logical problem of "bad faith" as it relates to authenticity, and where he developed an ontology of value as produced by willing in [[good faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/|title=Phenomenology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir developed ideas about bad faith into existentialism]]
Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir developed ideas about bad faith into [[Bad faith (existentialism)|existentialism]], using the concepts of bad faith and "authenticity" in the ethics of belief.&lt;ref&gt;''"The 'ethics of belief' refers to a cluster of questions at the intersection of epistemology, philosophy of mind, psychology, and ethics ... central ... is ... bad faith wish-fulfillment ..."'', ''The Ethics of Belief'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Sartre begins his discussion of bad faith by raising the question of how bad faith self-delusion is possible.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt; Sartre calls "bad faith" a kind of project of self-deception. In order to produce excuses, bad faith first takes a third-person stance toward itself. When it becomes necessary to elude this stance it has made of itself, it then adopts the first-person perspective. In neither case can the deception fully succeed. Without these two facets of existence, if [[consciousness]] was unitary and not divisible, as in the indivisible "I" in "[[I think, therefore I am]]", it would be impossible to explain how the very project of self-deception could be possible. The Freudian theory of the unconscious is viewed by Sartre as based on an incoherent view of consciousness, but the project of psychoanalysis as an uncovering of the "fundamental project" of an individual's life is considered to be valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/notes.html|title=Existentialism &gt; Notes (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Existentialist]] philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called the belief that there is something intrinsically good in itself, which is inherent in the world as absolute value and is discoverable by people, the "[[spirit of seriousness]]", which he argued leads to bad faith. He argued that people fall into the spirit of [[seriousness]] because they take their values too seriously, and forget that values are contingent, chosen and assigned subjectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Spirit of Seriousness", The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt; In Sartre's words, "the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] ''givens'',  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of 'desirable' from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution."&lt;ref&gt;Being and Nothingness, Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have proposed answers as to how bad faith self-delusion can be possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Self Deception and Bad Faith", Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P. McLaughlin ed., Alan W. Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

A "tropism" is an action done without conscious thought.&lt;ref&gt;''"action done without cognitive thought"'', Websters Dictionary Online, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tropism]&lt;/ref&gt; While self-deception may be a tropism, not consciously done, it may be guided by "projects" one may set for one's life, such as a desire for personal pleasure, wealth, power, or to get into heaven. For example, a creationist has a project to get into heaven, and a racist with feelings of personal inadequacy may have a project to be superior or to have power over some others. The project may create self-deception without conscious thought, as a tropism creates action without conscious thought. A project may be selfish, and overwhelm reason from facts, though its consequences are not directly intentional. But the project itself may be intentionally sought, and in a selfish way, whence bad faith arises, as a result of selfish or bad intention in choice of project.&lt;ref name="SDNM"&gt;''"Self Deception and the Nature of Mind"'', ''Tropisms and Reason'', Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P.

A [[homunculus]] is a little person (or map of the person) inside a person, and homuncularism is the theory in psychology that there are subsystems of the mind performing different operations; the homuncularist answer to the question as to how bad faith is possible is that one such subunit deceives the other.&lt;ref&gt;''"There is a natural homuncularist response to this surface paradox of self deception. Distinct subsystems that play the distinct role of deceiver and deceived are located within the self deceiver. So no single subject of belief is required to both believe (know) a proposition and not believe (know) it."'', Self Deception and the Nature of Mind, ''"Tropisms and Reason''", ''Perspectives on Self Deception'', Brian P.

Within the [[pseudoscience]] of racial eugenics, bad faith is proposed to be a motivator for self-defensive action against an objectified race of people to justifiably uphold a desire for racial supremacy; e.g., a minority group of whites who believe that blacks are inferior in bad faith to motivate the preservation of their white-race differences, while their faith is motivated in fear of elimination from within a volatile racial environment.&lt;ref&gt;''"... bad faith can be defined as fleeing a displeasing truth for a pleasing falsehood.

===Zen Buddhism===
Persons practicing [[Zen]] claim not to be subject to the "bad faith" in "self-deception", since they do not ''explain'' a motivation for action, as a [[rationalist]] would; a rationalist must rationalize an irrational desire that is actually rooted in the body and the unconscious as if it were not.&lt;ref&gt;''"Japanese Zen Buddhist Philosophy"'', ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical philosophy and the error theory of moral statements===
For philosophers in the Anglo-American [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] tradition statements involving moral values have caused concern because of their similarity to statements about objects and events in the physical world. Compare:
#Littering is commonplace in Chiang Mai
#Littering is wrong

Both have the same grammatical structure, but the way we might verify the first is quite different from the way we might want to verify the second. We can verify the first statement by observations made in the physical world, but, according to [[David Hume]], no amount of physical world observation can verify statements of the second type. Hume's view is summarized as "you can not derive ought from is". Whereas statements of the first type must be true or false, some philosophers have argued that moral statement are neither true nor false. [[Richard M. Hare]], for example, argues that moral statements are in fact imperatives (commands). For him the statement "littering is wrong" means "do not litter", and "do not litter" is neither true nor false.

In sharp contrast to people like Hare, [[J.L. Mackie]] contended that moral statements are false. Mackie's view discomforts [[Crispin Wright]] who says that it "relegates moral discourse to bad faith".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism/ Miller, Alexander ''Realism'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Wright is not saying that all moral statements are bad faith. What he is saying is that if Mackie is correct, and somebody believes that Mackie is correct, then that person will be guilty of bad faith whenever he makes a moral statement.

==In law==
In law, there are inconsistent definitions of bad faith, with one definition much more broad than used in other fields of study discussed in the above sections. ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' equates [[fraud]] with bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;definition of "bad faith", Black's Law Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; But one goes to jail for fraud, and not necessarily for bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;''Rocking Chair Plaza v Brampton'', 1988 29 CPC 2d 82, Duhaime online Legal Dictionary, [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BadFaith.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; The Duhaime online law dictionary similarly defines bad faith broadly as "intent to deceive", and "a person who intentionally tries to deceive or mislead another in order to gain some advantage".&lt;ref name="duhaime1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BadFaith.aspx|title=Bad Faith Definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian labor arbitrator wrote, in one case, that bad faith is related to rationality in reasoning, as it is used in other fields, but is ill-defined in the law.&lt;ref name="duhaime1"/&gt;

{{quote|The concept of bad faith is likely not capable of precise calibration and certainly has not been defined in the same way by all adjudicators. At its core, bad faith implies malice or ''ill will''. A decision made in bad faith is ''grounded, not on a rational connection between the circumstances and the outcome, but on antipathy toward the individual for non-rational reasons'' ... The absence of a rational basis for the decision implies that factors other than those relevant were considered. In that sense, a decision in bad faith is also arbitrary. These comments are not intended to put to rest the debate over the definition of bad faith. Rather, it is to point out that bad faith, which has its core in malice and ill will, at least touches, if not wholly embraces, the related concepts of ''unreasonableness'', discrimination and arbitrariness.}}
What was called "Canada's best judicial definition of 'bad faith{{'"}} by ''Duhaime's Legal Dictionary'' is similarly more consistent with use in other fields discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins v Transport &amp; Allied Worker's Union'', 1991, 6 CPC 3d 206, Newfoundland, Duhaime Legal Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Good faith and its opposite, bad faith, imports a ''subjective state of mind'', the former ''motivated by'' honesty of purpose and the latter by ''ill-will''.}}

Duhaime also refers to another description, "... bad faith refers to a subjective state of mind ... motivated by ill will ... or even ''sinister purposes''."&lt;ref name="duhaime1"/&gt;

The current standard legal definition of "bad faith" in the law of England and Wales is that of Lindsay J in Gromax Plasticulture Ltd. v. Don and Low Nonwovens Ltd: "Plainly it includes dishonesty and, as I would hold, includes also some dealings which fall short of the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the particular area being examined. Parliament has wisely not attempted to explain in detail what is or is not bad faith in this context; how far a dealing must so fall-short in order to amount to bad faith is a matter best left to be adjudged not by some paraphrase by the Courts (which leads to the danger of the Courts then construing not the Act but the paraphrase) but by reference to the words of the Act and upon a regard to all material surrounding circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/1998/316.html|title=Gromax Plasticulture Ltd v.

===Insurance bad faith===
{{Main|Insurance bad faith}}
[[Insurance bad faith]] is a [[tort]] claim that an insured may have against an insurer for its bad acts, e.g. intentionally denying a claim by giving spurious citations of exemptions in the policy to mislead an insured, adjusting the claim in a dishonest manner, failing to quickly process a claim, or other intentional misconduct in claims processing.&lt;ref&gt;"The tort of bad faith in first-party insurance transactions after two decades," Roger C. Henderson, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/arz37&amp;div=64&amp;id=&amp;page=].&lt;/ref&gt; Insurance bad faith has been broadened beyond use in other fields to include total inaction, a refusal to respond to a claim in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bad Faith Claims Address Insurer Violations|url=https://www.ohiobar.org/ForPublic/Resources/LawYouCanUse/Pages/LawYouCanUse-696.aspx|website=Ohio State Bar Association|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts can award [[Punitive damages|punitive or exemplary damages]], over and above actual damages against any insurance company which is found to have adjusted a claim in bad faith; the damages may be awarded with the aim of deterring such behavior among insurers in general, and may far exceed the amount of the damage due under the [[insurance policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Claims Settlement Practices Regulations|url=http://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/130-laws-regs-hearings/05-CCR/fair-claims-regs.cfm|website=California Department of Insurance|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], one case of this type resulted in a record punitive award of [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] $1 million when an [[insurance company]] pressed a claim for [[arson]] even after its own experts and adjusters had come to the conclusion that the fire was accidental; the company was advised by legal counsel that the desperate insured parties would be willing to settle for much less than what they were owed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc18/2002scc18.html|title=CanLII - 2002 SCC 18 (CanLII)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social sciences==

===Feminism===
Central to [[feminism]] is the idea that women are systematically subordinated, and bad faith exists when women surrender their [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] to this subordination, e.g., acceptance of religious beliefs that a man is the dominant party in a marriage by the will of God; Simone de Beauvoir labels such women "mutilated" and "[[immanent]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Look as Bad Faith'', Debra B. Bergoffen, Philosophy Today 36, 3 (1992), 221-227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It argues, with Simone de Beauvoir, that patriarchal marriage is both a perversion of the meaning of the couple and an institution in transition"'', Marriage, Autonomy, and the Feminine Protest'', Hypatia, Volume 14, Number 4, Fall 1999, pp. 18-35, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/hypatia/v014/14.4bergoffen.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"mutilated ... immanent ... ''", ''The Second Sex'', [[Simone de Beauvoir]], H.M. Parshley (Trans), Vintage Press, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"... women are systematically subordinated ... de Beauvoir labels women "mutilated" and "immanent"...  women succumb to 'bad faith' and surrender their agency ...", Feminist Perspectives on the Self, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Simone de Beauvoir developed modern conceptions of bad faith and modern feminism together in her book ''[[The Second Sex]]''.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of justice===
Bad faith is important to the concept of [[original position]] in [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], where mutual commitment of the parties requires that the parties cannot choose and agree to principles in bad faith, in that they have to be able, not just to live with and grudgingly accept, but to sincerely endorse the principles of justice; a party cannot take risks with principles he knows he will have difficulty voluntarily complying with, or they would be making an agreement in bad faith which is ruled out by the conditions of the original position.&lt;ref&gt;''"Rawls ... parties ... cannot choose and agree to principles in 'bad faith' ... have to be able, not just to live with and grudgingly accept, but to sincerely endorse the principles of justice ..."'', ''Original Position'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation theory===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-27106-0001, Paris, Verhandlungen über NATO-Beitritt.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles used an "inherent bad faith" model when negotiating with the Soviet Union in International relations.]]

Bad faith is a concept in [[negotiation theory]] whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.&lt;ref name=BFN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"negotiating in bad faith"'', example of use of "bad faith" from definition in Oxford Online Dictionary, [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bad+faith]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad faith in [[political science]] and [[political psychology]] refers to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of [[information processing]].&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"/&gt; The "[[inherent bad faith model]]" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between U.S. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;''"The 'Inherent Bad Fatih Model' Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger"'', ''Political Psychology'', Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.&lt;ref name="HSP"&gt;''"... the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one's opponent ..."'', ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt; A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are John Foster Dulles' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel's initial position on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].&lt;ref name=HSP/&gt;

===Loyalty and patriotism===
Bad faith is associated with being double minded, or of divided loyalty. (See [[#In theology|theology section above]].)

The philosophy of [[loyalty]] examines unchosen loyalties, e.g., one does not choose one's family or country, but when there is excessive wrongdoing, there is a general unwillingness to question these unchosen loyalties, and this exhibits bad faith as a type of lack of [[integrity]]; once we have such loyalties, we are resistant to their scrutiny and self-defensively discount challenges to them in bad faith.&lt;ref name="PBF"&gt;''"Patriotism as Bad Faith"'',''Ethics'', 115, Simon Keller, pp. 563–92, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/loyalty/|title=Loyalty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of [[patriotism]] (loyalty to one's country) bad faith is hiding from oneself the true source of some of one's patriotic beliefs, such as when one fights for a racist [[totalitarian dictatorship]] against a free and [[egalitarian]] democracy.&lt;ref name=PBF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"This leads her to hide from herself the true source of some of the beliefs involved. This is bad faith."'', Patriotism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/patriotism/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beneficence''' is a concept in [[research ethics]] which states that researchers should have the welfare of the research participant as a goal of any [[clinical trial]] or other research study. The [[antonym]] of this term, '''maleficence''', describes a practice which opposes the welfare of any research participant.

The concept that medical professionals and researchers would always practice beneficence seems natural to most patients and research participants, but in fact, every [[health intervention]] or research intervention has potential to harm the recipient. There are many different precedents in medicine and research for conducting a [[cost–benefit analysis]] and judging whether a certain action would be a sufficient practice of beneficence, and the extent to which treatments are acceptable or unacceptable is under debate.

Despite differences in opinion, there are many concepts on which there is wide agreement. One is that there should be community consensus when determining [[best practices]] for dealing with ethical problems.

==Elements==
These four concepts often arise in discussions about beneficence:
#one should not practice evil or do harm, often stated in [[Latin]] as ''[[Primum non nocere]]''
#one should prevent evil or harm
#one should remove evil or harm
#one should practice good

Ordinary moral discourse and most philosophical systems state that a prohibition on doing harm to others as in #1 is more compelling than any duty to benefit others as in #2–4. This makes the concept of "first do no harm" different from the other aspects of beneficence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=W.D.|title=The Right and the Good|year=1988|publisher=Hackett Pub. Co.|location=Indianapolis|isbn=978-0-87220-058-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example illustrating this concept is the [[trolley problem]].

Morality and ethical theory allows for judging relative costs, so in the case when a harm to be inflicted in violating #1 is negligible and the harm prevented or benefit gained in #2–4 is substantial, then it may be acceptable to cause one harm to gain another benefit. Academic literature discusses different variations of such scenarios. There is no objective evidence which dictates the best course of action when health professionals and researchers disagree about the best course of action for participants except that most people agree that the discussions about ethics should happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert J.|title=Ethics and Regulation of Clinical Research|year=1988|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-04288-7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem==
Some outstanding problems in discussing beneficence occur repeatedly. Researchers often describe these problems in the following categories:

===To what extent should the benefactor suffer harm for the beneficiary?===
Many people share the view that when it is trivial to do so, people should help each other. The situation becomes more complicated when one person can help another by making various degrees of personal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graff|first=James A.|title=Human Acts, an Essay in their Moral Evaluation by Eric D'Arcy, The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1963, 174p. $4.50.|journal=Dialogue|year=1963|volume=3|issue=3|pages=311–2|doi=10.1017/S0012217300035460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===To whom are duties of beneficence owed?===
Researchers should apply the concept of beneficence to individuals within the patient/physician relationship or the research-participant/researcher relationship. However, there is debate about the extent to which the interests of other parties, such as future patients and endangered persons, ought to be considered. When a researcher risks harm to a willing volunteer to do research with the intent to develop knowledge which will better humanity, this may be a practice of beneficence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Ruth R. |last2= Faden |first2= Tom L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22459">'''Biased competition theory''' advocates the idea that each object in the [[visual field]] competes for cortical representation and cognitive processing. &lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that the process of visual processing can be biased by other mental processes such as [[Top-down_and_bottom-up_design|bottom-up]] and [[Top-down_and_bottom-up_design|top-down]]  systems which prioritize certain features of an object or whole items for [[attention]] and further processing.  Biased competition theory is, simply stated, the competition of objects for processing. This competition can be biased, often toward the object that is currently attended in the visual field, or alternatively toward the object most relevant to behavior.

==History==
Research into the subject of attentional mechanisms in regard to visual perception was undertaken as an attempt to better understand the functional principles and potential constraints surrounding visual perception &lt;ref&gt;Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Visual search]] tasks are commonly used by experimenters to aid the exploration of visual perception.
The classical view of visual attention suggests that there are two basic principles: the pre-attentive stage and the attentive stage.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-attentive stage, an individual has an unlimited capacity for perception which is capable of processing information from the entire visual field concurrently. During the attentive stage, the processing of visual information corresponding to local spatial areas takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; This classical view of visual attention suggests that there is no competition within the visual field. Within this theory an individual is assumed to be capable of processing all information provided concurrently. Until recently it was still thought that individuals had a pre-attentive stage. This is no longer the case, research has now suggested that the pre-attentive stage is now limited in its capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The attentive stage of being able to process important information has now transformed into what is known as selectivity. The classical view of attention has built the ground work for the recent emergence of two new principles to benefit the understanding of visual attention. The first of these relates to the limited capacity of [[information processing]]. This suggests that at any given time, only a small amount of information can actually be retained and used to control behaviour. The principle of [[Attention#Selective attention and visual attention|selectivity]] incorporates the notion that a person has the ability to filter out unwanted information.  Koch and Ullman &lt;ref&gt;Koch C, &amp; Ullman S (1985) Shifts in selective visual attention: towards the underlying neural circuitry.  Human Neurobiology 4:219-227.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that attentive selection could be implemented by competitive "winner-takes-all" networks.
Robert Desimone and John Duncan  &lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; expanded on this idea. They proposed that at some point between the visual input of objects and the response to objects in the visual field there is some competition occurring;  competition for representation, analysis, and behavior. This suggests that attention to stimuli makes more demands on processing capacity than unattended stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of competition led researchers to develop a new theory of attention, which they termed the “biased competition theory".&lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory attempts to provide an explanation of the processes leading visual attention and their effects on the brain’s neural systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Biased competition serves to prioritize task relevant information to make visual search more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; A large amount of visual information is taken in at any given moment and there is a limited capacity available for processing. The visual system therefore needs a way to select relevant information and ignore irrelevant stimuli.
A visual search usually has a target (e.g. a coffee cup), which is being searched for (task relevant) in the visual environment, and task irrelevant information is ignored. The biasing from neural mechanisms guides the search to logical spatial locations (e.g. the table) and items that have similar semantic or visual features to the item that is being searched for.
It has been suggested that more than 30 cortical areas in the [[visual system]] are used for the processing of visual stimuli, and that there is competition from objects in the visual field that takes place in multiple areas of this extensive network.&lt;ref&gt;Desimone R, Ungerleider LG. (1989). Neural mechanisms of visual processing in monkeys. In Handbook of Neuropsychology, Vol. 2, ed. F Boller, J Grafman, pp. 267-99. New York: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldauf14&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baldauf D, Desimone R |title=Neural mechanisms of object-based attention |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=344 |issue=6182 |pages=424–427 |date=Mar 2014 |pmid=24763592 |doi=10.1126/science.1247003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Biased Competition Model==
Desimone suggested that the Biased Competition Model comprised five main tenets:&lt;ref&gt;4.	Desimone, R. (1998). Visual attention mediated by biased competition in extrastriate visual cortex. ‘’Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B, 353’’, 1245-1255.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Objects presented simultaneously in the visual field compete for cell responses in the visual cortex. When two stimuli are presented at the same time they will activate their neuronal representations. The responses will be determined by these two stimuli interacting in a competitive manner.
# Two stimuli that activate cells in the same area of the cortex will provide the strongest competitive interactions.
# Competitive interactions have the ability to be biased in preference of one stimulus due to many different neural mechanisms. This is called feedback bias. These may include Top-down feedback (for example, one stimulus may hold more situational relevance) or Bottom-up influences (for example, one stimulus is more novel than another).
# Feedback biasing is not purely the result of spatial location. Biasing during processing can be due to a stimuli possessing specific, relevant feature. Such features may include color, texture, and shape.
# A main source of Top-down biasing derives from the structures in the brain involved with working memory, more specifically, from the [[prefrontal cortex]].

==Neural Mechanisms==
There are two major [[neural pathways]] that process the information in the visual field; the [[ventral stream]] and the [[dorsal stream]]. The two pathways run in parallel and are both working simultaneously. The ventral stream is important for object recognition and often referred to as the “what” system of the brain; it projects to the inferior temporal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Ungerleider, L. G., &amp; Haxby, J. V. (1994). ‘What’ and ‘where’ in the human brain. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 4, 157-165.&lt;/ref&gt; The dorsal stream is important for spatial perception and performance and is referred to as the “where” system &lt;ref&gt;Ungerleider, L. G., &amp; Haxby, J. V. (1994). ‘What’ and ‘where’ in the human brain. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 4, 157-165.&lt;/ref&gt; which projects to the [[posterior parietal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the biased competition theory, an individual’s visual system has limited capacity to process information about multiple objects at any given time. For example, if an individual was presented with two stimuli (objects) and was asked to identify attributes of each object at the same time, the individual’s performance would be worse in comparison to if the objects were presented separately. This suggests multiple objects presented simultaneously in the visual field will compete for neural representation due to limited processing resources.
Single cell recording studies conducted by Kastner and Ungerleider examined the neural mechanisms behind the biased competition theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276.&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment the size of the [[receptive field]]'s (RF) of neurons within the visual cortex were examined. A single visual stimulus was presented alone in a neuron’s RF, followed with another stimulus presented simultaneously within the same RF.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276.&lt;/ref&gt; The single ‘effective’ stimuli produced a low [[firing rate]], whereas the two stimuli presented together produced a high firing rate. The response to the paired stimuli was reduced. This suggests that when two stimuli are presented together within a neuron’s RF, the stimuli are processed in a mutually suppressive manner, rather than being processed independently.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276.&lt;/ref&gt; This suppression process, according to Kastner and Ungerleider, occurs when two stimuli are presented together because they compete for neural representation, due to limited cognitive processing capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276.&lt;/ref&gt;
The RF experiment suggests that as the number of objects increase, the information available for each object will decrease due to increased neural workload (suppression), and decreased cognitive capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276.&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an object in the visual field or RF be efficiently processed, there needs to be a way to bias these neurological resources towards the object. Attention prioritizes task relevant objects, biasing this process. For example, this bias can be towards an object which is currently attended to in the visual field or RF, or towards the object that is most relevant to one’s behavior.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) has shown that biased competition theory can explain the observed attention effects at a neuronal level. Attention effects bias the internal weight (strengthens connections) of task relevant features toward the attended object. This was shown by Reddy,  Kanwisher,  and van Rullen  who found an increase in oxygenated blood to a specific neuron following a locational cue.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, L., Kanwisher, N.G, &amp; VanRullen, R. (2009). Attention and biased competition in multiple voxel object representations. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, 50, 21447-21452.&lt;/ref&gt; Further neurological support comes from [[neurophysiological]] studies which have shown that attention results from Top-down biasing, which in turn influences neuronal spiking.&lt;ref&gt;Deco, G., &amp; Rolls, E.T. (2005). Neurodynamics of biased competition and cooperation for attention: A model with Spiking Neurons. Journal of Neurophysiology, 94, 295-313.&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, external inputs affect the Top-down guidance of attention, which bias specific neurons in the brain.

==Empirical Evidence for Biased Competition Theory==
Since the development of Biased Competition Theory much research has been undertaken to validate the theory’s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, D.M., &amp; Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and Bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‘’Vision Research, 49’’, 1154-1165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldauf14&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baldauf D, Desimone R |title=Neural mechanisms of object-based attention |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=344 |issue=6182 |pages=424–427 |date=Mar 2014 |pmid=24763592 |doi=10.1126/science.1247003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research has formulated predictions based on the theoretical model to be tested in experimental settings. Top-down and Bottom-up biases have been tested in order to ascertain the legitimacy of their influence on visual perception and competition as described by Biased Competition Theory. These experiments provide evidence for the idea of feedback biasing as described in Desimone’s five central tenets.&lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence of Bottom-up Process===
Bottom-up processes are characterized by an absence of higher level direction in sensory processing.  It primarily relies on sensory information and incoming sensory information is the starting point for all Bottom-up processing. Bottom-up refers to when a feature stands out in a visual search. This is commonly called the “pop-out” effect.&lt;ref&gt;Gleitman, H., &amp; Jonides, J. (1978). The effect of set on categorization in visual search. Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 24(4), 361-368.&lt;/ref&gt; Salient features like bright colors, movement and big objects make the object “pop-out” of the visual search. “Pop-out” features can often attract attention without conscious processing. Objects that stand out are often given priority (bias) in processing. Bottom-up processing is data driven, and according to this stimuli are perceived on the basis of the data which is being experienced through the senses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/bottom-up-and-top-down-processing/.&lt;/ref&gt;
Evidence suggests that simultaneously presented stimuli do in fact compete in order to be represented in the [[visual cortex]], with stimuli mutually suppressing each other to gain this representation.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, D.M., &amp; Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‘’Vision Research, 49’’, 1154-1165.&lt;/ref&gt; This was examined by Reynolds and colleagues, who looked at the size of neurons’ receptive field’s within the visual cortex. It was found that the presentation of a single stimulus resulted in a low firing rate while two stimuli presented together resulted in a higher firing rate.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, J. H., Chelazzi, L., &amp; Desimone, R. (1999). Competitive mechanisms subserve attention in macaque areas V2 and V4. Journal of Neuroscience, 19, 1736–1753.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds and colleagues also found that when comparing the neural response of an individually presented visual stimulus to responses gathered from simultaneously presented stimuli, the responses of the concurrent presented stimuli were less than the sum of the responses gathered when each stimuli was presented alone.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, J. H., Chelazzi, L., &amp; Desimone, R. (1999). Competitive mechanisms subserve attention in macaque areas V2 and V4. Journal of Neuroscience, 19, 1736–1753.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that two stimuli presented together increase neural work load required for attention. This increased neural load creates suppressive processes and causes the stimuli to compete for neural representation in the brain.
Proulx and Egeth predicted that brighter objects would bias attention in favor of that object. Another prediction is that larger objects would bias the attention in favor of that object.&lt;ref&gt;Proulx, M.J., &amp; Egeth, H.E. (2008). Biased competition and visual search: the role of luminance and size contrast. Psychological Research, 72, 106-113.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment was a computer-based visual search task, where participants searched for a target among distractions. The results of the study suggested that when irrelevant stimuli were large or bright,  attention was biased towards the irrelevant objects, prioritizing them for cognitive processing.&lt;ref&gt;Proulx, M.J., &amp; Egeth, H.E. (2008). Biased competition and visual search: the role of luminance and size contrast. Psychological Research, 72, 106-113.&lt;/ref&gt; This research shows the effects of Bottom-up (stimulus-driven) processing on biased competition theory.

===Evidence of Top-down Processes===
A Top-down process is characterized by a high level of direction of sensory processing by more cognition; Top-down processing is based on pre-existing knowledge when interpreting sensory information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/bottom-up-and-top-down-processing/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldauf14&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baldauf D, Desimone R |title=Neural mechanisms of object-based attention |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=344 |issue=6182 |pages=424–427 |date=Mar 2014 |pmid=24763592 |doi=10.1126/science.1247003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Top-down guidance of attention refers to when the properties of an object (i.e. color, shape) are activated and held in working memory to facilitate the visual search for that object.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, A., &amp; Luck, S.J. (2009). The role of visual working memory (VWM) in the control of gaze during visual search. Attention, Perception, &amp; psycho physics, 71, 4, 936-949.&lt;/ref&gt; This controls visual search by guiding attention only to objects that could be the target and avoiding attention on irrelevant objects. Top-down processes are not a complete representation of the object but are coarse, which is why objects similar in color, shape or meaning are often attended to in the process of discriminating irrelevant objects. There is evidence that observers have Top-down control over the locations that will benefit from biased competition in spatial selection visual tasks. Evidence supports that observers can make voluntary decision about which locations are selected.&lt;ref&gt;Jonides, J. (1980). Towards a model of the mind’s eye’s movement. Canadian Journal of Psychology, 34, 103–112.&lt;/ref&gt; or features that capture the attention in a stimulus-driven manner.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaley, A., &amp; Nobre, A.C. (2012). Top-down Modulation: Bridging selective attention and working memory. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 16, 2, 129-135.&lt;/ref&gt;
Neurophysiology studies have showed that the neural mechanisms in Top-down processing are also seen in attention and working memory, suggesting Top-down processes play an important role in those functions as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, A., &amp; Luck, S.J. (2009). The role of visual working memory (VWM) in the control of gaze during visual search. Attention, Perception, &amp; psycho physics, 71, 4, 936-949.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Top-down processes can modulate Bottom-up processes by suppressing the “pop-out” features of Bottom-up processing from distracting from the visual search.
fMRI studies have investigated the Top-down and Bottom-up processes involved in biased competition theory.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, D.M., &amp; Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and Bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‘’Vision Research, 49’’, 1154-1165.&lt;/ref&gt; Results of fMRI suggest that both Bottom-up and Top-down processes work in parallel to bias competition.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, D.M., &amp; Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‘’Vision Research, 49’’, 1154-1165.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple studies have shown that stimuli in the visual field suppress each other when presented together, but not when each stimulus is presented alone. Kastner and colleagues also found that directing attention to the specific location of a stimulus reduces the suppressive effect. Increased activity in the visual cortex was also observed; this was the result of Top-down biasing due to the favoring of the attended location.&lt;ref&gt;O’Craven, K. M., Downing, P., &amp; Kanwisher, N. (1999). fMRI evidence for objects as the units of attentional selection. Nature, 401, 584–587.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further Evidence===
Another supposition of Biased Competition Theory, that competition is integrated across multiple systems in the brain (for example, the visual system as well as working memory), is least studied.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, D.M., &amp; Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‘’Vision Research, 49’’, 1154-1165.&lt;/ref&gt; However, empirical evidence has been undertaken to confirm the authenticity of this claim. Studies have shown this integration of differing brain systems by undertaking neuroimaging research. Activation in the middle temporal area, as well as the fusiform face area was seen when subjects were asked to attend to a moving face.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., Pinsk, M., De Weerd, P., Desimone, R., &amp; Ungerleider, L. (1999). Increased activity in human visual cortex during directed attention in the absence of visual stimulation. Neuron. 22, 751-761.&lt;/ref&gt; The middle temporal area is involved in the perception of motion, while the [[fusiform face area]] is involved in facial recognition, showing the integrated systems of the brain in Biased Competition Theory.  Ferrera and Lisberger &lt;ref&gt; Ferrera V.P., &amp; Lisberger S.G. (1995) Attention and target selection for smooth pursuit eye movements.  Journal of Neuroscience 15(11);7472-7484.&lt;/ref&gt; provided evidence for competitive interactions in the selection of targets for smooth pursuit eye movements.

Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|University of Edinburgh]]; instead, he helped to investigate [[marine invertebrates]].

Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=263–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=184, 187}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|both of their theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beddall | first1 = B.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
{{See also|Charles Darwin's education|Darwin-Wedgwood family}}
Charles Robert Darwin was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|The Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Desmond|first=Adrian J.|title=Charles Darwin|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=13 September 2002|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin|access-date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/mount/|title= The Mount House, Shrewsbury, England (Charles Darwin)|author= John H.

He was the grandson of two prominent [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]]: [[Erasmus Darwin]] on his father's side, and [[Josiah Wedgwood]] on his mother's side.

[[File:Charles Darwin 1816.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length portrait of seated boy smiling and looking at the viewer. He has straight mid-brown hair, and wears dark clothes with a large frilly white collar. In his lap he holds a pot of flowering plants| Painting of seven-year-old Charles Darwin in 1816.]]
Both families were largely [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], though the Wedgwoods were adopting [[Anglicanism]]. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a [[Freethought#England and France|freethinker]], had baby Charles [[baptism|baptised]] in November 1809 in the Anglican [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]], but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]] attending the nearby Anglican [[Shrewsbury School]] as a [[boarding school|boarder]].&lt;ref name=skool&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 12–15}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=21 21–25]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] (at the time the best medical school in the UK) with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned [[taxidermy]] in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from [[John Edmonstone]], a freed black slave who had accompanied [[Charles Waterton]] in the South American [[rainforest]].&lt;ref name=eddy&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=48 47–51]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=18–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Darwin's second year at the university he joined the [[Plinian Society]], a student [[natural history|natural-history]] group featuring lively debates in which [[radicalism (historical)#Popular agitation|radical democratic]] students with [[materialism|materialistic]] views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=31–34}} He assisted [[Robert Edmond Grant]]'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of [[marine invertebrates]] in the [[Firth of Forth]], and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in [[oyster]] shells were the eggs of a skate [[leech]]. One day, Grant praised [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]'s [[Lamarckism|evolutionary ideas]]. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=72–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was rather bored by [[Robert Jameson]]'s natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between [[Neptunism]] and [[Plutonism]]. He learned the [[alpha taxonomy|classification]] of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the [[Royal Museum|University Museum]], one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly sent him to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country [[parson]]. As Darwin was unqualified for the ''[[Tripos]]'', he joined the ''ordinary'' degree course in January 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=47–48, 89–91}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[shooting sports|shooting]] to studying. His cousin [[William Darwin Fox]] introduced him to the popular craze for [[beetle]] collecting; Darwin pursued this zealously, getting some of his finds published in [[James Francis Stephens]]' ''Illustrations of British entomology''. He became a close friend and follower of botany professor [[John Stevens Henslow]] and met other leading [[parson-naturalist]]s who saw scientific work as religious [[natural theology]], becoming known to these [[University don|dons]] as "the man who walks with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity''&lt;ref name=dar57&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 73–79}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=59 57–67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1794). In his final examination in January 1831 Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ''ordinary'' degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley's ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' (first published in 1802), which made an [[teleological argument|argument for divine design in nature]], explaining [[adaptation]] as God acting through [[Physical law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref name="syd5-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He read [[John Herschel]]'s new book, ''Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy'' (1831), which described the highest aim of [[natural philosophy]] as understanding such laws through [[inductive reasoning]] based on observation, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal Narrative'' of scientific travels in 1799–1804. Inspired with "a burning zeal" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit [[Tenerife]] with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the [[tropics]]. In preparation, he joined [[Adam Sedgwick]]'s [[geology]] course, then on 4 August travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping [[strata]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=69 67–68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=128–129, 133–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey voyage on HMS ''Beagle''===

After leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a week with student friends at [[Barmouth]], then returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) [[natural history|naturalist]] for a self-funded [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] place on {{HMS|Beagle}} with captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], emphasising that this was a position for a [[gentleman]] rather than "a mere collector". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-105.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 105&amp;nbsp;– Henslow, J.

After delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS ''Beagle'' [[hydrography|surveyed and charted]] coasts.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref name=kix&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=12 ix–xi]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of [[The Voyage of the Beagle|his journal]] for his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting [[marine invertebrates]], but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal.&lt;ref name=fnGal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|title=Darwin's field notes on the Galapagos: 'A little world within itself'|author=Gordon Chancellor|author2=[[Randal Keynes]]|date=October 2006|publisher=[[Darwin Online]]|accessdate=16 September 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qybOGZ?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with [[plankton]] collected in a calm spell.&lt;ref name=kix /&gt;&lt;ref name=plankton&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1925&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=53 21–22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]] in [[Cape Verde]], Darwin found that a white band high in the [[volcanic rock]] cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'', which set out [[uniformitarian]] concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,{{Ref label|B|II|none}} and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=183–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When they reached [[Brazil]], Darwin was delighted by the [[Bahia coastal forests|tropical forest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=73 41–42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but detested the sight of [[slavery]], and disputed this issue with Fitzroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=75 73–74]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey continued to the south in [[Patagonia]]. They stopped at [[Bahía Blanca]], and in cliffs near [[Punta Alta]] Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct [[mammal]]s beside modern seashells, indicating recent [[extinction]] with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known ''[[Megatherium]]'' by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him to be like a giant version of the armour on local [[armadillo]]s. The finds brought great interest when they reached England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 223–235}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=7 7]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k206&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=138 206–209]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On rides with [[gaucho]]s into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and [[anthropology|anthropological]] insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of [[rhea (bird)|rhea]] had separate but overlapping territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 189–192, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as [[raised beach]]es showing a series of elevations. He read Lyell's second volume and accepted its view of "centres of creation" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell's ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 131, 159}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=16 174–179]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HurrahChiloe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|title=Darwin Online: 'Hurrah Chiloe': an introduction to the Port Desire Notebook|accessdate=24 October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qzBb03?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Fuegians on board had been seized during the [[HMS Beagle#First voyage|first ''Beagle'' voyage]], then during a year in England were educated as missionaries. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at [[Tierra del Fuego]] he met "miserable, degraded savages", as different as wild from domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=218 205–208]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with [[Monogenism|a shared origin]] and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 243–244, 248–250, 382–383}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named [[Jemmy Button]] lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=258 226–227]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin experienced [[1835 Concepción earthquake|an earthquake in Chile]] and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including [[mussel]]-beds stranded above high tide. High in the [[Andes]] he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, [[island|oceanic islands]] sank, and [[coral reef]]s round them grew to form [[atoll]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 160–168, 182}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=278 260]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atolls&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=100 p 98–99]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the geologically new [[Galápagos Islands]], Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older "centre of creation", and found [[mockingbird]]s allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island. He heard that slight variations in the shape of [[tortoise]] shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food.&lt;ref name=k356&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=388 356–357]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulloway|1982|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the [[marsupial]] [[Potoridae|rat-kangaroo]] and the [[platypus]] seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work.&lt;ref name=Crows&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|title=Darwin Online: Coccatoos &amp; Crows: An introduction to the Sydney Notebook|accessdate=2 January 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114015611/http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|archivedate=14 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found the [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] "good-humoured &amp; pleasant", and noted their depletion by European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=430 398–399].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FitzRoy investigated how the atolls of the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] had formed, and the survey supported Darwin's theorising.&lt;ref name=atolls /&gt; FitzRoy began writing the official ''Narrative'' of the ''Beagle'' voyages, and after reading Darwin's diary he proposed incorporating it into the account.&lt;ref name=Letter301&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-301.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 301&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.R. to Darwin, C.S., 29 Apr 1836|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qzmWSB?url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-301|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal]]'' was eventually rewritten as a separate third volume, on natural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p= 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cape Town]], Darwin and FitzRoy met [[John Herschel]], who had recently written to Lyell praising his [[uniformitarianism]] as opening bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others" as "a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".&lt;ref name=Rascals&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=21 197]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When organising his notes as the ship sailed home, Darwin wrote that, if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the [[Falkland Islands wolf|Falkland Islands fox]] were correct, "such facts undermine the stability of Species", then cautiously added "would" before "undermine".&lt;ref name=xix&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=22 xix–xx]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that such facts "seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=16 p. 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inception of Darwin's evolutionary theory===

When the ship reached [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], on 2 October 1836, Darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles as in December 1835 [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_LettersOnGeology.html editorial introduction]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin visited his home in Shrewsbury and saw relatives, then hurried to [[Cambridge]] to see Henslow, who advised him on finding naturalists available to catalogue the collections and agreed to take on the botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded [[gentleman scientist]], and an excited Darwin went round the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections. Zoologists had a huge backlog of work, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]] eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist [[Richard Owen]], who had the facilities of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct [[ground sloth]]s as well as the ''[[Megatherium]]'', a near complete skeleton of the unknown ''[[Scelidotherium]]'' and a [[hippopotamus]]-sized [[rodent]]-like skull named ''[[Toxodon]]'' resembling a giant [[capybara]]. The armour fragments were actually from ''[[Glyptodon]]'', a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1840|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=26 16], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=83 73], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=116 106]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k206 /&gt; These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 201–205}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=349–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-December, Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to organise work on his collections and rewrite his ''Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=345–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his first paper, showing that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and with Lyell's enthusiastic backing read it to the [[Geological Society of London]] on 4 January 1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]. The ornithologist [[John Gould]] soon announced that the Galapagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of [[Common blackbird|blackbirds]], "[[Grosbeak|gros-beaks]]" and [[finch]]es, were, in fact, twelve [[Darwin's finches|separate species of finches]]. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 207–210}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of scientists and [[expert]]s such as [[Charles Babbage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-346.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 346&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

Darwin stayed with his [[freethought|freethinking]] brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]], part of this [[British Whig Party|Whig]] circle and a close friend of the writer [[Harriet Martineau]], who promoted [[Malthusianism]] underlying the controversial Whig [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law reforms]] to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] implications of [[transmutation of species]], promoted by [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]] and younger surgeons influenced by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy]]. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=201, 212–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in [[John Herschel]]'s letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a [[Physical law|natural cause]] of the origin of new species.&lt;ref name=Rascals /&gt;

Gould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos [[mockingbird]]s from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a "[[wren]]" was also [[Warbler-finch|in the finch group]]. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=9, 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[rhea (bird)|rheas]] were also distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=360}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1643&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1|title=Darwin, C.

By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his ''Red Notebook'' on the possibility that "one species does change into another" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange ''[[Macrauchenia]]'', which resembled a giant [[guanaco]]. His thoughts on lifespan, [[asexual reproduction]] and [[sexual reproduction]] developed in his "B" notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring "to adapt &amp; alter the race to ''changing'' world" explaining the [[Galápagos tortoise]]s, mockingbirds and rheas. He sketched branching descent, then a [[genealogy|genealogical]] branching of a single [[tree of life (science)|evolutionary tree]], in which "It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another", discarding Lamarck's independent [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]] progressing to higher forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1980|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1583e&amp;pageseq=9 7–10]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=44}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1837|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&amp;pageseq=1 1–13, 26, 36, 74]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=229–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While developing this intensive study of [[transmutation of species|transmutation]], Darwin became mired in more work. Still rewriting his ''Journal'', he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow's help obtained a Treasury grant of [[pound sterling|£]]1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]'', a sum equivalent to about £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|1000|1837|r=-3}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-2}}.{{inflation-fn|UK}} He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=367–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Victorian era]] began, Darwin pressed on with writing his ''Journal'', and in August 1837 began correcting [[Galley proof|printer's proofs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=21 xix]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's health suffered under the pressure. On 20 September he had "an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart", so his doctors urged him to "knock off all work" and live in the country for a few weeks. After visiting Shrewsbury he joined his Wedgwood relatives at [[Maer Hall]], Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]], nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. His uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah]] pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under [[loam]] and suggested that this might have been the work of [[earthworm]]s, inspiring "a new &amp; important theory" on their role in [[pedogenesis|soil formation]], which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233–234}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 404&amp;nbsp;– Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838|accessdate=23 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629192234/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|archivedate=29 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Whewell]] pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society. After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233–236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the grind of writing and editing the ''Beagle'' reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience such as farmers and [[pigeon keeping|pigeon fanciers]].&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241–244, 426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an [[orangutan]] in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She smiles pleasantly and is wearing an open necked blouse with a large shawl pulled over her arms|Darwin chose to marry his cousin, [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]].]]
The strain took a toll, and by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe [[boil]]s, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of [[Charles Darwin's illness|Darwin's illness]] remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 252, 476, 531}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=119 115]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June, he took a break and went "geologising" in Scotland. He visited [[Glen Roy]] in glorious weather to see the parallel "roads" cut into the hillsides at three heights. He later published his view that these were marine [[raised beach]]es, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a [[proglacial lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 254}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=377–378}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=86 84]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed ''"Marry"'' and ''"Not Marry"''. Advantages included "constant companion and a friend in old age&amp;nbsp;... better than a dog anyhow", against points such as "less money for books" and "terrible loss of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=238 232–233]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having decided in favour, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit Emma on 29 July. He did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=256–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malthus and natural selection====
Continuing his research in London, Darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', and on 28 September 1838 he noted its assertion that human "population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio", a [[geometric progression]] so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. Darwin was well prepared to compare this to [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]]'s "warring of the species" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the "final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, &amp; adapt it to changes", so that "One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref name="134e"&gt;{{cite web | title = Darwin transmutation notebook D pp. 134e–135e | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&amp;pageseq=112 | accessdate = 4 June 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120718105154/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&amp;pageseq=112 | archivedate = 18 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in the formation of new species.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 264–265}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 385–388}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1556&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=39 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he later wrote in his ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|Autobiography]]''''':'''

{{Quote|In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work..."&lt;ref name="autobio 120"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=124 120]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By mid December, Darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in [[selective breeding]], and a Malthusian Nature selecting from chance variants so that "every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=63 |title=Darwin transmutation notebook E p. 75 |accessdate=17 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628082830/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=63 |archivedate=28 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking this comparison "a beautiful part of my theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=61|title=Darwin transmutation notebook E p. 71|accessdate=17 March 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628080656/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=61|archivedate=28 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later called his theory [[natural selection]], an analogy with what he termed the [[artificial selection]] of selective breeding.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;

On 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, also expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=Belief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/130/125/|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Belief: historical essay|accessdate=25 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225124103/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/130/125/ |archivedate=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking "So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you." He found what they called "Macaw Cottage" (because of its gaudy interiors) in [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], then moved his "museum" in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1839|elected a Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).&lt;ref name=frs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 272–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, Darwin and Emma Wedgwood were married at Maer in an Anglican ceremony arranged to suit the Unitarians, then immediately caught the train to London and their new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When FitzRoy's ''Narrative'' was published in May 1839, Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal and Remarks]]'' was such a success as the third volume that later that year it was published on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=39003&amp;pageno=32 p. 32.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to [[Charles Lyell]], who noted that his ally "denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]'' on his theory of [[atoll]] formation was published in May 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first "pencil sketch" of his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=292–293}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1556&amp;pageseq=18 xvi–xvii]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural [[Down House]] in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=118 114]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], writing with melodramatic humour "it is like confessing a murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=7 183–184]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-729.html#back-mark-729.f6|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 729&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

By July, Darwin had expanded his "sketch" into a 230-page "Essay", to be expanded with his research results if he died prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|p= 188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the anonymously published sensational best-seller ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' brought wide interest in transmutation.

Darwin completed his third geological book in 1846. He now renewed a fascination and expertise in [[marine invertebrates]], dating back to his student days with [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]], by dissecting and classifying the [[barnacle]]s he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Hooker read the "Essay" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin's opposition to continuing acts of [[creation myth|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 320–323, 339–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. [[James Manby Gully|James Gully]]'s [[Great Malvern|Malvern]] spa and was surprised to find some benefit from [[hydrotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-1236.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 1236&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

In eight years of work on [[barnacle]]s (Cirripedia), Darwin's theory helped him to find "[[homology (biology)|homologies]]" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some [[genus|genera]] he found minute males [[parasitism|parasitic]] on [[hermaphrodite]]s, showing an [[Androdioecy|intermediate stage]] in evolution of [[Gonochorism|distinct sexes]].&lt;ref name=barlowbio117&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=121 117–118]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, it earned him the [[Royal Society]]'s Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a [[biology|biologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 383–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 he became a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London]], gaining postal access to its library.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2007|pp=107, 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to "diversified places in the economy of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 419–420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication of the theory of natural selection===

By the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and [[seed]]s could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was firmly against the transmutation of species. [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a "big book on species" titled ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]'', which was to include his "note on Man". He continued his researches, [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|obtaining information]] and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in [[Borneo]]. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; "Theory applied to Races of Man", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of ''Natural Selection'', which omitted [[human evolution|human origins]] and [[sexual selection]]. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, "so surrounded with prejudices", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that "I go much further than you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 412–441, 457–458, 462–463}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=283–284, 290–292, 295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection. Shocked that he had been "forestalled", Darwin sent it on that day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace,&lt;ref&gt;Ball, P. (2011).

His family was in crisis with children in the village dying of [[scarlet fever]], and he put matters in the hands of his friends. After some discussion, Lyell and Hooker decided on a joint presentation at the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] on 1 July of ''[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection]]''. On the evening of 28 June, Darwin's baby son died of scarlet fever after almost a week of severe illness, and he was too distraught to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 466–470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was little immediate attention to this announcement of the theory; the president of the Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=40–42, 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to recall it later; Professor [[Samuel Haughton]] of Dublin claimed that "all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=126 122]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his "big book", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends. Lyell arranged to have it published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 374–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 477}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Darwin set out "one long argument" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=477 p 459]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making the case for [[common descent]], he included evidence of [[Homology (biology)|homologies]] between humans and other mammals.{{sfn|van Wyhe|2008}}{{Ref label|C|III|none}} Having outlined [[sexual selection]], he hinted that it could explain differences between [[Race (human categorization)|human races]].&lt;ref name=SS_man&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=217&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 199]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | p=199}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|1}} He avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref name="light on man"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=506 488]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | pp=199, 488}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|2}} His theory is simply stated in the introduction:
{{quotation|As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be ''naturally selected''. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=20 p 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the end of the book he concluded that:
{{quotation|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=508 p 492]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last word was the only variant of "evolved" in the first five editions of the book. "[[Evolutionism]]" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with [[Prenatal development (biology)|embryological development]], and Darwin first used the word [[evolution]] in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of ''The Origin of Species''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=59}}, {{harvnb|Freeman|1977|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=80&amp;itemID=A1&amp;viewtype=text 79–80]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Reaction to On the Origin of Species}}
The book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|corresponded on it]] with colleagues worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=103–104, 379}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,&lt;ref name="light on man" /&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|3}} but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radick|2013|pp=174–175}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|Kettlewell|1965|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first review asked, "If a monkey has become a man–what may not a man become?" and said it should be left to theologians as it was too dangerous for ordinary readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=87}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Leifchild|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst early favourable responses, Huxley's reviews swiped at [[Richard Owen]], leader of the scientific establishment Huxley was trying to overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=477–491}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Owen's review attacked Darwin's friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. [[Patrick Matthew]] drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=158, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]]'s response was mixed. Darwin's old Cambridge tutors [[Adam Sedgwick|Sedgwick]] and [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] dismissed the ideas, but [[liberal Christianity|liberal clergymen]] interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] seeing it as "just as noble a conception of Deity".&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/|title=Darwin and design: historical essay|year=2007|publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project|accessdate=17 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615191012/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/ |archivedate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted [[clergy|clerical]] attention from Darwin, with its ideas including [[higher criticism]] attacked by church authorities as [[heresy]]. In it, [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that [[miracle]]s broke God's laws, so belief in them was [[atheism|atheistic]], and praised "Mr Darwin's masterly volume &amp;#91;supporting&amp;#93; the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 487–488, 500}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asa Gray]] discussed [[teleology]] with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on [[theistic evolution]], ''Natural Selection is not inconsistent with [[natural theology]]''.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt;&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{Harvnb|Miles|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous confrontation was at the public [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]] during a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], where the [[Bishop of Oxford]] [[Samuel Wilberforce]], though not opposed to [[transmutation of species]], argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] argued strongly for Darwin, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]]'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even Darwin's close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education,&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt; aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen's claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate [[order (biology)|biological order]] from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the "[[Great Hippocampus Question]]", and discredited Owen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=156–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darwinism]] became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863 [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]]'s ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley's ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then ''[[The Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'' by [[Henry Walter Bates]] provided empirical evidence of natural selection.&lt;ref name=B217&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=217–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]], awarded on 3 November 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4652.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 4652&amp;nbsp;– Falconer, Hugh to Darwin, C.

The ''Origin of Species'' was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the "working men" who flocked to Huxley's lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=507–508}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=128–129, 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's theory also resonated with various movements at the time{{Ref label|E|V|none}} and became a key fixture of popular culture.{{Ref label|F|VI|none}} Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way.

Despite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life, Darwin's work continued. Having published ''On the Origin of Species'' as an [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his "big book". He covered [[human evolution|human descent]] from earlier animals including evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.

Enquiries about insect [[pollination]] led in 1861 to novel studies of wild [[orchid]]s, showing adaptation of their flowers to [[Pollination syndrome|attract specific moths]] to each species and ensure [[heterosis|cross fertilisation]]. In 1862 ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of [[vine|climbing plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=50–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admiring visitors included [[Ernst Haeckel]], a zealous proponent of ''Darwinismus'' incorporating [[Lamarckism]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605110511/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-14 |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Cambridge University Press.

Darwin's book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' (1868) was the first part of his planned "big book", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of [[pangenesis]] attempting to explain [[heredity]]. It sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages. He wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freeman|1977|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A1&amp;pageseq=123 122]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] had already popularised human prehistory, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] had shown that anatomically humans are apes.&lt;ref name=B217 /&gt; With ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'' published in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented [[sexual selection]] to explain impractical animal features such as the [[peacock]]'s plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural [[Race (human categorization)|racial classification]], while emphasising that humans are all one species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;pageseq=402 385–405]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=339–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research using images was expanded in his 1872 book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the [[evolutionary psychology|evolution of human psychology]] and its continuity with the [[ethology|behaviour of animals]]. Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that "everybody is talking about it without being shocked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=359–369}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=145 133]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusion was "that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system–with all these exalted powers–Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=422 405]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on Orchids, ''[[Insectivorous Plants (book)|Insectivorous Plants]], [[The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom]]'', different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]''. His botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including [[Grant Allen]] and [[H. G. Wells]], and [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=10359900&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0007087416000352 helped transform plant science] in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

Portrait by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]].]]
By the time of his death, Darwin had convinced most scientists that [[evolution]] as [[common descent|descent with modification]] was correct, and he was regarded as a great scientist who had revolutionised ideas. In June 1909, though few at that time agreed with his view that "natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification", he was honoured by more than 400 officials and scientists from across the world who met in [[Cambridge]] to [[Darwin Day|commemorate his centenary]] and the fiftieth anniversary of ''On the Origin of Species''.&lt;ref name=b222&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=222–225}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F391&amp;pageseq=449 421]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the beginning of the 20th century, a period that has been called "[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms, which eventually proved untenable.

During Darwin's lifetime, many geographical features were given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the [[Beagle Channel]] was named ''[[Darwin Sound]]'' by [[Robert FitzRoy]] after Darwin's prompt action, along with two or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing [[glacier]] caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F10.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=267 216–8]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nearby [[Mount Darwin (Andes)|Mount Darwin]] in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/timeline/time_04.html Darwin's Timeline]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''[[HMS Beagle|Beagle]]'' was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend [[John Lort Stokes]] sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain [[John Clements Wickham|Wickham]] named ''[[Port Darwin]]'': a nearby settlement was renamed [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=NTDoPaI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipe.nt.gov.au/whatwedo/landinformation/place/origins/palmdarwin.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918153343/http://www.ipe.nt.gov.au/whatwedo/landinformation/place/origins/palmdarwin.html|archivedate=18 September 2006|title=Territory origins| accessdate=15 December 2006|publisher=Northern Territory Department of Planning and Infrastructure, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's work has continued to be celebrated by numerous publications and events. The [[Linnean Society of London]] has commemorated Darwin's achievements by the award of the [[Darwin–Wallace Medal]] since 1908. [[Darwin Day]] has become an annual celebration, and in 2009 worldwide events were arranged for the bicentenary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of ''On the Origin of Species''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n01/steven-shapin/the-darwin-show |title=The Darwin Show |first=Steven |last=Shapin |authorlink=Steven Shapin |date=7 January 2010 |publisher=[[London Review of Books]] |quote= |accessdate=25 January 2010 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229113315/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n01/steven-shapin/the-darwin-show |archivedate=29 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and [[Anne Darwin|Annie]]'s death at the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly attentive to his children.&lt;ref name=whowas /&gt; Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from [[inbreeding]] due to the close family ties he shared with his [[cousin marriage|wife and cousin]], Emma Wedgwood. He examined this topic in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of crossing amongst many organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=447}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers (see [[Darwin&amp;nbsp;– Wedgwood family|Darwin-Wedgwood family]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/darwin/Children.html Darwin's Children]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views and opinions==

===Religious views===
{{Details|Religious views of Charles Darwin}}
[[File:Annie Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length studio photo of seated girl about nine years old, looking slightly plump and rather solemn, in a striped dress, holding a basket of flowers on her lap.|In 1851 Darwin was devastated when his daughter [[Anne Darwin|Annie]] died. By then his faith in Christianity had dwindled, and he had stopped going to church.&lt;ref name=jvw41&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Darwin's family tradition was [[nonconformist]] [[Unitarianism]], while his father and grandfather were [[freethought|freethinkers]], and his [[baptism]] and [[boarding school]] were [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name=skool /&gt; When going to Cambridge to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman, he did not doubt the [[Biblical inerrancy|literal truth]] of the Bible.&lt;ref name=dar57 /&gt; He learned [[John Herschel]]'s science which, like [[William Paley]]'s [[natural theology]], sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw [[adaptation]] of species as [[teleological argument|evidence of design]].&lt;ref name="syd5-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=db /&gt; On board HMS ''Beagle'', Darwin was quite [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] and would quote the Bible as an authority on [[morality]].&lt;ref name=biorelig&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=87 85–96]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He looked for "centres of creation" to explain distribution,&lt;ref name=k356 /&gt; and suggested that the very similar [[antlion]]s found in Australia and England evidence of a divine hand.&lt;ref name=Crows /&gt;

By his return, he was [[Historical criticism|critical of the Bible as history]], and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid.&lt;ref name=biorelig /&gt; In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the [[transmutation of species]], he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife [[Emma Darwin|Emma]], whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning.&lt;ref name=Belief /&gt; The [[theodicy]] of Paley and [[Thomas Malthus]] vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=8–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the [[ichneumon wasp]] paralysing [[caterpillar]]s as live food for its eggs.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt; He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and ''On the Origin of Species'' reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a [[tribe|tribal]] survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of [[deism|God as an ultimate lawgiver]]. He was increasingly troubled by the [[problem of evil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=4–5, 12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin remained close friends with the [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] of Downe, [[John Brodie Innes]], and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/darwin-and-church |title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Darwin and the church: historical essay |accessdate=26 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128133709/https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/darwin-and-church |archivedate=28 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but from around 1849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church.&lt;ref name=jvw41 /&gt; He considered it "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist"&lt;ref name=Fordyce&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html Letter 12041] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107174817/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html |date=7 November 2009 }}&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

The "[[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope Story]]", published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed. The claims were repudiated by Darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2005}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Yates|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human society===
Darwin's views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. He grew up in a family of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported [[Reform Act 1832|electoral reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation of slaves]]. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave [[John Edmonstone]], who he long recalled as "a very pleasant and intelligent man", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the ''Beagle'' voyage.{{sfn|Browne|1995|pp=196–198, 240}} These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans. British society became more racist in mid century,&lt;ref name=eddy /&gt; but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species", and against ill-treatment of native people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkins|2008|pp=408–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|G|VII|none}} Darwins interaction with [[Yaghan]]s (Fuegians) such as [[Jemmy Button]] during the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle]] had a profound impact on his view of primitive peoples. At his arrival to [[Tierra del Fuego]] he made a colorful description of "[[Fuegian]] savages".&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018/&gt; This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail. By studying the Yaghans Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans.&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rozzi |first1=Ricardo|author-link=Ricardo Rozzi |date=2018 |title=Transformaciones del pensamiento de Darwin en cabo de hornos: Un legado para la ciencia y la etica ambiental|trans-title=Transformations of Darwin’s thought in cape horn: A legacy for science and environmental ethics |url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-22442018000100267&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=es|language=Spanish |journal=[[Magallania]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages= |doi=10.4067/S0718-22442018000100267 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While interested in Yaghan culture Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]] detailing 32-thousand words.&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018/&gt;

He valued European civilisation and saw colonisation as spreading its benefits, with the sad but inevitable effect that savage peoples who did not become civilised faced extinction. Darwin's theories presented this as natural, and were cited to promote policies that went against his humanitarian principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tony|last=Barta|title=Mr Darwin's shooters: on natural selection and the naturalizing of genocide|url= http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a713721865&amp;fulltext=713240928|work=Patterns of Prejudice, Volume 39, Issue 2 |publisher=Routledge |pages=116–137 |doi=10.1080/00313220500106170 |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He thought men's eminence over women was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] in her 1875 book ''[[The Sexes Throughout Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Vandermassen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vandermassen, Griet |title=Sexual Selection: A Tale of Male Bias and Feminist Denial |url=http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9 |journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |year=2004 |volume=11 |issue=9 |doi=10.1177/1350506804039812 |accessdate=24 November 2009 |pages=11–13 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012141736/http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9 |archivedate=12 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was intrigued by his [[Cousin#Additional terms|half-cousin]] [[Francis Galton]]'s argument, introduced in 1865, that [[Historiometry|statistical analysis]] of [[heredity]] showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, "the noblest part of our nature", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a "caste" of "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it "the sole feasible, yet I fear [[utopian]], plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=556–557, 572, 598}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=180 167–173], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;pageseq=419 402–403]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|title=Correspondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin|accessdate=8 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102150434/http://galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|archivedate=2 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Galton named this field of study "[[eugenics]]" in 1883.{{Ref label|H|VIII|1}}

==Evolutionary social movements==
[[File:VanityFair-Darwin2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Full length portrait of a very thin white bearded Darwin, seated but leaning eagerly forward and smiling.|[[Caricatures of Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory in 19th-century England|Caricature of Darwin]] from 1871 ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'']]
{{Further|Darwinism|Eugenics|Social Darwinism}}
Darwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.

[[Thomas Malthus]] had argued that [[Malthusian catastrophe|population growth beyond resources]] was ordained by God to get humans to [[Protestant work ethic|work productively]] and show restraint in getting families, this was used in the 1830s to justify [[workhouse]]s and [[laissez-faire economics]].&lt;ref name=wm&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkins|1997}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and [[Herbert Spencer]]'s 1851 book ''Social Statics'' based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sweet|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the ''Origin'' was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term ''[[Darwinism]]'' was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's "[[survival of the fittest]]" as free-market progress, and [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[polygenism|polygenistic]] ideas of [[Ernst Haeckel#Polygenism and racial theory|human development]]. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat dog capitalism, [[colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included "dependence of one being on another"; thus [[pacifism|pacifists]], socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2003|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bannister|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in "positive eugenics". During the "[[Eclipse of Darwinism]]", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. Negative eugenics to remove the "feebleminded" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and [[eugenics in the United States]] introduced [[compulsory sterilization]] laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, [[Nazi eugenics]] brought the field into disrepute.{{Ref label|H|VIII|2}}

The term "[[Social Darwinism]]" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by [[Richard Hofstadter]] to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like [[William Graham Sumner]] who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2003}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Kotzin|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wm /&gt;

==Works==
{{details|Charles Darwin bibliography}}

Darwin was a prolific writer. Even without publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of [[coral atoll]]s, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on [[barnacle]]s. While ''On the Origin of Species'' dominates perceptions of his work, ''The Descent of Man'' and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' had considerable impact, and his books on plants including ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]'' were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on ''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balfour|1882}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Anonymous|1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Brummitt|first = R.

'''{{small|I}}.''' {{Note label|A|I|none}} Darwin was eminent as a [[naturalist]], geologist, [[biologist]], and author. After working as a physician's assistant and two years as a [[medical student]], he was educated as a clergyman; he was also trained in [[taxidermy]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|Browne|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|II}}.''' {{Note label|B|II|none}} [[Robert FitzRoy]] was to become known after the voyage for [[biblical literalism]], but at this time he had considerable interest in Lyell's ideas, and they met before the voyage when Lyell asked for observations to be made in South America. FitzRoy's diary during the ascent of the River Santa Cruz in [[Patagonia]] recorded his opinion that the plains were [[raised beach]]es, but on return, newly married to a very religious lady, he recanted these ideas.{{Harv|Browne|1995|pp=186, 414}}

'''{{small|III}}.''' {{Note label|C|III|none}} In the section [[Morphology (biology)|"Morphology"]] of Chapter XIII of ''On the Origin of Species'', Darwin commented on [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] bone patterns between humans and other mammals, writing: "What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=452&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 434]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the concluding chapter: "The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse … at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=497&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 479]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|IV}}.''' {{Note label|D|IV|1}}{{Note label|D|IV|2}}{{Note label|D|IV|3}}
In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' Darwin mentioned [[human evolution|human origins]] in his concluding remark that "In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref name="light on man" /&gt;

In "Chapter VI: Difficulties on Theory" he referred to [[sexual selection]]: "I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous."&lt;ref name=SS_man /&gt;

In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' of 1871, Darwin discussed the first passage:
"During many years I collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=14&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: "it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1874|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=13&amp;itemID=F944&amp;viewtype=text vi]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|V}}.''' {{Note label|E|V|none}} See, for example, WILLA volume 4, ''[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall95/DeSimone.html Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Feminization of Education]'' by Deborah M. De Simone: "Gilman shared many basic educational ideas with the generation of thinkers who matured during the period of "intellectual chaos" caused by Darwin's Origin of the Species. Marked by the belief that individuals can direct human and social evolution, many progressives came to view education as the panacea for advancing social progress and for solving such problems as urbanisation, poverty, or immigration."

'''{{small|VI}}.''' {{Note label|F|VI|none}} See, for example, the song "A lady fair of lineage high" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Princess Ida]]'', which describes the descent of man (but not woman!) from apes.

'''{{small|VII}}.''' {{Note label|G|VII|none}} Darwin's belief that black people had the same essential humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from [[John Edmonstone]] in 1826.&lt;ref name=eddy /&gt; Early in the ''Beagle'' voyage, Darwin nearly lost his position on the ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. {{Harv|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=76 74]}} He wrote home about "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." {{harv|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=264 246]}} Regarding [[Fuegians]], he "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like [[Jemmy Button]]: "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here."{{Harv|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=218 205, 207–208]}}

In the ''Descent of Man'', he mentioned the similarity of Fuegians' and Edmonstone's minds to Europeans' when arguing against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=227 214], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 232]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He rejected the ill-treatment of native people, and for example wrote of massacres of [[Patagonia]]n men, women, and children, "Every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war, because it is against barbarians. Who would believe in this age that such atrocities could be committed in a Christian civilized country?"{{harv|Darwin|1845|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F14&amp;pageseq=115 102]}}

'''{{small|VIII}}.''' {{Note label|H|VIII|1}}{{Note label|H|VIII|2}} [[Genetics|Geneticists]] studied human heredity as [[Mendelian inheritance]], while [[eugenics]] movements sought to manage society, with a focus on social class in the United Kingdom, and on disability and ethnicity in the United States, leading to geneticists seeing this as impractical [[pseudoscience]]. A shift from voluntary arrangements to "negative" eugenics included [[compulsory sterilisation]] laws in the United States, copied by [[Nazi Germany]] as the basis for [[Nazi eugenics]] based on virulent racism and "[[racial hygiene]]".&lt;br /&gt;({{Cite news | url =http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/5-supp/text/thurtle.html| title =the creation of genetic identity| last = Thurtle| first =Phillip| date =17 December 1996| issue =Supplement: Cultural and Technological Incubations of Fascism| volume = 5| ref = harv| periodical =SEHR| accessdate =11 November 2008}}{{Cite news| url =http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/154/4/1419#The_Eclipse_of_Darwinism| title =The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection

'''Civility''' comes from the word ''civilis'', which in Latin means "[[citizen]]". Civility is caused by a person's emotions or lack thereof. If a person is emotionally affected by the negative feedback that they get from other people in a psychologically normal manner then they are defined as civil.

== Etymology ==

[[Late Middle English]]: from [[Old French]] ''civilite'', from [[Latin]] ''civilitas'', from civilis 'relating to citizens' (see civil). In early use, the term denoted the state of being a citizen and hence good citizenship or orderly behavior. The sense 'politeness' arose in the mid-16th century.

==Developmental model==

Adolf G. Gundersen and Suzanne Goodney Lea have developed a civility model grounded in empirical data that "stresses the notion that civility is a sequence, not a single thing or set of things". The model conceives of civility as a continuum or scale consisting of increasingly demanding traits ranging from "indifference" to "commentary", "conversation", "co-exploration" and, from there, to "habituation". According to the authors, such a developmental model has several distinct advantages, not least of which is that it allows civility to be viewed as something everyone can get better at.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Gundersen, Adolf G., PhD, and Suzanne Goodney Lea, PhD" |title=Let's Talk Politics: Restoring Civility through Exploratory Discussion. [publisher=Interactivity Foundation, Parkersburg, WV] |date=March 14, 2013]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide civility==

[[File:International Day of Peace &amp; Society For Women &amp; Child Development.png|thumb|130px| International Day of Peace is observed around the world each year on 21st of September.]]

===Movement to foster worldwide civility===
The [[International Day of Peace]] ("Peace Day") is observed by many countries on September 21. Peace day was first started in 1981 by declaration of the United Nations General Assembly. The voting was overwhelmingly in favor of enacting Peace Day, and so the observance was thus born. The goal of Peace Day is to help bring the world together, and share a collective attitude of peace and harmony. Many countries around the world celebrate September 21 as a day of non-violence and cease-fires to emulate the mission of global peace. Since its beginnings the day has spread more throughout the world, with many countries annually participating in this observance.

Participation is open to all people of the world. People may choose to celebrate Peace Day in different ways, but the goal is to have peace at the heart of all the activity's intentions. Individuals, businesses and organizations are also welcome and encouraged to celebrate Peace Day. Spreading peace and good will towards all mankind is the great aim that's in view for raising awareness for Peace Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://internationaldayofpeace.org/ |title=International Day of Peace |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |access-date=September 17, 2015 |quote=International Day of Peace (Also referred to as "Peace Day") is observed around the world each year on 21st of September. Established in 1981 by resolution 36/37, the United Nations General Assembly declared this day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all nations and peoples. Furthering the Day’s mission, the General Assembly voted unanimously in 2001 to adopt resolution 55/282 establishing 21 September as an annual day of non-violence and cease-fire.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the [[Global Peace Index]] (GPI) was launched in an attempt to measure the relative ranking of peacefulness around different countries around the world. Today, the Global Peace Index is maintained the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], and is conducted on an annual basis. The index primarily measures three different categories to determine the level of peace in the world. These levels look at the overall security, crime levels, and the build up of military forces. By measuring levels of peace, the hope is that a greater general awareness and attention is given towards making the world a more peaceful place.&lt;ref&gt;Information about indicators and methodology {{cite web | title =2014 Global Peace Index | publisher =Institute for Economics and Peace | url =http://www.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/2014%20Global%20Peace%20Index%20REPORT.pdf | accessdate =2015-06-02 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150221185512/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/2014%20Global%20Peace%20Index%20REPORT.pdf | archivedate =2015-02-21 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==

===Opinion polls===

A 2010 Allegheny College poll found that nearly all Americans (95 percent) believe civility is important in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=Peter|title=We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For: The Promise of Civic Renewal in America|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|asin=B00F51ZXII|edition=Kindle, first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 poll conducted by [[Weber Shandwick]], 65% of Americans reported an increase in incivility due to a weakened U.S. economy during the Great Recession. Almost 50% of those same Americans surveyed indicated they have removed themselves from participating in any politics because of fear of incivility or bullying. Of the 1000 people surveyed, a follow-up study revealed that 86% of those people reported being subjected to incivility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Ray Williams" |title=The Rise of Incivility and Bullying in America |publisher=Psychology Today |date=July 15, 2012 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201207/the-rise-incivility-and-bullying-in-america |accessdate=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this report, a part of an annual follow-up research report in January 2016 sharing findings on attitudes and sentiment about civility, 95% of Americans believe that incivility is a very visible issue, while 74% recognized that civility in general had declined during the past few years. Over 90% of voters claimed that the presidential candidates' attitudes and civil behavior would play a significant role in their voting decision in the upcoming 2016 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Ray Williams" |title=Nearly All Likely Voters Say Candidates’ Civility Will Affect Their Vote; New Poll Finds 93% Say Behavior Will Matter |publisher=Weber Shandwick |date=January 28, 2016 |url=http://www.webershandwick.com/news/article/nearly-all-likely-voters-say-candidates-civility-will-affect-their-vote |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement to foster civility in the U.S.===

====In government====
Many projects are led by State Supreme Courts to foster civility. One of these initiatives is led by the California Judicial Branch for their Civics Education Outreach program. The primary objective of this program is to teach young adults and students how democracy is supposed to function in the United States and other details about how legal processes work. The mission is to have students leave the program with a greater interest and understanding of U.S. courts, legal processes, and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Administrative Office of the Courts" |title=California Judicial Branch Outreach to Students:Highlights |publisher=California Judicial Branch |date=March 2011|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/factsheet-civics-outreach.pdf |accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the legal profession====
Penn State University conducted a study on perceptions of the legal professional and its relation to civility. They found that general opinion pointed to a drop or decline in civility with the legal profession. To counteract demeaning and unprofessional behavior, there has been several initiatives put in place by state bar associations. However, the legal profession is not the only industry that has adopted civility standards. Many other companies and organizations across several industries have adopted civility standards that have also help to increase workplace civility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="PennState University" |title=University Libraries Civility Statement and Guidelines |publisher=Penn State University Libraries |date=2017 |url=https://libraries.psu.edu/about/diversity/university-libraries-civility-statement-and-guidelines |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In schools====
Numerous universities in the U.S., such as the [[University of Colorado]], the [[University of Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="University of Missouri" |title=Civility, You, and Mizzou |publisher=University of Missouri |date=2015 |url=https://understand.missouri.edu/civility-you-mizzou/ |accessdate=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Civility Project|url=http://civilityproject.ucdavis.edu/|website=civilityproject.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johns Hopkins University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=User|first1=Administrative|title=JHU Dr. Forni's Civility Website|url=http://krieger.jhu.edu/civility|website=krieger.jhu.edu|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UW Oshkosh CivilityWorks|url=http://civilityworks.uwosh.edu/|website=CivilityWorks|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rutgers University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Relations|first1=Written by Sandra Lanman |title=Rutgers Project Advances Civility on Campus and Beyond|url=http://sas.rutgers.edu/news-events/student-news/1058-draft-2-rutgers-project-advances-civility-on-campus-and-beyond2nd-draft-for|website=Rutgers University, School of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Civility|url=https://www.american.edu/ocl/Civility.cfm|website=www.american.edu|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[California State University San Marcos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Student Life and Leadership California State University San Marcos" |title=The Civility Campaign |publisher=California State University San Marcos |date=2015 |url=http://www.csusm.edu/civility/ |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have created programs designed to foster and define what civility means on their campuses. Some colleges, such as the [[Arizona State University]], offer an undergraduate certificate in Civil Communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Arizona State University" |title=Certificate in Civil Communication |publisher=Arizona State University |date=2017 |url=https://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/degrees/certificate-and-minor |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other universities, such as [[Kansas State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Kansas State University" |title= Institute for Civic Discourse and Democracy |publisher=Kansas State University |date=2017 |url=https://www.k-state.edu/icdd/ |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed programs in dialogue and deliberation which involve codes of behavior that foster constructive, civil discourse. Although many colleges have adopted programs to foster civility efforts, there are still many colleges and universities, including many of the [[Ivy League]] schools, that do not have or list no visible place online about any civility initiatives, codes or standards.

====In the community====
Numerous community groups have formed throughout the U.S. to restore constructive civility in the public space. The Civility Toolkit with approximately 300 civility tools aggregated by the Civility Center with a mission to help provide access to resources regarding civility and to help restore civility in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Civility Center" |title= The Civility Center Toolkit &amp; Resources |publisher=Civility Center 501(c)(3) |date=2015 |url=http://www.civilityresources.com/Civility-Resources.html |accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these groups are members of the National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="National Coalition for Dialogue &amp; Deliberation" |title= What We’re All About |publisher=NATIONAL COALITION FOR DIALOGUE &amp; DELIBERATION |date=2015 |url=http://icdd.k-state.edu/ |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs like iCivics, which was started by [[Sandra Day O'Conner]] U.S. Justice, provides educational tools for students that teach about the importance of actively taking part in democracy. Although some private schools offer courses geared to teach about the U.S. government and legal system, most public schools do not teach about the U.S. government until their junior or senior year in high school. To help bring these lessons into the classroom, O'Conner's program provides teachers with educational tools, such as printable goals, games, and various lesson plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="iCivics" |title= Our Story |publisher=iCivics |date=2015 |url=http://www.icivics.org/our-story|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnett and Arneson define civility "a metaphor that points to the importance of public respect in interpersonal interaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnett, Arneson |first=Ronald, Pat |date=September 30, 1999 |title=Dialogic Civility in a Cynical Age: Community, Hope, and Interpersonal Relationships |url= |location= |publisher=State University of New York Press |page=7 |isbn=978-0791443262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between tolerating someone, and respecting them are concerned with the outlook that toleration does not imply respect, but respect requires understanding of another person's perspective. Having [[social intelligence]] or "Social IQ" impacts our ability to empathize with people, and realize all people are human and that if respect or common ground cannot be met that we strive for at least toleration in order to be civil.

In ''Psychology Today'', Price-Mitchell describes civility as a personal attitude that acknowledges other humans' rights to live and coexist together in a manner that does not harm others. The Psychology of civility indicates awareness, ability to control oneself's passions, as well as have a deeper understanding of others are a part of civil obligation, which everyone should strive to participate. This may suggest that civility goes beyond mere toleration, but may inherently imply a mutual co-existence and respect for [[humankind]]. Some may relate this to the ideas expressed by singer [[John Lennon]] in the song "Imagine", with the words "Imagine all the people sharing all the world." Although the level of peace can be a subjective topic, many people would agree that it requires a certain degree of harmony and opposes violence in order to remain civil.

In the academic journal ''[[Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs]]'', Calhoun delineates civility as an element of dialogue that sheds light on "basic moral attitudes of respect, tolerance, and considerateness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Cheshire |last=Calhoun |title=The Virtue of Civility |journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs |location=251-275 |access-date=September 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic of civility is expansive, and can be viewed from many different perspectives. Calhoun considers civility to be a part of the moral virtues that can differ from what is socially acceptable, since what is socially acceptable is not always morally correct.

====Masons and Civility====
The Freemasons and members of the entire Masonic family, have had a long history of fostering civil dialogue and building civil societies. Masonic Lodges represent a peaceful assembly of people that are of different places of origin, languages, backgrounds, and beliefs. In particular, the principles and tenets of Freemasonry's values aim to promote and restore civility in the United States and around the globe. In 2015, Grand Master Charvonia of the Grand Lodge of California declared May 25, 2015 to be the "Champion Civility Month", which encouraged Freemasons throughout California to make an effort to bring more civility into their local lodges and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Freemason.org" |title= Champion Civility This May |publisher=Freemason.org |date= May 2015 |url=https://freemason.org/newsEvents/article.htm;jsessionid=4F774C610EC8EFC302FF60B9A7FFDE4B?id=10759 |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Freemasons from around the world have been working to repair civility through the Masonic Family Civility Project. This Civility Project was built to help raise awareness of Civility, and by providing social conversations, civility resources, multimedia education, and information for anyone to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Masonic Family Civility Project" |title= Using Masonic Values to Promote Civility|publisher=masoniccivility.org |date= December 2017 |url=http://www.masoniccivility.org/document-resources/ |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the workplace===

Recent studies and polls from 2014 indicate that Americans find [[workplace incivility]] to be a growing problem that has had a negative impact on them and their duties at work. One study's research suggests 60% of employees think that their co-workers' irritating habits to have negatively affected them at their job. In the same study, 40% reported that they are looking for another job opportunity because of another negative co-worker. These studies suggest that incivility in the workplace dampens productivity and an adverse effect on an organization's bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Barbara Richman" |title=  Ten Tips for Creating Respect and Civility in Your Workplace |publisher=Lorman |date=May 28, 2014 |url=http://www.lorman.com/resources/ten-tips-for-creating-respect-and-civility-in-your-workplace-15463 |accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this data is only looking to quantify how widespread workplace incivility is in the workplace, it does not account for how many people encounter workplace incivility and are not sure what they can do about it. Furthermore, it is not taking into consideration how many of these workplaces have civility tools or initiatives at the researched companies.

Numerous organizations, including the United States government, have actively attempted to put in place measures to prevent incivility in the workforce. One measure that was initiated to reduce workplace incivility, was processing cases of [[sexual harassment]] to be illegal, which is defined by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ([[EEOC]]) as being against the law in every state to harass any person during the employment or hiring process because of that person's [[gender]]. Harassment can include "sexual harassment", but is not limited to workplace bullying, cyber bullying, physical and verbal threats.&lt;ref name="eeoc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm | title = Sexual Harassment | publisher = U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many would agree that sexual harassment is an issue that should be illegal, it has really been in the spotlight of the attention in the U.S. since 1964. Because of the legal ramifications from poor prior classification of sexual harassment cases in the past, its boundaries were more loosely interpreted and more people were subject to unwanted contact or attention. Since this the term has been redefined, people are greater protected from a legal perspective in their place of work, but must actively participate in preventing these issues by speaking up and/or reporting issues. The definition for these laws are still being written today, as more people are speaking out against the abuse.

===Lack of civility===

[[Incivility]] is the polar opposite of civility, or in other words a lack or completely without civility. Verbal or physical attacks on others, [[cyber bullying]], [[rudeness]], [[religious intolerance]], [[discrimination]], and [[vandalism]] are just some of the acts that are generally considered acts of incivility. Incivility is a negative part of society that has impacted many people in the United States, but as the world is becoming increasingly more transparent in social interactions, it has become more increasingly apparent that incivility has become an issue on the global stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Incivility in Political Discourse (The Coming Apogee of the Moonbat Hordes) |work= InDC Journal |url= http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |accessdate= 2006-11-25 |date= 2004-10-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130103133948/http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |archivedate= 2013-01-03 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media and the web have given people the ability around the globe to freely exchange ideas, but it has not come without its consequences.

Politicians in the U.S. have frequently cited that they encounter a lack of civility in their workplace, and have disregarded it as unfortunate aspect of politics, but polls indicate that "going negative" can help candidates win elections. During the 2016 presidential campaign, candidate [[Donald Trump]] has regularly called his rivals "stupid, incompetent and losers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Bush Appeals for Civility in GOP Race |work=US News |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/ken-walshs-washington/2015/07/28/bush-appeals-for-civility-in-gop-race |accessdate=2015-08-16 |date= 2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing that incivility online, more commonly referred to as cyber bullying, has become an increasing problem that takes away from a positive online experience. Recognizing that people harassing others online has become a problem and can have negative consequences for businesses, many companies have stepped up to create more awareness and initiatives to help. [[Intel]] in collaboration with organizations such as the [[Born This Way Foundation]] and [[Vox Media]] have made an initiative called "Hack Harassment" aimed to increase awareness of online harassment and anti-harassment technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Hack Harassment |work= Hack Harassment |url=http://www.hackharassment.com/ |accessdate=2016-01-17 |date= 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no claim of solution for what can be done to stop online harassment, but many studies suggest that a large number of people are harassed online.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Although there are many tactics to block cyber-bullying, such as censorship and banning users from accessing a site, it does not correct the underlying issues on what causes it in the first place. Although blocking people online from bullying others may solve some of the issues on the web, it may only manifest itself in other forms offline and in person where the possibility for violence and other physical harm could take place.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On April 22, 2016 The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research at the [[University of Chicago]] released a report citing that 74 percent of Americans think manners and behavior have declined in the United States. In this study they discovered that people in most cases can agree with what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. They found that 8 out of 10 Americans find jokes made based on race, gender, or sexuality are considered inappropriate, but only a small number of people owning up to actually making these types of jokes ever. Although there were some differences between age demographics on newer technologies, such as the use of cell phones. The report suggests that nearly half of all Americans 18-29 find it acceptable to use their cell phones in a restaurant, while less than 22 percent of people over the age of 60 years old agrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Americans believe civility is on the decline |work= The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Chicago |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160422201040.htm |accessdate=2016-05-24 |date= 2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Canada==

===Movement to foster civility in Canada===

In July 2012, the President of the [[Federation of Law Societies of Canada]] made a strong point on civility at the 5th Biennial International Legal Ethics Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wooley |first=Alice |year=2013 |title= 'Uncivil by Too Much Civility'? Critiquing Five More Years of Civility Regulation in Canada|journal=Dalhousie Law Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |page=239 |ssrn=2186930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation is often very open for interpretation, unless strictly and prohibitively defined by law, but in most cases where the law is yet to be defined many lawyers can see opportunity to act immorally to win their case. The "anything to get the job done" mentality can not only have negative consequences in the legal system, but it could possibly further spread the potential for laws and regulations to be exploited in immoral manner.

Additionally, during 2012, the Law Society of Upper Canada decided that Joe Groia was guilty of his incivility to opposing counsel during his successful defense of John Felderhof from [[Insider trading]] and securities charges. On the same case, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] confirmed the decision of [[Bar of Quebec]] that Giles Dore was guilty of professional misconduct because of an uncivil letter he wrote to a judge. This high-profile case brought a lot of attention to the legal definition of the word civility, and what it means to be civil in the legal profession. It has since defined a broader set of rules of what is legally considered civil in the court of law in Canada.

Since the case with Joe Groia, [[The Law Society of Upper Canada]] has launched several initiatives to guard against incivility in the Canadian legal profession. To enforce The Law Society's stance on the issues of civility in the Canadian legal system, they have issued verbal warnings to lawyers who are not civil with judges and other lawyers. The counter argument against civility measures in if the new guidelines inhibit their ability to defend their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Has the so-called civility movement already won? |work=National Magazine |url=http://www.nationalmagazine.ca/Articles/January-2015-Web/Out-of-order.aspx |accessdate=2015-09-17 |date= 2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since laws and rules are often open to interpretation, some lawyers consider it a [[conflict of interest]] to be civil with their opponents as they do not believe there is any way to accomplish their goals while remaining civil.

In January 2017, the BC &amp; Yukon Freemasons in Canada stated civility being like The [[Golden Rule]], defined as "treating others as you would want them to treat you". This statement was in part to a recent civility initiative grounded in respect and attitude of inclusiveness with family, community, and the society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=January 20, 2017 |title=Freemason’s Civility Initiative Outline by BC and Yukon Freemasons- 2017|publisher= Masonic Civility |quote= Civility can simply be defined as treating others as you would want them to treat you.  |url=http://www.masoniccivility.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/freemasons_civility_initiative_outline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In New Zealand==

===Movement to foster civility in New Zealand===

At a recent address with Gisborne's top businesswomen in early 2016, Lara Meyer an adviser to the Australian Government cited incivility in the workplace has cost New Zealand approximately $15 Million a year. Noting that Australia is also losing out about $26 Million a year due to a lack of workplace civility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Counting the cost of rudeness |work=The Gisborne Herald |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/2255300-135/counting-the-cost-of-rudeness |accessdate=2016-05-24 |date= 2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There could even potentially be more loss that is unaccounted for in New Zealand businesses, as the cost of rudeness could be holding them back from working together more politely and agreeably.

A '''class of groups''' is a set theoretical collection of [[Group_(mathematics)|groups]] satisfying the property that if ''G'' is in the collection then every group isomorphic to ''G'' is also in the collection. This concept arose from the necessity to work with a bunch of groups satisfying certain special property (for example finiteness or commutativity).  Since [[set theory]] does not admit the "set of all groups", it is necessary to work with the more general concept of ''[[Class_(set_theory)|class]]''.

== Definition ==

A '''class of groups''' &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}~&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of groups such that if &lt;math&gt;G\in\mathfrak{X}~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G\cong H~&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;H\in\mathfrak{X}~&lt;/math&gt;. Groups in the class &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}~&lt;/math&gt; are referred to as &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;-'''groups'''.

For a set of groups &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}~&lt;/math&gt;, we denote by &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{I})&lt;/math&gt; the smallest class of groups containing &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular for a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(G)&lt;/math&gt; denotes its isomorphism class.

== Examples ==

The most common examples of classes of groups are:
* &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;: the empty class of groups
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;: the class of [[Cyclic_group|cyclic groups]].
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of [[Abelian_group|abelian groups]].
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{U}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of finite [[Supersolvable group|supersolvable groups]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of [[nilpotent group|nilpotent groups]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of finite [[Solvable_group|solvable groups]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of finite [[Simple group|simple groups]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{E}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of [[finite groups]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{G}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of all groups

== Product of classes of groups==

Given two classes of groups &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Y}~&lt;/math&gt; it is defined the '''product of classes'''

&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}\mathfrak{Y}~=(G|G \text{ has a normal subgroup } N\in\mathfrak{X} \text{ with } G/N\in\mathfrak{Y})&lt;/math&gt;

This construction allows us to recursively define the '''power of a class''' by setting

&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}^0=(1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}^n=\mathfrak{X}^{n-1}\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;

It must be remarked that this [[binary operation]] on the class of classes of groups is neither [[associative]] nor [[commutative]]. For instance, consider the [[alternating group]] of degree 4 (and order 12); this group belongs to the class &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{C}\mathfrak{C})\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; because it has as a subgroup the group &lt;math&gt;V_4&lt;/math&gt; which belongs to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; and furthermore &lt;math&gt;A_4/V_4\cong C_3&lt;/math&gt; which is in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;. However &lt;math&gt;A_4&lt;/math&gt; has no non-trivial normal cyclic subgroup, so &lt;math&gt;A_4\not\in\mathfrak{C}(\mathfrak{C}\mathfrak{C})&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}(\mathfrak{C}\mathfrak{C})\not=(\mathfrak{C}\mathfrak{C})\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

However it is straightforward from the definition that for any three classes of groups &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Z}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}(\mathfrak{Y}\mathfrak{Z})\subseteq(\mathfrak{X}\mathfrak{Y})\mathfrak{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

== Class maps and closure operations==

A '''class map''' '''c''' is a map which assigns a class of groups &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt; to another class of groups &lt;math&gt;c\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;. A class map is said to be a closure operation if it satisfies the next properties:
# '''c''' is expansive: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}\subseteq c\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;
# '''c''' is [[idempotent]]: &lt;math&gt;c\mathfrak{X}=c(c\mathfrak{X})&lt;/math&gt;
# '''c''' is monotonic: If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}\subseteq\mathfrak{Y}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;c\mathfrak{X}\subseteq c\mathfrak{Y}&lt;/math&gt;

Some of the most common examples of closure operations are:

* &lt;math&gt;S\mathfrak{X}=(G|G\leq H, \ H\in\mathfrak{X})&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Q\mathfrak{X}=(G|\text{exists }H\in\mathfrak{X} \text{ and an epimorphism from }H \text{ to }G)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;N_0\mathfrak{X}=(G| \text{ exists }K_i\ (i=1,\cdots,r)\text{ subnormal in }G\text{ with }K_i\in\mathfrak{X}\text{ and }G=\langle K_1,\cdots,K_r\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R_0\mathfrak{X}=(G| \text{ exists }N_i\ (i=1,\cdots,r)\text{ normal in }G\text{ with }G/N_i\in\mathfrak{X}\text{ and }\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^rNi=1)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;S_n\mathfrak{X}=(G|G\text{ is subnormal in }H\text{ for some }H\in\mathfrak{X})&lt;/math&gt;

{{Taoism}}
'''De''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə}}; {{zh|c=德}}) is a key concept in [[Chinese philosophy]], usually translated "inherent character; inner power; integrity" in [[Taoism]], "moral character; virtue; morality" in [[Confucianism]] and other contexts, and "quality; virtue" (''[[guna]]'') or "merit; virtuous deeds" (''[[Merit (Buddhism)|punya]]'') in [[Chinese Buddhism]].

==The word==
Chinese ''de'' 德 is an ancient and linguistically complex word. The following analyzes it in terms of semantics, graphics, and [[etymology]].

===Meanings===
The ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'', defines twenty meanings for ''de'' 德, translatable as
# Rise, go up, climb, ascend. [升; 登.]
# Morals, morality, virtue, personal conduct, moral integrity, honor. [道德, 品行, 节操.]
# Denoting a wise/enlightened person with moral character. [指有道德的贤明之人.]
# Kindness, favor, grace, graciousness. [恩惠, 恩德.]
# Grateful, gratefulness, thankful, indebted. [感恩, 感激.]
# Benevolent rule, good government, good instruction. [德政, 善教.]
# Objective regulations/rules. [客观规律.]
# Quality, nature, basic character, characteristics, attribute. [性质; 属性.]
# Intention, purpose, heart, mind. For example: "Be of one heart and mind". [心意. 如:一心一德.]
# In [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]] theory, a reference to seasonally productive energy/air. [五行说指四季的旺气.]
# First growth, initial stage, beginning of something. [始生; 事物的开始.]
# A phoenix-head pattern/decoration. [凤凰头上的花纹.]
# Blessings, good fortune, happiness, resulting from benevolent actions. [福, 善庆的事.]
# Used for ''zhí'' "straight, just".  [通 "直 (''zhí'')".]
# Used for ''zhí'' "to plant, grow, establish". Plant a tree. [通 "植 (''zhí'')". 立木.]
# Used for "get, obtain, result in". [通 "得".]
# A national name. An abbreviation for the Republic of Germany during World War II. [国名. 第二次世界大战结束前的德意志联邦的简称.]
# A star name. [星名.]
# A river name. Another name for the Yellow River. [水名. 黄河之别名.]
# A surname. [姓.]
This dictionary provides early usage examples, and all of these ''de'' meanings occur in Han or pre-Han [[Chinese classic texts]], except for number 17 (''de'' abbreviating ''Deutschland'').

Translating ''de'' into English is problematic and controversial. [[Arthur Waley]] believed that ''de'' was better translated "power" than "virtue", and explained with a "bank of fortune" metaphor.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is usually translated 'virtue', and this often seems to work quite well; though where the word occurs in early, pre-moralistic texts such a translation is in reality quite false. But if we study the usage of the word carefully we find that ''de'' can be bad as well as good. What is a 'bad virtue'? Clearly 'virtue' is not a satisfactory equivalent. Indeed on examining the history of the word we find that it means something much more like the Indian ''karma'', save that the fruits of ''te'' are generally manifested here and now; whereas ''karma'' is bound up with a theory of transmigration, and its effects are usually not seen in this life, but in a subsequent incarnation. ''Te'' is anything that happens to one or that one does of a kind indicating that, as a consequence, one is going to meet with good or bad luck. It means, so to speak, the stock of credit (or the deficit) that at any given moment a man has at the bank of fortune. Such a stock is of course built up partly by the correct carrying out of ritual; but primarily by securing favourable omens; for unless the omens are favourable, no rite can be carried out at all. (1958:31)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on the cognate relation between ''de'' and ''zhi'' "to plant", Waley further noted the early Chinese regarded planting seeds as a ''de'', hence it "means a latent power, a 'virtue' inherent in something."

The linguist Peter A. Boodberg investigated the semantics and etymology of ''de''  德, which he called "perhaps the most significant word, next to ''tao'' 道, in ancient Chinese macro- and microcosmology."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The standard translation for it is "virtue," both in the sense of inherent quality and in that of moral excellence, but with the validity of the traditional rendering somewhat shaken by Arthur Waley's insistence on interpreting it as "power." Indeed, it is believed by many scholars that the term originated in the mytho-magical period of Chinese speculation when ''tê'' was conceived as a kind of ''mana''-like potency inherent in substances, things, and human beings, a potency which, on the one hand, made them true to their essence, and on the other, made possible their influencing of other entities. It appears often as if it had been imagined as a kind of electric charge permeating the thing in question, waxing or waning in accordance with some mysterious law, and capable of being transmitted, in the case of living beings, from one generation to another. Contrary-minded students of ancient Chinese philosophy dispute this interpretation as rather narrow and possibly anachronistic, and point to the fact that ''tê'' had early acquired, at least in Confucian literature, ethical connotations close to our "virtue," that is, as moral, and only rarely amoral or immoral, efficacy. They find, therefore, no quarrel with rendering ''tê'', almost invariably, as "virtue." Philologists are, however, troubled by the absence in the Chinese term of any connotations reminiscent of the Latin etymon ''vir'', such as manliness and virility. They remind us that ''tê'' is free from any contamination with sexual associations and differs in that from its great counterpart, ''tao'', the Way, which, in one or two expressions, such as ''jên tao'' 人道, "the way of men and women," is suggestive of sexual activity. Other recommended translation, such as "energy" and "essential quality," seem also inadequate from the etymological point of view. (1979:32) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Victor Mair explains that the difficulty of accurately translating ''de'',
&lt;blockquote&gt; …is evident from the astonishing sweep of thoughtful renderings of its meaning: power, action, life, inner potency, indarrectitude (inner uprightness), charisma, mana (impersonal supernatural force inherent in gods and sacred objects), [[Synderesis|sinderesis]] (conscience as the directive force of one's actions), and virtue, to name only a few of the brave attempts to convey the meaning of ''te'' in English. Of these, the last is by far the most frequently encountered. Unfortunately, it is also probably the least appropriate of all to serve as  an accurate translation of ''te'' in the ''Tao Te Ching''. (1990:133-4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mair (1990:135) concludes that Daoist ''de'' is best translated "integrity", which "means no more than the wholeness or completeness of a given entity," and like ''de'', "it represents the selfhood of every being in the universe."

===Characters===
''De'' "power; virtue" is written with the [[Chinese character]] [[Wikt:德|德]] in both [[Traditional Chinese]] and [[Simplified Chinese]]. This character 德 combines the ''chi'' 彳 "footstep; go" [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] (recurring graphic elements that suggest meaning) with ''zhi'' 直 "straight; vertical" and ''xin'' 心 "heart; mind". ''De'' 德 has rare [[Variant Chinese character|variant characters]] of [[Wikt:徳|徳]] (without the horizontal 一 line) and [[Wikt:悳|悳]] or [[Wikt:惪|惪]] (without the 彳 "footstep" radical).

The earliest written forms of ''de'' 德 are [[oracle script]] from the [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600-1046 BCE) and [[bronzeware script]] and [[seal script]] from the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045-256 BCE). Oracle characters wrote ''de'' 德 with 彳"footstep; go" and 直 "straight", later bronze characters added the 心 "heart; mind" element. The oracle script for ''zhi''  直 "straight; vertical" ideographically depicted ''shu'' 丨"vertical line (in a character)" above ''mu'' 目 "eye", the bronze script elaborated the line into ''shi'' 十 "ten"', and the seal script separated the eye and heart with a horizontal line.

===Etymologies===
Boodberg (1979:33-4) undertook a "graphophonetic analysis" of ''de''. Based on the phonetic element ''zhi'' 直 "upright; erect" and the radical 行 suggesting movement, he translates ''de'' as English ''arrect'' "set upright; direct upward" (from Latin ''ad-'' "to") or ''insititious'' "ingrafted; inserted" potency (from Latin ''insitio'' "to implant; to graft"). Interpreting the 心 "heart; mind" to connote "innerness", he takes the prefix from Latin ''indoles'' "innate quality; natural disposition" to further neologize ''indarrect''. Boodberg concludes that the noun ''de'' is best translated ''enrective'' in the passive sense of power, or ''arrective'' in the active sense of influencing others. He says the Chinese understood ''de'' as potent but not coercive, and as arrective rather than corrective. Since early texts describe ''de'' 德 as an acquired quality, he proposes it is a [[paronym]] of ''de'' 得 "to acquire; to obtain", which is a common definition of ''de'' "power; virtue". Lastly, he notes a possible etymology of "see straight; looking straight at things; intuition" because early ''zhi'' 直 graphs depicted a straight line over an 目 "eye" (horizontally written 罒 in 德).

[[Victor H. Mair]] proposes a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] etymology for ''de''.
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Te'' was pronounced approximately ''dugh''  during the early Chou period (about 1100 to 600 B.C.). The meanings it conveys in texts from that era are "character," "[good or bad] intentions," "quality," "disposition," "personality," "personhood," "personal strength," and "worth." There is a very close correlation between these meanings and words deriving from Proto-Indo-European ''dugh'' (to be fit, of use, proper; acceptable; achieve). And there is a whole series of words derived from the related Teutonic verbal root ''dugan''. There are Old High German ''tugan'', Middle High German ''tugen'', and modern German ''taugen'', all of which mean "to be good, fit, of use." There is another cognate group of words relating to modern English "doughty" (meaning worthy, valiant, stouthearted) that also contribute to our understanding of ''te''. They are Middle English ''douhti'', ''dohti'', of ''dühti'' ("valiant"). (1990:134) &lt;/blockquote&gt; In modern Dutch, the noun "de" can be translated as "deugd"; the verb "deugen" means 'to have virtue'.

According to Axel Schuessler's new etymological dictionary of Old Chinese (2007:208), ''de'' &lt; *''tək'' 德 "moral force, virtue, character; quality, nature" is probably in the same word family as ''de'' &lt; *''tək'' 得 "to get" and perhaps ''zhi'' &lt; *''drək'' 直 "straight; right". It quotes the proposal of [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]] that ''de'' 德 and ''de'' 得 are cognate with [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] ''thub'' "a mighty one, one having power and authority".

==Taoist usages==
Classic texts of philosophical Daoism frequently refer to ''de''.

===The ''Daodejing''===
''De'' (德) is a keyword in the ''[[Daodejing]]'' where it occurs 44 times, compared to 76 occurrences of ''dao''. The title refers to a textual division between the ''Daojing'' (chapters 1-37, since 1 begins with ''dao'': "The Way that can be told") and the ''Dejing'' (chapters 38-81, since 38 begins with ''de'': "The man of highest "power", see below). The (relatively) modern compound word ''daode'' (道德) means "morality, ethical principles, ethics, moral philosophy". Two common ''de'' themes are its connection with the ''dao'' and its usefulness in managing people. (Note that ''de'' is "power" in the following translations by Arthur Waley.)

The first ''Daojing'' theme is the interrelationship between ''de'' and ''dao''. "Such the scope of the All-pervading Power. That it alone can act through the Way." (21, tr. Waley). The so-called "''De'' Chapter" has the greatest number of occurrences.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The man of highest "power" does not reveal himself as a possessor of "power";
Therefore he keeps his "power".
The man of inferior "power" cannot rid it of the appearance of "power";
Therefore he is in truth without "power".
The man of highest "power" neither acts nor is there any who so regards him; The man of inferior "power" both acts and is so regarded.
The man of highest humanity, though he acts, is not regarded;
Whereas a man of even the highest morality both acts and is so regarded;
While even he who is best versed in ritual not merely acts, but if people fail to respond
Then he will pull up his sleeves and advance upon them. That is why it is said:
"After Tao was lost, then came the 'power';
After the 'power' was lost, then came human kindness."
After human kindness was lost, then came morality,
After morality was lost, then came ritual. (38, tr. Waley)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here is another example.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Truly, if one uses the Way as one's instrument, the results will be like the Way; if one uses the "power" as instrument, the results will be like the "power". If one uses what is the reverse of the "power", the results will be the reverse of the "power".

For to those who have conformed themselves to the Way, the Way readily lends its power. To those who have conformed themselves to the power, the power readily, lends more power. While to those who conform themselves to inefficacy, inefficacy readily lends its ineffectiveness. (23, tr. Waley)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare this third example.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Tao gave them birth;
The "power" of Tao reared them,
Shaped them according to their kinds,
Perfected them, giving to each its strength.
Therefore of the ten thousand things there is not one that does not worship Tao and do homage to its "power". No mandate ever went forth that accorded to Tao the right to be worshipped, nor to its "power" the right to be worshipped, nor to its "power" the right to receive homage.
It was always and of itself so.
Therefore as Tao bore them and the "power" of Tao reared them, made them grow, fostered them, harboured them, brewed for them, so you must,
Rear them, but not lay claim to them,
Control them, but never lean upon them,
Be chief among them, but not manage them.
This is called the "mysterious power." (51, tr. Waley)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chapters 10 and 65 also use this ''xuande'' (玄德 "dark/mysterious ''de''") phrase.

The second ''Daodejing'' theme is the efficacy of ''de'' for statesmanship (see meanings 6 and 7 above). A sage ruler can acquire sufficient ''de'' to influence his subjects through, in effect, ''[[wu wei]]'' government.
&lt;blockquote&gt;You cannot rule men nor serve heaven unless you have laid up a store;
This "laying up a store" means quickly absorbing,
And "quickly absorbing" means doubling one's garnered "power".
Double your garnered power and it acquires a strength that nothing can overcome.
If there is nothing it cannot overcome, it know no bounds,
And only what knows no bounds is huge enough to keep a whole kingdom in its grasp. (59, tr. Waley) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare this description of using one's accumulated ''de'' to affect others.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The best charioteers do not rush ahead;
The best fighters do not make displays of wrath.
The greatest conqueror wins without joining issue;
The best user of men acts as though he were their inferior.
This is called the power that comes of not contending,
Is called the capacity to use men,
The secret of being mated to heaven, to what was of old. (68, tr. Waley) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mair interprets these ''de'' occurrences.
&lt;blockquote&gt; As it is used in the ''Tao Te Ching'', ''te'' signifies the personal qualities or strengths of the individual, one's personhood. ''Te'' is determined by the sum total of one's actions, good and bad. Therefore it is possible to speak of "cultivating one's ''te''." Like karma, ''te'' is the moral weight of a person, which may be either positive or negative. In short, ''te'' is what you are. ''Te'' represents self-nature or self-realization, only in relation to the cosmos. It is in fact the actualization of the cosmic principle in the self. ''Te'' is the embodiment of the Way and is the character of all entities in the universe. Each creature, each object has a ''te'' which is its own manifestation of the Tao. (1990:134-5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The ''Zhuangzi''===
The ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' uses ''de'' 191 times. Many contexts praise Daoist "integrity; inner power", some mock Confucianist and Mohist "virtue", and others make ''de'' wordplays. One of the chapter titles is "''De chong fu''" (5, 德充符, "The Sign of Complete Virtue").

Several of the ''Zhuangzi'' translators (listed [[Zhuangzi (book)#Notable translations|here]]) explain the difficulties of rendering ''de'' into English. Frederic H. Balfour (1881:xxxvii) succinctly glosses ''de'' with Greek and Chinese.
&lt;blockquote&gt;德. In ethics, Virtue — ''ἀρετή'' [''[[arete (moral virtue)|areté]]'' "excellence"]; in physics, Energy — '' δύναμις'' [''dunamis'' "potential power; force"]. 道 ["The Tao"] is the 體 ["body; embodiment"] of which 德 is the 用 ["use; function"]. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
James Legge (1891:81) gives this footnote to the "''De'' Chapter".
&lt;blockquote&gt;論德, 'About the Attributes;' of Tâo, that is. It is not easy to render teh here by any other English term than 'virtue,' and yet there would be a danger of its thus misleading us in the interpretations of the chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
The 'virtue,' is the activity or operation of the Tâo, which is supposed to have come out of its absoluteness. Even Han Fei so defines it here, — 'Teh is the meritorious work of the Tâo.' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Fung Yu-lan (1938:8) cites two examples.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Next, we come to the conception of ''Tê'', or virtue. Lao Tzŭ said:&lt;br /&gt;
"''Tao'' produces a thing; ''Tê'' maintains it." – "''Tao Tê Ching''," ''51''. &lt;br /&gt;
Chuang Tzŭ said:&lt;br /&gt;
"That which things get in order to live is called ''Tê''." – ''Chapter XII''. &lt;br /&gt;
So ''Tê'' is what an individual thing receives from ''Tao''. The total spontaneity of all things is ''Tao''. The spontaneity that an individual thing receives from ''Tao'' is ''Tê''. As some commentator said, the relation between ''Tê'' and ''Tao'' is just like that between the water in river or lake, and water in general. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Burton Watson (1968:25), whose translation will be cited below, describes the subtle connotations.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In nearly all cases I have rendered ''te'' as "virtue" except where it has the meaning of a favor or good deed done for someone, This word presents certain difficulties in Chuang Tzu. Sometimes he employs it to mean conventional virtue — that is, virtue in the Confucian or Mo-ist sense — in which case it has bad connotations; at other times he employs it in a good sense to mean the true virtue or vital power that belongs to the man of Tao. (Compare Waley's rendering of the title ''Tao-te-ching'' as ''The Way and Its Power''.) I prefer not to try to distinguish these two usages in the translation because I do not wish to impose upon the English a distinction that is not explicit in the original. The reader should keep in mind, incidentally, that the words "virtue" (''te'') and "gain" or "to get" (''te'') are homophones, and this fact is the basis of frequent puns and word plays — that is, the man of true Taoist virtue is one who, as we would say in English, has "got it."  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Victor H. Mair (1994:383) differentiates ''Zhuangzi'''s contextual usages of ''de''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Confucian or conventional contexts, ''te'' is translated as "virtue." In Taoist or unconventional contexts, it is translated as "integrity." The most etymologically precise equivalent in English is the archaic word "dough[tiness]." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''De'' was central in Daoist cosmology, and the ''Zhuangzi'' frequently explains it with ''dao'' "the Way" and ''[[tian]]'' "heaven; god". Chapter 12, "Heaven and Earth", has two good illustrations.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Great Beginning, there was nonbeing; there was no being, no name. Out of it arose One; there was One, but it had no form. Things got hold of it and came to life, and it was called Virtue. Before things had forms, they had their allotments; these were of many kinds, but not cut off from one another, and they were called fates. Out of the flow and flux, things were born, and as they grew they developed distinctive shapes; these were called forms. The forms and bodies held within them spirits, each with its own characteristics and limitations, and this was called the inborn nature. If the nature is trained, you may return to Virtue, and Virtue at its highest peak is identical with the Beginning. Being identical, you will be empty; being empty, you will be great. You may join in the cheeping and chirping and, when you have joined in the cheeping and chirping, you may join with Heaven and earth. Your joining is wild and confused, as though you were stupid, as though you were demented. This is called Dark Virtue. Rude and unwitting, you take part in the Great Submission. (12, tr. Watson 1968:131-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pervading Heaven and earth: that is the Way. Moving among the ten thousand things: that is Virtue. Superiors governing the men below them: that is called administration. Ability finding trained expression: that is called skill. Skill is subsumed in administration; administration in duty; duty in Virtue; Virtue in the Way; and the Way in Heaven. Therefore it is said, those who shepherded the world in ancient times were without desire and the world was satisfied, without action and the ten thousand things were transformed. They were deep and silent and the hundred clans were at rest. The Record says: "Stick to the One and the ten thousand tasks will be accomplished; achieve mindlessness and the gods and spirits will bow down." (12, tr. Watson 1968:126-7) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Zhide'' (至德 "perfect/ultimate ''de''") occurs seven times (see the punning proverb quoted below). For instance,
&lt;blockquote&gt;When a man has perfect virtue, fire cannot burn him, water cannot drown him, cold and heat cannot afflict him, birds and beasts cannot injure him. I do not say that he makes light of these things. I mean that he distinguishes between safety and danger, contents himself with fortune or misfortune, and is cautious in his comings and goings. Therefore nothing can harm him.

"Hence it is said: the Heavenly is on the inside, the human is on the outside. Virtue resides in the Heavenly. Understand the actions of Heaven and man, base yourself upon Heaven, take your stand in virtue, and then, although you hasten or hold back, bend or stretch, you may return to the essential and speak of the ultimate." (17, tr. Watson 1968:182-3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The people have their constant inborn nature. To weave for their clothing, to till for their food — this is the Virtue they share. They are one in it and not partisan, and it is called the Emancipation of Heaven. Therefore in a time of Perfect Virtue the gait of men is slow and ambling; their gaze is steady and mild. In such an age mountains have no paths or trails, lakes no boats or bridges. The ten thousand things live species by species, one group settled close to another. Birds and beasts form their flocks and herds, grass and trees grow to fullest height. So it happens that you can tie a cord to the birds and beasts and lead them about, or bend down the limb and peer into the nest of the crow and the magpie. In this age of Perfect Virtue men live the same as birds and beasts, group themselves side by side with the ten thousand things. Who then knows anything about "gentleman" or "petty man"? Dull and ununwitting, men have no wisdom; thus their Virtue does not depart from them. Dull and unwitting, they have no desire; this is called uncarved simplicity. In uncarved simplicity the people attain their true nature.

Then along comes the sage, huffing and puffing after benevolence, reaching on tiptoe for righteousness, and the world for the first time has doubts; mooning and mouthing over his music, snipping and stitching away at his rites, and the world for the first time is divided. Thus, if the plain unwrought substance had not been blighted, how would there be any sacrificial goblets? If the white jade had not been shattered, how would there be any scepters and batons? If the Way and its Virtue had not been cast aside, how would there be any call for benevolence and righteousness? If the true form of the inborn nature had not been abandoned, how would there be any use for rites and music? If the five colors had not confused men, who would fashion patterns and hues? If the five notes had not confused them, who would try to tune things by the six tones? That the unwrought substance was blighted in order to fashion implements — this was the crime of the artisan. That the Way and its Virtue were destroyed in order to create benevolence and righteousness — this was the fault of the sage. (9, tr. Watson 1968:105-6) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This parable blaming sages for losing the primordial ''dao'' and ''de'' has several ''Zhuangzi'' parallels. Here are two.
&lt;blockquote&gt;So it is said, With the sage, his life is the working of Heaven, his death the transformation of things. In stillness, he and the yin share a single Virtue; in motion, he and the yang share a single flow. He is not the bearer of good fortune, nor the initiator of bad fortune. Roused by something outside himself, only then does he respond; pressed, only then does he move; finding he has no choice, only then does he rise up. He discards knowledge and purpose and follows along with the reasonableness of Heaven. Therefore he incurs no disaster from Heaven, no entanglement from things, no opposition from man, no blame from the spirits. His life is a floating, his death a rest. He does not ponder or scheme, does not plot for the future. A man of light, he does not shine; of good faith, he keeps no promises. He sleeps without dreaming, wakes without worry. His spirit is pure and clean, his soul never wearied. In emptiness, nonbeing, and limpidity, he joins with the Virtue of Heaven.

So it is said, Grief and happiness are perversions of Virtue; joy and anger are transgressions of the Way; love and hate are offenses against Virtue. When the mind is without care or joy, this is the height of Virtue. When it is unified and unchanging, this is the height of stillness. When it grates against nothing, this is the height of emptiness. When it has no commerce with things, this is the height of limpidity. When it rebels against nothing, this is the height of purity. (15, tr. Watson 1968:168-9) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Yellow Emperor said, "Do-Nothing-Say‑Nothing — he's the one who is truly right. Wild-and-Witless appears to be so. But you and I in the end are nowhere near it. Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Therefore the sage practices the teaching that has no words. The Way cannot be brought to light; its virtue cannot be forced to come. But benevolence — you can put that into practice; you can discourse on righteousness, you can dupe one another with rites. So it is said, When the Way was lost, then there was virtue; when virtue was lost, then there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost, then there was righteousness; when righteousness was lost, then there were rites. Rites are the frills of the Way and the forerunners of disorder. So it is said, He who practices the Way does less every day, does less and goes on doing less, until he reaches the point where he does nothing, does nothing and yet there is nothing that is not done." Now that we've already become 'things,' if we want to return again to the Root, I'm afraid we'll have a hard time of it! The Great Man — he's the only one who might find it easy. (22, tr. Watson 1968:235) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This theme of sagely rulers using the powers of ''de'' recurs in the "Heaven and Earth" chapter.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Heaven and Earth are huge, but they are alike in their transformations. The ten thousand things are numerous, but they are one in their good order. Human beings are many, but they are all subjects of the sovereign. The sovereign finds his source in Virtue, his completion in Heaven. Therefore it is said that the sovereign of dark antiquity ruled the world through inaction, through Heavenly Virtue and nothing more. (12, tr. Watson 1968:126) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The man of kingly Virtue moves in simplicity and is ashamed to be a master of facts. He takes his stand in the original source and his understanding extends to the spirits. Therefore his Virtue is far‑reaching. His mind moves forth only when some external thing has roused it. Without the Way the body can have no life, and without Virtue, life can have no clarity. To preserve the body and live out life, to establish Virtue and make clear the Way — is this not kingly Virtue? Broad and boundless, suddenly he emerges, abruptly he moves, and the ten thousand things follow him — this is what is called the man of kingly Virtue. (12, tr. Watson 1968:128) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the Inner Chapters has a dialogue between [[Confucius]] and Duke Ai of [[Lu (state)|Lu]] (r. 494-468 BCE). The Duke describes meeting a hunchback named Ai Taito, who was famously ugly and charismatic, and asks about his incredible popularity, which the Master attributes to formless and water-like ''de''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said, "I once went on a mission to Ch'u, and as I was going along, I saw some little pigs nursing at the body of their dead mother. After a while, they gave a start and all ran away and left her, because they could no longer see their likeness in her; she was not the same as she had been before. In loving their mother, they loved not her body but the thing that moved her body. When a man has been killed in battle and people come to bury him, he has no use for his medals. When a man has had his feet amputated, he doesn't care much about shoes. For both, the thing that is basic no longer exists. When women are selected to be consorts of the Son of Heaven, their nails are not pared and their ears are not pierced. When a man has just taken a wife, he is kept in posts outside [the palace] and is no longer sent on [dangerous] missions. If so much care is taken to keep the body whole, how much more in the case of a man whose virtue is whole? Now Ai T'ai‑t'o says nothing and is trusted, accomplishes nothing and is loved, so that people want to turn over their states to him and are only afraid he won't accept. It must be that his powers are whole, though his virtue takes no form."

"What do you mean when you say his powers are whole?" asked Duke Ai.

Confucius said, "Life, death, preservation, loss, failure, success, poverty, riches, worthiness, unworthiness, slander, fame, hunger, thirst, cold, heat — these are the alternations of the world, the workings of fate. Day and night they change place before us and wisdom cannot spy out their source. Therefore, they should not be enough to destroy your harmony; they should not be allowed to enter the Spirit Storehouse. If you can harmonize and delight in them, master them and never be at a loss for joy, if you can do this day and night without break and make it be spring with everything, mingling with all and creating the moment within your own mind — this is what I call being whole in power."

"What do you mean when you say his virtue takes no form?"

"Among level things, water at rest is the most perfect, and therefore it can serve as a standard. It guards what is inside and shows no movement outside. Virtue is the establishment of perfect harmony. Though virtue takes no form, things cannot break away from it." (5, tr. Watson 1968:73-74) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Zhuangzi'' is famous for wordplay and witticism. Several passages make puns between ''de'' "obtain" and ''de'' "integrity; virtue" (see Watson 1968:183, 214). The "Autumn Floods" chapter quotes a "perfect ''de'' does not ''de''" (至德不得) proverb; "I have heard it said, 'The Man of the Way wins no fame, the highest virtue wins no gain, the Great Man has no self.' To the most perfect degree, he goes along with what has been allotted to him." (17, tr. Watson 1968:178-9). ''De'' derogatorily means "virtue; morality" in some contexts mocking the Confucians, [[Mohists]], and [[School of Names]]. For instance, this derision of their sophistry: "There is left, there is right, there are theories, there are debates, there are divisions, there are discriminations, there are emulations, and there are contentions. These are called the Eight Virtues." (2, tr. Watson 1968:44). Translating the witty words of ''Zhuangzi'' can be highly complex. A final instance mentions five types of ''xiongde'' (凶德 "bad/fiendish/terrible ''de''"), but only lists the first one ''zhongde'' (中德 "center/middle ''de''"). Compare these ''de'' translations by Watson ("virtue") and Mair ("integrity").
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no greater evil than for the mind to be aware of virtue, and to act as though it were a pair of eyes. For when it starts acting like a pair of eyes, it will peer out from within, and when it peers out from within, it is ruined. There are five types of dangerous virtue, of which inner virtue is the worst. What do I mean by inner virtue? He who possesses inner virtue will think himself always in the right, and denigrate those who do not do as he does. (32, tr. Watson 1968:359) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no greater affliction than for integrity to be possessed by the mind and for the mind to be possessed by its eye. Once ruled by the mind's eye, a person looks inward, and when she looks inward she is defeated. There are five types of malevolent integrity and the chief among them is egocentric integrity. What is meant by "egocentric integrity"? She who has egocentric integrity is possessed by self-love and ridicules whatever she does not do herself. (tr. Mair 1994:330) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word ''bade'' 八德 "eight virtues/powers" first appears in the "Discussion on Making All Things Equal" chapter. Although many ''Zhuangzi'' commentators and translators try to give ''de'' "some special meaning other than its ordinary one of "virtue" in this context", notes Watson, "I believe Chuang Tzu is deliberately parodying the ethical categories of the Confucians and Mo-ists."
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way has never known boundaries; speech has no constancy. But because of [the recognition of a] "this," there came to be boundaries. Let me tell you what the boundaries are. There is left, there is right, there are theories, there are debates, there are divisions, there are discriminations, there are emulations, and there are contentions. These are called the Eight Virtues. (2, tr. Watson 1968:43-44) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later Confucianists misread this Daoist context and moralistically interpreted ''bade'' as ''xiao'' 孝 "[[filial piety]]", ''di'' 悌 "sibling piety", ''zhong'' 忠 "loyalty; fidelity", ''xin'' 信 "trust; believe", ''li'' 禮 "ritual; rites; courtesy", ''yi'' 義 "righteousness; right conduct", ''lian'' 廉 "upright; honorable; integrity", and ''zhi'' 恥 "humility; shame".{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Confucianist usages==
The [[Four Books]] of Confucianism give some insightful explanations of ''de'' "virtue". Note that the following quotations cite [[Charles Muller]]'s scholarly translations of  the ''Analects'', ''Doctrine of the Mean'', ''Great Learning'', and ''Mencius''. The more familiar translations of [[James Legge]] render ''ren'' "[[Confucianism#Humaneness|humaneness]]; human-heartedness" as "perfect virtue", which occasionally creates confusion with ''de'' as "virtue". Compare their translations of these two ''Analects'' passages.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yen Yüan]] asked about [仁] perfect virtue. The Master said, "To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?" (12:1, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yen Yüan asked about the meaning of [仁] humaneness. The Master said, "To completely overcome selfishness and keep to propriety is humaneness. If for a full day you can overcome selfishness and keep to propriety, everyone in the world will return to humaneness. Does humaneness come from oneself, or from others?" (12:1, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, "Let the will be set on the path of duty. Let [德] every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. Let [仁] perfect virtue be accorded with. Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts." (7:6, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Set your aspirations on the Tao, hold to [德] virtue, rely on your [仁] humaneness, and relax in the study of the arts." (7:6, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The ''Analects''===
''De'' occurs 40 times in the Confucian ''Lunyu'' or ''[[Analects]]''. While Confucius extolled ''de'' "virtue; morality" — "If you are virtuous, you will not be lonely. You will always have friends." (4:25) — he frequently criticized his contemporaries for having lost it. He described ''de'' as something that one can augment, and praised sage kings who governed through its compelling powers.

Confucius claimed that the rulers of ancient China had ''zhide'' "perfect/ultimate ''de''" (see above). The two examples below mention the legendary [[Emperor Yao]] and [[Emperor Shun]], [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], the founder of the Zhou Dynasty, and Tai Bo, who ceded the throne to his nephew [[King Wen]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "T'ai Po can be said to have had a [至德] perfected level of virtue. He declined the rule of the kingdom three times, without the people knowing about it." (8:1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shun, with five ministers, was able to successfully govern the empire. King Wu said, "Altogether I have ten ministers." Confucius said, "Their ability is the issue. Don't you think so? When the T'ang [Shang] and Wu [Zhou] dynasties combined, they had as many ministers as you, with a woman and nine men. King Wen (of the Chou) controlled two-thirds of the empire, and with this, served the Yin. Indeed, the [德] virtue of Chou can be called the [至德] epitome of virtue!" (8:20) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Good government is a central ''Analects'' topic, and the following citations illustrate the importance of ''de'' for rulers and officials.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it." (2:1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "If you govern the people legalistically and control them by punishment, they will avoid crime, but have no personal sense of shame. If you govern them by means of virtue and control them with propriety, they will gain their own sense of shame, and thus correct themselves." (2:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "The Superior Man cares about virtue; the inferior man cares about material things. The Superior Man seeks discipline; the inferior man seeks favors." (4:11) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone said: "What do you think of the saying: 'Repay harm with virtue'?" Confucius replied, "Then how will you repay virtue? Repay harm with Justice and repay virtue with virtue." (14:36) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chi K'ang Tzu asked Confucius about government saying: "Suppose I were to kill the unjust, in order to advance the just. Would that be all right?" Confucius replied: "In doing government, what is the need of killing? If you desire good, the people will be good. The nature of the Superior Man is like the wind, the nature of the inferior man is like the grass. When the wind blows over the grass, it always bends." (12:19) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this wind and grass simile, ''de'' clearly does not mean moral "virtue", but something like "nature; character". Compare these two semantically similar usages.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Heaven gave birth to the virtue within me. What can Huan T'ui [who wanted to kill Confucius] do to me?" (7:22) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "The Southerners have a saying: 'If a man is not constant in his self-cultivation, he cannot be a shaman or a healer.' It is a good proverb. If you are not consistently developing your virtue, what can you give to others? You will not even be able to give a diagnosis." (13:22) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Confucius recurrently disparaged his [[Spring and Autumn period]] contemporaries for having diminished their natural ''de'' virtue. One notably ironic ''Analects'' passage accuses the Master himself of having lost it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chieh Yu, the madman of Ch'u, passed by Confucius, singing: "Phoenix! Phoenix! How your virtue has declined! Your past cannot be corrected, But your future is yet to come. Give up! Give up! Those who involve themselves in Government now Will be in danger." Confucius jumped down, wanting to talk to him, but he ran away, so Confucius couldn't talk to him. (18:5) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here are some Confucian quotations about the rarity of people who possessed true ''de'' "virtue".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Yu, those who understand virtue are few and far between." (15:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Even over a long period of time, there have been few people who have actualized the Mean into Manifest Virtue." (6:27) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "I have never seen one who loves virtue as much as he loves sex." (9:17, repeated in 14:12) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "The virtuous will certainly have something to say, but those who have something to say are not necessarily virtuous. The humane man is always brave, but the brave man is not necessarily possessed of humaneness." (14.5) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Clever words disrupt virtue. Lack of patience in small matters leads to the disruption of great plans." (15:26) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "The 'conventional townsman' is a thief of virtue." (17:13, cf. Mencius 7B:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "To apprehend the Tao and lecture on it before actualization is to throw away your accumulation of virtue." (17:14) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This last quote implies that ''de'' can be accumulated, and Confucius was not completely pessimistic about virtue going astray. For example (14:6), he praised his disciple [[Disciples of Confucius#Nangong Kuo|Nangong Kuo]] as "a Superior Man, a man of enhanced virtue." These four contexts describe ''de'' as a measurable force that one can "return," "cultivate," "extend," and "heighten".
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Tseng Tzu]] said: "When they are careful (about their parents) to the end and continue in reverence after (their parents) are long gone, the virtue of the people will return to its natural depth." (1:9) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "Having virtue and not cultivating it; studying and not sifting; hearing what is just and not following; not being able to change wrongdoing: these are the things that make me uncomfortable." (7:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Tzu Chang said: "Keeping one's virtue without extending it; trusting the Tao without enriching it. What can you gain? And what can you get rid of?" (19:2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fan Chih, while strolling with the Master among the Rain Dance altars, said, "May I ask how to heighten virtue, overcome wickedness and resolve delusion?" The Master said, "An excellent question! If you take care of your responsibilities before you seek your own gain, won't this heighten your virtue? If you attack your own evil rather than the evil of others, won't you overcome wickedness? If, because of a moment's anger, you endanger your own life, as well as that of your parents, is this not delusion?" (12:21) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The ''Great Learning''===
The ''[[Da Xue]]'' or "Great Learning" is an early Confucianist text that was transmitted as a ''[[Liji]]'' chapter. The brief main passage, which is attributed to Confucius, repeats the phrase ''ming mingde'' (明明德 "brighten the bright ''de''"), which Legge translates "illustrate illustrious virtue".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The way of great learning consists in manifesting one's bright virtue, consists in loving the people, consists in stopping in perfect goodness. … The ancients who wanted to manifest their bright virtue to all in the world first governed well their own states. (tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The received ''Great Learning'' includes nine commentaries. The first one was supposedly written by [[Zeng Zi]], a disciple of Confucius. It explains ''mingde'' by quoting three ''[[Shujing]]'' sections, an otherwise unknown bathtub inscription of King [[Tang of Shang]], and a ''[[Shijing]]'' ode.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the "Announcement to K'ang" it is said, "He was able to [明德] manifest his virtue." The "T'ai-chia" says, "He contemplated Heaven's unveiled mandate." The "[[Canon of Yao]]" says, "he was able to [明峻德] manifest his lofty virtue." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The inscription of the bath of King T'ang said, "If you renew yourself for one day, you can renew yourself daily, and continue to do so." In the "Announcement of K'ang" it says, "carry out the renewal of the people." The ''Book of Odes'' says, "Even though Chou was an ancient state, its mandate was sustained anew." Therefore there is nothing in which the Superior Man does not fully exert himself. (tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The ''Doctrine of the Mean''===
The ''Zhongyong'' or ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', which like the "Great Learning" above was included in the ''Liji'', uses ''de'' 22 times.

While Confucianist texts generally describe the ''de'' of humans, one passage portrays that of ''guishen'' (鬼神 "ghosts and spirits; gods").
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius said: "The overabundance of the [德] power of spiritual beings is truly amazing! Looking for them, they cannot be seen. Listening for them, they cannot be heard. There is nothing that they do not embody. They cause the people of the world to fast for purification, and wear beautiful clothes in order to participate at the sacrifices. They are overflowing, seeming to be above, seeming to be on the left and on the right. The ''Book of Odes'' says: 'Trying to investigate the spirits, we cannot reach them. How could we possibly grasp them with our thoughts?' The manifestation of the subtle and the inconcealability of sincerity is like this."(16, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Note how the ''Doctrine of the Mean'' attributes almost mystical powers to ''cheng'' (誠 "sincerity; truth; honesty").
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sincerity is just 'perfecting' and the Way is just 'following.' Sincerity is the beginning and end of all things. Without sincerity there is nothing. Thus the Superior Man values the process of "becoming-sincere." But sincerity is not "just-perfecting"; it also means "perfecting all things." To perfect yourself, you need ''jen''. To perfect others, you need wisdom. The [德] virtue of our nature is that it is none other than the Way by which inner and outer are merged. Thus we can always use it to set things right. (25, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Only that person who has fully actualized sincerity is able to adjust the strings of the Great Net of the World; is able to establish himself in the Great Root of the World; is able to understand the transformations and the nurturing of Heaven and Earth. So sincere is his ''jen''; so unfathomable is his depth; so vast is his spaciousness. Who is able to understand this, but one who has the firm, acute, luminous sagely intelligence – who is permeated with [天德] Heavenly Virtue? (32, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two passages use the compound ''dade'' (大德 "big/great ''de'').
&lt;blockquote&gt;What a good son was Shun (the sage emperor)! His [德] virtue was that of a sage, he was venerated as an emperor. His wealth included everything within the [[Four Seas]]. He is sacrificed to in the ancestral temple, and his sons and grandsons have preserved his name. Therefore we can say that the [大德] greatly virtuous always attain their appropriate position, always receive their proper reward, always get their recognition and are always long-lived. (17, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Confucius transmitted the legacy of (sage-emperors) Yao and Shun and modeled his character on that of (sage-kings) Wen and Wu. He was ruled by the Heavenly seasons from above, and combined the Earth and Waters below. He was like Heaven and Earth, which have nothing they do not support, and nothing they do not cover. His function was like the revolution of the four seasons, the alternation of sun and moon. He nourishes the myriad things and they grow up together without harming each other, and they follow their courses simultaneously without interfering with each other. His [小德] smaller power is like the rivers and streams. His [大德] great power is seen in deep transformations. This is why Heaven and Earth are called "great." (30, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Doctrine of the Mean'' also mentions the concept of ''zhide'' "perfect ''de''".
&lt;blockquote&gt;How great is the Way of the sage! Superabundant, it develops all things, extending up to Heaven. How excellent it is! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of conduct; it waits for the right person and then functions. Hence it is said: "If you do not [至德] perfect your virtue, the [至道] perfect Way cannot be actualized." Therefore the Superior Man esteems his [德] virtuous nature and follows the path of inquiry, extending himself in breadth and greatness, penetrating all subtleties, penetrating its height and brilliance, following the course of the actualization of the Mean. He reviews the old and learns the new, thickening his character through the valorization of propriety. (27, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The ''Mencius''===
''De'' 德 "virtue; character" occurs 41 times in the ''Mengzi'' or ''[[Mencius]]''. Many occurrences are in quotations, for instance 6A6 and 6A17 quote ''Shijing'' odes 260 and 247. Mencius frequently quotes Confucius about ''de''; 3A4 quotes the ''Lunyu'' 12:19 wind and grass metaphor, and 7B37 quotes 17:13 about "Conventional townsmen are thieves of virtue."  Three common ''de'' thematic usages are that wise rulers can utilize its powers, should employ people with ''de'', and should understand how it affects friendship.

The first and most frequent Mencian teaching is that a ruler should develop his ''de'' as a means of controlling people.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The king said: "What kind of [德] qualities are necessary for real kingship?" Mencius said: "Take care of the people, and no one can oppose you." (1A7, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was king Wen, moreover, with all the virtue which belonged to him; and who did not die till he had reached a hundred years — and still his influence had not penetrated throughout the kingdom. (2A1, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, "He who uses force as a pretense of Humaneness is the de-facto strongman among the princes. But such a strongman must have a large state in order to be effective. The man who uses his virtue to practice Humaneness is the true king. To be a real king you don't need an especially large territory. T'ang did it with only seventy li and King Wen did it with only one hundred li. When you use your power to force people into submission, they will never submit with their hearts; it is only because they don't have enough strength to resist. When people submit to virtue, they are happy from the bottom of their hearts, and they submit sincerely, the way the seventy disciples submitted to Confucius." (2A3, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'When right government prevails in the kingdom, princes of little virtue are submissive to those of great, and those of little worth to those of great. When bad government prevails in the kingdom, princes of small power are submissive to those of great, and the weak to the strong. Both these cases are the rule of Heaven. They who accord with Heaven are preserved, and they who rebel against Heaven perish. (4A7, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say, "When the disposal of the kingdom came to Yü, his virtue was inferior to that of Yâo and Shun, and he transmitted it not to the worthiest but to his son." Was it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it was not so. When Heaven gave the kingdom to the worthiest, it was given to the worthiest. When Heaven gave it to the son of the preceding sovereign, it was given to him. … 'In the case of a private individual obtaining the throne, there must be in him virtue equal to that of Shun or Yü; and moreover there must be the presenting of him to Heaven by the preceding sovereign. It was on this account that Confucius did not obtain the throne.' (5A6, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'The administration of government is not difficult — it lies in not offending the great families. He whom the great families affect, will be affected by the whole State; and he whom any one State affects, will be affected by the whole kingdom. When this is the case, such an [sic] one's virtue and teachings will spread over all within the four seas like the rush of water.' (4A6, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Confucius said, "The flowing progress of virtue is more rapid than the transmission of royal orders by stages and couriers."' (2A1, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Note how these last two examples describe rapidly flowing powers of ''de''.

The second related theme is that rulers should seek out and employ those individuals who have ''de''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If a prince hates disgrace, the best course for him to pursue, is to esteem virtue and honour virtuous scholars, giving the worthiest among them places of dignity, and the able offices of trust. (2A2, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said: "Humaneness brings glory and non-Humaneness brings disgrace. So if you hate disgrace but still involve yourself in what is not Humaneness, it is like hating moisture and living in a basement. If you really hate it, you should honor virtue and respect the good. Install good men into positions of rank and give jobs to people of ability." (2A4, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore a prince who is to accomplish great deeds will certainly have ministers whom he does not call to go to him. When he wishes to consult with them, he goes to them. The prince who does not honour the virtuous, and delight in their ways of doing, to this extent, is not worth having to do with. (2B7, tr. Legge 214) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chien asked, "How do you go about 'just being content'?" Mencius said, "If you value virtue and enjoy Rightness, you can be content. Hence the gentleman in dire straits does not lose his sense of Rightness, and when successful, does not lose the Path. Since he does not lose his sense of Rightness when in dire straits, the gentleman is able to keep a grasp on himself. Since he does not lose the Path when he becomes successful, the people are not disappointed in him." (7A9, tr. Muller) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hsien-ch'iû Mang asked Mencius, saying, 'There is the saying, "A scholar of complete virtue may not be employed as a minister by his sovereign, nor treated as a son by his father." … Mencius replied, 'No. These are not the words of a superior man. They are the sayings of an uncultivated person of the east of Qi.' (5A4, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A third theme in ''Mencius'' is the connection between ''de'' and friendship.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'I venture to ask the principles of friendship.' Mencius replied, 'Friendship should be maintained without any presumption on the ground of one's superior age, or station, or the circumstances of his relatives. Friendship with a man is friendship with his virtue, and does not admit of assumptions of superiority.' (5B12, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the frequent interviews of the duke Mû with Tsze-sze, he one day said to him, "Anciently, princes of a thousand chariots have yet been on terms of friendship with scholars — what do you think of such an intercourse?" Tsze-sze was displeased, and said, "The ancients have said, 'The scholar should be served:' how should they have merely said that he should be made a friend of?" When Tsze-sze was thus displeased, did he not say within himself, — "With regard to our stations, you are sovereign, and I am subject. How can I presume to be on terms of friendship with my sovereign! With regard to our virtue, you ought to make me your master. How can you be on terms of friendship with me?" Thus, when a ruler of a thousand chariots sought to be on terms of friendship with a scholar, he could not obtain his wish — how much less could he call him to his presence!' (5B16, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One final example of Confucian ''de'' usages is this context where the word has a markedly negative meaning, semantically opposed to moral "virtue".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'Qiu acted as chief officer to the head of the Ji family, whose [德] evil ways he was unable to change, while he exacted from the people double the grain formerly paid.' (4A14, tr. Legge) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In divination==
Several [[Mawangdui]] (before 168 BCE) texts named ''Xingde'' 刑德 ("Punishment and Virtue") describe De as a mantic function related to the [[sexagenary cycle]] and the astronomical notion of the ''Nine Palaces'' ([[:zh:九宮]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kalinowski. The "Xingde" Texts from [[Mawangdui]]. "Early China" 23-24. 1998-99:125-202&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Didacticism''' is a philosophy that emphasizes instructional and informative qualities in [[literature]] and other types of [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2940819/Whats_Wrong_with_Didacticism What’s Wrong with Didacticism?] Academia.edu, Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/HSH/Whitec/terms/D/didactic.htm Didactic Literature or Didacticism], [[University of Houston–Clear Lake]], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term has its origin in the [[Ancient Greek]] word διδακτικός (''didaktikos''), "related to [[education]] and teaching", and signified learning in a fascinating and intriguing manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI8315998/ RELIGIOUS AWAKENING STORIES IN LATE MEDIEVAL JAPAN: THE DYNAMICS OF DIDACTICISM], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Didactic art was meant both to entertain and to instruct. Didactic plays, for instance, were intended to convey a moral theme or other rich truth to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://literarydevices.net/didacticism/ Didacticism in Morality Plays], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/general/glossary.htm#d Glossary of Literary Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103044158/http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/general/glossary.htm |date=2013-11-03 }}, The University of North Carolina at Pembroke, Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt; An example of didactic writing is [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' (1711), which offers a range of advice about critics and criticism. An example of didactism in music is the chant ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', which was used by [[Guido of Arezzo]] to teach [[Solfège|solfege]] syllables.

Around the 19th century the term ''didactic'' came to also be used as a criticism for work that appears to be overburdened with instructive, factual, or otherwise educational information, to the detriment of the enjoyment of the reader (a meaning that was quite foreign to Greek thought). [[Edgar Allan Poe]] called didacticism the worst of "heresies" in his essay ''[[The Poetic Principle]]''.

{{other uses2|Dignitas}}
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}

'''''Dignitas''''' is a [[Latin]] word referring to a unique, intangible, and culturally subjective [[Society|social]] concept in the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] mindset. The word does not have a direct translation in [[English language|English]]. Some interpretations include "[[dignity]]", which is a ''derivation'' from "dignitas", and "[[:wikt:prestige|prestige]]" or "charisma".

With respect to ancient Rome, ''dignitas'' was regarded as the sum of the personal clout and influence that a male citizen acquired throughout his life. When weighing the ''dignitas'' of a particular individual, factors such as personal reputation, moral standing, and ethical worth had to be considered, along with the man's entitlement to respect and proper treatment.

==Origins==
Authors who had used ''dignitas'' extensively in their writings and oratories include [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Tacitus]], and [[Livy]]. The most prolific user was Cicero, who initially related it to the established term ''[[auctoritas]]'' ([[authority]]). These two words were highly associated, with the latter defined as the expression of a man's ''dignitas''.

==Personal significance==
The cultivation of ''dignitas'' in ancient Rome was extremely personal. Men of all classes, most particularly noblemen of [[consul]]ar families, were highly protective and zealous of this asset. This is because every man who took on a higher political office during the [[Roman Republic]] considered ''dignitas'' as comprising much more than just his dignity. It referred to his "good name" (his past and present [[reputation]], achievement, standing, and honor). Its importance within the [[Social class in ancient Rome| hierarchical classes of Roman society ]] meant many historical figures would kill, commit [[suicide]] (e.g. [[Mark Antony]]), or enter [[exile]] in order to preserve their ''dignitas''.

==Influence on conflict==
The personal significance of one's ''dignitas'' had encouraged several conflicts in ancient Rome. [[Florus]] claimed that the stubbornness of [[Cato the Younger]] had driven [[Pompeius Magnus]] to prepare defenses in order to build up his ''dignitas''. Cicero wrote that Caesar valued his status so greatly that he did not want anyone to be his equal in ''dignitas''. [[Aulus Hirtius]] had written that [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 51 BC)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], who was one of the instigators of Caesar’s recall from Gaul, had attempted to build all of his own reputation on his success on turning people’s feelings against Caesar. Whether the exact term was used much during these times is unknown; however, the concept of ''dignitas'' was certainly influential and worth fighting for.

==Changing definition==
Over the course of ancient Roman history, ''dignitas'' had never taken on all of the aforementioned descriptions simultaneously. The term took on different meanings over time, adjusting for the gradually changing viewpoints of society, politicians, and the various authors.

Years after Caesar's death, his heir [[Augustus]] rejected the contemporary meaning of ''dignitas''. Augustus found the related term ''[[auctoritas]]'' to be a suitable alternative.

In 46 BC, Cicero cited the ambiguous nature of the concept of ''dignitas''. He wrote, "And so I have, if loyal feeling for the state and winning good men's approval of those loyal feelings is all that ''dignitas'' amounts to; but if in ''dignitas'' you include the power of translating those loyal feelings into action or of defending them with complete freedom, then ''ne vestigium quidem ullum est reliquum nobis dignitatis'' [not even a trace is left to us of our dignity]."

==Combination of dignitas and otium==
When paired with the term ''[[otium]]'', the word ''dignitas'' took on a different meaning. Cicero did not consider himself worthy of having ''dignitas'' alone because he felt that&amp;mdash;by turning his back on the Roman public&amp;mdash;he had neglected the duty of one whose life had normally exemplified the concept. He then altered the definition to mean "[lifetime] impact," to better describe his unique status. By this time, Cicero's political life had ended, and he labeled his past political influence as his ''dignitas'', and his present standing as ''otium''.

[[File:Substance.JPG|thumb|Classification of the six eternal substances]]
{{Jainism}}
'''Dravya''' ({{lang-hi|द्रव्य}}) is a term used to refer to a substance. According to the [[Jain philosophy]], the universe is made up of six eternal substances: sentient beings or souls (''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jīva]]''), non-sentient substance or matter (''[[pudgala]]''), principle of motion (''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''), the principle of rest (''[[adharma]]''), space (''[[Ākāśa (Jainism)|ākāśa]]'') and time (''[[kāla (time)|kāla]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 1 of  Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grimes&gt;Grimes, John (1996). Pp.118–119&lt;/ref&gt; The latter five are united as the ''ajiva'' (the non-living). As per the [[Sanskrit]] etymology, ''dravya'' means substances or entity, but it may also mean real or fundamental categories.&lt;ref name="grimes"/&gt;

Jain philosophers distinguish a substance from a body, or thing, by declaring the former as a simple element or reality while the latter as a compound of one or more substances or atoms. They claim that there can be a partial or total destruction of a body or thing, but no substance can ever be destroyed. {{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=15}}

==Jīva (living entity)==
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)}}
According to [[Jain philosophy]], this universe consists of infinite ''[[jiva]]s'' or souls that are uncreated and always existing. There are two main categories of souls: un-liberated mundane embodied souls that are still subject to transmigration and rebirths in this '' [[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]] '' due to [[Karma in Jainism|karmic bondage]] and the [[Siddha|liberated souls]] that are free from birth and death. All souls are intrinsically pure but are found in bondage with karma since beginning-less time. A soul has to make efforts to eradicate the karmas attain its true and pure form.

10th-century [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] [[Nemichandra]] describes the soul in ''[[Dravyasamgraha]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The sentient substance (soul) is characterized by the function of understanding, is incorporeal, performs [[Karma in Jainism|actions]] (doer), is co-extensive with its own body. It is the enjoyer (of its actions), located in the world of rebirth ([[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]) (or) emancipated '' ([[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]]) '' (and) has the intrinsic movement upwards.|''Dravyasaṃgraha'' (2)}}

The qualities of the soul are ''chetana'' (consciousness) and ''upyoga'' (knowledge and perception). Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither really destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearing of one state and appearing of another state and these are merely the modes of the soul. Thus Jiva with its attributes and modes, roaming in ''samsara'' (universe), may lose its particular form and assume a new one. Again this form may be lost and the original acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar, Prof. A. Chakravarti (2005). verses 16–21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ajiva (five non-living entities)==
{{Main|Ajiva}}

=== Pudgala (Matter)===
{{Main|Pudgala}}
Matter is classified as solid, liquid, gaseous, energy, fine Karmic materials and extra-fine matter i.e. ultimate particles. ''Paramāṇu'' or ultimate particle (atoms or sub-atomic particles) is the basic building block of all matter. It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (''varna''), a taste (''rasa''), a smell (''gandha''), and a certain kind of palpability (''sparsha'', touch).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}} One of the qualities of the ''paramāṇu'' and ''pudgala'' is that of permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its basic qualities remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John (1996). p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot be created nor destroyed and the total amount of matter in the universe remains the same.

=== Dharma ===
{{Main|Dharma (Jainism)}}
''Dharma'' means the principles of Motion that pervade the entire universe. Dharma and Adharma are by themselves not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without ''Dharma'' motion is not possible. The medium of motion helps matter and the sentient that are prone to motion to move, like water (helps) fish. However, it does not set in motion those that do not move.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adharma ===
Without ''adharma'', rest and stability is not possible in the universe. The principle of rest helps matter and the sentient that are liable to stay without moving, like the shade helps travellers. It does not stabilize those that move.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.11&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Champat Rai Jain]]:{{quote|The necessity of Adharma as the accompanying cause of rest, that is, of cessation of motion will be clearly perceived by any one who will put to himself the question, how jīvas and bodies of matter support themselves when coming to rest from a state of motion. Obviously gravitation will not do, for that is concerned with the determination of the direction which a moving body may take...&lt;ref name = "key"/&gt;}}

=== Ākāśa (space) ===
Space is a substance that accommodates the living souls, the matter, the principle of motion, the principle of rest and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kāla (time)===
{{Main|Kāla (time)}}
''Kāla'' is a real entity according to Jainism and is said to be the cause of continuity and succession. Champat Rai Jain in his book "''The Key of Knowledge'' wrote:&lt;ref name = "key"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=520–530}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|...As a substance which assists other things in performing their ‘temporal’ gyrations, Time can be conceived only in the form of whirling posts. That these whirling posts, as we have called the units of Time, cannot, in any manner, be conceived as parts of the substances that revolve around them, is obvious from the fact that they are necessary for the continuance of all other substances, including souls and atoms of matter which are simple ultimate units, and cannot be imagined as carrying a pin each to revolve upon. Time must, therefore, be considered as a separate substance which assists other substances and things in their movements of continuity.|[[Champat Rai Jain]]}} Jaina philosophers call the substance of Time as ''Niścay'' Time to distinguish it from ''vyavhāra'' (practical) Time which is a measure of duration- hours, days and the like.&lt;ref name = "key"/&gt;

==Astikaya==
[[File:Dravya.jpeg|thumb|270px|Chart showing the classification of ''dravya'' and ''astikaya'']]
Out of the six ''dravyas'', five except time have been described as ''astikayas'', that is, extensions or conglomerates. Since like conglomerates, they have numerous space points, they are described as ''astikaya''. There are innumerable space points in the sentient substance and in the media of motion and rest, and infinite ones in space; in matter they are threefold (i.e. numerable, innumerable and infinite). Time has only one; therefore it is not a conglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the corresponding conglomerates or extensions are called—''jivastikaya'' (soul extension or conglomerate), ''pudgalastikaya'' (matter conglomerate), ''dharmastikaya'' (motion conglomerate), ''adharmastikaya'' (rest conglomerate) and ''akastikaya'' (space conglomerates). Together they are called ''pancastikaya'' or the five ''astikayas''.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Sikdar (2001) p. 1107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes of Dravya==
These substances have some common attributes or gunas such as:&lt;ref name=nemi&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; J. L. Jaini (1927) p. 4 (of introduction)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Astitva'' (existence): indestructibility; permanence; the capacity by which a substance cannot be destroyed.
*''Vastutva'' (functionality): capacity by which a substance has function.
*''Dravyatva'' (changeability): capacity by which it is always changing in modifications.
*''Prameyatva'' (knowability): capacity by which it is known by someone, or of being the subject-matter of knowledge.
*''Agurulaghutva'' (individuality): capacity by which one attribute or substance does not become another and the substance does not lose the attributes whose grouping forms the substance itself.
*''Pradeshatva'' (spatiality): capacity of having some kind of location in space.

There are some specific attributes that distinguish the dravyas from each other:&lt;ref name="nemi"/&gt;
*''Chetanatva'' (consciousness) and ''amurtavta'' (immateriality) are common attributes of the class of substances soul or jiva.
*''Achetanatva'' (non-consciousness) and ''murtatva'' (materiality) are attributes of matter.
*''Achetanatva'' (non-consciousness) and ''amurtavta'' (immateriality) are common to Motion, Rest, Time and Space.

'''Eudaimonia'''  ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:εὐδαιμονία|εὐδαιμονία]] {{IPA-el|eu̯dai̯moníaː|}}), sometimes [[anglicized]] as '''eudaemonia''' or '''eudemonia''' {{IPAc-en|j|uː|d|ɪ|ˈ|m|oʊ|n|i|ə}}, is a Greek word commonly translated as [[happiness]] or [[welfare]]; however, "human [[flourishing]] or [[prosperity]]" has been proposed as a more accurate translation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel N.

It is a central concept in [[Aristotelian ethics]] and [[political philosophy]], along with the terms "[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]", most often translated as "[[virtue]]" or "excellence", and "[[phronesis]]", often translated as "practical or ethical wisdom".&lt;ref name=twsJun5e&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosalind Hursthouse|title=Virtue Ethics|publisher=''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''|quote=But although modern virtue ethics does not have to take the form known as "neo-Aristotelian", almost any modern version still shows that its roots are in ancient Greek philosophy by the employment of three concepts derived from it. These are areté (excellence or virtue) phronesis (practical or moral wisdom) and eudaimonia (usually translated as happiness or flourishing.) As modern virtue ethics has grown and more people have become familiar with its literature, the understanding of these terms has increased, but it is still the case that readers familiar only with modern philosophy tend to misinterpret them.|date=July 18, 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Aristotle]]'s works, eudaimonia (based on older Greek tradition) was used as the term for the highest human good, and so it is the aim of practical philosophy, including [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]], to consider (and also experience) what it really is, and how it can be achieved.

Discussion of the links between virtue of character (''ēthikē aretē'') and happiness ''(eudaimonia)'' is one of the central concerns of ancient ethics, and a subject of much disagreement. As a result there are many varieties of eudaimonism. Two of the most influential forms are those of Aristotle&lt;ref name=twsJun5a&gt;{{cite news|author=Verena von Pfetten|title=5 Things Happy People Do|publisher=''Huffington Post''|quote=But researchers now believe that eudaimonic well-being may be more important. Cobbled from the Greek eu ("good") and daimon ("spirit" or "deity"), eudaimonia means striving toward excellence based on one's unique talents and potential—Aristotle considered it to be the noblest goal in life. In his time, the Greeks believed that each child was blessed at birth with a personal daimon embodying the highest possible expression of his or her nature. One way they envisioned the daimon was as a golden figurine that would be revealed by cracking away an outer layer of cheap pottery (the person's baser exterior).

Aristotle takes virtue and its exercise to be the most important constituent in eudaimonia but acknowledges also the importance of external goods such as health, wealth, and beauty.

A number of considerations tell against this interpretation, however. One such consideration is merely an ''ex silentio'' appeal. No Stoic source, to my knowledge, suggests that actions may be justified with respect to anything other than what contributes to the end of happiness, and virtue alone does this in the Stoics view. A few texts, moreover, are explicit on this point. Cicero's summary of Stoics' ethics in ''De finibus'' 3 considers and rejects the suggestion that Stoic theory is implicitly committed to two final ends, virtue and a life that accords with nature, where these are conceived as independent objectives at which a rational agent might aim... Independent, that is, in the strong sense according to which one of these rational objectives may be realized while the other is not. See Irwin (2007), p. 316: 'Virtuous action. therefore, is not sufficient for achieving the life according to nature, which includes the natural advantages.' Irwin is certainly correct to point out that virtue is not sufficient for attaining the natural advantages, preferred indifferents such as health and wealth. But it is the Stoics' critics, not the Stoics themselves, who maintain that the actual possession of these items is a necessary condition of the life according to nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ''[[Definitions (Plato)|Definitions]]'', a dictionary of Greek philosophical terms attributed to [[Plato]] himself but believed by modern scholars to have been written by his immediate followers in  [[Platonic Academy|the Academy]],  provides the following definition of the word eudaimonia: "The good composed of all goods; an ability which suffices for living well; perfection in respect of virtue; resources sufficient for a living creature."

In his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (§21; 1095a15–22), Aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings, but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well; i.e. eudaimon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Verbally there is a very general agreement; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is [eudaimonia], and identify living well and faring well with being happy; but with regard to what [eudaimonia] is they differ, and the many do not give the same account as the wise. For the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure, wealth or honour… [1095a17]&lt;ref name=twsJun5c&gt;{{cite news|author=Aristotle, also David Ross, Lesley Brown|title=The Nicomachean Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|quote=Verbally there is very general agreement, for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement...|year=1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHkp7t6ISvEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Verbally+there+is+a+very+general+agreement%3B+for+both+the+general+run+of+men+and+people+of+superior+refinement+say+that+it+is&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QI2bp7lMzx&amp;sig=SVWPQlfkhX3jxPSss8KC-U-RIGw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fG0KTOaEEIL58AakkJmMBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=very%20general%20agreement&amp;f=false|accessdate= 2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So, as Aristotle points out, saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable, and means living well, is not saying very much. Everyone wants to be eudaimon; and everyone agrees that being eudaimon is related to faring well and to an individual's well being. The really difficult question is to specify just what sort of activities enable one to live well. Aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings. The candidates that he mentions are a (1) life of pleasure, (2) a life of political activity and (3) a philosophical life.

One important move in Greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy, "arete" ("[[virtue]]"). Aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of "virtuous activity in accordance with reason" [1097b22&amp;ndash;1098a20]. And even [[Epicurus]] who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue. So the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness (areté is bound up with eudaimonia). However, they disagree on the way in which this is so. We shall consider the main theories in a moment, but first a warning about the proper translation of areté.

As already noted, the Greek word areté is usually translated into English as "virtue". One problem with this is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense, which is not always what the ancients had in mind. For a Greek, areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics, for example, physical beauty. So it is important to bear in mind that the sense of ‘virtue' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom, courage and compassion. The sense of virtue which areté connotes would include saying something like "speed is a virtue in a horse", or "height is a virtue in a basketball player". Doing anything well requires virtue, and each characteristic activity (such as carpentry, flute playing, etc.) has its own set of virtues. The alternative translation "excellence" (or "a desirable quality") might be helpful in conveying this general meaning of the term. The moral virtues are simply a subset of the general sense in which a human being is capable of functioning well or excellently.

Positive Psychology defines Eudaimonia as a self-discovery, perceived development of one's best potentials, a sense of purpose and meaning in life, intense involvement in activities, investment of significant effort, and enjoyment of activities as personally expressive, deep relationships.&lt;ref&gt;https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/4275774/3168522.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and translation==
In terms of its etymology, eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from ''eu'' meaning "well" and ''daimon'' (daemon), which refers to a minor deity or a guardian spirit.&lt;ref name=twsJun5a/&gt;

Eudaimonia implies a positive and divine state of being that humanity is able to strive toward and possibly reach. A literal view of eudaimonia means achieving a state of being similar to benevolent deity, or being protected and looked after by a benevolent deity. As this would be considered the most positive state to be in, the word is often translated as 'happiness' although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate, or blessed. Despite this etymology, however, discussions of eudaimonia in ancient Greek ethics are often conducted independently of any super-natural significance.

In his ''Nicomachean Ethics,'' (1095a15&amp;ndash;22) [[Aristotle]] says that eudaimonia means 'doing and living well'. It is significant that synonyms for eudaimonia are living well and doing well. On the standard English translation, this would be to say that ‘[[happiness]] is doing well and living well'. The word ‘happiness' does not entirely capture the meaning of the Greek word. One important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind. For example, when we say that someone is "a very happy person", we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life. We mean to imply that they feel good about the way things are going for them. In contrast, eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one's experience of feeling happy may affect one's eudaimonia.

Eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence, but quite independently of whether we do know about them. Ascribing eudaimonia to a person, then, may include ascribing such things as being virtuous, being loved and having good friends. But these are all objective judgments about someone's life: they concern a person's really being virtuous, really being loved, and really having fine friends. This implies that a person who has evil sons and daughters will not be judged to be eudaimonic even if he or she does not know that they are evil and feels pleased and contented with the way they have turned out (happy). Conversely, being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you (and perhaps thought that they did not), but it would count towards your eudaimonia. So eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life, to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not. It includes conscious experiences of well being, success, and failure, but also a whole lot more. (See Aristotle's discussion: ''Nicomachean Ethics,'' book 1.10–1.11.)

Because of this discrepancy between the meaning of eudaimonia and happiness, some alternative translations have been proposed. W.D. Ross suggests "well-being" and John Cooper proposes "flourishing". These translations may avoid some of the misleading associations carried by "happiness" although each tends to raise some problems of its own. In some modern texts therefore, the other alternative is to leave the term in an English form of the original Greek, as "eudaimonia".

==Main views on eudaimonia and its relation to aretē==

===Socrates===
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates detail.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a painting.|French painter [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] portrayed the philosopher in ''[[The Death of Socrates]]'' (1787).]]
What we know of [[Socrates]]' philosophy is almost entirely derived from Plato's writings. Scholars typically divide Plato's works into three periods: the early, middle, and late periods. They tend to agree also that Plato's earliest works quite faithfully represent the teachings of Socrates and that Plato's own views, which go beyond those of Socrates, appear for the first time in the middle works such as the ''[[Phaedo]]'' and the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]].'' This division will be employed here in dividing up the positions of Socrates and Plato on eudaimonia.

As with all other ancient ethical thinkers, Socrates thought that all human beings wanted eudaimonia more than anything else. (see Plato, ''Apology'' 30b, ''Euthydemus'' 280d&amp;ndash;282d, ''Meno'' 87d&amp;ndash;89a). However, Socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism (see above): he seems to have thought that [[virtue]] is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. Socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control, courage, justice, piety, wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy (eudaimon) life. Virtues guarantee a happy life eudaimonia. For example, in the ''Meno'', with respect to wisdom, he says: "everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness" [''Meno'' 88c].

In the ''Apology,'' Socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure, when he chastises the Athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Good Sir, you are an Athenian, a [[citizenship|citizen]] of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the best possible state of your soul [29e].&lt;ref name=twsJun5d&gt;{{cite news|author=Uncertain|title=How "God" functioned in Socrates' life|publisher=DD:Religion|quote=Men of Athens, I am grateful and I am your friend, but I will obey the god rather than you, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to practice philosophy, to exhort you and in my usual way to point out to any of you whom I happen to meet: "Good Sir, you are an Athenian, a citizen of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth, or the best possible state of your soul?"|date=19 September 2008|url=http://www.ohiodialogues.org/nugget/how-god-functioned-socrates-life|accessdate=2010-06-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226163749/http://www.ohiodialogues.org/nugget/how-god-functioned-socrates-life|archivedate=26 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... it does not seem like human nature for me to have neglected all my own affairs and to have tolerated this neglect for so many years while I was always concerned with you, approaching each one of you like a father or an elder brother to persuade you to care for ''virtue''. [31a&amp;ndash;b; italics added]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It emerges a bit further on that this concern for one's soul, that one's soul might be in the best possible state, amounts to acquiring moral virtue. So Socrates' point that the Athenians should care for their souls means that they should care for their virtue, rather than pursuing honour or riches. Virtues are states of the soul. When a soul has been properly cared for and perfected it possesses the virtues. Moreover, according to Socrates, this state of the soul, moral virtue, is the most important good. The health of the soul is incomparably more important for eudaimonia than (e.g.) wealth and political power. Someone with a virtuous soul is better off than someone who is wealthy and honoured but whose soul is corrupted by unjust actions. This view is confirmed in the ''Crito'', where Socrates gets Crito to agree that the perfection of the soul, virtue, is the most important good:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And is life worth living for us with that part of us corrupted that unjust action harms and just action benefits? Or do we think that part of us, whatever it is, that is concerned with justice and injustice, is inferior to the body? Not at all. It is much more valuable…? Much more… (47e–48a)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here Socrates argues that life is not worth living if the soul is ruined by wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=twsJun5f&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Parry|title=Ancient Ethical Theory|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=Socrates says that a man worth anything at all does not reckon whether his course of action endangers his life or threatens death. He looks only at one thing — whether what he does is just or not, the work of a good or of a bad man (28b&amp;ndash;c).|date=Aug 7, 2009|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. A person who is not virtuous cannot be happy, and a person with virtue cannot fail to be happy. We shall see later on that Stoic ethics takes its cue from this Socratic insight.

===Plato===
Plato's great work of the middle period, the ''Republic'', is devoted to answering a challenge made by the [[sophist]] [[Thrasymachus]], that conventional morality, particularly the 'virtue' of justice, actually prevents the strong man from achieving eudaimonia. Thrasymachus's views are restatements of a position which Plato discusses earlier on in his writings, in the ''Gorgias'', through the mouthpiece of Callicles. The basic argument presented by Thrasymachus and Callicles is that justice (being just) hinders or prevents the achievement of eudaimonia because conventional morality requires that we control ourselves and hence live with un-satiated desires. This idea is vividly illustrated in book 2 of the ''Republic'' when Glaucon, taking up Thrasymachus' challenge, recounts a myth of the magical ring of Gyges. According to the myth, Gyges becomes king of Lydia when he stumbles upon a magical ring, which, when he turns it a particular way, makes him invisible, so that he can satisfy any desire he wishes without fear of punishment. When he discovers the power of the ring he kills the king, marries his wife and takes over the throne. The thrust of Glaucon's challenge is that no one would be just if he could escape the retribution he would normally encounter for fulfilling his desires at whim. But if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire, whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire, then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality. (This general line of argument reoccurs much later in the philosophy of [[Nietzsche]].) Throughout the rest of the ''Republic'', Plato aims to refute this claim by showing that the [[virtue of justice]] is necessary for eudaimonia.
[[File:Plato and Aristotle in The School of Athens, by italian Rafael.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[The School of Athens]] by [[Raffaello Sanzio]], 1509, showing [[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right)]]

The argument of the ''Republic'' is lengthy and complex. In brief, Plato argues that virtues are states of the soul, and that the just person is someone whose soul is ordered and harmonious, with all its parts functioning properly to the person's benefit. In contrast, Plato argues that the unjust man's soul, without the virtues, is chaotic and at war with itself, so that even if he were able to satisfy most of his desires, his lack of inner harmony and unity thwart any chance he has of achieving eudaimonia. Plato's ethical theory is eudaimonistic because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. On Plato's version of the relationship, virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia.

===Aristotle===
Aristotle's account is articulated in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''. In outline, for Aristotle, eudaimonia involves activity, exhibiting virtue (''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]'' sometimes translated as excellence) in accordance with [[reason]]. This conception of eudaimonia derives from Aristotle's [[essentialism|essentialist]] understanding of [[human nature]], the view that [[reason]] (''logos'' sometimes translated as [[rationality]]) is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work (''ergon'') of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason. Basically, well being (eudaimonia) is gained by proper development of one's highest and most human capabilities and human beings are "the rational animal". It follows that eudaimonia for a human being is the attainment of excellence (''areté'') in reason.

According to Aristotle, eudaimonia actually requires [[energeia|activity]], action, so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition. Eudaimonia requires not only good character but rational activity. Aristotle clearly maintains that to live in accordance with reason means achieving excellence thereby. Moreover, he claims this excellence cannot be isolated and so competencies are also required appropriate to related functions. For example, if being a truly outstanding scientist requires impressive math skills,  one might say "doing mathematics well is necessary to be a first rate scientist". From this it follows that eudaimonia, living well, consists in activities exercising the rational part of the psyche in accordance with the virtues or excellency of reason [1097b22&amp;ndash;1098a20]. Which is to say, to be fully engaged in the intellectually stimulating and fulfilling work at which one achieves well-earned success. The rest of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason. Since reason for Aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well, he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character, which enables a person to exercise his practical reason (i.e., reason relating to action) successfully.

Aristotle's ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. However, it is Aristotle's explicit view that virtue is necessary but not sufficient for eudaimonia. While emphasizing the importance of the rational aspect of the psyche, he does not ignore the importance of other ‘goods' such as friends, wealth, and power in a life that is eudaimonic. He doubts the likelihood of being eudaimonic if one lacks certain external goods such as ‘good birth, good children, and beauty'. So, a person who is hideously ugly or has "lost children or good friends through death" (1099b5–6), or who is isolated, is unlikely to be eudaimon. In this way, "dumb luck" ([[Chance (philosophy)|chance]]) can preempt one's attainment of eudaimonia.

===Epicurus===
[[File:Epicurus-PergamonMuseum.png|thumb|left|alt=Sculpture of a face.|[[Epicurus]] identified eudaimonia with the life of pleasure.]]
[[Epicurus]]' ethical theory is [[Hedonism|hedonistic]]. (His view proved very influential on the founders and best proponents of [[utilitarianism]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].) Hedonism is the view that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and that pain is the only intrinsic bad. An object, experience or state of affairs is intrinsically valuable if it is good simply because of what it is. Intrinsic value is to be contrasted with instrumental value. An object, experience or state of affairs is instrumentally valuable if it serves as a means to what is intrinsically valuable. To see this, consider the following example. Suppose a person spends their days and nights in an office, working at not entirely pleasant activities for the purpose of receiving money. Someone asks them "why do you want the money?", and they answer: "So, I can buy an apartment overlooking the ocean, and a red sports car." This answer expresses the point that money is instrumentally valuable because its value lies in what one obtains by means of it – in this case, the money is a means to getting an apartment and a sports car and the value of making this money dependent on the price of these commodities.

Epicurus identifies the good life with the life of pleasure. He understands eudaimonia as a more or less continuous experience of pleasure and, also, freedom from pain and distress. But it is important to notice that Epicurus does not advocate that one pursue any and every pleasure. Rather, he recommends a policy whereby pleasures are maximized "in the long run". In other words, Epicurus claims that some pleasures are not worth having because they lead to greater pains, and some pains are worthwhile when they lead to greater pleasures. The best strategy for attaining a maximal amount of pleasure overall is not to seek instant gratification but to work out a sensible long term policy.

Ancient Greek ethics is eudaimonist because it links virtue and eudaimonia, where eudaimonia refers to an individual's well being. Epicurus' doctrine can be considered eudaimonist since Epicurus argues that a life of pleasure will coincide with a life of virtue. He believes that we  do and ought to seek virtue because virtue brings pleasure. Epicurus' basic doctrine is that a life of virtue is the life which generates the most amount of pleasure, and it is for this reason that we ought to be virtuous. This thesis—the eudaimon life is the pleasurable life—is not a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] as "eudaimonia is the good life" would be: rather, it is the substantive and controversial claim that a life of pleasure and absence of pain is what eudaimonia consists in.

One important difference between Epicurus' eudaimonism and that of Plato and Aristotle is that for the latter virtue is a constituent of eudaimonia, whereas Epicurus makes virtue a means to happiness. To this difference, consider Aristotle's theory. Aristotle maintains that eudaimonia is what everyone wants (and Epicurus would agree). He also thinks that eudaimonia is best achieved by a life of virtuous activity in accordance with reason. The virtuous person takes pleasure in doing the right thing as a result of a proper training of moral and intellectual character (See e.g., ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1099a5). However, Aristotle does not think that virtuous activity is pursued for the sake of pleasure. Pleasure is a byproduct of virtuous action: it does not enter at all into the reasons why virtuous action is virtuous. Aristotle does not think that we literally aim for eudaimonia. Rather, eudaimonia is what we achieve (assuming that we aren't particularly unfortunate in the possession of external goods) when we live according to the requirements of reason. Virtue is the largest constituent in a eudaimon life.
By contrast, Epicurus holds that virtue is the means to achieve happiness. His theory is eudaimonist in that he holds that virtue is indispensable to happiness; but virtue is not a constituent of a eudaimon life, and being virtuous is not (external goods aside) identical with being eudaimon. Rather, according to Epicurus, virtue is only instrumentally related to happiness. So whereas Aristotle would not say that one ought to aim for virtue in order to attain pleasure, Epicurus would endorse this claim.

===The Stoics===
[[File:Raffael 070.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] thought happiness was a "good flow of life." ]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Zeno of Citium.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of a sculpture.|Zeno of Citium thought happiness was a "good flow of life."]] --&gt;
Stoic philosophy begins with [[Zeno of Citium]] c.300 BC, and was developed by [[Cleanthes]] (331&amp;ndash;232 BC) and [[Chrysippus]] (c.280–c.206 BC) into a formidable systematic unity.&lt;ref name=twsJun5g&gt;{{cite news|author=Dirk Baltzly|title=Stoicism|publisher=''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''|quote=But what is happiness? The Epicureans' answer was deceptively straightforward: the happy life is the one which is most pleasant. (But their account of what the highest pleasure consists in was not at all straightforward.) Zeno's answer was "a good flow of life" (Arius Didymus, 63A) or "living in agreement", and Cleanthes clarified that with the formulation that the end was "living in agreement with nature" (Arius Didymus, 63B). Chrysippus amplified this to (among other formulations) "living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature"; later Stoics inadvisably, in response to Academic attacks, substituted such formulations as "the rational selection of the primary things according to nature". The Stoics' specification of what happiness consists in cannot be adequately understood apart from their views about value and human psychology.|date=Feb 7, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno believed happiness was a "good flow of life"; Cleanthes suggested it was "living in agreement with nature", and Chrysippus believed it was "living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature".&lt;ref name=twsJun5g/&gt; Stoic ethics is a particularly strong version of eudaimonism. According to the Stoics, virtue is necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. (This thesis is generally regarded as stemming from the Socrates of Plato's earlier dialogues.) We saw earlier that the conventional Greek concept of arete is not quite the same as that denoted by ''virtue'', which has Christian connotations of charity, patience, and uprightness, since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty. However, the Stoic concept of arete is much nearer to the Christian conception of virtue, which refers to the moral virtues. However, unlike Christian understandings of virtue, righteousness or piety, the Stoic conception does not place as great an emphasis on mercy, forgiveness, self-abasement (i.e. the ritual process of declaring complete powerlessness and humility before God), charity and self-sacrificial love, though these behaviors/mentalities are not necessarily spurned by the Stoics (they are spurned by some other philosophers of Antiquity). Rather Stoicism emphasizes states such as justice, honesty, moderation, simplicity, self-discipline, resolve, fortitude, and courage (states which Christianity also encourages).

The Stoics make a radical claim that the eudaimon life is the morally virtuous life. Moral virtue is good, and moral vice is bad, and everything else, such as health, honour and riches, are merely "neutral".&lt;ref name=twsJun5g/&gt; The Stoics therefore are committed to saying that external goods such as wealth and physical beauty are not really good at all. Moral virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. In this, they are akin to [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers such as [[Antisthenes]] and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] in denying the importance to eudaimonia of external goods and circumstances, such as were recognized by Aristotle, who thought that severe misfortune (such as the death of one's family and friends) could rob even the most virtuous person of eudaimonia. This Stoic doctrine re-emerges later in the history of ethical philosophy in the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], who argues that the possession of a "good will" is the only unconditional good. One difference is that whereas the Stoics regard external goods as neutral, as neither good nor bad, Kant's position seems to be that external goods are good, but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness.

=="Modern Moral Philosophy"==
Interest in the concept of eudaimonia and ancient ethical theory more generally enjoyed a revival in the twentieth century. [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" (1958) argued that [[duty]]-based conceptions of morality are conceptually incoherent for they are based on the idea of a "law without a lawgiver".&lt;ref name=twsJun5h&gt;{{cite news|title=The ethics of virtue: The Ethics of Virtue and the Ethics of Right Action|publisher=wutsamada.com|quote=legalistic ethics rest on the incoherent notion of a "law" without a lawgiver: DCT unacceptable; and the alternative sources of moral "legislation" are inadequate substitutes|date=2010-06-05|url=http://www.wutsamada.com/alma/ethics/rachelsd.htm|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims a system of morality conceived along the lines of the [[Ten Commandments]] depends on someone having made these rules.&lt;ref name=twsJun5i&gt;{{cite news|author=G. E. M. Anscombe|title=Modern Moral Philosophy|publisher=Philosophy 33, No. 124|quote=Originally published in Philosophy 33, No. 124 (January 1958). ... The first is that it is not profitable for us at present to do moral philosophy; that should be laid aside at any rate until we have an adequate philosophy of psychology, in which we are conspicuously lacking. The second is that the concepts of obligation, and duty&amp;mdash;moral obligation and moral duty, that is to say—and of what is morally right and wrong, and of the moral sense of "ought", ought to be jettisoned if this is psychologically possible; because they are survivals, or derivatives from survivals, from an earlier conception of ethics which no longer generally survives, and are only harmful without it. My third thesis is that the differences between the well‑known English writers on moral philosophy from Sidgwick to the present day are of little importance.|date=January 1958|url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/cmt/mmp.html|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anscombe recommends a return to the eudaimonistic ethical theories of the ancients, particularly Aristotle, which ground morality in the interests and well being of human moral agents, and can do so without appealing to any such lawgiver.

[[Julia Driver]] in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anscombe's article ''Modern Moral Philosophy'' stimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to Utilitarianism, Kantian Ethics, and Social Contract theories. Her primary charge in the article is that, as secular approaches to moral theory, they are without foundation. They use concepts such as "morally ought", "morally obligated", "morally right", and so forth that are legalistic and require a legislator as the source of [[moral authority]]. In the past God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts.&lt;ref name=twsJun5j&gt;{{cite news|author=Julia Driver|title=Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe: 5.1 Virtue Ethics|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=In the past God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts.|date=Jul 21, 2009|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anscombe/#VirEth|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Models of eudaimonia in [[psychology]] emerged from early work on [[self-actualization]] and the means of its accomplishment by researchers such as [[Erik Erikson]], [[Gordon Allport]], and [[Abraham Maslow]].&lt;ref name=ryff1989&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryff | first1 = C.

Central theories are Diener's [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]], Ryff's [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]], Keyes work on [[flourishing]], and Seligman's contributions to positive psychology and his theories on ''authentic happiness'' and P.E.R.M.A. Related concepts are [[happiness]], [[flourishing]], [[quality of life]], [[contentment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[meaningful life]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2808">'''Goodsall's rule''' relates the external opening (in the perianal skin) of an [[anal fistula]] to its internal opening (in the anal canal). It states that if the perianal skin opening is posterior to the transverse anal line, the fistulous tract will open into the anal canal in the midline posteriorly, sometimes taking a curvilinear course. A perianal skin opening anterior to the transverse anal line is usually associated with a radial fistulous tract.

Or in more direct terms, it means that anterior-opening fistulas tend to follow a simple, direct course while posterior-opening fistulas may follow a devious, curving path with some even being horseshoe-shaped before opening in the posterior midline.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess BE. Chapter 88. Anorectal Disorders. In: Tintinalli JE, Stapczynski JS, Cline DM, Ma OJ, Cydulka RK, Meckler GD, eds. Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2011. http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=6361536. Accessed June 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fistula]]s can be described as [[Anterior#Anterior and posterior|anterior or posterior]] relating to a line drawn in the [[coronal plane]] across the [[anus]], the so-called transverse anal line. Anterior fistulas will have a direct track into the anal canal. Posterior fistulas will have a curved track with their external opening lying in the posterior midline of the [[anal canal]]. An exception to the rule are anterior fistulas lying more than 2.5 cm from the anus, which may have a curved track (similar to posterior fistulas) that opens into the posterior midline of the anal canal.

Goodsall's rule may not be applicable when the fistula is more than 2.5 cm from the anal verge. In such situations, the fistula is almost always indirect. In situations where there are multiple anal fistuale, the course would be similar to that of posterior-opening fistulae because of branching and communication between these openings.

The investigation of choice for anal fistulas is [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). Fistulograms can be used to demonstrate the track of the fistula.

Goodsall's rule is named after [[David Henry Goodsall]] who described it in 1900.

'''Graphic communication''' as the name suggests is [[communication]] using [[graphic]] elements. These elements include symbols such as [[glyph]]s and [[icon (computing)|icon]]s, images such as drawings and photographs, and can include the passive contributions of [[substrate (printing)|substrate]], color and surroundings. It is the process of creating, producing, and distributing material incorporating [[word]]s and [[image]]s to convey [[data]], [[concept]]s, and [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="GCC08"&gt;[http://teched.vt.edu/GCC/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html Definition of Graphic Communications] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306143724/http://www.teched.vt.edu/gcc/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html |date=2008-03-06 }} GRAPHIC COMM CENTRAL, 2008. Accessed 25 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of graphic communications encompasses all phases of the graphic communications processes from origination of the idea (design, layout, and typography) through reproduction, finishing and distribution of two- or three-dimensional products or electronic transmission.&lt;ref name="GCC08"/&gt;

== Overview ==
Graphic communication involves the use of visual material to relate ideas such as [[drawings]], [[photograph]]s, [[Photographic slide|slide]]s, and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. The drawings of plans and refinements and a rough map sketched to show the way could be considered graphical communication.

Any medium that uses a [[graphics]] to aid in conveying a [[message]], [[Education|instruction]], or an [[idea]] is involved in graphical communication. One of the most widely used forms of graphical communication is the [[drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Goetsch et al. (1999). ''Technical Drawing''. {{ISBN|0-7668-0531-X}}. p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are [[cave paintings]] and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period from 40,000–10,000 [[Before Christ|B.C.]] or earlier. Many of these played a major role in [[geometry]]. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

== Graphic communication topics ==
=== Graphics ===
[[Graphics]] are visual presentations on some surface, such as a wall, [[canvas]], computer screen, paper, or stone to [[brand]], inform, illustrate, or entertain. Examples are [[photograph]]s, [[drawings]], [[line art]], [[graphics|graphs]], [[diagrams]], [[typography]], [[number]]s, [[symbols]], [[geometric]] designs, [[map]]s, [[engineering drawings]], or other [[image]]s. Graphics often combine [[character (computer)|text]], [[illustration]], and [[color]]. [[Graphic design]] may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.

Graphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.

=== Communication ===
[[Communication]] is the process whereby information is imparted by a sender to a receiver via a [[media (communication)|medium]]. It requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. There are [[Sound|auditory]] means, such as speaking, singing and sometimes tone of voice, and [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal]], physical means, such as [[body language]], [[sign language]], [[paralanguage]], [[Haptic perception|touch]], [[eye contact]], by using [[writing]]. Communication is defined as a process by which we assign and [[convey]] meaning in an attempt to create shared understanding.  This process requires a vast repertoire of skills in [[intrapersonal]] and [[interpersonal]] processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, and evaluating. if you use these processes it is developmental and transfers to all areas of life: home, school, community, work, and beyond. It is through communication that [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]] occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communication |work=office of superintendent of Public instruction |location=Washington |url=http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/Communications/default.aspx |accessdate=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual communication ===
[[Visual communication]] as the name suggests is [[communication]] through visual aid. It is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Primarily associated with [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, it includes: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], colour and electronic resources. It solely relies on vision. It is a form of [[communication]] with visual effect. It explores the idea that a visual message with text has a greater power to inform, educate or [[persuade]] a person.  It is communication by presenting information through Visual form. The evaluation of a good visual design is based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on aesthetic or artistic preference.  There are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness.  There exists a variety of ways to present information visually, like [[gestures]], body languages, video and TV. Here, focus is on the presentation of text, pictures, diagrams, photos, et cetera, integrated on a computer display. The term visual presentation is used to refer to the actual presentation of information. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] use methods of visual communication in their professional practice.

=== Communication design ===
[[Communication design]] is a mixed discipline between design and information-development which is concerned with how  intermission such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, utilizing [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]].

=== Graphic design ===
The term [[graphic design]] can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation.  Various methods are used to create and combine symbols, images and/or words to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to produce the final result.  Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

Common uses of graphic design include magazines, advertisements, product packaging and web design.  For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece.  [[Composition (visual arts)|Composition]] is one of the most important features of graphic design especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.

=== Graphical representation ===
The term representation, according to O'Shaughnessy and Stadler (2005), can carry a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]] representation is commonly defined in three ways.
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation, according to Mitchell (1995), began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies. Aristotle discusses representation in three ways:&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995&gt;Mitchell, W. 1995, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', 2nd edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The object:'' The symbol being represented.
# ''Manner:'' The way the symbol is represented.
# ''Means:'' The material that is used to represent it.
The ''means'' of literary representation is [[language]]. The means of graphical representation are [[graphics]]. Graphical representation of data is one of the most commonly used modes of presentation.
The purpose of graphical communication is transfer message or information to the receiver in effective way.when professional organizations prepare reports then usually use the mode of graphical presentations.

'''Harry Gordon Frankfurt''' (born May 29, 1929) is an [[American philosopher]]. He is [[professor emeritus]] of [[philosophy]] at [[Princeton University]], where he taught from 1990 until 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/fraharg/biocv |title=Bio &amp;#124; Harry G. Frankfurt |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and previously taught at [[Yale University]], [[Rockefeller University]], and [[Ohio State University]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Frankfurt was born on May 29, 1929, in Pennsylvania. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1949 and [[Ph.D.]] in 1954 from [[Johns Hopkins University]].

===Career===
He is [[professor emeritus]] of [[philosophy]] at [[Princeton University]] and has previously taught at [[Yale University]], [[Rockefeller University]], and [[Ohio State University]].

His major areas of interest include [[moral philosophy]], [[philosophy of mind]] and [[philosophy of action|action]], and 17th-century [[rationalism]]. His 1986 paper ''[[On Bullshit]]'', a philosophical investigation of the concept of "bullshit", was republished as a book in 2005 and became a surprise [[bestseller]], leading to media appearances such as [[Jon Stewart]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]''. In 2006 he released a companion book, ''On Truth'', which explores society's loss of appreciation for truth.

Among philosophers, he was for a time best known for his interpretation of [[Descartes]]'s rationalism.  His most influential work, however, has been on [[freedom of the will]] (on which he has written numerous important papers&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg; Shafer-Landau: ''Reason &amp; Responsibility'', p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;) based on his concept of [[higher-order volition]]s and for developing what are known as "[[Frankfurt cases]]" or "Frankfurt counterexamples" (i.e., thought experiments designed to show the possibility of situations in which a person could not have done other than he/she did, but in which our intuition is to say nonetheless that this feature of the situation does not prevent that person from being morally responsible).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankfurt|first=Harry G.|date=1969-01-01|title=Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/oom/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=&amp;rft.imuse_id=jphil_1969_0066_0023_0829_0839&amp;svc_id=info:www.pdcnet.org/collection|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=66|issue=23|doi=10.2307/2023833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frankfurt is probably the leading living Humean compatibilist, developing Hume's view that to be free is to do what one wants to do.  (Others who develop this view are [[David Velleman]], Gary Watson and [[John Martin Fischer]].)  Frankfurt's version of [[compatibilism]] is  the subject of a substantial literature by other philosophy professors.  More recently, he has written on love and caring.

He is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He has been a Visiting Fellow of [[All Souls College]], [[Oxford University]]; he served as President, Eastern Division, [[American Philosophical Association]]; and he has received fellowships and grants from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and the [[Andrew Mellon Foundation]].

'''Human rights''' applied to '''encryption''' is an important concept for freedom of expression as encryption is a technical resource of implementation of basic human rights.

With the evolution of the [[digital age]], application of [[freedom of speech]] becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger. From a [[human rights]] perspective, there is a growing awareness that encryption is an important piece of the puzzle for realizing a free, open and trustworthy [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Cryptography]] is a long-standing subject in the field of [[mathematics]], [[computer science]] and [[engineering]]. It can generally be defined as "the protection of information and computation using mathematical techniques."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cryptology and Privacy, In: Van Der Sloot, Broeders and Schrijvers (eds.), Exploring the Boundaries of Big Data|last=Gürses|first=Seda|last2=Preneel|first2=Bart|publisher=Netherlands Scientific Council for Government Policy|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[OECD]] Guidelines, [[Encryption]] and cryptography are defined as follows: "Encryption" means the transformation of data by the use of cryptography to produce unintelligible data (encrypted data) to ensure its [[confidentiality]].  Cryptography" means the discipline which embodies principles, means, and methods for the transformation of data in order to hide its information content, establish its authenticity, prevent its undetected modification, prevent its repudiation, and/or prevent its unauthorized use.&lt;ref&gt;OECD guidelines&lt;/ref&gt; encryption and cryptography are "often used synonymously, although "cryptographic" has a broader technical meaning. For example, a [[digital signature]] is "cryptographic" but arguably it is not technically "encryption"".&lt;ref&gt;Ed Felten. Software backdoors and the White House NSA panel report.

The human rights aspects related to the availability and use of a technology of particular significance for the field of information and communication is recognised in many places. Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and recognized in [[international human rights law]] in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). Article 19 of the UDHR states that "everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice".&lt;ref&gt;Article 19, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights

== Overview ==

Since the 1970s, the availability of [[digital computing]] and the invention of [[Public-key cryptography|public key]] cryptography has made encryption more widely available. Previously, strong versions of encryption were the domain of [[nation state]] actors. However, since the year 2000, cryptographic techniques have been widely deployed by a variety of actors to ensure personal, commercial and [[public sector]] protection of information and communication. Cryptographic techniques are also used to protect [[anonymity]] of communicating actors and protecting [[privacy]] more generally. The availability and use of encryption continues to lead to complex, important and highly contentious legal policy debates. There are government statements and proposals on the need to curtail such usage and deployment in view of the potential hurdles it could present for access by [[government]] agencies. The rise of commercial services offering [[end-to-end encryption]] and the calls for restrictions and solutions in view of law enforcement access are pushing towards more and more debates around the use of encryption and the legal status of the deployment of cryptography more generally.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human rights and encryption|last=Wolfgang|first=Schulz|last2=van Hoboken|first2=Joris|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100185-7|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002465/246527e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encryption, as defined above, refers to a subset of cryptographic techniques for the protection of [[information]] and [[computation]]. The [[normative]] value of encryption, however, is not fixed but varies with the type of cryptographic method that is used or deployed and for which purposes. Traditionally, encryption (cypher) techniques were used to ensure the confidentiality of communications and prevent access to information and communications by others than intended recipients. Cryptography can also ensure the authenticity of communicating parties and the integrity of communications contents, providing a key ingredient for enabling trust in the [[digital environment]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a growing awareness within human rights that encryption plays an important role in realizing a free, open and trustworthy Internet. UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression [[David Kaye (law professor)|David Kaye]] observed, during the Human Rights Council in June 2015, that encryption and anonymity deserve a protected status under the rights to privacy and freedom of expression:

''"Encryption and anonymity, today's leading vehicles for online security, provide individuals with a means to protect their privacy, empowering them to browse, read, develop and share opinions and information without interference and enabling journalists, civil society organizations, members of ethnic or religious groups, those persecuted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, activists, scholars, artists and others to exercise the rights to freedom of opinion and expression."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keystones to foster inclusive knowledge societies: access to information and knowledge, freedom of expression, privacy and ethics on a global internet|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232563&amp;set=0059EDFBB1_1_85&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Encryption in media and communication ==

Two types of encryption in media and communication can be distinguished:
# Encryption in media and communication could be used as a result of choice of a service provider or deployed by Internet users. [[Client-side encryption]] tools and technologies are relevant for [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] communities, journalists and other online media actors practicing journalism as it becomes a way of protecting their rights.
# Encryption provided by [[service provider]]s can prevent unauthorized [[Third-party access|third party access]], but the service provider implementing it would still have access to the relevant user data. End-to-end encryption is an encryption technique that refers to encryption that also prevents service providers themselves from having access to the user's communications. The [[implementation]] of these forms of encryption have sparked the most debate since the year 2000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Service provider deployed techniques to prevent unauthorized third-party access ===

Amongst the most widely deployed cryptographic techniques is securing the [[Communication channel|communications channel]] between internet users and specific service providers from [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] attacks, access by unauthorized third parties. These cryptographic techniques must be run jointly by a user and the service provider to work. This means that they require service providers, such as an online news publisher or a [[Social networking service|social network]], to actively integrate them into service design and implementation. Users cannot deploy these techniques [[Unilateralism|unilaterally]]; their deployment is contingent on active participation by the service provider.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The [[Transport Layer Security|TLS protocol]], which becomes visible to the normal internet user through the [[HTTPS]] header, is widely used for securing online commerce, [[e-government]] services and health applications as well as devices that make up networked infrastructures, e.g., routers, cameras. However, although the standard has been around since 1990, the wider spread and evolution of the technology has been slow. As with other cryptographic methods and protocols, the practical challenges related to proper, secure and (wider) deployment are significant and have to be considered. Many service providers still do not implement TLS or do not implement it well.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In the context of [[wireless]] communications, the use of cryptographic techniques that protect communications from third parties are also important. Different standards have been developed to protect wireless communications: [[2G]], [[3G]] and [[4G]] standards for communication between mobile phones, base stations and base stations controllers; standards to protect communications between mobile devices and wireless routers ('[[Wireless LAN|WLAN]]'); and standards for local computer networks.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} One common weakness in these designs is that the transmission points of the wireless communication can access all communications e.g., the [[Telecommunications service provider|telecommunications provider]]. This vulnerability is exacerbated when wireless protocols only [[Authentication|authenticate]] user devices, but not the [[wireless access point]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Whether the data is stored on a device, or on a local server as in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], there is also a distinction between 'at rest'. Given the vulnerability of cellphones to theft for instance, particular attention may be given to limiting service provided access. This does not exclude the situation that the service provider discloses this information to third parties like other commercial entities or governments. The user needs to trust the service provider to act in its interests. The possibility that a service provider is legally compelled to hand over user information or to interfere with particular communications with particular users, remains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Privacy Enhancing Technologies ===

There are services that specifically [[Marketing|market]] themselves with claims not to have access to the content of their users' communication. Service Providers can also take measures that restrict their ability to access information and communication, further increasing the protection of users against access to their information and communications. The integrity of these [[Privacy-enhancing technologies|Privacy Enhancing Technologies]] (PETs), depends on delicate [[design]] decisions as well as the willingness of the service provider to be transparent and [[Accountability|accountable]].&lt;ref name="Human Rights" /&gt; For many of these services, the service provider may offer some additional features (besides the ability to communicate), for example contact list management—meaning that they can observe who is communicating with whom—but take technical measures so that they cannot read the contents of the messages. This has potentially negative implications for users, for instance, since the service provider has to take action to connect users who want to communicate using the service, it will also have the power to prevent users from communicating in the first place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following the discovery of [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]], there is a growing [[awareness]] that there needs to be more investment in the [[audit]]ing of widely used [[code]] coming out of the free and open [[software]] community. The pervasiveness of [[business model]]s that depend on collection and processing of user data can be an obstacle for adopting cryptographic mechanisms for protecting information at rest. As [[Bruce Schneier]], has stated:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''"[s]urveillance is the business model of the Internet. This has evolved into a shockingly extensive, robust, and profitable surveillance architecture. You are being tracked pretty much everywhere you go on the Internet, by many companies and [[data brokers]]: ten different companies on one site, a dozen on another."''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How We Sold Our Souls - and More - to the Internet Giants|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2015/05/how_we_sold_our_soul.html|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryptographic methods play a key role in [[online identity management]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Digital credential|Digital credential systems]] can be used to allow anonymous yet authenticated and accountable transactions between users and service providers, and can be used to build privacy preserving identity management systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hero or Villain: The Data Controller in Privacy Law and Technologies|last=Claudia Diaz, Omer Tene and Seda Gürses|first=|publisher=74 Ohio State Law Journal|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== End-user and community-driven encryption and collaborative services ===

The Internet allows [[End user|end-users]] to develop applications and uses of the network without having to coordinate with the relevant [[internet service provider]]s. Many of the available encryption tools are not developed or offered by traditional service providers or organizations but by [[expert]]s in the [[Free and open-source software|free and open software]] (FOSS) and Internet engineering communities. A major focus of these initiatives is to produce Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) that can be unilaterally or collaboratively deployed by interested users who are ready, willing, and able to look after their own privacy interests when interacting with service providers. These PETs include standalone encryption applications as well as [[browser add-on]]s that help maintain the confidentiality of web-based communications or permit anonymous access to online services. Technologies such as [[Keystroke logging|keystroke loggers]] can intercept content as it is entered before encryption is applied, thereby falling short of offering protection. Hacking into information systems and devices to access data at or after the moment of [[decryption]] may have the same effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Multi-party computation]] (MPC) techniques are an example of Collaboration|collaborative solutions that allow parties, e.g. [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] with sensitive data, to do [[Data analysis|data analytics]] without revealing their [[Data set|datasets]] to each other. All of these designs leverage encryption to provide privacy and [[security]] assurances in the absence of a trustworthy centralized authority.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are many developments in the implementations of [[Cryptocurrency|crypto-currencies]] using blockchain protocols. These systems can have many benefits and these [[Cryptographic protocol|protocol]]s can also be useful for novel forms of contracts and electronic attestation, useful aids when legal infrastructure are not readily available. As to the protection of privacy related to payments, it is a common misconception that the cryptographic techniques that are used in [[Bitcoin]] ensure anonymous payments. The only protection offered by Bitcoin is [[pseudonymity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bitcoinisnotanonymous.com/|title=See Bitcoin is NOT anonymous|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The cryptographic protection of metadata ===

The availability of [[metadata]] (the information relating to a user's information and communications behavior) can pose a particular threat to users including information that can be observed by service providers through the provisioning of services: when, how frequently, how long, and with whom users are communicating. Metadata can also be used to track people geographically and can interfere with their ability to communicate anonymously.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} As noted by the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society|Berkman Center]] report, metadata is generally not encrypted in ways that make it inaccessible for governments, and accordingly ''"provides an enormous amount of surveillance data that was unavailable before [internet communication technologies] became widespread."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Bekman Center|last=|first=|date=2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to minimize exposure of meaningful metadata, encryption tools may need to be used in combination with technologies that provide communication anonymity.
{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== The Onion Router ====
[[The Onion Router]], most commonly known as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], offers the ability to access websites and online services anonymously. Tor requires a community of volunteers to run intermediary proxies which channel a user's communication with a website so that third parties cannot observe who the user is communicating with. Through the use of encryption, each proxy is only aware of part of the communication path meaning that none of the proxies can by itself infer both the user and the website she is visiting. Besides protecting anonymity, Tor is also useful when the user's ISP blocks access to content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is similar as the protection that can be offered by a [[Virtual private network|VPN]]. Service providers, such as websites, can block connections that come from the Tor network. Because certain malicious traffic may reach service providers as Tor traffic and because Tor traffic may also interfere with the business models, service providers may have an [[incentive]] to do so. This interference can prevent users from using the most effective means to protect their anonymity online. The Tor browser allows users to [[Obfuscation|obfuscate]] the origin and [[Endpoint security|end-points]] of their communications when they communicate on the internet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Obfuscation ====
Obfuscation, the automated generation of "fake" signals that are indistinguishable from users' actual online activities, providing users with a noisy "cover" under which their real information and communication behavior remains unobservable. Obfuscation has received more attention as a method to protect users online recently. [[TrackMeNot]] is an obfuscation tool for search engine users: the plugin sends fake search queries to the [[Web search engine|search engine]], affecting the ability of the search engine provider to build an accurate profile of the user. Although TrackMeNot and other search obfuscation tools have been found to be vulnerable to certain attacks that allow search engines to distinguish between user-generated and computer-generated queries, further advances in obfuscation are likely to play a positive role in protecting users when disclosure of information is inevitable, as in the case of search or [[location-based service]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cryptography, law and human rights ==

=== Restrictions on cryptographic techniques ===

Recent incidents of terrorism have led to further calls for restrictions on encryption.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Don't Panic: Making Progress on the "Going Dark" Debate|last=Berkman Center|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though, in the interest of [[Public security|public safety]], there are many proposals to interfere with the free deployment of strong encryption, these proposals do not hold against close scientific [[scrutiny]]. These proposals side-step a more fundamental point, related to what is at stake for users. More advanced security measures seem necessary for governments, considering the existing threat landscape for users of digital communications and [[computing]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While many governments consider that encryption techniques could present a hurdle in the investigation of crime and the protection of [[national security]], certain countries, such as [[Germany]] or the [[Netherlands]] have taken a strong position against restrictions on encryption on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=For a discussion of Germany|last=McCarthy|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Ministers of the Interior of [[France]] and Germany have jointly stated the need to work on solutions for the challenges law enforcement can face as a result of end-to-end encryption, in particular when offered from a foreign jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Le-ministre/Interventions-du-ministre/Initiative-francoallemande-sur-la-securite-interieure-en-Europe|title=Bernard Cazeneuve, French Minister of the Interior, Speech at the Joint Press Conference with Thomas de Maizière, German Minister of the Interior, Paris|last=|first=|date=23 August 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a joint statement, the European Agency for Network and Information Security ([[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security|ENISA]]) and [[Europol]] have also taken a stance against the introduction of backdoors in encryption products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=On lawful criminal investigation that respects 21st Century data protection|last=ENISA and Europol Joint Statement|first=|date=20 May 2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, restrictions would have serious detrimental effects on [[Computer security|cyber security]], trade and [[e-commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-fbi-terror-encrypt-apple-google-edit-1214-20151211-story.html|title=See also Chicago Tribune. Encryption and the terrorists' tracks|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Encryption and the law: the broader landscape ===

Privacy and [[Information privacy|data protection]] [[legislation]] is closely related to the protection of human rights. There are now more than 100 countries with data protection laws.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf 2015. For this count, the inclusion of rules on security was a criterion.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key principles for the fair and lawful processing of personal information regulated by data protection laws is the principle of security. This principle implies that proper security measures are taken to ensure the protection of personal data against unlawful access by others than intended recipients.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[European Data Protection Supervisor|European Union General Data Protection Regulation]], which was adopted in 2016 and will enter in to force in 2018, contains an advanced set of rules with respect to the security of personal data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Encryption can be a [[safeguard]] against personal [[data breach]]es for the UN, as it can facilitate the implementation of privacy and data protection by design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cryptography has also been an essential ingredient for establishing the conditions for e-Commerce over the Internet. The OECD Principles were adopted to ensure that national cryptography policy would not interfere with trade and to ensure the conditions for international developments in e-Commerce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== International cryptography policy and human rights ===

The [[policy]] debate about encryption has a significant international dimension because of the [[Transnationalism|international nature of the communications networks]] and the Internet as well as trade, [[globalization]] and the national security dimensions. The OECD adopted a Recommendation Concerning Guidelines for Cryptography Policy on 27 March 1997. There are three components to this policy intervention of the OECD, which is primarily aimed at its Member Countries: a recommendation of the OECD Council, Guidelines for Cryptography Policy (as an Annex to the Recommendation) and a Report on Background and Issues of Cryptography Policy to explain the context for the Guidelines and the basic issues involved in the [[cryptography law]] and [[policy debate]]. The Principle most explicit about the connection to human rights is Principle 5 on the Protection of Privacy and Personal Data: ''"The fundamental rights of individuals to privacy, including secrecy of communications and protection of personal data, should be respected in national cryptography policies and in the implementation and use of cryptographic methods."''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[UNESCO]], after consulting [[Multistakeholder governance model|stakeholders]], identified encryption as a relevant element for policy on privacy and freedom of expression. The Keystones Report (2015) articulates that ''"to the extent that our data can be considered representative of ourselves, encryption has a role to play in protecting who we are, and in preventing abuse of user content. It also allows for greater protection of privacy and anonymity in transit by ensuring that the contents (and sometimes also the metadata) of communications are only seen by the intended recipient."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' The report recognizes ''"the role that anonymity and encryption can play as enablers of privacy protection and freedom of expression"'', and proposes that UNESCO facilitate dialogue on these issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Necessary and Proportionate Principles]] developed and adopted by [[civil society]] actors stipulates the protection of the [[integrity]] of [[communications system]]s as one of its 13 principles.&lt;ref&gt;See here: https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles&lt;/ref&gt; The principles themselves do not provide for explicit guidance on specific cryptographic policy issues such as backdoors or restrictions on the deployment of encryption. The guidance that is offered by the OECD principles and the recent positions of the UN Rapporteur on Encryption state the importance of encryption for the protection of human rights. While it does not give a definitive answer to the question of whether a mandate for encryption backdoors is to be considered incompatible with international law, it does point in that direction. Generally, the available guidance at the international level clarifies that when limitations are imposed on encryption, relevant human rights guarantees have to be strictly observed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== National level developments in selected countries ==

=== United States of America ===
There has been a broad, active and contentious policy debate on encryption in the [[United States|USA]] since the 1990s beginning with the '[[Crypto Wars]]'. This involved the adoption of the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA), containing requirements for [[telecommunication]]s providers and equipment manufacturers to ensure the possibility of effective [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]].&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 103-414, 108 Stat. 4279, codified at 47 USC 1001-1010&lt;/ref&gt; It also involved a debate over existing export controls on strong encryption products (considering their classification as munition) and a criminal investigation into cryptographic email software developer and activist [[Phil Zimmermann]]. The case was dropped and the general debate resolved after the [[liberalization]] of export controls on most commercial products with strong encryption features and the transfer of these items from the U.S.A. Munitions List ([[United States Munitions List|USML]]), administered by the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], to the [[Commerce Control List]] (CCL), administered by the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;See USA Department of Commerce, Encryption Export Controls: Revision of License Exception ENC and Mass Market Eligibility. June 2010. See also Ira Rubinstein and Michael Hintze. Export Controls on Encryption Software. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://encryption_policies.tripod.com/us/rubinstein_1200_software.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The USA Department of Commerce maintains some controls over items on the CCL, including registration, technical reviews and reporting obligations, and continues to impose licensing and other requirements for sensitive encryption items and sales of such items to foreign governments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The debate ignited after the [[Edward Snowden]] revelations and the well-documented increase in deployed encryption measures by Internet services, device makers and users, as well as a concerted call from the technical community and civil society to increase encryption use and security to address [[mass surveillance]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;See Ira Rubinstein and Joris van Hoboken. Privacy and Security in the Cloud, Maine Law Review 2014. Notably, the debate on encryption was already taking place before the Snowden revelations, as US law enforcement actors were arguing for the extension of wiretap obligations (CALEA) for internet services. For a discussion, see Adida et al. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The increased adoption of encryption by the [[industry]] has been received critically by certain government actors, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in particular.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This led to the widely reported [[FBI–Apple encryption dispute]] over the possibility to gain access to information on the [[iPhone]] in assistance to law enforcement. In 2016, several bills were introduced in the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] that would place new limits encryption under USA law. The USA's legal system promotes and requires security measures to be implemented in the relevant contexts, including cryptographic methods of various kinds, to ensure security in commerce and trade. Relevant laws are the [[Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014|Federal Information Security Modernization Act]] (FISMA) of 2014, the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act|Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,]] the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) and also the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914|Federal Trade Commission Act]]. These acts contain security requirements and thereby indirectly require or stimulate the use of encryption in certain circumstances. Finally, many state breach notification laws treat encrypted data as a [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] by exempting firms that have encrypted data from notice obligations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Constitution]]al considerations and [[Human rights in the United States|human rights]] play a role of significance in the USA debate about the legal treatment of encryption methods. Restrictions on distribution of cryptographic protocols, and the publication of cryptographic methods are considered an interference with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], the USA constitutional safeguard protecting freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The USA has particularly active and strongly developed civil society actors involved in cryptographic policy and practice.

The United States of America is a primary site for cryptology research and engineering, development and implementation of cryptographic service innovations. There is an active community of Non-Governmental Organizations engaged in the national and international debate on encryption policy.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the Encrypt all the Things Campaign.&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant interferences with strong encryption that take place or are being considered take place in the field of [[National Security Agency|national security,]] [[law enforcement]] and [[Foreign Affairs|foreign affairs]]. In this area and in answering the contentious question of whether and how lawful access to specific communications could be ensured, the US Government has internationally explained its policy as one aiming to ensure that 'responsibly deployed encryption' helps to ''"secure many aspects of our daily lives, including our private communications and commerce",'' but also ''"to ensure that malicious actors can be held to account without weakening our commitment to strong encryption"''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Germany ===
As part of the global debate on encryption in the late 1990s, a debate also took place in Germany about the need and legitimacy of imposing a general ban on the encryption of communications because of the impact on criminal investigations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grundrecht auf Verschlüsselung?|last=Koch|first=Alexander|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were profound doubts concerning the constitutional [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] as well as concerns about negative factual consequences of such a ban.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In qualitative terms, a number of [[fundamental rights]] are considered to be affected by restrictions on encryption: the secrecy of telecommunications, expressions of the general right of personality and, indirectly, all communicative freedoms that are exercisable over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=(Grund-)Recht auf Verschlüsselung?|last=Gerhards|first=Julia|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Politics of Germany|Federal Government]] set key points in 1999 for the German cryptographic policy which should especially provide confidence in the security of encryption instead of restricting it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Besides the statements of the German Minister of the Interior towards possible future restrictions, Germany aligns with the position of the UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye and adopts policies of non-restriction or comprehensive protection and only adopts restrictions on a case-specific basis. In November 2015 governmental representatives as well as representatives of the [[private sector]] signed a "Charter to strengthen the trusted communication "(Charta zur Stärkung der vertrauenswürdigen Kommunikation) together, in which they stated: ''"We want to be Encryption Site No. 1 in the world"''.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Agenda 2014-2017, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Government|German government]] has also used its foreign policy to promote international privacy standards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In particular, Germany, in a joint effort with [[Brazil]], committed itself in the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] for the appointment of an UN Special Rapporteur on Privacy.&lt;ref&gt;See Monika Ermert, NSA-Skandal: UN-Sonderberichterstatter für Datenschutz in der digitalen Welt angestrebt, Heise Online, 23 March 2015, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/NSA-Skandal-UNSonderberichterstatter-fuer-Datenschutz-in-der-digitalen-Welt-angestrebt-2582480.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple examples of how there have been efforts by the government to implement encryption policy. They range from informal actions, to laws and regulations: The IT Security Act in 2015, the 'De-Mail' law. There are also several sector-specific rules for encryption and information security in Germany, like the Telecommunications Act (TKG). The [[Federal Constitutional Court|German Constitutional Court]] has also provided valuable input for the international legal handling of encryption techniques with the IT basic right, with which, the constitutional court recognizes that parts of one's personality go into IT systems and therefore the applied protection has to travel with it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== India ===
There are a number of limitations on the free deployment of encryption by electronic communications services despite the fact that [[Law of India|Indian law]] and policy promotes and requires the implementation of strong encryption as a security measure, such as in [[Banking in India|banking]], ecommerce and by organizations handling sensitive personal information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is notable legal uncertainty about the precise legal scope of these license requirements and to what extent they could have legal effect on (the use of or deployment of ) services by the end-users of covered services. The encryption debate ignited publicly in India in 2008 after the Government published a draft proposal with a number of envisioned limitations on the use of encryption. The policy, issued under Section 84A of the Indian Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 was short-lived, but worries remain about the lack of safeguards for privacy and freedom of expression that the draft illustrated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response to the outcry, the Indian government first exempted ''"mass use encryption products, which are currently being used in web applications, social media sites, and social media applications such as Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter etc."'' Soon thereafter, it withdrew the proposed policy and a new policy has not been made public yet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Section 84A of the Indian Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 [[Empowerment|empowers]] the government to formulate rules on modes of encryption for the electronic medium. Legal commentators have noted the lack of [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] about what types of encryption use and deployment are permitted and required under Indian law, especially in the field of electronic communications services.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, the Central Indian Government has, in theory, a broad exclusive [[monopoly]] over electronic communications which includes the privilege to provide telecommunication and Internet services in India.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Brazil ===
After the Edward Snowden revelations in 2013, Brazil was at the forefront of a global coalition promoting the right to privacy at the UN and condemning USA mass surveillance. In recent events, Brazil has demonstrated diverse aims when it comes to the use and implementation of encryption. On the one side, the country is a leader in providing a legal framework of rules for the Internet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But it has also taken several measures that may be seen to restrict the dissemination of encryption technology. In 2015, in a process that was open for public comments and discussions, Brazil's [[legislator]] drafted a new privacy bill ("proteção de dados pessoais"), which was sent to Brazil's Federal Congress on 13 May 2016 and came into force as Bill 5276 of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://pensando.mj.gov.br/dadospessoais/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It regulates and protects [[personal data]] and privacy, including online practices and includes provisions for more secure methods such as encryption on the treatment of personal data. The law also addresses security issues and a duty for companies to report any attacks and security breaches. With the [[Marco Civil]] (2014), that introduces principles like [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]], the [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet]], Brazil was one of the first countries to ever introduce a law, that aims at combining all Internet rules in one bundle. Brazil has a well-established e-government model: The Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure (Infraestrutura de Chaves Públicas Brasileira – ICP-Brasil).&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iti.gov.br/icp-brasil&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010 ICP-Brasil certificates can be partly integrated in Brazilian IDs, which can then be used for several services like tax revenue service, judicial services or bank related services. In practice, the ICP-Brasil digital certificate acts as a [[Online identity|virtual identity]] that enables secure and unique identification of the author of a message or transaction made in an electronic medium such as the web. Brazilian courts have taken a stance against encryption in private messaging services by repeatedly ordering the [[Internet censorship|blocking]] of the messaging service [[WhatsApp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/344200/brazil-bans-whatsapp-again-over-encryption|title=Brazil Bans WhatsApp (Again) Over Encryption|last=Mlot|first=Stephanie|date=3 May 2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it switched to a full end-to-end encryption, the service has been periodically blocked as a result of a court order in an attempt to make the company comply with demands for information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== African countries ===

The African ([[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights|Banjul]]) Charter on Human and People's Rights, was adopted in the context of the [[African Union]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;African (Banjul) Charter on Human and People's Rights, Adopted 27 June 1981, OAU Doc. CAB/LEG/67/3 rev. 5, 21 I.L.M. 58 (1982), entered into force 21 October 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; A Protocol to the Charter, establishing the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] was adopted in 1998 and came into effect in 2005. In the area of [[information policy]], the African Union has adopted the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.&lt;ref&gt;African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, adopted on 27 June 2014. The Convention has currently been signed by 8 of the Member States.&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions on personal data protection in this Convention generally follow the [[European Union|European model]] for the protection of data privacy and contains a number of provisions on the security of personal data processing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A civil society initiative has adopted a specific African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedoms "to help shape approaches to Internet policy-making and governance across the continent".&lt;ref&gt;See African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedoms, available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://africaninternetrights.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Northern Africa ====
Different countries in the [[North Africa|North-Africa]]n region have not seen a significant rise in legal actions aiming at the suppression of encryption in the [[Arab Spring|transformations that started in 2011]]. Although legislation often dates back to before the transformations, the enforcement has become stricter since then. No difference in the position towards cryptography can be seen between the countries that had successful revolutions and went through regime changes and those that didn't.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Tunisia]] has several laws that limit online anonymity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Articles 9 and 87 of the 2001 Telecommunication Code ban the use of encryption and provide a sanction of up to five years in prison for the unauthorized sale and use of such techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Loi n° 1-2001 du 15 janvier 2001 portant promulgation du code des télécommunications (Tunesia), available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=204160&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Algeria]], users have legally needed authorization for the use of cryptographic technology from the relevant telecommunications authority ARPT (Autorité de Régulation de la Poste et des Télécommunications) since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Decision No 17 du 11 June 2012, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.arpt.dz/fr/doc/reg/dec/2012/DEC_N17_11_06_2012.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egypt]], Article 64 of the 2003 Telecommunication Regulation Law states that the use of encryption devices is prohibited without the written consent of the NTRA, the military, and national security authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Egypt Telecommunications Regulation Law (Translation), available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Egypt/Egypt%20Telecommunication%20Regulation%20Law.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Morocco]], the [[import]] and [[export]] of cryptographic technology, be it soft- or hardware, requires a [[license]] from the government. The relevant law No. 53-05 (Loi n° 53-05 relative à l'échange électronique de données juridiques) went into effect in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin officiel n° 6332 du 15 rabii II 1436 (5 February 2015), available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://adala.justice.gov.ma/production/html/Fr/liens/..%5C188896.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== East Africa ====
There are no specific provisions in effect in countries in the [[East Africa|East-Africa]]n region restricting the use of encryption technology. As in other African countries, the main reason given for State surveillance is the prevention of [[Terroristic threat|terroristic]] attacks. [[Kenya]] with its proximity to [[Somalia]], has cited this threat for adopting restrictive actions. The country has recently fast-tracked a Computer and Cybercrime Law, to be adopted in the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;See MyGov, Computer and cybercrime law to be in place before end year, 29 June 2016, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mygov.go.ke/?p=10848&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Uganda]] a number of laws and [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] policies have been passed over the past three years, none of them however deal with encryption. In 2016, following the Presidential Elections, the Ugandan government shut down social networks such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and WhatsApp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35601220|title=Uganda Election: Facebook and Whatsapp blocked|last=|first=|date=18 February 2016|work=BBC News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== West Africa ====
[[West Africa|West-Africa]]n countries neither limit the import or export of encryption technology, nor its use, most national and foreign [[companies]] still rely on the use of VPNs for their communication. [[Ghana]] recently introduced a draft law aiming at intercepting electronic and postal communications of citizens, to aid crime prevention. Section 4(3) of the proposed bill gives the government permission to intercept anyone's communication upon only receiving oral order from a public officer.&lt;ref&gt;Ajibola Adigun, Affront on Freedom in Ghana with the Introduction of Spy Bill, Student For Liberty, 29 March 2016, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://studentsforliberty.org/africa/2016/03/29/affront-on-freedom-in-ghana-with-theintroduction-of-spy-bill/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the [[Nigeria]]n Communications Commission has drafted a bill regarding Lawful Interception of Communications Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Nigerian Communications Commission, Draft Lawful Interception of Communications Regulations, available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://bit.ly/1du7UKO&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; If passed, the bill allows the interception of all communication without [[Judiciary|judicial]] oversight or court order and forces mobile [[Telephone company|phone companies]] to store voice and [[Data transmission|data communication]] for three years. Furthermore, the draft plans to give the National Security Agency a right to ask for a key to decrypt all encrypted communication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Southern Africa ====
Users in [[South Africa]] are not prohibited from using encryption.&lt;ref&gt;See Freedom House, Freedom on the Net 2015: South Africa, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedomnet/2015/south-africa&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The provision of such technology, however, is strictly regulated by the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;See Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, 2002 No. 25 of 2002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.internet.org.za/ect_act.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central Africa ====
Countries in [[Central Africa]], like the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Gabon]] and [[Cameroon]] do not yet have a well-developed [[legal framework]] addressing Internet policy issues. The Internet remains a relatively unregulated sphere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Human rights legal framework related to cryptography ==

=== International instruments ===
While a very broad range of human rights is touched upon by [[Digital Technologies|digital technologies]], the human rights to freedom of expression (Art. 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [ICCPR]) and the right to private life (Art. 17 ICCPR) are of particular relevance to the protection of cryptographic methods. Unlike the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) which is international '[[soft law]]', the ICCPR is a [[legally binding]] [[international treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression: progressive development of international standards relating to freedom of expression. in: McGonagle and Donders|last=Mendel|first=Toby|publisher=The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=238, chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restrictions on the right to freedom of expression are only permitted under the conditions of Article 19, paragraph 3. Restrictions shall be provided for by law and they shall be necessary (a) for the respect of the rights or reputations of others or (b) for the protection of national security or of [[Public-order crime|public order]] or of [[public health]] or [[morals]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A further possibility for restriction is set out in Art. 20 ICCPR,&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Nowak, CCPR Commentary, 2nd edition, p. 477. Cf. Michael O'Flaherty. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: interpreting freedom of expression and information standards for the present and the future. in: McGonagle and Donders. The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information. chapter 2, p. 69 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of limitations on cryptography, restrictions will most often be based on Article 19 (3)(b), i.e. risks for national security and public order. This raises the complex issue of the relation, and distinction, between security of the individual, e.g. from interference with personal electronic communications, and national security. The right to privacy&lt;ref&gt;Art. 17 ICCPR; Art. 21 ACHR (Arab); Art. 11 ACHR (America); Art. 21 AHRD.&lt;/ref&gt; protects against 'arbitrary or unlawful interference' with one's privacy, one's family, one's home and one's correspondence. Additionally, Article 17(1) of the ICCPR protects against 'unlawful attacks' against one's honor and reputation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The scope of Article 17 is broad. Privacy can be understood as the right to control information about one's self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fried|first=Charles|date=1968|title=Privacy|url=|journal=77 Yale Law Journal|volume=|pages=475, 483|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility to live one's life as one sees fit, within the boundaries set by the law, effectively depends on the information which others have about us and use to inform their behavior towards us. That is part of the core justification for protecting privacy as a human right.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to the duty to not infringe these rights, States have a positive obligation to effectively ensure the enjoyment of freedom of expression and privacy of every individual under their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;CCPR/G/GC/34, § 11.&lt;/ref&gt; These rights may conflict with other rights and interests, such as [[dignity]], equality or life and security of an individual or legitimate public interests. In these cases, the integrity of each right or value must be maintained to the maximum extent, and any limitations required for balancing have to be in law, necessary and proportionate (especially least restrictive) in view of a legitimate aim (such as the rights of others, public morals and national security).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Guaranteeing "uninhibited communications" ===
Encryption supports this mode of communication by allowing people to protect the integrity, [[availability]] and confidentiality of their communications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The requirement of uninhibited communications is an important precondition for freedom of communication, which is acknowledged by constitutional courts e.g. [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;See for example New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964) and Dombrowskiv. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; and the German [[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]&lt;ref&gt;See BVerfG NJW 1995, 3303 (3304) and BVerfG NJW 2006, 207 (209).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Cumhuryiet Vafki and others v. Turkey, ECHR 10.08.2013 - 28255/07; Ricci v. Italy, ECHR 10.08.2013 - 30210/06.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, meaningful communication requires people's ability to freely choose the pieces of information and develop their ideas, the style of language and select the medium of communication according to their personal needs. Uninhibited communication is also a [[precondition]] for autonomous personal development. Human beings grow their personality by communicating with others.&lt;ref name="Tarlach McGonagle p. 3"&gt;Tarlach McGonagle. The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information. chapter 1, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; UN's first Special Rapporteur on Privacy, professor Joe Cannataci, stated that ''"privacy is not just an enabling right as opposed to being an end in itself, but also an essential right which enables the achievement of an over-arching fundamental right to the free, unhindered development of one's personality"''.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy, Joseph A. Cannataci, A/HRC/31/64.&lt;/ref&gt; In case such communication is inhibited, the interaction is biased because a statement does not only reflect the speaker's true (innermost) personal views but can be unduly influenced by considerations that should not shape communication in the first place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, the process of forming one's personality through [[Social relation|social interaction]] is disrupted. In a complex society freedom of speech does not become reality when people have the right to speak. A second level of guarantees need to protect the precondition of making use of the right to express oneself. If there is the risk of [[surveillance]] the right to protect one freedom of speech by means of encryption has to be considered as one of those second level rights. Thus, restriction of the availability and effectiveness of encryption as such constitutes an interference with the freedom of expression and the right to privacy as it protects private life and correspondence. Therefore, it has to be assessed in terms of [[legality]], necessity and purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Procedures and transparency ===
Freedom of expression and the right to privacy (including the right to private communications) materially protect a certain behavior or a personal state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is well established in fundamental rights theory that substantive rights have to be complemented by procedural guaranties to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Theory of Constitutional Rights|last=Alexy|first=Robert|last2=Rivers|first2=Julian|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those procedural guarantees can be rights such as the right to an effective remedy. However, it is important to acknowledge that those procedural rights must, similar to the substantive rights, be accompanied by specific procedural duties of governments without which the rights would erode. The substantial rights have to be construed in a way that they also contain the duty to make governance systems transparent, at least to the extent that allows citizens to assess who made a decision and what measures have been taken. In this aspect, transparency ensures accountability. It is the precondition to know about the dangers for fundamental rights and make use of the respective freedoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Security intermediaries ===
The effectuation of human rights protection requires the involvement of service providers. These service providers often act as [[Internet Intermediaries|intermediaries]] facilitating expression and communication of their users of different kinds.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon et al. UNESCO study; Cf. Karol Jakubowicz. Early days: the UN, ICTs and freedom of expression. in: The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information. chapter 10, pp. 324 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In debates about cryptographic policy, the question of lawful government access – and the conditions under which such access should take place in order to respect human rights – has a vertical and national focus. Complexities of [[jurisdiction]] in lawful government access are significant and present a still unsolved puzzle. In particular, there has been a dramatic shift from traditional lawful government access to [[digital communications]] through the targeting of telecommunications providers with strong local connections, to access through targeting over-the-top services with fewer or loose connections to the jurisdictions in which they offer services to users. In which cases such internationally operating service providers should (be able to) hand over user [[data]] and communications to local authorities. The deployment of encryption by service providers is a further complicating factor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From the perspective of service providers, it seems likely that cryptographic methods will have to be designed to account for only providing user data on the basis of valid legal process in certain situations. In recent years, companies and especially online intermediaries have found themselves increasingly in the focus of the debate on the implementation of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 2011. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the UNESCO publication Fostering Freedoms Online. The Role of Internet Intermediaries. 2014. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002311/231162e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet intermediaries|Online intermediaries]]&lt;ref name="Tarlach McGonagle p. 3"/&gt; not only have a role of intermediaries between [[Content Providers|content providers]] and users but also one of "Security Intermediaries" in various aspects. Their practices and defaults as regards encryption are highly relevant to the user's access to and effective usage of those technologies. Since a great amount of data is traveling through their routers and is stored in their clouds, they offer ideal points of access for the intelligence community and [[non-state actor]]s. Thus, they also, perhaps involuntarily, function as an interface between the state and the users in matters of encryption policy. The role has to be reflected in the human rights debate as well, and it calls for a comprehensive integration of security of user information and communication in the emerging [[Internet governance]] model of today.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Human rights and encryption: obligations and room for action ===
UNESCO is working on promoting the use of legal assessments based on human rights in cases of interference with the freedom to use and deploy cryptographic methods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The concept of [[Internet Universality]], developed by UNESCO, including its emphasis on [[Openness of the Internet|openness]], [[Accessibility of the Internet|accessibility]] to all, and [[multi-stakeholder participation]]. While these minimal requirements and good practices can be based on more abstract legal analysis, these assessments have to be made in specific contexts. Secure authenticated access to publicly available content, for instance, is a safeguard against many forms of public and private [[censorship]] and limits the risk of falsification. One of the most prevalent technical standards that enables secure authenticated access is [[TLS termination proxy|TLS]]. Closely related to this is the availability of anonymous access to information. TOR is a system that allows the practically anonymous retrieval of information online. Both aspects of access to content directly benefit the freedom of thought and expression. The principle of [[legal certainty]] is vital to every juridical process that concerns cryptographic methods or practices. The principle is essential to any forms of interception and surveillance, because it can prevent unreasonable fears of surveillance, such as when the underlying legal norms are drafted precisely. Legal certainty may avert chilling effects by reducing an inhibiting key factor for the exercise of human rights, for UNESCO.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Continuous [[innovation]] in the field ofcryptography and setting and spreading new technical standards is therefore essential. Cryptographic standards can expire quickly as [[Computer performance|computing power]] increases . UNESCO has outlined that [[education]] and continuous [[Modernization theory|modernization]] of cryptographic techniques are important.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Legality of limitations ===

The impact of human rights can only be assessed by analyzing the possible limitations that states can set for those [[Political freedom|freedoms]]. UNESCO states that national security can be a legitimate aim for actions that limit freedom of speech and the [[right to privacy]], but it calls for actions that are necessary and proportional.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "UNESCO considers an interference with the right to encryption as a guarantee enshrined in the freedom of expression and in privacy as being especially severe if:

• It affects the ability of key service providers in the media and [[communication]]s landscape to protect their users' information and communication through secure cryptographic methods and protocols, thereby constituting the requirement of uninhibited communications for users of networked communication services and technologies.

• The state reduces the possibility of vulnerable [[Community|communities]] and/or [[Structure|structurally]] important actors like [[journalist]]s to get access to encryption;

• Mere [[Theory|theoretical]] risks and dangers drive restrictions to the relevant fundamental rights under the legal system of a state;

• The mode of state action, e.g. if restrictions on fundamental rights are established through informal and voluntary arrangements, lead to unaccountable circumvention or [[erosion]] of the security of deployed cryptographic methods and technologies."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''''jivan mukta''''' or '''''mukta'''''&lt;ref&gt;The Vivekacūḍāmaṇi of Śaṅkarācārya Bhagavatpāda: An Introduction and Translation edited by John Grimes "A mukta is a mukta, with or without a body.110 It may be said that a knower of the Self with a body is a jivanmukta and when that person sheds the body, he attains videhamukti. But this difference exists only for the onlooker, not the mukta."&lt;/ref&gt; is someone who, in the [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy of [[Hinduism]], has gained and assimilated infinite and divine knowledge and power and gained complete self-knowledge and self-realisation and attained [[Kaivalya]] or [[Moksha]] (enlightenment), thus is liberated with an inner sense of freedom while living and not yet died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gavin Flood]] (1998), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pages 61-71&lt;/ref&gt; The state is the aim of [[moksha]] in Advaita Vedanta, [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] and other schools of Hinduism, and it is referred to as ''jivanmukti'' (Self-realization).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Fort and Patricia Mumme (1996), Living Liberation in Hindu Thought, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman E.

Jivanmukti contrasts with the concept of ''[[Videha mukti|videhamukti]]''; the latter means "liberation or emancipation after death, in afterlife".&lt;ref&gt;M. von Brück (1986), Imitation or Identification?, Indian Theological Studies, Vol. 23, Issue 2, pages 95-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], {{Google books|2h0YAAAAYAAJ|The philosophy of the Upanishads|page=356}}, pages 356-357&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Jivanmukti'' is derived from a combination of [[Sanskrit]] words ''[[jiva]]'' and ''[[Moksha|mukti]]'', which mean "life" and "freedom" respectively.

==Description==
{{main|Moksha}}

The various texts and schools of Hinduism describe ''Jivanmukti'' state of existence as one of liberation and freedom reached within one’s life.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Muktika Upanishad, Varaha Upanishad, Adhyatma Upanishad, Sandilya Upanishad, [[Tejobindu Upanishad]], etc.; in K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), [[:iarchive:thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft|Thirty Minor Upanishads]], University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], [[:iarchive:philosophyupani00deusgoog|The philosophy of the Upanishads]], Translated by A.S. Geden (1906), T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; Some contrast ''jivanmukti'' with ''videhamukti'' (moksha from samsara after death).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1 &amp; 2, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1467-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, claim these ancient texts of Hindu philosophy. For example, according to Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, the enlightened individual shows attributes such as:&lt;ref&gt;see:

* he is not bothered by disrespect and endures cruel words, treats others with respect regardless of how others treat him;
* when confronted by an angry person he does not return anger, instead replies with soft and kind words;
* even if tortured, he speaks and trusts the truth;
* he does not crave for blessings or expect praise from others;
* he never injures or harms any life or being ([[ahimsa]]), he is intent in the welfare of all beings;&lt;ref&gt;see also Sandilya Upanishad for ahimsa and other virtues; Quote: “तत्र हिंसा नाम मनोवाक्कायकर्मभिः सर्वभूतेषु सर्वदा क्लेशजननम्”; Aiyar translates this as: He practices Ahimsa - no injury or harm to any living being at any time through actions of his body, his speech or in his mind; K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), [[:iarchive:thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft|Thirty Minor Upanishads]], University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 173-174&lt;/ref&gt;
* he is as comfortable being alone as in the presence of others;
* he is as comfortable with a bowl, at the foot of a tree in tattered robe without help, as when he is in a mithuna (union of mendicants), grama (village) and nagara (city);
* he doesn’t care about or wear [[sikha]] (tuft of hair on the back of head for religious reasons), nor the holy thread across his body. To him, knowledge is sikha, knowledge is the holy thread, knowledge alone is supreme. Outer appearances and rituals do not matter to him, only knowledge matters;
* for him there is no invocation nor dismissal of deities, no mantra nor non-mantra, no prostrations nor worship of gods, goddess or ancestors, nothing other than knowledge of Self;
* he is humble, high spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words.

==Advaita view==
Adi Shankara explains that nothing can induce one to act who has no desire of his own to satisfy. The supreme limit of [[vairagya]] ("detachment"), is the non-springing of ''vasanas'' in respect of enjoyable objects; the non-springing of the sense of the “I” (in things which are the ''[[Anatman (Hinduism)|ānatman]]'') is the extreme limit of ''bodha'' ("awakening"), and the non-springing again of the modifications which have ceased is the extreme limit of ''[[Uparati]]'' ("abstinence"). The Jivanmukta gains divine and infinite knowledge and has complet self-knowledge and Self-realization, a Jivanmukta by reason of his ever being Brahman, is freed from awareness of external objects and no longer aware of any difference between the inner atman and Brahman and between Brahman and the world, he knows the he is same as Brahman and has a ever experiencing infinite consciousness. ''"Vijnatabrahmatattvasya yathapurvam na samsrtih"'' – "there is no [[saṃsāra]] as before for one who has known Brahman".&lt;ref name=Vivekacudamani&gt;{{cite book |title=Vivekacūḍāmaṇi of Śrī Samkara Bhagavatpāda |author=Śaṅkarācārya |pages=403–423 |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three kinds of ''[[prarabdha karma]]'': ''Ichha'' ("personally desired"), ''Anichha'' ("without desire") and ''Parechha'' ("due to others' desire"). For a self realized person, a Jivanamukta, there is no ''Ichha-Prarabdha'' but the two others, ''Anichha'' and ''Parechha'', remain,&lt;ref name=kar/&gt; which even a jivanmukta has to undergo.&lt;ref name=kar&gt;{{cite web |first=Ramana |last=Maharshi |url=http://www.hinduism.co.za/karma&amp;.htm |title=Karma and Destiny |authorlink=Ramana Maharshi |work=Hinduism.co.za |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paths to Transcendence: According to Shankara, Ibn Arabi, and Meister Eckhart |first=Reza |last=Shah-Kazem |publisher=World Wisdom, Inc. |year=2006 |isbn=0-941532-97-6 |pages=59-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Advaita school for those of wisdom ''Prarabdha'' is liquidated only by experience of its effects; ''Sancita'' ("accumulated karmas") and ''Agami'' ("future karmas") are destroyed in the fire of ''[[Jnana]]'' ("knowledge").&lt;ref name=Vivekacudamani/&gt;

The term '''Paramukti''' is commonly used to refer to final liberation, which occurs upon the death of the body of someone who has attained Jivanmukti or Kaivalya during his or her lifetime. It implies the ultimate release of the soul ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]) from the Saṃsāra and karma and merger of the atman in [[Brahman]], so when a Jivanmukta dies he becomes a '''Paramukta'''. In the Hindu view, when an ordinary person dies and his physical body disintegrates, the person's unresolved karma causes his atman to pass on to a new birth; and thus the karmic inheritance is reborn in one of the six realms of [[samsara]]. However, when a person attains Jivanmukti, he is liberated from karmic rebirth. When such a person dies and his physical body disintegrates, his cycle of rebirthing ends and he become one with Brahman, then that person is said to have achieved '''Paramukti''' and became a Paramukta, so, a Jivanmukta has a body while a Paramukta is bodyless and pure.
 
In the ''[[Śramaṇa|śramaṇic]]'' traditions, the jivanmukta is called an ''[[arhat]]'' in Buddhism and ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' in Jainism.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Implication==

The Advaita school holds the view that the world appearance is owing to ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]'' (ignorance) that has the power to project i.e. to superimpose the unreal on the real ([[adhyasa]]), and also the power to conceal the real resulting in the delusion of the [[Jiva]] who experiences objects created by his mind and sees difference in this world, he sees difference between the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] ("the individual self") and [[Brahman]] ("the supreme Self"). This delusion caused by ignorance is destroyed when ignorance itself is destroyed by knowledge. When all delusion is removed there remains no awareness of difference. He who sees no difference between Self and Brahman is said to be a Jivanmukta. Jivanmukta experience enlightenment and liberation while alive and also after death i.e., after becoming paramukta, while Videhmukta experiences enlightenment and liberation only after death.
There are four stages of Jivanmukti:–

1. '''Sālokya''' – living in the same world.

2. '''Sārūpya''' – having the same form

3. '''Sāmīpya''' – being close to

4. '''Sāyujya''' – merging into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Constructive Survey Of Upanishadic Philosophy: Being An Introduction To The Thought Of The Upanishads |first=R. D. |last=Ranade |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |place=Mumbai |year=1986 |orig-year=1926 |page=157 |url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STAGE 1. The first stage is called sālokya — corresponding to the waking state of consciousness (jāgrata) — the realization that the entire vast universe of billions of galaxies and universes is all pervaded by the Divine Consciousness. (Viṣṇu means That which pervades the entire universe and everything in it.) It is the undifferentiated Ocean of Being.
When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from the idea that the world is separate and independent from us and is an ultimate source of abiding pleasure and joy.

STAGE 2. The second stage is sarūpya or sadhārmya — corresponding to the dreaming state of consciousness – realization that every being is interconnected and all “apparently” separate jivas are embodiments of the One Divine Consciousness. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from ahaṅkāra - the notion of self-identity and the notion of difference and the other, thus being able to cultivate empathy with all and universal compassion for all beings.

STAGE 3. The third stage samīpya — is intimacy with the Divine — corresponding to the unconscious dreamless state of consciousness – God-realization occurs when the nature of the saguṇa īśvara is cognized and one surrenders to Him/Her. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from all self-effort to achieve liberation, freedom from religion and its bondage and the relinquishing of all self-imposed burdens – achieving a state of equanimity, tranquility, abiding joy and peace.

STAGE 4. The final stage sāyujya — communion with, or unification with the Absolute Godhead — corresponding to the Turiya or inconceivable and inexpressible fourth state of consciousness – a merging with the Godhead bordering on complete identity.
When this stage is achieved then the person becomes a complete Jivanmukta and gets the absolute freedom from rebirth and suffering — the final stage of Brahma-nirvāna.

==Significance==

The Advaita philosophy rests on the premise that noumenally the Absolute alone exists, Nature, Souls and God are all merged in the Absolute; the Universe is one, that there is no difference within it, or without it; Brahman is alike throughout its structure, and the knowledge of any part of it is the knowledge of the whole ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] II.4.6-14), and, since all causation is ultimately due to Brahman, since everything beside Brahman is an appearance, the Atman is the only entity that exists and nothing else. All elements emanated from the Atman ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]] II.1) and all existence is based on Intellect ([[Aitareya Upanishad]] III.3). The universe created by Brahman from a part of itself is thrown out and re-absorbed by the Immutable Brahman ([[Mundaka Upanishad]] I.1.7). Therefore, the [[Jiva]] (the individual self) is non-different from [[Brahman]] (the supreme Self), and the Jiva, never bound, is ever liberated. Through [[Self-consciousness (Vedanta)|Self-consciousness]] one gains the knowledge of existence and realizes Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bhagavad-Gita As It Is |author=[[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] |publisher=The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust |year=1972 |place=Mumbai |page=621 |url=http://vedabase.net/bg/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|fr|Jurisprudence constante}}''''' ([[French language|French]] for "stable jurisprudence", or literally, "constant jurisprudence") is a [[legal doctrine]] according to which a long series of previous decisions applying a particular legal principle or [[rule of law|rule]] is highly [[Precedent#Persuasive precedent|persuasive]] but not controlling in subsequent [[legal case|cases]] dealing with similar or identical issues of law&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in the case of French administrative law, see CE, July 13th 2016, ''[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/Decisions-Avis-Publications/Decisions/Selection-des-decisions-faisant-l-objet-d-une-communication-particuliere/CE-13-juillet-2016-departement-de-la-Seine-Saint-Denis Département de la Seine-Saint-Denis]'',
N° 388317, §5 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;.  This doctrine is recognized in most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s as well as in certain mixed jurisdictions, e.g., [[law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].

The rule of law applied in the ''{{lang|fr|jurisprudence constante}}'' directly compares with ''{{lang|la|[[stare decisis]]}}''. But the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] notes the principal difference between the two legal doctrines: a single [[legal opinion|court decision]] can provide sufficient foundation for ''{{lang|la|stare decisis}}'', however, "a
series of [[case law|adjudicated cases]], all in accord, form the basis for ''{{lang|fr|jurisprudence constante}}''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants = Willis-Knighton Med. Ctr. v.

[[File:Kasner-simple.gif|250px|right|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Dynamics of Kasner metrics {{EquationNote|eq. 2}} in [[spherical coordinate system | spherical coordinates]] towards singularity.

The '''Kasner metric''' (developed by and named for the American mathematician [[Edward Kasner]] in 1921)&lt;ref&gt;Kasner, E. "Geometrical theorems on Einstein’s cosmological equations." ''Am. J. Math.'' '''43''', 217–221 (1921).&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] to [[Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]].  It describes an anisotropic [[universe]] without [[matter]] (i.e., it is a [[vacuum solution]]).  It can be written in any [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] &lt;math&gt;D&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and has strong connections with the study of gravitational [[Chaos theory|chaos]].

== Metric and conditions ==

The [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] in &lt;math&gt;D&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; spacetime dimensions is

:&lt;math&gt;\text{d}s^2 = -\text{d}t^2 + \sum_{j=1}^{D-1} t^{2p_j} [\text{d}x^j]^2&lt;/math&gt;,

and contains &lt;math&gt;D-1&lt;/math&gt; constants &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''Kasner exponents.''  The metric describes a spacetime whose equal-time slices are spatially flat, however space is expanding or contracting at different rates in different directions, depending on the values of the &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt;.  Test particles in this metric whose comoving coordinate differs by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x^j&lt;/math&gt; are separated by a physical distance &lt;math&gt;t^{p_j}\Delta x^j&lt;/math&gt;.

The Kasner metric is an exact solution to Einstein's equations in vacuum when the Kasner exponents satisfy the following ''Kasner conditions,''

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{D-1} p_j = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{D-1} p_j^2 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The first condition defines a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], the ''Kasner plane,'' and the second describes a [[sphere]], the ''Kasner sphere.''  The solutions (choices of &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt;) satisfying the two conditions therefore lie on the sphere where the two intersect (sometimes confusingly also called the Kasner sphere).  In &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; spacetime dimensions, the space of solutions therefore lie on a &lt;math&gt;D-3&lt;/math&gt; dimensional sphere &lt;math&gt;S^{D-3}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Features ==

There are several noticeable and unusual features of the Kasner solution:

*The volume of the spatial slices is always &lt;math&gt;O(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  This is because their volume is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt;, and

::&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-g} = t^{p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_{D-1}} = t&lt;/math&gt;

:where we have used the first Kasner condition.  Therefore &lt;math&gt;t\to 0&lt;/math&gt; can describe either a [[Big Bang]] or a [[Big Crunch]], depending on the sense of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;

*[[Isotropic]] [[metric expansion of space|expansion or contraction of space]] is not allowed.  If the spatial slices were expanding isotropically, then all of the Kasner exponents must be equal, and therefore &lt;math&gt;p_j = 1/(D-1)&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy the first Kasner condition.  But then the second Kasner condition cannot be satisfied, for

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{D-1} p_j^2 = \frac{1}{D-1} \ne 1.&lt;/math&gt;

:The [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] employed in [[cosmology]], by contrast, is able to expand or contract isotropically because of the presence of matter.

*With a little more work, one can show that at least one Kasner exponent is always negative (unless we are at one of the solutions with a single &lt;math&gt;p_j=1&lt;/math&gt;, and the rest vanishing).  Suppose we take the time coordinate &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to increase from zero.  Then this implies that while the volume of space is increasing like &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, at least one direction (corresponding to the negative Kasner exponent) is actually ''contracting.''
*The Kasner metric is a solution to the vacuum Einstein equations, and so the [[Ricci tensor]] always vanishes for any choice of exponents satisfying the Kasner conditions.  The full [[Riemann tensor]] vanishes only when a single &lt;math&gt;p_j=1&lt;/math&gt; and the rest vanish, in which case the space is flat. The Minkowski metric can be recovered via the coordinate transformation &lt;math&gt;t' = t \cosh x_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_j' = t \sinh x_j&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Hinduism small}}
A '''Kosha''' (also '''Kosa'''; [[Sanskrit]] [[:wikt:कोश|कोश]], [[IAST]]: {{IAST|kośa}}), usually rendered "sheath", is a covering of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], or Self according to [[Vedantic]] philosophy. There are five Koshas, and they are often visualised as the layers of an onion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roeser|first1=Robert W.|title=An introduction to Hindu India's contemplative psychological perspective on motivation, self, and development|date=2005|page=15|edition=pdf|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/iaryd/documents/researchPaperHindu.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The five sheaths (pancha-kosas) are described in the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;David Frawley, ''Yoga and the Sacred Fire: Self-Realization and Planetary Transformation'', p.288&lt;/ref&gt; From gross to fine they are:
# Annamaya kosha, "foodstuff" sheath (Anna)
# [[Prana|Pranamaya kosha]], "energy" sheath (Prana/apana)
# [[Manomaya kosha]] "mind-stuff" sheath (Manas)
# Vijñānmāyā [[Vijnanamaya kosha|kosha]], "wisdom" sheath (''[[Vijnana|Vigyan]]'')
# [[Anandamaya kosha]], "bliss" sheath (''[[wikt:bliss|Ananda]]'')

According to Vedanta the wise person, being aware of the subtle influences of the five elements within each kosha, ever discerns the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]] amidst appearances.

==The five sheaths==

=== Annamaya kosha ===
This is the sheath of the physical self, named from the fact that it is nourished by food. Living through this layer humans identify themselves with a mass of [[skin]], [[flesh]], [[Adipose tissue|fat]], [[bone]]s, and [[feces|filth]], while the human of discrimination knows their own self, the only reality that there is, as distinct from the body.

=== Pranamaya kosha ===
Pranamaya means composed of [[prana]], the vital principle, the force that vitalizes and holds together the body and the mind. It pervades the whole organism, its one physical manifestation is the breath. As long as this vital principle exists in the organisms, life continues. Coupled with the five organs of action it forms the vital sheath. In the Vivekachudamani it is a modification of [[vayu]] or air, it enters into and comes out of the body.

=== Manomaya kosha ===

Manomaya means composed of [[Mind|manas]] or [[mind]]. The mind (manas) along with the five sensory organs is said to constitute the manomaya kosa. The ''manomaya kosa'', or “mind-sheath” is said more truly to approximate to personhood than ''annamaya kosa'' and ''pranamaya kosha''. It is the cause of diversity, of ''I'' and ''mine''. [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] likens it to clouds that are brought in by the wind and again driven away by the same agency. Similarly, man’s bondage is caused by the mind, and liberation, too, is caused by that alone.

=== Vijñānmāyā kosha ===

Vijñānmāyā means composed of [[Vijñānā]], or intellect, the faculty which discriminates, determines or [[will (philosophy)|will]]s. [[Chattampi Swamikal]] defines Vijñānmāyā as the combination of intellect and the [[five sense organs]]. It is the sheath composed of more intellection, associated with the organs of perception. Sankara holds that the [[buddhi]], with its modifications and the organs of knowledge, form the cause of man’s [[Reincarnation|transmigration]]. This knowledge sheath, which seems to be followed by a reflection of the power of the [[Cit (consciousness)|cit]], is a modification of [[prakrti]]. It is endowed with the function of knowledge and identifies itself with the body, organs etc.

This knowledge sheath cannot be the supreme self for the following reasons;
*It is subject to change.
*It is insentient.
*It is a limited thing.
*It is not constantly present.

=== Anandamaya kosha ===
{{main|Anandamaya kosha}}

Anandamaya means composed of ananda, or [[wikt:bliss|bliss]]. In the [[Upanishads]] the sheath is known also as the ''[[causal body]]''. In deep sleep, when the mind and senses cease functioning, it still stands between the finite world and the self. Anandamaya, or that which is composed of Supreme bliss, is regarded as the innermost of all. The bliss sheath normally has its fullest play during [[deep sleep]]: while in the dreaming and wakeful states, it has only a partial manifestation. The blissful sheath ([[anandamaya kosha]]) is a reflection of the Atman which is truth, beauty, bliss absolute.

The following entry is for the utility of Hindu aspirants who are familiar with Panchakosha:

Just as each of the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) appear in corresponding subtlety among each of the five senses so too the intellect cognizes ever subtler causes and effects at play through each of the five sheaths.

For example, the annamayakosha, the coarsest sheath, is based in the earth element, which is guarded by Ganesha, while the very subtlest sheath Anandamaya is based in the quanta/ether element, and is guarded by a black disc of utter darkness over the sun, which can be removed only by Ganesha.

Awareness of that reflection of atman/self within the most subtle sheath, Anandamayakosha, however, is but the foundation for discerning that which the elements, energies, senses, and kosha serve. To that end, one re-examines the components of the five koshas in daily devotional meditation after recitation of twenty-one OM, viz, one OM per each of the five elements, the five pranas, the five indriyas, and the five kosha, equaling twenty OM, then a twenty-first OM is offered for the ineffable, such that a spiritual discernment of ever-increasing subtlety arises in the purified intellect, alaya nirvijnana, the womb of the tathagata, wherein silence ensues and clarity blossoms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17268">The '''language of mathematics''' is the system used by [[mathematician]]s to communicate [[Mathematics|mathematical]] ideas among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/language/MathIsLanguage.shtml|title=Mathematics Is a Language|last=Bogomolny|first=Alexander |author-link=Alexander Bogomolny|website=www.cut-the-knot.org|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This language consists of a [[substratum (linguistics)|substrate]] of some [[natural language]] (for example [[English language|English]]) using [[technical term]]s and grammatical conventions that are peculiar to mathematical discourse (see [[Mathematical jargon]]), supplemented by a highly specialized symbolic notation for [[mathematical formula]]s.

Like natural languages in general, discourse using the language of mathematics can employ a scala of [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s. [[Research article]]s in [[academic journals]] are sources for detailed theoretical discussions about ideas concerning mathematics and its implications for society.

==What is a language?==
Here are some definitions of [[language]]:
* ''a systematic means of communicating by the use of sounds or conventional symbols''
* ''a system of words used in a particular discipline''
* ''a system of abstract codes which represent antecedent events and concepts''&lt;ref&gt;Syntax: An Introduction, Volume 1
Talmy GivónJohn Benjamins Publishing, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''the code we all use to express ourselves and communicate to others'' - Speech &amp; Language Therapy Glossary of Terms
* ''a set (finite or infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements'' - [[Noam Chomsky]].

These definitions describe language in terms of the following components:
* A [[vocabulary]] of symbols or words
* A [[grammar]] consisting of rules of how these symbols may be used
* A 'syntax' or propositional structure, which places the symbols in linear structures.
* A 'Discourse' or 'narrative,' consisting of strings of syntactic propositions&lt;ref&gt;Syntax: An Introduction, Volume 1
Talmy Givón
John Benjamins Publishing, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[community]] of people who use and understand these symbols
* A range of [[Meaning (semiotics)|meanings]] that can be communicated with these symbols

Each of these components is also found in the language of mathematics.

==The vocabulary of mathematics==
[[Mathematical notation]] has assimilated [[table of mathematical symbols|symbols]] from many different [[alphabet]]s and [[typeface]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/logic#toc283520|title=logic|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes symbols that are specific to mathematics, such as

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \ \exists \ \vee \ \wedge \ \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematical notation is central to the power of modern mathematics. Though the [[algebra]] of [[Al-Khwārizmī]] did not use such symbols, it solved equations using many more rules than are used today with symbolic notation, and had great difficulty working with multiple variables (which using symbolic notation can simply be called &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;, etc.). Sometimes formulas cannot be understood without a written or spoken explanation, but often they are sufficient by themselves, and sometimes they are difficult to read aloud or information is lost in the translation to words, as when several parenthetical factors are involved or when a complex structure like a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is manipulated.

Like any other profession, mathematics also has its own brand of [[technical terminology]]. In some cases, a word in general usage has a different and specific meaning within mathematics—examples are [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], [[field (mathematics)|field]], [[category theory|category]], [[term (mathematics)|term]], and [[Factorization|factor]]. For more examples, see [[:Category:Mathematical terminology]].

In other cases, specialist terms have been created which do not exist outside of mathematics—examples are [[tensor]], [[fractal]], [[functor]]. Mathematical statements have their own moderately complex taxonomy, being divided into [[axiom]]s, [[conjecture]]s, [[theorem]]s, [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]s and [[corollary|corollaries]]. And there are stock phrases in mathematics, used with specific meanings, such as "{{italics correction|''[[if and only if]]''}}", "{{italics correction|''[[necessary and sufficient]]''}}" and "''[[without loss of generality]]''". Such phrases are known as [[mathematical jargon]].

The vocabulary of mathematics also has visual elements. Diagrams are used informally on blackboards, as well as more formally in published work. When used appropriately, diagrams display schematic information more easily. Diagrams also help visually and aid intuitive calculations. Sometimes, as in a [[visual proof]], a diagram even serves as complete justification for a proposition. A system of diagram conventions may evolve into a mathematical notation – for example, the [[Penrose graphical notation]] for tensor products.

==The grammar of mathematics==
The mathematical notation used for formulas has its own [[grammar]], not dependent on a specific natural language, but shared internationally by mathematicians regardless of their mother tongues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/FormalandNaturalLanguages.html|title=1.11. Formal and Natural Languages — How to Think like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition|website=interactivepython.org|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the conventions that the formulas are written predominantly [[left to right]], even when the writing system of the substrate language is right-to-left, and that the [[Latin alphabet]] is commonly used for simple [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s and [[parameter]]s. A formula such as
:&lt;math&gt;\sin x + a\cos 2 x \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
is understood by Chinese and Syrian mathematicians alike.

Such mathematical formulas can be a [[part of speech]] in a natural-language phrase, or even assume the role of a full-fledged sentence. For example, the formula above, an [[inequation]], can be considered a sentence or an independent clause in which the [[greater than or equal to]] symbol has the role of a symbolic [[verb]]. In careful speech, this can be made clear by pronouncing "≥" as "is greater than or equal to", but in an informal context mathematicians may shorten this to "greater or equal" and yet handle this grammatically like a verb. A good example is the book title ''Why does {{nowrap|1=E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}?'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why does E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;? (and why should we care?) |author=Brian Cox |authorlink=Brian Cox (physicist) |author2=Jeff Forshaw |authorlink2=Jeff Forshaw|publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-306-81876-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; here, the [[equals sign]] has the role of an [[infinitive]].

Mathematical formulas can be ''[[Speech production|vocalized]]'' (spoken aloud). The vocalization system for formulas has to be learned, and is dependent on the underlying natural language. For example, when using English, the expression "''ƒ''(''x'')" is conventionally pronounced "eff of eks", where the insertion of the preposition "of" is not suggested by the notation per se. The expression "&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;", on the other hand, is commonly vocalized like "dee-why-dee-eks", with complete omission of the [[fraction bar]], in other contexts often pronounced "over". The book title ''Why does {{nowrap|1=E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}?'' is said aloud as ''Why does ee equal em see-squared?''.

Characteristic for mathematical discourse – both formal and informal – is the use of the [[Clusivity|inclusive]] [[Grammatical person|first person]] [[plural]] "we" to mean: "the audience (or reader) together with the speaker (or author)".

=== Typographical conventions ===
{{Main|Typographical conventions in mathematical formulae}}
As is the case for spoken mathematical language, in written or printed mathematical discourse, mathematical expressions containing a symbolic verb, like &lt;math&gt;=,\ \in,\ \exists&lt;/math&gt;, are generally treated as clauses (dependent or independent) in sentences or as complete sentences and are punctuated as such by mathematicians and theoretical physicists.  In particular, this is true for ''both'' inline and displayed expressions.  In contrast, writers in other natural sciences disciplines may try to avoid using equations within sentences and may treat displayed expressions in the same way as figures or schemes.

As an example, a mathematician might write: 

:If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b_n)&lt;/math&gt; are convergent sequences of real numbers, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n=B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(c_n)&lt;/math&gt;, defined for all positive integers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;c_n = a_n+b_n&lt;/math&gt;, is convergent, and
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} c_n=A+B&lt;/math&gt;.

In this statement, "&lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;" (in which &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is read as "ay en" or perhaps, more formally, as "the sequence ay en") and "&lt;math&gt;(b_n)&lt;/math&gt;" are treated as nouns, while "&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=A&lt;/math&gt;" (read: the limit of &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; as ''n'' tends to infinity equals 'big A'), "&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n=B&lt;/math&gt;", and "&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} c_n=A+B&lt;/math&gt;" are read as independent clauses, and "&lt;math&gt;c_n = a_n+b_n&lt;/math&gt;" is read as "the equation &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; plus &lt;math&gt;b_n&lt;/math&gt;".  Moreover, the sentence ends after the displayed equation, as indicated by the [[period  (punctuation)|period ]] after "&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} c_n=A+B&lt;/math&gt;". In terms of typesetting conventions, broadly speaking, standard mathematical functions such as {{math|[[Sine|sin]]}} and operations such as {{math|+}} as well as punctuation symbols including the various [[bracket]]s are set in {{math|[[roman type]]}} while Latin alphabet variables are set in {{math|''[[italics]]''}}.  Matrices, vectors, and other objects made up of components are set in {{math|'''bold roman'''}}.  (There is some disagreement as to whether the standard constants (e.g., {{mvar|e}}, π, i = (–1)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;) or the "d" in {{math|''dy''/''dx''}} should be italicized.  Greek letters are also usually set upright instead of slanted.)  There are also a number of conventions for the part of the alphabet from which variable names are chosen.  For example, {{mvar|i}}, {{mvar|j}}, {{mvar|k}}, {{mvar|l}}, {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}} are usually reserved for integers, {{mvar|w}} and {{mvar|z}} are often used for complex numbers, while {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, α, β, γ are used for real numbers.  The letters {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}} are frequently used for [[unknown (mathematics)|unknown]]s to be found or as arguments of a function, while {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}} are used for [[coefficient]]s and {{mvar|f}}, {{mvar|g}}, {{mvar|h}} are used as names of functions.  These conventions are not hard rules.

Definitions are signaled by words like "we call", "we say", or "we mean" or by statements like "An [''object''] is [''word to be defined''] if [''condition'']" (for example, "A set is closed if it contains all of its limit points.").  As a special convention, the word "if" in such a definition should be interpreted as "[[if and only if]]".

[[Theorems]] have generally a title or label in bold type, and possibly identify the originator (for example, "{{math|'''Theorem 1.4 (Weyl).'''}}").  This is immediately followed by the statement of the theorem, usually set in italics.  The proof of a theorem is usually clearly delimited, starting with the word ''Proof'' while the end of the proof is indicated by a [[Tombstone (typography)|halmos]] or another symbol, or by the letters [[Q.E.D.]].

==The language community of mathematics==
Mathematics is used by [[list of mathematicians|mathematicians]], who form a global community composed of speakers of many languages. It is also used by students of mathematics.  As mathematics is a part of primary education in almost all countries, almost all educated people have some exposure to pure mathematics. There are very few cultural dependencies or barriers in modern mathematics. There are international mathematics competitions, such as the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], and international co-operation between professional mathematicians is commonplace.

==The meanings of mathematics==
Mathematics is used to communicate information about a wide range of different subjects. Here are three broad categories:

* '''Mathematics describes the real world''': many areas of mathematics originated with attempts to describe and solve real world phenomena - from measuring farms ([[geometry]]) to falling apples ([[calculus]]) to gambling ([[probability]]). Mathematics is widely used in modern [[mathematical physics|physics]] and [[engineering]], and has been hugely successful in helping us to understand more about the universe around us from its largest scales ([[physical cosmology]]) to its smallest ([[quantum mechanics]]). Indeed, the very success of mathematics in this respect has been a source of puzzlement for some philosophers (see [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]] by [[Eugene Wigner]]).
* '''Mathematics describes abstract structures''': on the other hand, there are areas of pure mathematics which deal with [[abstract structure]]s, which have no known physical counterparts at all. However, it is difficult to give any categorical examples here, as even the most abstract structures can be co-opted as models in some branch of physics (see [[Calabi-Yau spaces]] and [[string theory]]).
* '''Mathematics describes mathematics''': mathematics can be used reflexively to describe itself—this is an area of mathematics called [[metamathematics]].

Mathematics can communicate a range of meanings that is as wide as (although different from) that of a natural language. As [[England|English]] mathematician [[Rolph Ludwig Edward Schwarzenberger|R.L.E. Schwarzenberger]] says:

:''My own attitude, which I share with many of my colleagues, is simply that mathematics is a language. Like English, or Latin, or Chinese, there are certain concepts for which mathematics is particularly well suited: it would be as foolish to attempt to write a love poem in the language of mathematics as to prove the [[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]] using the English language.''

==Alternative views==
Some definitions of language, such as early versions of [[Charles Hockett]]'s "design features" definition, emphasize the spoken nature of language. Mathematics would not qualify as a language under these definitions, as it is primarily a written form of communication (to see why, try reading [[Maxwell's equations]] out loud). However, these definitions would also disqualify [[sign language]]s, which are now recognized as languages in their own right, independent of spoken language.

Other linguists believe no valid comparison can be made between mathematics and language, because they are simply too different:

: ''Mathematics would appear to be both more and less than a language for while being limited in its linguistic capabilities it also seems to involve a form of thinking that has something in common with art and music.'' - Ford &amp; Peat (1988)

'''Latency''' is a time interval between the stimulation and response, or, from a more general point of view, a time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/L/latency.html "What is Latency?" / "Latency"] Retrieved 2015-02-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Latency is physically a consequence of the limited velocity with which any physical interaction can propagate. The magnitude of this velocity is always less than or equal to the [[speed of light]]. Therefore, every physical system will experience some sort of latency, regardless of the nature of stimulation that it has been exposed to.

The precise definition of latency depends on the system being observed and the nature of stimulation.  In communications, the lower limit of latency is determined by the medium being used for communications.  In reliable two-way communication systems, latency limits the maximum rate that information can be transmitted, as there is often a limit on the amount of information that is "in-flight" at any one moment.  In the field of human–machine interaction, perceptible latency has a strong effect on user satisfaction and usability.

==Communication latency==

[[Online game]]s are sensitive to latency since fast response times to new events occurring during a game session are rewarded while slow response times may carry penalties. [[Lag]] is the term used to describe latency in gaming. Due to a delay in transmission of game events, a player with a high latency internet connection may show slow responses in spite of appropriate [[reaction time]].  This gives players with low latency connections a technical advantage.

Minimizing latency is of interest in the [[Low latency (capital markets)|capital markets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=TABB|title=High Frequency Trading Technology: a TABB Anthology|year=2009|url=http://www.tabbgroup.com/PublicationDetail.aspx?PublicationID=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly where [[algorithmic trading]] is used to process market updates and turn around orders within milliseconds. Low-latency trading occurs on the networks used by financial institutions to connect to stock exchanges and electronic communication networks (ECNs) to execute financial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mackenzie|first=Michael|title=The dash to flash|url=http://www.themistrading.com/article_files/0000/0493/8-6-09Financial_Times.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|year=2009|author2=Grant, Jeremy|quote=extracting tiny slices of profit from trading small numbers of shares  in companies, often between different trading platforms, with success relying on minimal variations in speed - or  "latency", in the trading vernacular.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joel Hasbrouck and Gideon Saar (2011) measure latency based on three components: the time it takes for information to reach the trader, execution of the trader’s algorithms to analyze the information and decide a course of action, and the generated action to reach the exchange and get implemented.

==={{Anchor|PACKET-SWITCHED}}Packet-switched networks===
{{See also|Bandwidth-delay product|Network delay}}

'''Network latency''' in a [[packet-switched]] network is measured as either [[One-way delay|one-way]] (the time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it), or [[round-trip delay time]] (the one-way latency from source to destination plus the one-way latency from the destination back to the source). Round-trip latency is more often quoted, because it can be measured from a single point. Note that round trip latency excludes the amount of time that a destination system spends processing the packet.{{cn|reason=Not supported by [[Round-trip delay time]]. The reality is, some measures include this and some don't|date=June 2018}} Many software platforms provide a service called [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] that can be used to measure round-trip latency. Ping uses the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) ''echo request'' which causes the recipient to send the received packet as an immediate response, thus it provides a rough way of measuring round-trip delay time. Ping cannot perform accurate measurements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/7479-Dont-misuse-ping!.html|title=Don't misuse ping!|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally because ICMP is intended only for diagnostic or control purposes, and differs from real communication protocols such as [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]. Furthermore, [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[internet service provider]]s might apply different [[traffic shaping]] policies to different protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, in a non-trivial network, a typical packet will be forwarded over multiple links and gateways, each of which will not begin to forward the packet until it has been completely received.  In such a network, the minimal latency is the sum of the transmission delay of each link, plus the forwarding latency of each gateway. In practice, minimal latency also includes queuing and processing delays. [[Queuing delay]] occurs when a gateway receives multiple packets from different sources heading towards the same destination. Since typically only one packet can be transmitted at a time, some of the packets must queue for transmission, incurring additional delay. [[Processing delay]]s  are incurred while a gateway determines what to do with a newly received packet. [[Bufferbloat]] can also cause increased latency that is an order of magnitude or more. The combination of propagation, serialization, queuing, and processing delays often produces a complex and variable network latency profile.

Latency limits total throughput in reliable two-way communication systems as described by the [[bandwidth-delay product]].

===Fiber optics===
Latency in fiber optics is largely a function of the [[speed of light]], which is 299,792,458 meters/second in vacuum.  This would equate to a latency of 3.33&amp;nbsp;[[Microsecond|µs]] for every kilometer of path length.  The [[index of refraction]] of most fibre optic cables is about 1.5, meaning that light travels about 1.5 times as fast in a vacuum as it does in the cable.  This works out to about 5.0&amp;nbsp;µs of latency for every kilometer.  In shorter metro networks, higher latency can be experienced due to extra distance in building risers and cross-connects. To calculate latency of a connection, one has to know the distance traveled by the fibre, which is rarely a straight line, since it has to traverse geographic contours and obstacles, such as roads and railway tracks, as well as other rights-of-way. 

Due to imperfections in the fibre, light degrades as it is transmitted through it. For distances of greater than 100 kilometers, [[Optical amplifier|amplifiers]] or [[Regenerator (telecommunication)|regenerators]] are deployed. Latency introduced by these components needs to be taken into account.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

===Satellite transmission===
This is illustrated when a [[news presenter]] in a studio talks with a reporter in a distant place via a geostationary [[communication satellite]]. The signal travels from the newsreader up to and down from the satellite to the reporter and then the reply from the reporter does the same, resulting in four satellite hops incurring a [[Geostationary_orbit#Communications|latency]] on the order of a half second, not including the typically smaller latencies inside the communications equipment.

[[Low Earth orbit]] is sometimes used to cut this delay, at the expense of more complicated satellite tracking on the ground and requiring more satellites in the [[satellite constellation]] to ensure continuous coverage.

==Audio latency==
{{main|Latency (audio)}}

Audio latency is the delay between when an audio signal enters and when it emerges from a system. Potential contributors to latency in an audio system include [[analog-to-digital conversion]], [[Buffer (telecommunication)|buffering]], [[digital signal processing]], [[transmission time]], [[digital-to-analog conversion]] and the [[speed of sound]] in air.

==Operational latency==
Any individual [[workflow]] within a system of workflows can be subject to some type of operational latency.  It may even be the case that an individual system may have more than one type of latency, depending on the type of participant or goal-seeking behavior.  This is best illustrated by the following two examples involving [[air travel]].

===Consumer view===
From the point of view of a passenger, latency can be described as follows.  Suppose John Doe flies from [[London]] to [[New York City|New York]].  The latency of his trip is the time it takes him to go from his house in England to the hotel he is staying at in New York.  This is independent of the throughput of the London-New York air link &amp;ndash; whether there were 100 passengers a day making the trip or 10000, the latency of the trip would remain the same.

===Producer view===
From the point of view of flight operations personnel, latency can be entirely different.  Consider the staff at the London and New York airports.  Only a limited number of planes are able to make the transatlantic journey, so when one lands they must prepare it for the return trip as quickly as possible.  It might take, for example:
*35 minutes to clean a plane
*15 minutes to refuel a plane
*10 minutes to load the passengers
*30 minutes to load the cargo

Assuming the above are done one after another, minimum plane [[turnaround time]] is:
:35 + 15 + 10 + 30 = '''90'''

However, cleaning, refueling and loading the cargo can be done at the same time. Passengers can be loaded after cleaning is complete. The reduced latency, then, is:
:35 + 10 = 45
:15
:30
:Minimum latency = '''45'''

The people involved in the turnaround are interested only in the time it takes for their individual tasks.  When all of the tasks are done at the same time, however, it is possible to reduce the latency to the length of the longest task. If some steps have prerequisites, it becomes more difficult to perform all steps in parallel. In the example above, the requirement to clean the plane before loading passengers results in a minimum latency longer than any single task.

==Mechanical latency==
Any mechanical process encounters limitations modeled by [[Newtonian physics]].  The behavior of [[disk drive]]s provides an example of mechanical latency.  Here, it is the time needed for the data encoded on a platter to rotate from its current position to a position adjacent to the read-write head as well as the seek time required for the actuator arm for the read-write head to be positioned above the appropriate track.  This is also known as [[rotational latency]] and [[seek time]] since the basic term '''latency''' is also applied to the time required by a computer's [[electronics]] and [[software]] to perform [[polling (computer science)|polling]], [[interrupt]]s, and [[direct memory access]].

==Computer hardware and operating system latency==
{{Further|Access time}}

Computers run sets of instructions called a [[Process (computing)|process]].  In [[operating system]]s, the execution of the process can be postponed if other processes are also executing.  In addition, the operating system can schedule when to perform the action that the process is commanding.  For example, suppose a process commands that a computer card's voltage output be set high-low-high-low and so on at a rate of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz.  The operating system may choose to adjust the scheduling of each transition (high-low or low-high) based on an internal clock.  The latency is the delay between the process instruction commanding the transition and the hardware actually transitioning the voltage from high to low or low to high.

On [[List of Microsoft operating systems|Microsoft Windows]], it appears{{or|date=March 2011}} that the timing of commands to hardware is not exact.  Empirical data suggest that Windows (using the Windows sleep timer which accepts millisecond sleep times) will schedule on a 1024&amp;nbsp;Hz clock and will delay 24 of 1024 transitions per second to make an average of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz for the update rate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  This can have serious ramifications for discrete-time algorithms that rely on fairly consistent timing between updates such as those found in control theory. The sleep function or similar windows API were at no point designed for accurate timing purposes. Certain multimedia-oriented API routines like &lt;code&gt;timeGetTime()&lt;/code&gt; and its siblings provide better timing consistency.  However, consumer- and server-grade Windows ({{as of | 2011 | lc = on}} those based on [[Ntoskrnl.exe|NT kernel]]) were not to be [[real-time operating system]]s. Drastically more accurate timings could be achieved by using dedicated hardware extensions and control-loop cards.

[[Linux]] may have the same problems with scheduling of hardware I/O.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The problem in Linux is mitigated by support for posix real-time extensions, and the possibility of using a kernel with the [[PREEMPT_RT|PREEMPT_RT patch]] applied.

On embedded systems, the real-time execution of instructions is often supported by the low-level embedded operating system.

==In simulators and simulation==
In simulation applications, 'latency' refers to the time delay, normally measured in [[millisecond]]s (1/1,000 sec), between initial input and an output clearly discernible to the simulator trainee or simulator subject.  Latency is sometimes also called transport delay.

* Some authorities distinguish between latency and transport delay by using the term 'latency' in the sense of the extra time delay of a system over and above the reaction time of the vehicle being simulated, but this requires a detailed knowledge of the [[vehicle dynamics]] and can be controversial.
* Importance of Motion and Visual Latencies.  In simulators with both visual and motion systems, it is particularly important that the latency of the motion system not be greater than of the visual system, or symptoms of [[simulator sickness]] may result.  This is because in the real world, motion cues are those of acceleration and are quickly transmitted to the brain, typically in less than 50 milliseconds; this is followed some milliseconds later by a perception of change in the visual scene.  The visual scene change is essentially one of change of perspective and/or displacement of objects such as the horizon, which takes some time to build up to discernible amounts after the initial acceleration which caused the displacement.  A simulator should therefore reflect the real-world situation by ensuring that the motion latency is equal to or less than that of the visual system and not the other way round.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
[[File:Linné-Systema Naturae 1735.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The title page of ''Systema Naturae'', Leiden (1735)]]

'''Linnaean taxonomy''' can mean either of two related concepts: 
# the particular form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]] (taxonomy) set up by [[Carl Linnaeus]], as set forth in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735) and subsequent works. In the taxonomy of Linnaeus there are three kingdoms, divided into ''classes'', and they, in turn, into ''orders'', ''genera'' (singular: ''genus''), and ''species'' (singular: ''species''), with an additional rank lower than species.
# a term for rank-based classification of organisms, in general. That is, taxonomy in the traditional sense of the word: rank-based [[scientific classification]]. This term is especially used as opposed to [[cladistics|cladistic]] systematics, which groups organisms into [[clade]]s. It is attributed to Linnaeus, although he neither invented the concept of ranked classification (it goes back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) nor gave it its present form. In fact, it does not have an exact present form, as "Linnaean taxonomy" as such does not really exist: it is a collective (abstracting) term for what actually are several separate fields, which use similar approaches.

'''Linnaean name''' also has two meanings: depending on the context, it may either refer to a formal name given by Linnaeus (personally), such as [[Giraffa camelopardalis|''Giraffa camelopardalis'' Linnaeus, 1758]], or a formal name in the accepted nomenclature (as opposed to a modernistic [[clade]] name).

== The taxonomy of Linnaeus ==
In his ''Imperium Naturae'', Linnaeus established three kingdoms, namely ''Regnum Animale'', ''Regnum Vegetabile'' and ''Regnum Lapideum''. This approach, the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral Kingdoms, survives today in the popular mind, notably in the form of the parlour game question: "Is it [[animal, vegetable or mineral]]?". The work of Linnaeus had a huge impact on science; it was indispensable as a foundation for [[biological nomenclature]], now regulated by the [[nomenclature codes]]. Two of his works, the first edition of the ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753) for plants and the tenth edition of the ''Systema Naturae'' (1758), are accepted as part of the starting points of nomenclature; his binomials (names for species) and generic names take priority over those of others. However, the impact he had on science was not because of the value of his taxonomy.

=== Classification for plants ===
His classes and orders of plants, according to his ''Systema Sexuale'', were never intended to represent natural groups (as opposed to his [[ordo naturalis|''ordines naturales'']] in his ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'') but only for use in identification. They were used for that purpose well into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Comstock, J.L.|year=1837 |title= An introduction to the study of botany: including a treatise on vegetable physiology, and descriptions of the most common plants in the middle and northern states |publisher=Robinson, Pratt &amp; Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHnvAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each class were several orders.

[[File:Kalmia latifolia Great Smoky.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Kalmia]]'' is classified according to  Linnaeus' sexual system in class Decandria, order Monogyna, because it has 10 [[stamen]]s and one [[pistil]]]]

The Linnaean classes for plants, in the Sexual System, were: 
* Classis 1. Monandria: flowers with 1 stamen
* Classis 2. Diandria: flowers with 2 stamens
* Classis 3. Triandria: flowers with 3 stamens
* Classis 4. Tetrandria: flowers with 4 stamens
* Classis 5. Pentandria: flowers with 5 stamens
* Classis 6. Hexandria: flowers with 6 stamens
** Hexandria monogynia pp.&amp;nbsp;285–352{{sfn|Linnaeus|1753|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358106#page/297/mode/1up Hexandria monogynia pp.&amp;nbsp;285–352]}}

* Classis 7. Heptandria: flowers with 7 stamens
* Classis 8. Octandria: flowers with 8 stamens
* Classis 9. Enneandria: flowers with 9 stamens
* Classis 10. Decandria: flowers with 10 stamens
* Classis 11. Dodecandria: flowers with 12 stamens
* Classis 12. Icosandria: flowers with 20 (or more) stamens, [[Ovary (plants)#Half-inferior ovary|perigynous]]
* Classis 13. Polyandria: flowers with many stamens, inserted on the [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]
* Classis 14. Didynamia: flowers with 4 stamens, 2 long and 2 short
* Classis 15. Tetradynamia: flowers with 6 stamens, 4 long and 2 short
* Classis 16. Monadelphia; flowers with the anthers separate, but the filaments united, at least at the base
* Classis 17. Diadelphia; flowers with the stamens united in two separate groups
* Classis 18. Polyadelphia; flowers with the stamens united in several separate groups
* Classis 19. Syngenesia; flowers with stamens united by their anthers
* Classis 20. Gynandria; flowers with the stamens united to the pistils
* Classis 21. Monoecia: [[monoecious]] plants
* Classis 22. Dioecia: [[dioecious]] plants
* Classis 23. Polygamia: [[Plant sexual morphology#Plant population|polygamodioecious]] plants
* Classis 24. Cryptogamia: the "flowerless" plants, including [[fern]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[algae]], and [[bryophyte]]s

The classes based on the number of stamens were then subdivided by the number of pistils, e.g. ''Hexandria monogynia'' with six stamens and one pistil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linnaeus Sexual System|url=http://cronklab.wikidot.com/linnaeus-sexual-system|website=CronkLab|publisher=Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia|accessdate=26 January 2015|ref={{harvid|Linnaeus Sexual System|2015}}}}

=== Classification for animals ===
[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|400px|The 1735 classification of animals]]

Only in the Animal Kingdom is the higher taxonomy of Linnaeus still more or less recognizable and some of these names are still in use, but usually not quite for the same groups. He divided the Animal Kingdom into six classes, in the tenth edition, of 1758, these were:
* Classis 1. [[Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Mammalia]]
* Classis 2. [[Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Aves]]
* Classis 3. [[Amphibia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Amphibia]]
* Classis 4. [[Pisces in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Pisces]]
* Classis 5. [[Insecta in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Insecta]]
* Classis 6. [[Vermes in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Vermes]]

=== Classification for minerals ===
His taxonomy of [[mineral]]s has long since dropped from use. In the tenth edition, 1758, of the ''Systema Naturae'', the Linnaean classes were:

* Classis 1. Petræ
* Classis 2. Mineræ
* Classis 3. Fossilia
* Classis 4. Vitamentra

== Rank-based scientific classification ==
{{Main|Taxonomy (biology)}}

This rank-based method of classifying living organisms was originally popularized by (and much later named for) Linnaeus, although it has changed considerably since his time. The greatest innovation of Linnaeus, and still the most important aspect of this system, is the general use of [[binomial nomenclature]], the combination of a [[genus]] name and a second term, which together uniquely identify each [[species]] of organism within a kingdom. For example, the [[human]] species is uniquely identified within the animal kingdom by the name ''Homo sapiens''. No other species of animal can have this same [[binomen]] (the technical term for a binomial in the case of animals). Prior to Linnaean taxonomy, animals were classified according to their mode of movement.

Linnaeus's use of binomial nomenclature was anticipated by the theory of definition used in [[Scholasticism]]. Scholastic logicians and philosophers of nature defined the species man, for example, as ''Animal rationalis'', where ''animal'' was considered a genus and ''rationalis'' (Latin for "rational") the characteristic distinguishing man from all other animals. Treating ''animal'' as the immediate genus of the species man, horse, etc. is of little practical use to the biological taxonomist, however. Accordingly, Linnaeus's classification treats ''animal'' as a class including many genera (subordinated to the animal "kingdom" via intermediary classes such as "orders"), and treats ''homo'' as the genus of a species ''Homo sapiens'', with ''sapiens'' (Latin for "knowing" or "understanding") playing a differentiating role analogous to that played, in the Scholastic system, by ''rationalis'' (the word ''homo'', Latin for "human being", was used by the Scholastics to denote a species, not a genus).

A strength of Linnaean taxonomy is that it can be used to organize the different kinds of living [[organism]]s, simply and practically. Every species can be given a unique (and, one hopes, stable) name, as compared with common names that are often neither unique nor consistent from place to place and language to language. This uniqueness and stability are, of course, a result of the acceptance by working [[Systematics|systematists]] (biologists specializing in taxonomy), not merely of the binomial names themselves, but of the rules governing the use of these names, which are laid down in formal [[nomenclature code]]s.

Species can be placed in a [[taxonomic rank|ranked]] [[hierarchy]], starting with either ''[[Domain (biology)|domains]]'' or ''kingdoms''. Domains are divided into [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. Kingdoms are divided into ''[[phylum|phyla]]'' (singular: ''phylum'') &amp;mdash; for [[animal]]s; the term ''division'', used for [[plant]]s and [[fungi]], is equivalent to the rank of phylum (and the current [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] allows the use of either term). Phyla (or divisions) are divided into ''[[Class (biology)|classes]]'', and they, in turn, into ''[[Order (biology)|orders]]'', ''[[Family (biology)|families]]'', ''[[genus|genera]]'' (singular: ''genus''), and ''[[species]]'' (singular: ''species''). There are ranks below species: in zoology, ''subspecies'' (but see ''[[form (zoology)|form]]'' or ''[[morph (zoology)|morph]]''); in botany, ''variety'' (varietas) and ''form'' (forma), etc.

Groups of organisms at any of these ranks are called ''taxa'' (singular: ''[[taxon]]'') or ''taxonomic groups''.

The Linnaean system has proven robust and it remains the only extant working classification system at present that enjoys universal scientific acceptance. However, although the number of ranks is unlimited, in practice any classification becomes more cumbersome the more ranks are added. Among the later subdivisions that have arisen are such entities as phyla, families, and tribes, as well as any number of ranks with prefixes (superfamilies, subfamilies, etc.). The use of newer taxonomic tools such as [[cladistics]] and [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] has led to a different way of looking at evolution (expressed in many nested [[clade]]s) and this sometimes leads to a desire for more ranks. An example of such complexity is the [[Mammal classification#McKenna.2FBell classification|scheme for mammals]] proposed by McKenna and Bell.

=== Alternatives ===
Over time, the understanding of the relationships between living things has changed. Linnaeus could only base his scheme on the structural similarities of the different organisms. The greatest change was the widespread acceptance of [[evolution]] as the mechanism of biological diversity and species formation, following the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. It then became generally understood that classifications ought to reflect the [[phylogeny]] of organisms, their descent by evolution. This led to [[evolutionary taxonomy]], where the various [[extant taxon|extant]] and [[extinction|extinct]] are linked together to construct a phylogeny. This is largely what is meant by the term 'Linnaean taxonomy' when used in a modern context.

In [[cladistics]], originating in the work of [[Willi Hennig]], 1950 onwards, each taxon is grouped so as to include the common ancestor of the group's members (and thus to avoid [[polyphyly]]). Such taxa may be either [[monophyly|monophyletic]] (including all descendants) such as genus ''[[Homo]]'', or [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] (excluding some descendants), such as genus ''[[Australopithecus]]''.

Originally, Linnaeus established three kingdoms in his scheme, namely for [[Plant]]s, [[Animal]]s and an additional group for [[minerals]], which has long since been abandoned.  Since then, various life forms have been moved into three new kingdoms: [[Monera]], for [[prokaryote]]s (i.e., bacteria); [[Protist]]a, for protozoans and most algae; and [[fungus|Fungi]].  This five kingdom scheme is still far from the [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] ideal and has largely been supplanted in modern taxonomic work by a division into three domains: [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]], which contain the prokaryotes, and [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]], comprising the remaining forms. These arrangements should not be seen as definitive. They are based on the [[genome]]s of the organisms; as knowledge on this increases, classifications will change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Embley, T. A.  |author2=Martin, W. |lastauthoramp=yes|date=2006 |title=Eukaryotic evolution, changes and challenges. |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=623–630 |doi=10.1038/nature04546 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/eukaryotic-evolution-changes-and-challenges-13997647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing presumptive evolutionary relationships, especially given the wide acceptance of [[cladistic]] methodology and numerous [[molecular phylogenetic|molecular phylogenies]] that have challenged long-accepted classifications, within the framework of Linnaean taxonomy, is sometimes seen as problematic. Therefore, some systematists have proposed a [[PhyloCode]] to replace it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5261">A '''literary element''', or '''narrative element''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lunsford|Horowitz|2005|p=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''element of literature'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Literature|2015|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a constituent of all works of [[narrative]] [[fiction]]—a necessary feature of verbal storytelling that can be found in any written or spoken narrative. This distinguishes them from [[literary technique]]s, or non-universal features of literature that accompany the construction of a particular work rather than forming the essential characteristics of all narrative. For example, [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Theme (narrative)|theme]], [[Character (arts)|character]] and [[Tone (literature)|tone]] are literary elements, whereas [[figurative language]], [[irony]], or [[foreshadowing]] would be considered literary techniques.

Literary elements aid in the discussion of and understanding of a work of literature as basic categories of critical analysis; literary elements could be said to be produced by the readers of a work just as much as they are produced by its author. For the most part, they are popular concepts that are not limited to any particular branch of [[literary criticism]], although they are most closely associated with the [[Formalism (literature)|formalist method]] of professional literary criticism. There is no official definition or fixed list of terms of literary elements; however, they are a common feature of literary education at the [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] level, and a set of terms similar to the one below often appears in institutional student evaluation. For instance, the New York State Comprehensive English [[Regents Examinations|Regents Exam]] requires that students use and discuss literary elements relating to specific works in each of the three essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regents High School Comprehensive Examination in English|url=http://www.nysedregents.org/ComprehensiveEnglish/113/engl12013-exam.pdf|work=Office of State Assessment|publisher=New York State Education Department|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Machine operator efficiency''' (MOE) is a [[lean manufacturing]] term used to describe the performance of an employee who operates industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do You Know MOE|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-operator-efficiency-moe-rick-wenzel?trk=pulse_spock-articles|publisher=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operator's efficiency is measured as the time spent producing product divided by the time the operator is on duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarkar|first1=Prasanta|title=How to calculate operator efficiency at work|url=http://www.onlineclothingstudy.com/2011/09/how-to-calculate-operator-efficiency.html|publisher=OCS|date=2011-09-23|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: if an operator is assigned to run a CNC machine tool for seven hours, but he only has four hours worth of continuous uninterrupted output of workpieces - his MOE rating is 57% (4 divided by 7) for this seven-hour period of time.

There is a similar lean manufacturing [[Key Performance Indicator|KPI]] called [[overall equipment effectiveness]] (OEE). The major difference between OEE and MOE is that the OEE rating is on the machine and the MOE is on the person.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

MOE is a measure of operator performance only, regardless of the type of machine or the speed of the machine he is working on. MOE only measures the operator's ability to keep the machine running continuously (load and unload parts faster that the automatic cycle time of the machine). The MOE rating of an operator will travel with him as he moves from one machine to another. This is easily accomplished because the MOE rating is a universal calculation of time and not reliant on the complex OEE calculations of loading, availability, performance, and quality.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Industrial dashboard|Industrial Dashboards]] can be used to display statistics for MOE ratings on each operator. To boost overall profitability for a manufacturing plant, machine operators are sometimes compensated with a salary bonus based on their MOE ratings.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Metta World Peace''' (born '''Ronald William Artest Jr.'''; November 13, 1979) is an American professional [[basketball]] coach and former player. He is currently the player development coach for the [[South Bay Lakers]] of the [[NBA G League]]. He was known as '''Ron Artest''' before legally changing his name in September 2011.

World Peace gained a reputation as one of the league's premier defenders as he won the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] in 2004, when he was also named an [[NBA All-Star]] and earned [[All-NBA]] honors. He was a participant in several controversial on-court incidents, most notably the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl|Malice at the Palace]], and is known for his sometimes eccentric and outspoken behavior. He won an [[NBA championship]] in 2010 as a member of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

Artest played high school basketball at [[La Salle Academy]] and [[college basketball]] at [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University]]. He has played for six teams in the NBA.

==Early life==
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
Metta World Peace was born Ronald William Artest Jr. on November 13, 1979, and raised in the [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge]] projects in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He has two younger brothers, Isaiah and Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Aasen |title=The man behind the melee |url=http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=39502&amp;search=ron%20artest&amp;section=search |work=[[Indiana Daily Student]] |date=February 10, 2005 |accessdate=April 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209123845/http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=39502&amp;search=ron%20artest&amp;section=search |archive-date=December 9, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played high school basketball at [[La Salle Academy]]. He also teamed with future NBA players [[Elton Brand]] and [[Lamar Odom]] on the same [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) team.&lt;ref name="Ron Artest Bio Page"/&gt;

Growing up, Artest witnessed the murder of a fellow player on a basketball court in [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. "It was so competitive, they broke a leg from a table and they threw it, it went right through his heart and he died right on the court. So I'm accustomed to playing basketball really rough."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.chron.com/nba/2009/05/a_wild_and_crazy_night_kobe_ge.html A wild and crazy night: Kobe gets tough, Artest gets angry and the NBA has some decisions to make]. Retrieved on May 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The player to whom Artest was referring was 19-year-old Lloyd Newton, who was stabbed in the back with a broken-off table leg during an altercation at a 1991 [[YMCA]]-sanctioned basketball tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/15/nyregion/player-dies-in-stabbing-at-basketball-game.html Player Dies in Stabbing at Basketball Game]. Nytimes.com (April 15, 1991). Retrieved on 2012-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
Artest played [[college basketball]] at [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University]] from 1997 to 1999. At St. John's, he majored in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.databasebasketball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=ArtesRo01 Ron Artest Pro and College Stats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011339/http://www.databasebasketball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=ARTESRO01 |date=September 27, 2007 }}.

&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
Artest was selected by the [[Chicago Bulls]] with the 16th pick of the [[1999 NBA draft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbadraft.net/nba_draft_history/1999.html 1999 NBA draft]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1999.html&amp;nbsp;– 1999 NBA Draft | Basketball-Reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artest played a total of 175 games for the Bulls over 2-1/2 years, the bulk as a starter, during which time he averaged about 12.5 points and just over 4 rebounds per game. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in the 1999–2000 season.

Midway through the 2001–02 season, Artest was traded by Chicago to the Indiana Pacers along with [[Ron Mercer]], [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Brad Miller]], and [[Kevin Ollie]], in exchange for [[Jalen Rose]], [[Travis Best]], [[Norman Richardson (basketball)|Norman Richardson]], and a 2nd round draft pick.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Davenport, [http://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2009/7/4/937998/a-ron-artest-review-the-soap-opera "A Ron Artest Review: The Soap Opera So Far"], ''Silver Screen and Roll'', July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacers–Pistons brawl====
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
{{main article|Pacers–Pistons brawl}}

On November 19, 2004, Artest was at the center of an [[violence in sports|altercation]] among players and fans during a game in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]], between Artest's Pacers and the home team [[Detroit Pistons]]. The brawl involved Artest, Pistons [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Ben Wallace]], Artest's teammates [[Jermaine O'Neal]] and [[Stephen Jackson]], several other players, and spectators including Pistons fans John Green&lt;ref name="John Green"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4670842| title= Fan details strides made since brawl| date = November 19, 2009| publisher=ESPN.com| accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and A.J.

The fight resulted in the game being stopped with less than a minute remaining. O'Neal, Jackson and Wallace were suspended indefinitely the day after the game. A day later, the NBA suspended Artest for the rest of the regular season, plus any playoff games. Artest missed 86 games, the [[List of players banned or suspended by the NBA|longest suspension]] for an on-court incident in NBA history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suspensions without pay, won't be staggered|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1928540|publisher=ESPN|date=November 22, 2004|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath and trade====
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
Early in the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06 season]], Artest requested a trade from the Indiana Pacers and was put on the team's inactive roster. Artest's call for a trade created a rift between him and his teammates. "We felt betrayed, a little disrespected", teammate Jermaine O'Neal said. As for their basketball relationship, O'Neal said: "The business relationship is over. That's fact." Pacers president [[Larry Bird]] said he also felt "betrayed" and "disappointed".&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10612285/ 'Betrayed' Bird says Artest must go – December 27, 2005]. MSNBC (December 27, 2005). Retrieved on 2012-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2006, reports from NBA sources confirmed that the [[Sacramento Kings]] had agreed to trade [[Predrag Stojaković|Peja Stojaković]] to the Pacers for Artest. However, before the trade could be completed, many press outlets reported that Artest had informed team management that he did not want to go to Sacramento. According to Artest's [[sports agent|agent]], his original trade request was only made because he was upset when he heard rumors that the Pacers were going to trade him to Sacramento for Stojaković early in the season. While not denying his agent's story, Artest did deny that he had rejected the trade to Sacramento, saying that he would play anywhere; hence, contradicting earlier press accounts stating Artest was holding up the trade. Given conflicting accounts, it is unclear why the trade was delayed, but it was nevertheless completed on January 25 and Artest was officially sent to the Kings for Stojaković.

===Sacramento Kings (2006–2008)===
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
[[Image:Ron Artest.jpg|thumb|170px|Artest during his tenure with the Sacramento Kings.]]
Though traded midseason to the Kings franchise, Artest quickly found his place on the team by providing some much needed defense.&lt;ref name="foxsports1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Kahn |title=Artest has Kings back in playoff hunt |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/5408720 |work=[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] |date=March 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524234734/http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/5408720 |archivedate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many feared his abrasive personality would be a problem, he worked well with his teammates and then-coach [[Rick Adelman]]. Artest wore #93 for his jersey number with the Kings. After acquiring Artest in late January 2006, the team immediately went on a 14–5 run, the team's best run of the season. The Kings broke .500 and landed the eighth spot in the Western Conference. This prompted [[ESPN]] to declare that "Ron Artest has breathed new life in the Sacramento Kings and enhanced their chances of reaching the playoffs for the ninth straight year."&lt;ref name="espn3"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/preview?gameId=260314023 NBA Preview – Lakers At Kings – March 14, 2006].

He was suspended for Game 2 of the team's first-round series against the [[San Antonio Spurs]] following a flagrant foul (elbow to the head) on [[Manu Ginóbili]]. The Kings eventually were eliminated from the playoffs in six games.

After the playoffs, Artest offered to donate his entire salary to keep teammate [[Bonzi Wells]] with the team, who became a free agent after the [[2005–06 NBA season]]. He even jokingly threatened to kill Wells if he did not re-sign with the Kings.&lt;ref name="hardwood"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Amick |title=Q &amp; A: Artest hits the road and the hardwood |url=http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/sports/story/14276300p-15085707c.html |work=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |page=C1 |date=July 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512072334/http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/sports/story/14276300p-15085707c.html |archivedate = May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells was later picked up by the [[Houston Rockets]] and then traded to the [[New Orleans Hornets]] for former [[Sacramento Kings]] player [[Bobby Jackson (basketball)|Bobby Jackson]]. Artest also offered to donate his salary to retain the services of head coach [[Rick Adelman]], whose contract expired after the same season. Adelman and the Kings did not agree on a contract extension so the two parted ways.

===Houston Rockets (2008–2009)===

[[Image:Ron Artest Rockets Wizards.jpg|thumb|left|Artest playing for the [[Houston Rockets]] in the [[2008–09 NBA season]].]]
On July 29, 2008, it was reported that Artest was to be traded to the [[Houston Rockets]] along with [[Patrick Ewing, Jr.]] and [[Sean Singletary]] for [[Bobby Jackson (basketball)|Bobby Jackson]], recently drafted forward [[Donté Greene]], a [[2009 NBA draft|2009 first-round draft]] pick, and cash considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3510261 Rockets agree to send pick, Greene, Jackson to Kings for Artest].

In response, Artest said, "This is Tracy (McGrady) and Yao's team, you know. I'm not going to take it personal. I understand what Yao said, but I'm still ghetto. That's not going to change. I'm never going to change my culture. Yao has played with a lot of black players, but I don't think he's ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as I represent my culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Feigen |title=Despite Yao's comments, Artest seems happy about future |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5916652.html |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=July 30, 2008 |accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artest and Yao later exchanged extensive phone calls. Artest also said, "Whatever Adelman needs me to do, whether that's come off the bench, sixth, seventh man, start, I don't even care. Whatever he needs me to do, I'm 100 percent sure it's going to work out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feigen |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/sports/5945115.html |title=Rockets hoping Artest ends playoff drought |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2008, Artest received his first technical as a Houston Rocket, as he raced towards a group of [[Dallas Mavericks]] players and then quickly went to [[Yao Ming]] who bumped [[Josh Howard]] after play stopped. Artest was trying to pull Yao away from the play and to the foul line, but contact was made with Maverick players. The [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] broadcast crew felt this technical was not warranted, and was based upon Artest's prior reputation as a feisty player in the league. In the [[2009 NBA playoffs|playoffs]], Artest helped the Rockets advance past the first round for the first time in 12 seasons.&lt;ref name="CBSsports-Ron Artest"&gt;{{cite news |title = Rockets down Blazers, advance to second round for first time in 12 years | url = http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20090430_POR@HOU | publisher = CBS Sports | date = May 1, 2009 | accessdate = May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Game 2 of the second round against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], Artest, who was battling for rebounding position with [[Kobe Bryant]], was elbowed in the neck by Bryant, which was later ruled to be a Type 1 [[flagrant foul]]. After being called for an offensive foul, Artest was indignant and proceeded to antagonize Bryant after the play, which eventually led to an ejection by [[Joe Crawford (basketball, born 1951)|Joe Crawford]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Chris.

It was determined the next day that the foul was not serious enough to warrant an ejection, and the flagrant foul was downgraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2009/playoffs2009/05/09/artest.ap/index.html |title=Artest not suspended for Game 4, foul downgraded |publisher=NBA.com |date=May 9, 2009 |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
{{main article|Pacers–Pistons brawl}}

On November 19, 2004, Artest was at the center of an altercation among players and fans during a game in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]] between Artest's Pacers and the home team [[Detroit Pistons]].

The brawl began when Artest [[Personal foul (basketball)|fouled]] Pistons [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Ben Wallace]] as Wallace was [[Layup|putting up a shot]]. Wallace, upset at being fouled hard when the game was effectively over (the Pacers led 97–82 with less than 50 seconds to go), responded by shoving Artest, leading to an [[violence in sports|altercation]] near the scorer's table. Artest walked to the sideline and lay down on the scorer's table. Reacting to Wallace throwing something at Artest, Pistons fan John Green threw a cup of Diet Coke&lt;ref name="John Green 2"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4670842| title= Fan details strides made since brawl| date = November 19, 2009| publisher=ESPN.com| accessdate=November 19, 2009|quote="I remember throwing the cup, actually a cup of Diet Coke, not a beer, but I had been drinking and I've had issues with alcohol in the past"}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Artest, hitting him. Artest jumped into the front-row seats and confronted a man he incorrectly believed to be responsible, which in turn erupted into a brawl between Pistons fans and several of the Pacers. Artest returned to the basketball court, and punched Pistons fan A.J. Shackleford, who was apparently taunting Artest verbally.&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt; This fight resulted in the game being stopped with less than a minute remaining. Artest's teammates [[Jermaine O'Neal]] and [[Stephen Jackson]] were suspended indefinitely the day after the game, along with Wallace.

On November 21, the NBA suspended Artest for the rest of the regular season, plus any playoff games.  All told, Artest missed 86 games (73 regular season games plus 13 playoff games), the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. Eight other players (four Pacers and four Pistons) received suspensions, without pay, which ranged from one to thirty games in length. Each of the players involved were levied fines and ordered to do community service. Several fans were also charged and were banned from attending Pistons games for life. Artest lost approximately $5 million in salary due to the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/site/21683474/ |title=Palace brawl lives in infamy 1 year later |date=November 26, 2005 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671gn543Q?url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/site/21683474/ |archivedate=April 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{orphan|date=June 2013}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''''N''-topological space''' is a set equipped with ''N'' arbitrary topologies. If ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; are ''N''&amp;nbsp;topologies defined on a nonempty set '''X''', then the ''N''-topological space is denoted by (''X'',''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;).
For ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the structure is simply a [[topological space]].
For ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the structure becomes a [[bitopological space]] introduced by J. C. Kelly.&lt;ref name="J. C. Kelly"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=J. C.|title=Bitopological spaces|journal=Proc. London Math. Soc.|year=1963|volume=13|issue=3|pages=71–89|doi=10.1112/plms/s3-13.1.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
Let ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} be any finite set. Suppose ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}. Then the collection ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''φ'',&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''} will be a topology on&amp;nbsp;''X''. If ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be ''m'' such topologies (chain topologies) defined on ''X'', then the structure (''X'', ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) is an '''''m''-topological space'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14412">The neural basis of [[self]] is the idea of using modern concepts of [[neuroscience]] to describe and understand the [[biological]] processes that underlie human's [[perception]] of self-understanding. The '''neural basis of self''' is closely related to the [[psychology of self]] with a deeper foundation in [[neurobiology]].

==Experimental techniques==
In order to understand how the human [[mind]] makes the [[human]] [[perception]] of [[self]], there are different experimental techniques. One of the more common methods of determining brain areas that pertain to different [[mental processes]] is by using [[Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]]. [[fMRI]] data is often used to determine activation levels in portions of the brain. fMRI measures blood flow in the brain. Areas with higher blood flow as shown on fMRI scans are said to be activated. This is due to the assumption that portions of the brain receiving increased blood flow are being used more heavily during the moment of scanning.&lt;ref&gt;About Functional MRI.  {{cite web |url=http://www.fmri.org/fmri.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109170511/http://www.fmri.org/fmri.htm |archivedate=2012-01-09 |df= }}. Accessed November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Positron emission tomography]] is another method used to study brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;Damasio AR, Grabowski TJ, Bechara A, et al. Subcortical and cortical brain activity during the feeling of self-generated emotions. Nature Neuroscience. 2000;3(10):1049-1056.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-awareness==

===Anatomy===
[[File:Gray726.png|thumb|right|Brain areas involved human perception of self.]]
[[File:Head image.jpg|thumb|right|Brain areas involved human perception of self.]]
Two areas of the [[brain]] that are important in retrieving [[self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] are the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] and the medial posterior parietal cortex.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer"&gt;Pfeifer, J. H., Lieberman, M. D., &amp; Dapretto, M. (2007). "I know you are but what am I?!": Neural bases of self- and social knowledge retrieval in children and adults. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19(8), 1323-1337.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[posterior cingulate cortex]], the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and [[medial prefrontal cortex]] are thought to combine to provide humans with the ability to self-reflect. The [[insular cortex]] is also thought to be involved in the process of [[self-reference]].&lt;ref name="Modinos"&gt;Modinos G, Renken R, Ormel J, Aleman A. Self-reflection and the psychosis-prone brain: an fMRI study. Neuropsychology [serial online]. May 2011;25(3):295-305. Available from: MEDLINE with Full Text, Ipswich, MA. Accessed November 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodiment===
The sense of embodiment is critical to a person’s conception of [[self]]. Embodiment is the understanding of the physical body and its relation to oneself.&lt;ref name="Arzy"&gt;Arzy, S., Thut, G., Mohr, C., Michel, C. M., &amp; Blanke, O. (2006). Neural basis of embodiment: Distinct contributions of temporoparietal junction and extrastriate body area. Journal of Neuroscience, 26(31), 8074-8081.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of human embodiment currently has a large impact on the study of human [[cognition]] as a whole. The current study of embodiment suggests that sensory input and [[experiences]] impact human’s overall [[perception]]. This idea somewhat challenges previous ideas of human [[cognition]] because it challenges the idea of the human mind being innate.&lt;ref&gt;Pezzulo G, Barsalou LW, Cangelosi A, Fischer MH, McRae K, Spivey MJ. The mechanics of embodiment: a dialog on embodiment and computational modeling. Frontiers In Psychology.2:5-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two portions of the [[brain]] that have recently been found to have a large importance on a person’s perception of [[self]]. The [[temporoparietal junction]], located in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] is one of these brain regions. The [[temporoparietal junction]] is thought to integrate [[sensory information]]. The second portion of the brain thought to be involved in perception of embodiment is the [[extrastriate body area]]. The extrastriate body area is located in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex.  When people are shown images of body parts, the [[extrastriate body area]] is activated. The temporoparietal junction is involved in sensory integration processes while the extrastriate body area deals mainly with [[thoughts]] of and exposure to human body parts. It has been found that the brain responds to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] that involve embodiment differently from stimuli that involve [[locatization (disambiguatino)|localization]]. During task performance tests, a person’s [[body position]] (whether he or she is sitting or laying face up) affects how the extrastriate body area is activated. The temporoparietal junction, however, is not affected by a person’s particular body position. The temporoparietal junction deals with disembodied rather than embodied self-location, explaining why a person’s physical position does not affect its activation. Self-location as related to a person’s sense of embodiment is related to his or her actual location in space.&lt;ref name="Arzy" /&gt;

===Autobiographical memories===
The [[information]] people remember as [[autobiographical memory]] is essential to their perception of self. These [[memories]] form the way people feel about themselves. The left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] and [[posterior cingulate cortex]] are involved in the memory of autobiographical information.&lt;ref&gt;Botzung, A., Denkova, E., Ciuciu, P., Scheiber, C., &amp; Manning, L. (2008). The neural bases of the constructive nature of autobiographical memories studied with a self-paced [[fMRI]] design. Memory, 16(4), 351-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morality===
[[Morality]] is an extremely important defining factor for humans. It often defines or contributes to people’s choices or actions, defining who a person is. Making moral decisions, much like other neural processes has a clear biological basis. The anterior and [[medial prefrontal cortex]] and the superior temporal sulcus are activated when people feel [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[compassion]], or [[embarrassment]]. Guilt and [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] activate the [[mesolimbic pathway]], and indignation and disgust are activated by the amygdala. There is clearly a network involved with the ideas of [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;Moll, J., de Oliveira-Souza, R., Garrido, G. J., Bramati, I. E., Caparelli-Daquer, E. M. A., Paiva, M., et al. (2007). The self as a moral agent: Link-ling the neural bases of social agency and moral sensitivity. Social Neuroscience, 2(3-4), 336-352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of self==
In order to explain how a human views him or herself, two different conceptual views of self-perception exist: the individualist and collectivistic views of [[self]]. The individualistic view of self involves people's perception of themselves as a stand-alone [[individual]]. This is thought of as a somewhat permanent perception of oneself that is unaffected by environmental and temporary cues and influences. People who view themselves in an individualistic sense describe themselves with [[personality traits]] that are permanent descriptions unrelated to particular situations. The collectivistic view of self, however, involves people's perception of themselves as members of a group or in a particular situation. The view people have of themselves in a collectivistic sense is entirely dependent on the situation they are in and the group with which they are interacting. These two ideas of self are also called self-construal styles.&lt;ref name="Chiao"&gt;Chiao, J. Y., Harada, T., Komeda, H., Li, Z., Mano, Y., Saito, D., et al. (2009). Neural Basis of Individualistic and Collectivistic Views of Self. Human Brain Mapping, 30(9), 2813-2820.&lt;/ref&gt;
There is neurobiological evidence supporting these two definitions of self-construal styles.  [[fMRI]] data has been used to understand the [[biology]] of both the individualistic and collectivistic view of self. Certain people tend to view themselves in almost exclusively a collectivistic sense or an individualistic sense. When people have to describe themselves in a collectivistic way (as a part of a group), those who tend to view themselves collectivistically show greater [[fMRI]] activation in the medial prefrontal  cortex than those who view themselves individualistically. The reverse is true when people describe themselves individualistically.&lt;ref name="Chiao" /&gt;

==Impaired views of self==

The study of the human [[mind]] in diseased states provides valuable insight into how the mind works in healthy individuals. A multitude of diseases are studied to understand altered perceptions of self and what causes these impairments.

===Autism===
[[Autism]] is a disorder in which those affected experience impaired social interactions, communication, and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Carayol J, Schellenberg GD, Dombroski B, Genin E, Rousseau F, Dawson G. Autism risk assessment in siblings of affected children using sex-specific genetic scores. Molecular Autism.2(1):17-17.&lt;/ref&gt; A new approach to studying [[autism]] is to focus on individuals’ perception of [[self]] rather than understanding the individual’s social interactions. A common thought is that understanding of the differences between the self and others are impaired. However, the exact biological mechanism of self-understanding in autistic children is currently unknown. It has been found that there are significant differences in brain activation in self and other situations in autistic children when compared to children who do not have autism.  
In adults who do not have autism, during [[self-recognition]] tasks, the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule in the right hemisphere are activated. Children who do not have autism show activation in these areas when performing face processing tasks for their own faces and those of others. Children with autism, however, only show activation in these areas when recognizing their own faces. The activation in the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] is less in children with autism than in those who do not have autism.&lt;ref&gt;Uddin, L. Q., Davies, M. S., Scott, A. A., Zaidel, E., Bookheimer, S. Y., Iacoboni, M., et al. (2008). Neural Basis of Self and Other Representation in Autism: An fMRI Study of Self-Face Recognition. PLoS ONE, 3(10).
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schizophrenia===
The cortical midline structure is extremely important in the understanding of the self, especially during the task of self-reflection. Many researchers believe that self-reference plays a role in the expression of [[psychoses]]. The disturbance of the individual’s self may be underlying the manifestation of these psychoses. Occurrences such as [[hallucinations]] and [[delusions]] may originate with disruptions of a person’s perception of the self. Understanding the differences in those who have [[psychoses]] and those who do not can aid in diagnoses and treatment of those diseases. Those who are prone to psychoses such as [[schizophrenia]], when describing positive traits about themselves show increased activation in the left insula, right dorsomedial [[prefrontal cortex]], and left [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]]. When they use negative traits to describe themselves, those who are prone to psychoses show higher activation in the bilateral insula, [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name="Modinos" /&gt;

===After strokes===

Sometimes after strokes patients' perception of self changes. Often after a stroke, patients report their perception of self in more negative terms than before their stroke.
&lt;ref&gt;Ellis-Hill CS, Horn S. Change in identity and self-concept: a new theoretical approach to recovery following a stroke. Clinical Rehabilitation. 2000;14(3):279-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging==
It has been found that humans’ ideas of themselves are established early in life but that the perception can change as others ideas are combined with their own. 
There are differences in the areas activated during self-knowledge retrieval between adults and children. This suggests a difference in self-knowledge neurobiologically due to normal aging. The [[prefrontal cortex]] and the medial posterior parietal cortex have been found to be activated when adults perform self-knowledge retrieval processes. Tests consist of presenting subjects with self-description phrases and allowing the subject to respond yes or no depending on whether or not the phrase describes him or herself. During this task, patients brains are fMRI scanned. These results can then be compared to [[fMRI]] data of the same patients when they are asked if the same phrases describe another individual, such as a well-known fictional character. The [[medial prefrontal cortex]] is activated more strongly for subjects when they are describing themselves than when they are describing others. However, children show greater medial prefrontal cortex activation than adults when performing self-knowledge retrieval tasks. Additionally, children and adults activate different specific regions in the medial prefrontal cortex. Adults activate the posterior [[precuneus]] more while children activate the anterior precuneus and the posterior cingulate.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer" /&gt;
The understanding of the areas of the brain most frequently activated in children and adults can also provide information about how children, adolescents, and adults view themselves differently. Older children more significantly activate the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] because they deal with [[introspection]] much less frequently than adults and adolescents. Children have decreased specificity in skills than adults, so they show greater activation during spatial tasks. This is explained by the idea that with increased expertise in a task, decreased interest in wide spatial parameters occurs. When a person is an expert, he or she is able to be more focused in his or her performance. The difference in performance between adults and children is thought to be attributable to different perceptions of the self whether it is more introspective or more concerned with the surroundings and environment.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2804">'''Person of Jewish ethnicity''' ({{lang-ru|'''Лицо еврейской национальности'''}}) is а Russian [[euphemism]] that was invented as a [[politically correct]] alternative term for an [[ethnic Jew]]. It was invented because [[Jew (word)|the word "Jew"]] became [[derogatory]] during [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet antisemitic campaigns]].&lt;ref name="Sarnov"&gt;[[Benedikt Sarnov]],''Our Soviet Newspeak: A Short Encyclopedia of Real Socialism.'', Moscow: 2002, {{ISBN|5-85646-059-6}} (Наш советский новояз. Маленькая энциклопедия реального социализма.), "Persons of Jewish ethnicity", pages 287-293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RFERL"&gt;[http://www.svobodanews.ru/content/article/411203.html Person of Jewish ethnicity], [[RFE/RL]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several officially sanctioned antisemitic campaigns took place in the Soviet Union, most notably the [[Doctor's Plot]] and the struggle against the "[[rootless cosmopolitans]]". However, the entire Jewish population was never openly and officially declared the [[enemy of the people]].&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt; Instead, several [[euphemism]]s were used, such as [[zionists]], [[rootless cosmopolitans]] and "persons of Jewish ethnicity". There was an important distinction between these words: ''zionist'' and ''rootless cosmopolitans'' served as a label for "bad Jews" as enemies of the state, whereas "persons of Jewish ethnicity" was a [[politically correct]] expression for good, loyal Jews who were called by some ordinary folks as ''trained'' Jews (the original Russian word "дресированные" (dressage) typically refers to animals trained to perform in circus).&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt; However most people realized that all these euphemisms denoted ''all'' Jews. A dean of [[Marxism-Leninism]] department at one of Soviet Universities explained the policy to his students:&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt;

{{Quotation|1=One of you asked if our current political campaign can be regarded as [[antisemitism|antisemitic]]. Comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] said: "We hate Nazi not because they are Germans, but because they brought enormous suffering to our land". Same can be said about the Jews.}}

The analogous euphemism "person of Caucasian ethnicity" is used less frequently in modern Russian to refer to [[Racism in Russia#Peoples of the Caucasus|peoples of the Caucasus]], such as [[Georgians in Russia|Georgians]] or [[Armenians in Russia]].&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RFERL"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12420">'''Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports''' ('''PBIS''') is a set of ideas and tools that schools use to improve the behavior of students.  PBIS uses evidence and data-based programs, practices and strategies to frame behavioral improvement in terms of student growth in academic performance, safety, behavior, and establishing and maintaining positive school culture. PBIS addresses the needs of at-risk students as well as the multi-leveled needs of all students in regards to behavior, which creates an environment for both teaching and learning to occur in schools. In contrast to PBIS, many schools used exclusionary discipline practices including detentions, [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]], or [[expulsion (education)|expulsions]] to separate students from the classroom and from peers.  PBIS emphasizes preventing problem behaviors before they happen to increase the opportunity for students to learn by keeping them in the classroom. PBIS is a team-based framework for schools that borrows elements from [[response to intervention]], an intervention that uses diagnostic data to develop personalized learning plans for all students.

==Background==
PBIS is an acronym for Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports.&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) (n.d.). [http://rti.dpi.wi.gov/rti_pbis "Positive behavioral intervention and supports (PBIS)"].  Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective classroom management and discipline are essential for teaching and learning. PBIS emphasizes the integrated use of classroom management and school-wide discipline strategies coupled with effective academic instruction to create a positive and safe school climate for all students.  PBIS is based in a behaviorist psychology approach to improving student behavior, which means that teachers and students identify misbehavior, model appropriate behaviors, and provide clear consequences for behavior in the classroom context.  In a PBIS model, schools must define, teach, and reinforce appropriate behaviors to ensure success. Research shows that punishing students inconsistently without a positive alternative, is ineffective and only offers short-term solutions.&lt;ref name=pbis&gt;Bradley, Renee (2015). [https://www.pbis.org "Positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS)"]. ''U.S. Department of Education (OSEP Technical Assistance Center)''. Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling and rewarding positive behaviors are more effective. The goal of PBIS is to establish a positive school climate. To do this, a continuum of behavior support has been established which can be applied at the school level (primary level), for small groups of students (secondary level), and for individual level (tertiary level).&lt;ref name=pbis/&gt;

==Core features==
PBIS is not a packaged program for districts to purchase. Instead, it is a framework approach that helps schools to identify the key tasks in developing preventative positive behavior tailored to their own school.  It is an approach defined by the following core design components.

===Outcomes===
The outcome is the goal for improved student behavior towards which the school community aims.  The goals must be measurable, and must clearly be the result of implementing the PBIS model.&lt;ref name=Services&gt;Student Services (2015). [http://www.sjusd.org/student-services/pbis/what-is-pbis/ "Positive behavior interventions &amp; supports (PBIS): What is PBIS?"] Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Outcomes of a successful PBIS framework with a school can be measured in both behavior data and academic achievement of the students in the school. The academic and behavior goals are often defined and supported by the students, families, and teachers in tandem for the program to succeed.&lt;ref name=pbis/&gt;

===Data===
PBIS is grounded in the data being used for all levels of decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Renee (2015). [https://www.pbis.org/school "Positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS)"]. ''U.S. Department of Education (OSEP Technical Assistance Center)''. Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The team often considers trends in numbers, locations of where problems occurred, which classes they occurred in, and individual students that were involved.  Through the data, schools take stock of their current situation, pinpoint areas for change and or improvement, and evaluate the effects of current and future interventions.

===Practices===
This component refers to the evidence-based curriculum, instruction, interventions, and strategies implemented within the school, and are meant to create a common and shared understanding of expectations.  These practices are introduced through the team after a review of the data.&lt;ref name=Services/&gt;

===Systems===
PBIS requires a review team of educators with buy-in from across the school and strong administrative support to design and enforce the PBIS system.  The team is generally a representative group of all of the staff (classroom teachers, special education teachers, specialists, etc.).  In a secondary school, students could also be included as part of this team.  The team creates the systems used by the remainder of the staff and the students they serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Colvin, G.|author2=Fernandez, E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Sustaining effective behavior support systems in an elementary school|journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions|volume=2|issue=4|pages=251–253|doi=10.1177/109830070000200414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuum of support==
Each PBIS model uses a continuum of support.  Tiers of support that range in intestate are offered to students as their needs fluctuate.  Most students are supported by tier 1 (universal) Level of support, which describes the general school context.  As students struggle with the behavioral expectations of the model, they may advance to higher tiers to provide more support.

===Tier 1: Primary Level ''(support for all)''===
The first level in PBIS is the universal level. In terms of PBIS, this refers to the school-wide expectations that are defined and taught to all school staff in each of the settings within the school. These expectations are developed by the team and taught to students by their regular classroom teachers, administrators or others who have contact with all students. Many schools who have adopted this framework use: Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible, but like all aspects, this is determined by the school.  The fidelity of the expectations should be determined by the continuous collecting of data.&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, R., Panyan, M., Smith, C. &amp; Wessendorf, S. (in press) Systems change with school-wide positive behavior supports: Iowa’s work in progress. Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the expectations, there should be a system of acknowledgement and reinforcement of expected behaviors.

The Core Principles of PBIS at the primary level are:
#schools can effectively teach appropriate behavior to all students 
#intervene early 
#use a multi-tier model 
#use research-based interventions 
#monitor student progress often 
#use data to make decisions
#use assessments to screen, diagnose, and monitor progress
These principles make the PBIS program significant in that it makes it more proactive rather than reactive. Furthermore, PBIS helps schools develop a common language, common practices, and consistent application of positive and negative reinforcement at a school-wide level.&lt;ref name=pbis/&gt;

===Tier 2: Secondary Level ''(support for some)''===
Although the primary level is taught and reinforced with all students, there may be some students who need additional intervention for students with at-risk behaviors as determined by the data. Secondary prevention provides intensive or targeted interventions to support students not responding to the primary efforts.  These behavioral interventions are taught by specialized staff like special educators, school psychologists, behavior interventionists, and counselors.  Some examples of tier 2 behavior interventions are targeted social skill groups, behavior plans with continuous progress monitoring.

===Tier 3: Tertiary Level ''(support for few)''===
PBIS also acknowledges that some students have high risk behaviors and need specialized, or individualized skill building practice due to exhibited habits of problem behavior.  Tier 3 behavioral interventions involve a functional behavioral assessment (FBA) and an individualized plan of support which includes: 
#new skills to replace problem behaviors 
#reorganization of current environment or "triggers" 
#procedures for monitoring, evaluating, and reassessing the plan. 
To succeed in a tier 3 intervention, both tier 1 and tier 2 interventions must also be in place. Also, support must be conducted in a comprehensive and collaborative manner.

The Tier 3 process should include the student with the behavior issue and the people who know them the best on a personal level working together as a behavioral support team (BST). Support should be tailored to the student’s specific needs. It should also include multiple interventions. The goal at this level is to diminish problematic behavior, increase adaptive skills, and attempt to increase the student’s quality of life.&lt;ref name=pbis/&gt;

==Alternatives to PBIS==

===Culturally responsive PBIS===
Culturally responsive PBIS (CR-PBIS) is also a framework aimed at restructuring school culture much like PBIS. However, CR-PBIS emphasizes change through understanding and interacting with the community. Providing an environment in which all cultures are acknowledged, respected, and celebrated is important in building the bridge between home culture and school culture. To ensure all students succeed, an understanding of their various cultural beliefs and practices are a must. When someone engages in culturally responsive practice, they are forming an understanding about the values, beliefs, and behaviors of other people than themselves.

Race has been a predictor of success in schools for decades. Students of color have statistically lower rates of success. Part of the job of educators is to help bridge the social understanding gap in order to bridge the educational understanding gap.&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin PBIS Network (2015) [http://www.wisconsinrticenter.org/educators/understanding-rti-a-systems-view/crp.html "Culturally Responsive Practices"]. Retrieved April 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there is some concern that PBIS alone 
creates outcome disparities due to culture.  The behavior of students with color, without the 
knowledge of the community they come from, may be seen as disruptive, resistant, and limiting 
to student success. CR-PBIS tries to address these concerns that are left untouched by the 
traditional PBIS framework by including families as a large piece of creating an environment for teaching and learning.

===Responsive Classroom===
Just like PBIS, Responsive Classroom (RC) centers on research-based approaches and strive to ensure high quality education to all students.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Responsive Classroom (n.d.). [http://www.responsiveclassroom.org/sites/default/files/pdf_files/RC_PBIS_white_paper.pdf "Responsive classroom and PBIS: Can schools use them together?"]  Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Both agree that these positive behaviors and the skills needed to reach them must be explicitly taught to students. Lastly, both also believe that non-punitive strategies are more effective than what has been used in schools in the past.

Where PBIS is a framework that coaches the school staff to create their own resources and changes, RC outlines specific prescribed practices that schools should use to reach this goal. Responsive Classroom is a for-purchase-program that staff can be trained in at multiple levels and has published tools and strategies for meeting these goals with students.

{{Further|Superpower|Great power|Regional power|Middle power|Small power}}
'''Power in international relations''' is defined in several different ways. Modern discourse generally speaks in terms of state power, indicating both economic and military power. Those states that have significant amounts of power within the international system are referred to as [[small power]]s, [[middle power]]s, [[regional power]]s, [[great power]]s, [[superpower]]s, or [[hegemons]], although there is no commonly accepted standard for what defines a powerful state. [[NATO Quint]], the [[G7]], the [[BRICS]] nations and the [[G20]] are seen by academics as forms of governments that exercise varying degrees of influence within the international system.

Entities other than states can also be relevant in power acquisition in international relations. Such entities can include [[multilateralism|multilateral]] [[international organizations]], military alliance organizations like [[NATO]], [[multinational corporation]]s like [[Wal-Mart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/03/03/338383/index.htm |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2010-05-22|title=One Nation Under Wal-Mart: How Retailing's Superpower—and our Biggest, Most Admired Company—Is Changing the Rules for Corporate America|date=2003-03-03|first=Jerry|last=Useem}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[non-governmental organizations]] such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]], or other institutions such as the [[Hanseatic League]] and technology companies like [[Facebook]] and [[Google]].

==Concepts of political power==
[[Political science|Political scientists]], [[historian]]s, and practitioners of [[international relations]] ([[diplomat]]s) have used the following concepts of [[political power]]:
* Power as a '''goal''' of states or leaders;
* Power as a measure of '''[[Social influence|influence]]''' or control over outcomes, events, actors and issues;
* Power as victory in conflict and the attainment of '''[[international security|security]]''';
* Power as control over resources and '''capabilities''';
* Power as '''status''', which some states or actors possess and others do not.

===Power as a goal===
Primary usage of "power" as a goal in international relations belongs to political theorists, such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/morg6.htm|title=SIX PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL REALISM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially among Classical [[Realism in international relations|Realist]] thinkers, power is an inherent goal of mankind and of states.  Economic growth, military growth, cultural spread etc. can all be considered as working towards the ultimate goal of international power.  The German military thinker [[Carl von Clausewitz]]&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Richard H. "Hans Delbrück (1848-1929)." Bernadotte E. Schmitt. ''Some Historians of Modern Europe''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; is considered to be the quintessential projection of European growth across the continent.  In more modern times, [[Baron Moser|Claus Moser]] has elucidated theories centre of distribution of power in Europe after the Holocaust, and the power of universal learning as its counterpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview--sir-claus-moser-735-per-cent-english-what-is-dangerous-in-the-sort-of-life-ive-had-is-that-there-are-moments-when-one-might-think-one-is-indispensable-1536025.html#|title=INTERVIEW / Sir Claus Moser: 73.5 per cent English: 'What is dangerous|author=ANGELA LAMBERT|date=27 July 1992|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Monnet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/founding-fathers/pdf/jean_monnet_en.pdf|title=About the EU - European Union website, the official EU website - European Commission|first=|last=Anonymous|date=16 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French left-wing social theorist, stimulating expansive Eurocommunism, who followed on the creator of modern European community, the diplomat and statesman [[Robert Schuman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/founding-fathers/pdf/robert_schuman_en.pdf|title=About the EU - European Union website, the official EU website - European Commission|first=|last=Anonymous|date=16 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power as influence===
[[File:North Atlantic Treaty Organization (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|upright|[[NATO]] accounts for over 70% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|global military expenditure]],&lt;ref name="sipri1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |title=The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328072123/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[United States]] alone accounting for 43% of global military expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/15majorspenders|title=The 15 countries with the highest military expenditure in 2009|publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Political science|Political scientists]] principally use "power" in terms of an actor's ability to exercise [[Sphere of influence|influence]] over other actors within the [[international relations|international system]]. This influence can be [[coercive]], attractive, [[cooperative]], or [[competitive]]. Mechanisms of influence can include the threat or use of force, economic interaction or pressure, diplomacy, and cultural exchange.

Under certain circumstances, states can organize a [[sphere of influence]] or a bloc within which they exercise predominant influence. Historical examples include the spheres of influence recognized under the [[Concert of Europe]], or the recognition of spheres during the [[Cold War]] following the [[Yalta Conference]]. The [[Warsaw Pact]], the "[[Free World]]", and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] were the blocs that arose out of the Cold War contest. Military alliances like [[NATO]] and the Warsaw Pact are another forum through which influence is exercised. However, "[[political realism|realist]]" theory attempted to maintain the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] from the development of meaningful diplomatic relations that can create a [[hegemony]] within the region. [[British foreign policy]], for example, dominated Europe through the [[Congress of Vienna]] after the defeat of France.  They continued the balancing act with the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, to appease Russia and Germany from attacking Turkey.  Britain has sided against the aggressors on the European continent—i.e. the [[German Empire]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[Napoleonic France]] or [[Habsburg Austria]], known during the Great War as the [[Central Powers]] and, in the World War Two were called the [[Axis Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P.Taylor, "Origins of the First World War"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, Sir Robert (1962) 2nd ed. "Britain 1870-1914" The Oxford History of England.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power as security===
''Power'' is also used when describing states or actors that have achieved [[military]] victories or security for their state in the international system. This general usage is most commonly found among the writings of historians or popular writers.

===Power as capability===
American author [[Charles W. Freeman, Jr.]] described power as the following:
{{quote|Power is the capacity to direct the decisions and actions of others. Power derives from strength and will. Strength comes from the transformation of resources into capabilities. Will infuses objectives with resolve. Strategy marshals capabilities and brings them to bear with precision. Statecraft seeks through strategy to magnify the mass, relevance, impact, and irresistibility of power. It guides the ways the state deploys and applies its power abroad. These ways embrace the arts of war, espionage, and diplomacy. The practitioners of these three arts are the paladins of statecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gabriel|last=Marcella|chapter=Chapter 17: National Security and the Interagency Process|chapterurl=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/army-usawc/strategy2004/17marcella.pdf|title=U.S. Army War College Guide to National Security Policy and Strategy|editor-first=J. Boone|editor-last=Bartholomees, Jr.|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/army-usawc/strategy2004/index.htm|pages=239–260|date=July 2004|publisher=United States Army War College}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Power'' is also used to describe the [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and [[Capability (systems engineering)|capabilities]] of a state. This definition is quantitative and is most often{{Dubious|''Power as resources most often used by geopoliticians and the military''|date=February 2017}} used by geopoliticians and the military. Capabilities are thought of in tangible terms—they are measurable, weighable, quantifiable assets. A good example for this kind of measurement is the ''Composite Indicator on Aggregate Power'', which involves 54 indicators and covers the capabilities of 44 states in [[Asia-Pacific]] from 1992 to 2012.&lt;ref name="Fels2017a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fels, Enrico|title=Shifting Power in Asia-Pacific? The Rise of China, Sino-US Competition and Regional Middle Power Allegiance|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319456881|year=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-45689-8|pages=225–340|accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hard power can be treated as a potential and is not often enforced on the international stage.

[[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] strategists have such a concept of national power that can be measured [[Quantitative property|quantitatively]] using an index known as [[comprehensive national power]].

==Power as status==

===Definitions===
Much effort in academic and popular writing is devoted to deciding which countries have the status of "power", and how this can be measured. If a country has "power" (as influence) in military, diplomatic, cultural, and economic spheres, it might be called a "power" (as status). There are several categories of power, and inclusion of a state in one category or another is fraught with difficulty and controversy. In his famous 1987 work, ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers]],'' British-American historian [[Paul Kennedy]] charts the relative status of the various powers from AD 1500 to 2000. He does not begin the book with a [[theoretical definition]] of a "great power"; however he does list them, separately, for many different eras. Moreover, he uses different [[working definitions]] of a great power for different eras. For example:
{{blockquote|"France was not strong enough to oppose Germany in a one-to-one struggle... If the mark of a Great Power is country which is willing to take on any other, then France (like Austria-Hungary) had slipped to a lower position. But that definition seemed too abstract in 1914 to a nation geared up for war, militarily stronger than ever, wealthy, and, above all, endowed with powerful allies."&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul Kennedy|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000|year=1989|origyear=1987|publisher=Fontana|location=London|isbn=0006860524|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Categories of power===

In the modern geopolitical landscape, a number of terms are used to describe various types of powers, which include the following:
* '''''[[Superpower]]''''': In 1944, [[William T. R. Fox]] defined ''superpower'' as "great power plus great mobility of power" and identified three states, the [[British Empire]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=G.|last2=Newnham|first2=J.|year=1998|title=Dictionary of International Relations|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the decolonisation of the British Empire following World War II, and then the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the United States is currently the only country considered to be a superpower.&lt;ref name="Nossal"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://post.queensu.ca/~nossalk/papers/hyperpower.htm|title=Lonely Superpower or Unapologetic Hyperpower?

* '''''[[Middle power]]''''': A subjective description of influential second-tier states that could not quite be described as great or small powers. A middle power has sufficient strength and authority to stand on its own without the need of help from others (particularly in the realm of [[security]]) and takes diplomatic leads in regional and global affairs.&lt;ref name="Fels2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fels, Enrico|title=Shifting Power in Asia-Pacific?

* '''''[[Small power]]''''': The International System is for the most part made up by ''small powers''. They are instruments of the other powers and may at times be dominated; but they cannot be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Vital, D. (1967) The Inequality of States: A Study of Small Power in International Relations&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other categories====
* '''''[[Regional power]]''''': This term is used to describe a nation that exercises influence and power within a region. Being a ''regional power'' is not mutually exclusive with any of the other categories of power. The majority of them exert a strategic degree of influence as minor or secondary regional powers. A primary regional power (like [[Australia]]) has often an important role in international affairs outside of its region too.&lt;ref&gt;Schenoni, Luis (2017) "Subsystemic Unipolarities?" in Strategic Analysis, 41(1): 74-86 [https://www.academia.edu/30528886/_Subsystemic_Unipolarities_Power_Distribution_and_State_Behaviour_in_South_America_and_Southern_Africa_in_Strategic_Analysis_41_1_74-86]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hard, soft and smart power==
{{Main|Hard power|Soft power|Smart power}}
Some political scientists distinguish between two types of power: Hard and Soft. The former is coercive (example: [[military invasion]]) while the latter is attractive (example: [[broadcast media]] or cultural invasion).

Hard power refers to coercive tactics: the threat or use of [[armed forces]], [[economic]] pressure or [[International sanctions|sanctions]], assassination and subterfuge, or other forms of intimidation. Hard power is generally associated to the stronger of nations, as the ability to change the domestic affairs of other nations through military threats. Realists and [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealists]], such as [[John Mearsheimer]], are advocates of the use of such power for the balancing of the international system.

[[Joseph Nye]] is the leading proponent and theorist of soft power. Instruments of soft power include debates on cultural values, dialogues on ideology, the attempt to influence through good example, and the appeal to commonly accepted human values. Means of exercising soft power include diplomacy, dissemination of information, analysis, propaganda, and cultural programming to achieve political ends.

Others have synthesized soft and hard power, including through the field of [[smart power]]. This is often a call to use a holistic spectrum of statecraft tools, ranging from soft to hard.

==European powers of the modern age==
During the time of the Renaissance, powers in Europe included [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], the [[Habsburg Empire]], [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland–Lithuania]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Bolstered by shipments of gold and silver from the Americas, the Spanish Habsburg dynasty emerged as a dominant force and regularly launched military interventions to project its power and defend Catholicism, while its rival, France, was torn apart by religious civil war. Meanwhile,
in Eastern Europe, the Ottoman Empire reached its zenith and completed its conquest of the [[Balkan peninsula|Balkan]] region.

During the 17th century the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] were added to the group, whilst the Ottomans, Poland and Spain gradually declined in power and influence. France progressively grew stronger and by the latter part of the century found itself repeatedly facing alliances designed to hold its military power in check.

In the 18th century, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] (formed from a union of England and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]) progressively gained strength and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] also saw their importance increase, while Sweden and the Dutch Republic declined. Great Britain and France increasingly struggled for dominance both on the continent and abroad (notably in [[North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[India]]). By the century's end, the British had established themselves as the foremost naval power while the French were dominant on land, conquering many of their neighbors during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and establishing client republics. The struggle between the two nations ended only in 1815 with the final defeat of the French under [[Napoleon]].

During the 19th century, there was an informal convention recognising five Great Powers in Europe: the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], the [[British Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Austrian Empire]] (later [[Austria-Hungary]]) and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]). In the late 19th century the newly united [[Italy]] was added to this group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30020">The [[social norm]] of '''reciprocity''' is the expectation that people will respond to each other in similar ways—responding to gifts and kindnesses from others with similar benevolence of their own, and responding to harmful, hurtful acts from others with either indifference or some form of retaliation. Such norms can be crude and mechanical, such as a literal reading of the [[eye for an eye|eye-for-an-eye]] rule [[lex talionis]], or they can be complex and sophisticated, such as a subtle understanding of how anonymous donations to an international organization can be a form of reciprocity for the receipt of very personal benefits, such as the love of a parent.
 
The [[norm of reciprocity]] varies widely in its details from situation to situation, and from society to society.  Anthropologists and sociologists have often claimed, however, that having some version of the norm appears to be a social inevitability.&lt;ref&gt;Gouldner, Alvin.  “The Norm of Reciprocity.”  ''American Sociological Review'' 25 (1960): 161-78.&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocity figures prominently in [[social exchange theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter M.

==Patterns of reciprocity==
'''One-to-one reciprocity'''.Some reciprocal relationships are direct one-to-one arrangements between individuals, or between institutions, or between governments. Some of these are one-time arrangements, and others are embedded in long-term relationships.  Families often have expectations that children will reciprocate for the care they receive as infants by caring for their elderly parents; businesses may have long-term contractual obligations with each other: governments make treaties with each other.

There are also one-to-one reciprocal relationships that are indirect.  For example, there are sometimes long chains of exchanges, in which A gives a benefit to B, who passes on a similar benefit to C, and so on, in which each party in the chain expects that what goes around will eventually come back around.  The classic anthropological example is the [[Kula ring|Kula exchange]] in the Trobriand Islands.

'''One-to-many and many-to-one reciprocity''' often lies somewhere between direct reciprocal arrangements and generalized reciprocity. Informal clubs in which the hosting arrangements circulate among members are examples of the one-to-many variety.  Bridal showers are examples of the many-to-one variety. So are [[barn raising]] practices in some frontier communities. All of these are similar to direct reciprocity, since the beneficiaries are identified as such in each case, and contributors know exactly what they can expect in return. But because membership in the group changes, and needs for new meetings or marriages or barns are not always predictable, these cases differ significantly from precisely defined one-to-one cases.

'''Generalized reciprocity''' is even less precise.  Here donors operate within a large network of social transactions largely unknown to each other, and without expectations about getting specific benefits in return — other than, perhaps, the sort of social insurance provided by the continuance of the network itself. Recipients may not know the donors, and may not themselves be able to make a return in-kind to that network, but perhaps feel obligated to make a return to a similar network. Blood banks and food banks are examples.  But in fact any stable social structure in which there is a division of labor will involve a system of reciprocal exchanges of this generalized sort, as a way of sustaining [[social norms]].

All of these patterns of reciprocity, along with related ideas such as [[gratitude]], have been central to social and political philosophy from Plato onward.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Lawrence C. ''Reciprocity''.  London and New York: Routledge, 1986. Contains bibliographic essays.&lt;/ref&gt;  These philosophical discussions concern the ways in which patterns and norms of reciprocity might have a role in theories of justice, stable and productive social systems, healthy personal relationships, and ideals for human social life generally.

==The concept of reciprocity==
{{or-section|date=December 2012}}
Philosophical work on reciprocity often pays considerable attention, directly or indirectly, to the proper interpretation of one or more of the following conceptual issues.

'''Reciprocity as distinct from related ideas'''.  In [[Plato]]’s [[Crito]], Socrates considers whether citizens might have a duty of gratitude to obey the laws of the state, in much the way they have duties of gratitude to their parents.  Many other philosophers have considered similar questions. (See the references below to Sidgwick, English, and Jecker for modern examples.) This is certainly a legitimate question. Charging a child or a citizen with ingratitude can imply a failure to meet a requirement.  But confining the discussion to gratitude is limiting. There are similar limitations in discussions of the do-unto-others [[ethic of reciprocity|golden rule]], or ethical principles that are modeled on the mutuality and mutual benevolence that come out of the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] relations envisaged by [[Emmanuel Levinas]] or the [[I-Thou]] relationships described by [[Martin Buber]]. Like gratitude, these other ideas have things in common with the norm of reciprocity, but are quite distinct from it.
  
[[Gratitude]], in its ordinary sense, is as much about having warm and benevolent feelings toward one’s benefactors as it is about having obligations to them. Reciprocity, in its ordinary dictionary sense, is broader than that, and broader than all discussions that begin with a sense of mutuality and mutual benevolence. (See the reference below to Becker, ''Reciprocity'', and the bibliographic essays therein.) Reciprocity pointedly covers arm’s-length dealings between egoistic or mutually disinterested people.
 
Moreover, norms of gratitude do not speak very directly about what feelings and obligations are appropriate toward wrongdoers, or the malicious.  Reciprocity, by contrast, speaks directly to both sides of the equation – requiring responses in kind: positive for positive, negative for negative. In this, it also differs from the golden rule, which is compatible with forgiveness and “turning the other cheek” but has notorious difficulties as a basis for corrective justice, [[punishment]], and dealing with people (e.g., masochists) who have unusual motivational structures.

Finally, the idea of enforcing, or carrying out a duty of gratitude, as well as calibrating the extent one’s gratitude, seems inconsistent with the warm and benevolent feelings of  “being grateful.” There is a similar inconsistency in the idea of enforcing a duty to love. Reciprocity, by contrast, because it does not necessarily involve having special feelings of love or benevolence, fits more comfortably into discussions of duties and obligations. Further, its requirement of an in-kind response invites us to calibrate both the quality and the quantity of the response. 
 
The norm of reciprocity thus requires that we make fitting and proportional responses to both the benefits and harms we receive – whether they come from people who have been benevolent or malicious. Working out the conceptual details of this idea presents interesting questions of its own. The following matters are all considered at length in many of the sources listed below under References, and those authors typically defend particular  proposals about how best to define the conceptual details of reciprocity. What follows here is simply an outline of the topics that are under philosophical scrutiny.

'''Qualitative similarity'''. What counts as making a qualitatively appropriate or “fitting” response in various settings—positive for positive, negative for negative?  If one person invites another to dinner, must the other offer a dinner in return? How soon?  Must it be directly to the original benefactor, or will providing a comparable favor to someone else be appropriate? If the dinner one receives is unintentionally awful, must one reciprocate with something similarly awful? Sometimes an immediate tit-for-tat response seems inappropriate, and at other times it is the only thing that will do.

Are there general principles for assessing the qualitative appropriateness of reciprocal responses?  Reflective people typically practice a highly nuanced version of the norm of reciprocity for social life, in which the qualitative similarity or fittingness of the response appears to be determined by a number of factors.

''The nature of the transaction''. One is the general nature of the transaction or relationship between the parties – the rules and expectations involved in a particular interaction itself.  Tit for tat, defined in a literal way as an exchange of the identical kinds of goods (client list for client list, referral for referral) may be the only sort of reciprocal response that is appropriate in a clearly defined business situation. Similarly, dinner-for-dinner may be the expectation among members of a round robin dinner club.  But when the nature of the transaction is more loosely defined, or is embedded in a complex personal relationship, an appropriate reciprocal response often requires spontaneity, imagination, and even a lack of premeditation about where, what, and how soon.

''Fitting the response to the recipient''. Another aspect of qualitative fit is what counts subjectively, for the recipient, as a response in-kind.   When we respond to people who have benefited us, it seems perverse to give them things they do not regard as benefits.  The general principle here is that, other things equal, a return of good for good received will require giving something that will actually be appreciated as good by the recipient – at least eventually. Similarly for the negative side.  When we respond to bad things, reciprocity presumably requires a return that the recipient regards as a bad thing.

''Unusual circumstances''. A third aspect of qualitative fit is the presence or absence of circumstances that undermine the usual expectations about reciprocity.  If a pair of friends often borrow each other’s household tools, and one of them (suddenly deranged with anger) asks to borrow an antique sword from the other’s collection, what is a fitting response? The example, in a slightly different form, goes back to [[Plato]].  The point is that in this unusual circumstance, reciprocity (as well as other considerations) may require that the recipient not get what he wants at the moment.  Rather, it may be that the recipient should be given what he needs, in some objective sense, whether he ever comes to appreciate that it is good for him.

''General rationale''. A final determinant of qualitative fit is the general rationale for having the norm of reciprocity in the first place. For example, if the ultimate point of practicing reciprocity is to produce stable, productive, fair, and reliable social interactions, then there may be some tensions between things that accomplish this general goal and things that satisfy only the other three determinants.  Responding to others’ harmful conduct raises this issue.  As [[Plato]] observed ([[Republic]], Book I), is not rational to harm our enemies in the sense of making them worse, as enemies or as people, than they already are.  We may reply to Plato by insisting that reciprocity merely requires us to make them worse-off, not worse, period. But if it turns out that the version of the reciprocity norm we are using actually has the consequence of doing both, or at any rate not improving the situation, then we will have undermined the point of having it.

''Quantitative similarity''.  Another definitional issue concerns proportionality.   What counts as too little, or too much in return for what we receive from others?  In some cases, such as borrowing a sum of money from a friend who has roughly the same resources, a prompt and exact return of the same amount seems right.  Less will be too little, and a return with interest will often be too much, between friends.  But in other cases, especially in exchanges between people who are very unequal in resources, a literal reading of tit-for-tat may be a perverse rule – one that undermines the social and personal benefits of the norm of reciprocity itself.  How, for example, may badly disadvantaged people reciprocate for the public or private assistance they receive?   Requiring a prompt and exact return of the benefit received may defeat the general purpose of the norm of reciprocity by driving disadvantaged people further into debt.  Yet to waive the debt altogether, or to require only some discounted amount seems to defeat the purpose also.

Anglo-American legal theory and practice has examples of two options for dealing with this problem.  One is to require a return that is equal to the benefit received, but to limit the use of that requirement in special cases.  Bankruptcy rules are in part designed to prevent downward, irrecoverable spirals of debt while still exacting a considerable penalty. Similarly, there are rules for rescinding unconscionable contracts, preventing unjust enrichment, and dealing with cases in which contractual obligations have become impossible to perform. These rules typically have considerable transaction costs.

Another kind of option is to define a reciprocal return with explicit reference to ability to pay. Progressive tax rates are an example of this. Considered in terms of reciprocity, this option seems based on an equal sacrifice interpretation of proportionality, rather than an equal benefit one.  Under an equal sacrifice rule, making a quantitatively similar return will mean giving something back whose marginal value to oneself, given one’s resources, equals the marginal value of the sacrifice made by the original giver, given her resources.

==Reciprocity and justice==
Standard usage of the term justice shows its close general connection to the concept of reciprocity. Justice includes the idea of fairness, and that in turn includes treating similar cases similarly, giving people what they deserve, and apportioning all other benefits and burdens in an equitable way. Those things, further, involve acting in a principled, impartial way that forbids playing favorites and may require sacrifices.  All of those things are certainly in the neighborhood of the elements of reciprocity (e.g., fittingness, proportionality), but it is challenging to explain the precise connections.

===Reward and punishment===
Discussions of merit, desert, blame, and [[punishment]] inevitably involve questions about the fittingness and proportionality of our responses to others, and retributive theories of punishment put the norm of reciprocity at their center. The idea is to make the punishment fit the crime.  This differs from utilitarian theories of punishment, which may use fittingness and proportionality as constraints, but whose ultimate commitment is to make punishment serve social goals such as general deterrence, public safety, and the rehabilitation of wrongdoers.

===Justice and war===
In [[Just war|just war theory]], notions of fittingness and proportionality are central, at least as constraints both on the justification of a given war, and the methods used to prosecute it. When war represents a disproportionate response to a threat or an injury, it raises questions of justice related to reciprocity.  When war fighting employs weapons that do not discriminate between combatants and noncombatants, it raises questions of justice related to reciprocity. A profound sense of injustice related to a lack of reciprocity – for example, between those privileged by socioeconomic status, political power, or wealth, and those who are less privileged, and oppressed – sometimes leads to war in the form of revolutionary or counterrevolutionary violence. It has been argued that the use of autonomous or remote controlled weaponized drones violate reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2013/07/18/just-war-theory-and-the-ethics-of-drone-warfare/|title=Just War Theory and the Ethics of Drone Warfare|work=E-International Relations|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Drone warfare and morality in riskless war|journal=Global Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=285–291|doi=10.1080/23340460.2015.1080042|year = 2015|last1 = Henriksen|first1 = Anders|last2=Ringsmose|first2=Jens}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political solutions which end the violence without dealing with the underlying injustice run the risk of continued social instability.

===Legitimation of social, political, and legal obligations===
A very deep and persistent line of philosophical discussion explores the way in which reciprocity can resolve conflicts between justice and self-interest, and can justify the imposition (or limitation) of social, political, and legal obligations that require individuals to sacrifice their own interests.

This aspect of the philosophical discussion of reciprocity attempts to bring together two ways of approaching a very basic question: What is the fundamental justification for the existence of social and political institutions – institutions that impose and enforce duties and obligations upon their members?

'''Individual well-being'''. One obvious answer is that people need to stay out of each other’s way enough so that each can pursue his or her individual interests as far as possible, without interference from others.  This immediately justifies rules that are mutually advantageous, but it raises questions about requiring obedience from people whenever it turns out that they will be disadvantaged by following the rules, or can get away with disobeying them.  So the problem becomes one of showing whether, and when, it might actually be mutually advantageous to follow the rules of justice even when it is inconvenient or costly to do so.

[[Social contract]] theorists often invoke the value of reciprocal relationships to deal with this. Many human beings need help from one another from time to time in order to pursue their individual interests effectively.  So if we can arrange a system of reciprocity in which all the benefits we are required to contribute are typically returned to us in full (or more), that may justify playing by the rules—even in cases where it looks as though we can get away with not doing so.

'''Social well-being'''. Another obvious answer to the question of why people organize themselves into groups, however, is in order to achieve levels of cooperation needed for improving society generally – for example by improving public health, and society-wide levels of education, wealth, or individual welfare.  This also gives a reason for rules of justice, but again raises problems about requiring individuals to sacrifice their own welfare for the good of others—especially when some individuals might not share the particular goals for social improvements at issue.

Here too, the value of reciprocal relationships can be invoked, this time to limit the legitimacy of the sacrifices a society might require. For one thing, it seems perverse to require sacrifices in pursuit of some social goal if it turns out those sacrifices are unnecessary, or in vain because the goal cannot be achieved.

To some philosophers, a theory of justice based on reciprocity (or fairness, or fair play) is an attractive middle ground between a thoroughgoing concern with individual well-being and a thoroughgoing concern with social well-being. This has been part of the attraction of the most influential line of thought on distributive justice in recent Anglo-American philosophy – the one carried on in the context of [[John Rawls]]’ work.

'''Future generations'''.  It may also be that there is something to be gained, philosophically, from considering what obligations of generalized reciprocity present generations of human beings may have to future ones.  [[John Rawls|Rawls]] considers (briefly) the problem of defining a “just savings principle” for future generations, and treats it as a consequence of the interests people typically have in the welfare of their descendents, and the agreements fully reciprocal members of society would come to among themselves about such matters.  Others (e.g., [[Lawrence C. Becker|Lawrence Becker]]) have explored the intuitive idea that acting on behalf of future generations may be required as a generalized form of reciprocity for benefits received from previous generations.

==Mutuality==
What is the relation between reciprocity and [[love]], [[friendship]] or [[family]] relationships? If such relationships are ideally ones in which the parties are connected by mutual affection and benevolence, shouldn’t justice and reciprocity stay out of their way? Isn’t impartiality inconsistent with love? Doesn’t acting on principle take the affection out of friendship or family relationships?  Doesn’t following the norm of reciprocity eliminate unconditional love or loyalty?

Some contemporary philosophers have criticized major figures in the history of Western philosophy, including [[John Rawls]]’ early work, for making familial relationships more or less opaque in theories of justice. (See the reference below to [[Susan Moller Okin|Okin]].) The argument is that families can be grossly unjust, and have often been so.  Since the family is “the school of justice,” if it is unjust the moral education of children is distorted, and the injustice tends to spread to the society at large, and to be perpetuated in following generations. If that is right, then justice and reciprocity must define the boundaries within which we pursue even the most intimate relationships.
  
A somewhat different thread on these matters begins with [[Aristotle]]’s discussion of friendship, in ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1155-1172a.  He proposes that the highest or best form of friendship involves a relationship between equals – one in which a genuinely reciprocal relationship is possible. This thread appears throughout the history of Western ethics in discussions of personal and social relationships of many sorts: between children and parents, spouses, humans and other animals, and humans and god(s). The question is the extent to which the kind of reciprocity possible in various relationships determines the kind of mutual affection and benevolence possible in those relationships.

This said, reciprocation in personal relationships rarely follows a mathematical formula and the level of reciprocation, i.e. the give and take, will vary depending on the personalities involved, and situational factors such as which party has more control, persuasive power or influence. It is often the case that one party will typically be the lead reciprocator with the other being the responsive reciprocator.  The form of reciprocation can also be influenced by the level of emotional need. Sometimes one party will need more support than the other and this can switch at different times depending on the life situation of each party.  Because reciprocation is influenced by personal circumstances and since people do not follow a set pattern like robots, reciprocation from a friend to a friend for example will vary in intensity and an absolutely consistent pattern cannot be expected.  If for example a person has a large inner circle of friendships with reciprocation as the key element of friendship, then the level of reciprocation within the inner circle will influence the depth of a friendship therein.  Reciprocation can be responsive or initiative.  It is also a fundamental principle in parenting, a successful work place, religion and karma.

So for example, in the friendship context, reciprocation means to give or take mutually but not necessarily equally. Overall reciprocal balance is more important than strict equality at every moment. Friendship based on reciprocity means caring for each other, being responsive and supportive and in tune with each other. But without some form of overall reciprocal balance, the relationship may become transformed into a nonreciprocal form of friendship, or the friendship may fail altogether.

To provide an everyday life example, should one's (person A) dog die, a good friend (person B) would offer support and a "shoulder to cry on" for person A struggling to deal with the death of their dog. After time, person B might suggest a new dog, to help person A move on from their loss. Reciprocation occurs from person A to person B, if person B obtains assistance from person A at a future time.

'''Repechage''' ({{IPAc-en|ɹ|ə|p|ɛ|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|ʒ}}; {{lang-fr|repêchage}}, "fishing out, rescuing") is a practice in series competitions that allows participants who failed to meet qualifying standards by a small margin to continue to the next round, in a similar way as a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card system]] works out.

{{wiktionary|repechage}}

== Types ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Different types of repechage can occur.  As a basis for the examples below, assume that 64 competitors are divided into four pools of 16 competitors, labeled A, B, C, and D.  The first three rounds of the primary championship bracket winnow the field down to eight competitors for the quarter-final.

=== Full repechage ===
In full repechage, a competitor who loses to the pool winner drops into the repechage bracket. The theory is that a worthy competitor who is paired with another worthy competitor should not be unduly penalized by luck of the draw, but have an opportunity to fight for at least third place.  In our example, four competitors from each pool (the loser to the pool winner in the first, second, third and quarter-final rounds) drop into the repechage bracket.  A larger pool results in a longer wait for first-round losers to determine if they will compete in repechage.

=== Quarter-final repechage ===
Quarter-final repechage pulls losers from the quarter-final round only.  The prior rounds are single-elimination.  Losers in the quarter-final from two pools (e.g., A and B) are entered into one bracket of the repechage first round. Quarter-final losers from the other two pools are entered into the other bracket. Repechage losers are placed in seventh place. Winners of these matches play against semifinal losers of opposite bracket. Losers are placed in fifth place and winners are awarded with bronze medal each.

=== Double-elimination repechage ===
In [[double-elimination tournament|double-elimination]] repechage, any loser in the championship bracket drops into the repechage bracket.  Typically the losers from the championship bracket's first round compete against each other in the repechage first round for the right to compete in the repechage second round (against the championship bracket second round losers).  In ''full'' double-elimination repechage, the eventual repechage bracket winner competes against the championship bracket winner to determine the winner of the overall competition, but the repechage bracket winner must win two matches to win the competition whereas the championship bracket winner needs only win one match.  In a ''partial'' double-elimination repechage bracket, the bracket winner(or winners in dual third-place scenario) will take third place.

=== Repechage bracket with two third place finishers ===
Dual third-place finishers can result with full, quarter-final, or double-elimination repechage.  Losers from two championship bracket pools (e.g., A and B) are placed into one repechage bracket and losers from the other two pools are placed in the other repechage bracket.  The winner from each pool's repechage bracket competes against the loser in the championship semi-final who comes from one of that repechage bracket's two pools.  Or, in a "cross-over" arrangement, the semi-final loser comes from the other bracket's pools.  Each winner of this repechage round takes third place.  The losers of the prior two repechage rounds are often considered to take fifth and seventh places.

=== Consolation bracket ===
A consolation bracket is when losers drop from the primary championship bracket and compete for [[Third place playoff|third place]] or a lesser [[consolation prize]].  Hence, except in the case of full double-elimination repechage, a repechage bracket might be referred to as a consolation bracket.

== Usage ==

=== Baseball and softball ===
In [[Major League Baseball]] a repechage bracket is formed by [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] teams in each League. Entry to the [[Major League Baseball postseason|Postseason]] is determined by the [[Wild Card Game]].

At many levels of amateur play in [[baseball]] and [[softball]], including the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], tournaments are established as a full double-elimination repechage.

In the current 64-team baseball and softball NCAA tournament formats, there are alternating four-team double-elimination repechage formats, and best two-of-three games series.  The first and third rounds are full double-elimination repechages, while the second and fourth rounds are best two-of-three game series.

The [[Southeastern Conference]] baseball tournament has a flip-bracket format; the winner of the first championship bracket plays the winner of the second repechage bracket, and the winner of the second championship bracket plays the winner of the first repechage bracket.  As usual, the repechage bracket winner must win two matches to advance to the championship game.

=== Beach volleyball ===
Some competitions use a modified double elimination format called Olympic Crossing, in which the winning teams compete until two teams remain, while teams with one loss continue in an elimination format until two of them remain. Then, in the semifinals, each of the two remaining winning teams play a team from the losers bracket, and the winners of these matches compete in the final match, while the semifinal losers compete for third place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-04-07/community/0004060624_1_double-elimination-format-championship-bracket-double-fault  Glossary Of Beach Volleyball Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cycling ===
In [[cycling]], repechage heats are used in the [[Keirin]] and [[match sprints]]. These heats give a second chance for non-qualifiers in the preliminary heat(s) to advance to the next round of competition.

=== Fencing ===
Although not normally used for [http://britishfencing.com/uploads/files/fie_rules_-_organisation_rules_-_dec_2014.pdf FIE events], sometime local events use direct elimination with repechage.  A disadvantage is that some competitors have to wait.  An advantage for team events is more willingness to use DE from the start (with seeding by drawing lots) instead of pools.  Example format sheets are [http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Fencing/Membership/Divisions/Division-Officer-Resources/Score-and-Pool-Sheets here].

Repechage was formerly widely used in [[fencing]] tournaments, but the majority have now abandoned it, an exception being [[United States Fencing Association]] Division I tournaments.

=== Martial arts ===
In [[karate]], [[judo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sports and Organization Rules of the International Judo Federation |url=http://www.intjudo.eu/pictures/news/570_1_1.pdf |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]] |accessdate= 4 December 2010 |edition=2010 |year=2010 |publisher=[[International Judo Federation]] |location=Lausanne, Switzerland |page=7 |chapter=System of Competition |quote=7.1 An elimination system with repechage starting at the quarter-final (last 8), i.e. for all categories the competitors will be divided into two tables by a "draw", and an elimination system will be used to produce two finalists, who will compete for the gold medal.

The winners (2) of those contests are placed third; The losers (2) are placed fifth; The losers (2) of repechage contests are placed seventh.}}  Example brackets are depicted at pp. 58–66.&lt;/ref&gt; [[taekwondo]], and [[wrestling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 2010 | title = International Wrestling Rules | publisher = [[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles]] | location = Corsier-sur-Vevey, Suisse | page = 10 | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/regles/2009_wrestling_rules.pdf | accessdate = 5 March 2012 | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]]| quote = Pairing is made in the order of the numbers drawn at random. All wrestlers who lost against both finalists will have repechage matches.

The repechage matches begin with wrestlers who lost in the first round including in matches to obtain the ideal number against one of the two finalists up to the losers in the semi-finals by direct elimination. The winners of the two repechage groups will receive each the bronze medal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; tournaments, single-elimination brackets are used to determine the two athletes who will compete in the final for first and second place. The repechage bracket is built from athletes who were knocked out by the finalists and building brackets to determine third place.

Repechage addresses the possibility of two top competitors meeting in an early round, allowing the loser a chance to compete for a bronze medal.

===Quiz===

In ''[[University Challenge]]'', 28 teams compete in each season. Of the fourteen teams who lose in the first round, the four teams with the highest scores compete in the Highest Scoring Losers Play-Offs, with the two winners advancing to the second round.

===Rowing  ===
In [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], often only the first one or two boats in a race will qualify automatically for the next round, and the other boats race again in one or more repechage to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Competition Rowing | publisher = [[International Rowing Federation]] | url = http://www.worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=168 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101204080143/http://worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=168 | archivedate = 4 December 2010 | quote = Repechages – in cases of up to 24 entries in one boat class and in cases of 37 to 54 entries, every crew who has not qualified for the next round of racing in the heats has a second chance to advance through the repechages round.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conditions such as wind vary between the heats, often significantly affecting a competitor's time, and the repechage system allows the "fastest losers" to qualify irrespective of the variable conditions in the opening heats.

===Rugby ===
In [[rugby football|rugby]], the qualification processes for the [[Rugby Union World Cup]] and the [[Rugby League World Cup]] use a repechage system. The [[Air New Zealand Cup]], [[New Zealand]]'s domestic professional competition in Union, used the repechage in the [[2006 Air New Zealand Cup]], but scrapped it for the [[2007 Air New Zealand Cup]].

=== Sailing ===
A repechage stage in [[sailing]] is sometimes used in match-racing competition to allow teams finishing the round robin(s) just below the top-level teams a chance to advance to the quarter-final stage. This is standard competition for the Olympic-class events, such as the [[ISAF Sailing World Cup]].

=== Track and field athletics ===
In [[track and field|field athletics]], automatic qualification for the next round depends on meeting or surpassing a specified minimum result.  The remaining qualification spots (if any) are given in order to the best results.

In [[track and field|track athletics]], automatic qualification for the next round is given to the best competitors in each heat.  Other competitors with the best times may qualify for the next round indirectly as "fastest losers" as a result of the repechage.  If a particular heat was significantly faster than the others, repechage spots can be all taken by athletes from that heat.

== Alternatives ==
Alternatives to repechage include [[Single-elimination tournament|single elimination]], [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]], [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] and the [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system]].

In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, a '''retraction''' is a [[continuous mapping]] from a [[topological space]] into a subspace which preserves the position of all points in that subspace.&lt;ref&gt;Borsuk (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; A '''deformation retraction''' is a mapping which captures the idea of ''continuously shrinking'' a space into a subspace.

An '''absolute neighborhood retract''' ('''ANR''') is a particularly [[well-behaved]] type of topological space. For example, every [[topological manifold]] is an ANR. Every ANR has the [[homotopy type]] of a very simple topological space, a [[CW complex]].

== Definitions ==

=== Retract ===
Let ''X'' be a topological space and ''A'' a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''X''. Then a continuous map
:&lt;math&gt;r\colon X \to A&lt;/math&gt;

is a '''retraction''' if the [[function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restriction]] of ''r'' to ''A'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''A''; that is, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r(a) = a&lt;/math&gt; for all ''a'' in ''A''. Equivalently, denoting by

:&lt;math&gt;\iota\colon A \hookrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;
the [[Inclusion map|inclusion]], a retraction is a continuous map ''r'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;r \circ \iota = \operatorname{id}_A,&lt;/math&gt;
that is, the composition of ''r'' with the inclusion is the identity of ''A''. Note that, by definition, a retraction maps ''X'' [[onto]] ''A''. A subspace ''A'' is called a '''retract''' of ''X'' if such a retraction exists. For instance, any non-empty space retracts to a point in the obvious way (the constant map yields a retraction). If ''X'' is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then ''A'' must be a [[closed subset]] of ''X''.

If &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r: X \to A&lt;/math&gt; is a retraction, then the composition ι∘''r'' is an [[idempotent]] continuous map from ''X'' to ''X''. Conversely, given any idempotent continuous map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;s: X \to X,&lt;/math&gt; we obtain a retraction onto the image of ''s'' by restricting the [[codomain]].

=== Deformation retract and strong deformation retract===
A continuous map
:&lt;math&gt;F\colon X \times [0, 1] \to X &lt;/math&gt;
is a ''deformation retraction'' of a space ''X'' onto a subspace ''A'' if, for every ''x'' in ''X'' and ''a'' in ''A'',
:&lt;math&gt; F(x,0) = x, \; F(x,1) \in A ,\quad \mbox{and} \quad F(a,1) = a.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, a deformation retraction is a [[homotopy]] between a retraction and the identity map on ''X''. The subspace ''A'' is called a '''deformation retract''' of ''X''. A deformation retraction is a special case of a [[homotopy equivalence]].

A retract need not be a deformation retract. For instance, having a single point as a deformation retract of a space ''X'' would imply that ''X'' is [[path connected]] (and in fact that ''X'' is [[contractible space|contractible]]).

''Note:'' An equivalent definition of deformation retraction is the following. A continuous map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r: X \to A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Deformation theory|deformation]] retraction if it is a retraction and its composition with the inclusion is homotopic to the identity map on ''X''. In this formulation, a deformation retraction carries with it a homotopy between the identity map on ''X'' and itself.

If, in the definition of a deformation retraction, we add the requirement that
:&lt;math&gt;F(a,t) = a&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''t'' in [0, 1] and ''a'' in ''A'', then ''F'' is called a '''strong deformation retraction'''. In other words, a strong deformation retraction leaves points in ''A'' fixed throughout the homotopy. (Some authors, such as [[Allen Hatcher|Hatcher]], take this as the definition of deformation retraction.)

As an example, the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;S^{n}&lt;/math&gt;'' is a strong deformation retract of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\reals^{n+1} \backslash \{0\};&lt;/math&gt; as strong deformation retraction one can choose the map 

:&lt;math&gt;F(x,t)=\left((1-t)+{t\over \|x\|}\right) x.&lt;/math&gt;

===Cofibration and neighborhood deformation retract===
A map ''f'': ''A'' → ''X'' of topological spaces is a ([[Witold Hurewicz|Hurewicz]]) '''[[cofibration]]''' if it has the [[homotopy extension property]] for maps to any space. This is one of the central concepts of [[homotopy theory]]. A cofibration ''f'' is always injective, in fact a [[homeomorphism]] to its image.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher (2002), Proposition 4H.1.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''X'' is Hausdorff (or a [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[weak Hausdorff space]]), then the image of a cofibration ''f'' is closed in ''X''.

Among all closed inclusions, cofibrations can be characterized as follows. The inclusion of a closed subspace ''A'' in a space ''X'' is a cofibration if and only if ''A'' is a '''neighborhood deformation retract''' of ''X'', meaning that there is a continuous map &lt;math&gt;u: X \rightarrow I&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I = [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A = u^{-1}\!\left(0\right)&lt;/math&gt; and a homotopy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H: X \times I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;such that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H\left(x,0\right) = x \quad \forall x \in X,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;H\left(a,t\right) = a \quad \forall (a,t) \in A \times I,&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h\left(x,1\right) \in A \; \text{if} \; u(x) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Puppe (1967), Satz 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the inclusion of a subcomplex in a CW complex is a cofibration.

==Properties==
* One basic property of a retract ''A'' of ''X'' (with retraction &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r: X \to A&lt;/math&gt;) is that every continuous map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f: A \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; has at least one extension &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g: X \rightarrow Y,&lt;/math&gt; namely &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g = f \circ r&lt;/math&gt;.
* Deformation retraction is a particular case of homotopy equivalence. In fact, two spaces are homotopy equivalent [[if and only if]] they are both deformation retracts of a single larger space.
* Any topological space which deformation retracts to a point is contractible and vice versa. However, there exist contractible spaces which do not strongly deformation retract to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher (2002), Exercise 0.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==No-retraction theorem==
The [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the [[N-ball|''n''-dimensional ball]], that is, the (''n''−1)-sphere, is not a retract of the ball. (See {{Section link|Brouwer fixed-point theorem|A proof using homology}}.)

==Absolute neighborhood retract (ANR)==
A closed subset &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''neighborhood retract''' of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a retract of some open subset of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a class of topological spaces, closed under homeomorphisms and passage to closed subsets. Following [[Karol Borsuk|Borsuk]] (starting in 1931), a space ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is called an '''absolute retract''' for the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{AR} \left(\mathcal{C}\right),&lt;/math&gt; if ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and whenever ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is a closed subset of a space  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a retract of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. A space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an '''absolute neighborhood retract''' for the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{ANR} \left(\mathcal{C}\right),&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and whenever &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset of a space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a neighborhood retract of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

Various classes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; such as [[normal space]]s have been considered in this definition, but the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; of [[metrizable space]]s has been found to give the most satisfactory theory. For that reason, the notations AR and ANR by themselves are used in this article to mean &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {AR} \left({\mathcal {M}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {ANR} \left({\mathcal {M}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mardešiċ (1999), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

A metrizable space is an AR if and only if it is contractible and an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Proposition II.7.2.&lt;/ref&gt; By [[James Dugundji|Dugundji]], every locally convex metrizable [[topological vector space]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an AR; more generally, every nonempty [[convex set|convex subset]] of such a vector space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an AR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Corollary II.14.2 and Theorem II.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, any [[normed vector space]] ([[complete metric space|complete]] or not) is an AR. More concretely, Euclidean space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\reals^{n},&lt;/math&gt; the [[unit cube]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I^{n},&lt;/math&gt;and the [[Hilbert cube]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; are ARs.

ANRs form a remarkable class of "[[Well behaved|well-behaved]]" topological spaces. Among their properties are:
*Every open subset of an ANR is an ANR. 
*By [[Olof Hanner|Hanner]], a metrizable space that has an [[open cover]] by ANRs is an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Theorem III.8.1.&lt;/ref&gt; (That is, being an ANR is a '''[[local property]]''' for metrizable spaces.) It follows that every topological manifold is an ANR. For example, the sphere ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;S^{n}&lt;/math&gt;'' is an ANR but not an AR (because it is not contractible). In infinite dimensions, Hanner's theorem implies that every Hilbert cube manifold as well as the (rather different, for example not [[locally compact space|locally compact]]) [[Hilbert manifold]]s and [[Banach manifold]]s are ANRs.
*Every locally finite [[CW complex]] is an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Mardešiċ (1999), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; An arbitrary CW complex need not be metrizable, but every CW complex has the homotopy type of an ANR (which is metrizable, by definition).&lt;ref&gt;Fritsch &amp; Piccinini (1990), Theorem 5.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every ANR ''X'' is '''[[locally contractible]]''' in the sense that for every open neighborhood &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there is an open neighborhood &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that the inclusion &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V \hookrightarrow U&lt;/math&gt; is homotopic to a [[constant map]]. A [[covering dimension|finite-dimensional]] metrizable space is an ANR if and only if it is locally contractible in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Theorem V.7.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Cantor set]] is a [[compact space|compact]] subset of the real line that is not an ANR, since it is not even [[locally connected]].
*Counterexamples: Borsuk found a compact subset of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\reals^{3}&lt;/math&gt; that is an ANR but not strictly locally contractible.&lt;ref&gt;Borsuk (1967), section IV.4.&lt;/ref&gt; (A space is '''strictly locally contractible''' if every open neighborhood &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of each point &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contains a contractible open neighborhood of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.) Borsuk also found a compact subset of the Hilbert cube that is locally contractible (as defined above) but not an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Borsuk (1967), Theorem V.11.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every ANR has the homotopy type of a CW complex, by [[J. H. C. Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[John Milnor|Milnor]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritsch &amp; Piccinini (1990), Theorem 5.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a locally compact ANR has the homotopy type of a locally finite CW complex; and, by West, a compact ANR has the homotopy type of a finite CW complex.&lt;ref&gt;West (2004), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, ANRs avoid all the homotopy-theoretic pathologies of arbitrary topological spaces. For example, the [[Whitehead theorem]] holds for ANRs: a map of ANRs that induces an isomorphism on [[homotopy group]]s (for all choices of base point) is a homotopy equivalence. Since ANRs include topological manifolds, Hilbert cube manifolds, Banach manifolds, and so on, these results apply to a large class of spaces.
*Many mapping spaces are ANRs. In particular, let ''Y'' be an ANR with a closed subspace ''A'' that is an ANR, and let ''X'' be any compact metrizable space with a closed subspace ''B''. Then the space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(Y, A\right)^{\left(X, B\right)}&lt;/math&gt; of maps of [[topological pair|pairs]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(X, B\right) \rightarrow \left(Y, A\right)&lt;/math&gt; (with the [[compact-open topology]] on the [[Function space|mapping space]]) is an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Theorem VII.3.1 and Remark VII.2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; It follows, for example, that the [[loop space]] of any CW complex has the homotopy type of a CW complex.
*By Cauty, a metrizable space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an ANR if and only if every open subset of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has the homotopy type of a CW complex.&lt;ref&gt;Cauty (1994), Fund. Math. 144: 11–22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*By Cauty, there is a [[topological vector space#Topological structure|metric linear space]] ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;'' (meaning a topological vector space with a [[Translation invariant|translation-invariant]] metric) that is not an AR. One can take &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to be [[separable space|separable]] and an [[F-space]] (that is, a complete metric linear space).&lt;ref&gt;Cauty (1994), Fund. Math. 146: 85–99.&lt;/ref&gt; (By Dugundji's theorem above, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; cannot be locally convex.) Since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is contractible and not an AR, it is also not an ANR. By Cauty's theorem above, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; has an open subset &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that is not homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. Thus there is a metrizable space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that is strictly locally contractible but is not homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. It is not known whether a compact (or locally compact) metrizable space that is strictly locally contractible must be an ANR.

In [[political philosophy]], the '''right of revolution''' (or '''right of rebellion''') is the [[right]] or [[duty]] of the people of a nation to [[Revolution|overthrow]] a government that acts against their common interests and/or threatens the safety of the people without cause. Stated throughout history in one form or another, the belief in this right has been used to justify various revolutions, including the  [[French Revolution]], the [[Russian Revolution]], and the [[Iranian Revolution]].

==History==

===Early precedent===
To justify their overthrowing of the earlier [[Shang Dynasty]], the kings of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1122 – 256 BC) of [[China]] promulgated the concept known as the [[Mandate of Heaven]], that [[Tian|Heaven]] would bless the authority of a just ruler, but would be displeased and withdraw its mandate from a despotic ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Elizabeth. [2002] (2002). Challenging the Mandate of Heaven: Social Protest and State Power in China.  Sharpe.  {{ISBN|0-7656-0444-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandate of Heaven would then transfer to those who would rule best. Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that the Mandate of Heaven had passed on. Throughout Chinese history, rebels who opposed the ruling dynasty made the claim that the Mandate of Heaven had passed, giving them the right to revolt. Ruling dynasties were often uncomfortable with this, and the writings of the Confucian philosopher [[Mencius]] (372 – 289 BC) were often suppressed for declaring that the people have the right to overthrow a ruler that did not provide for their needs.

====Europe====
{{main|Resistance theory in the Early Modern period}}
[[File:Magna_Carta_(British_Library_Cotton_MS_Augustus_II.106).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Magna Carta]] marks one of the earliest attempts to limit a sovereign's authority and it is seen as a symbol of the rule of law.]]
In Europe, one example of the emergence of a right of revolution can be traced back to [[Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker]], who in 1018 had a dramatic confrontation with the King of Sweden. The lawspeaker claimed the King of Sweden was accountable to the people and would be overthrown by them if he continued with his unpopular war with Norway. Another example is [[Magna Carta]], an English charter issued in 1215, that required the King to renounce certain rights and accept that his will could be bound by the law. It included a "security clause" that gave the right to a committee of barons to overrule the will of the King through force if needed. Magna Carta directly influenced the development of parliamentary democracy and many constitutional documents, such as the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph V. Turner. ''Magna Carta''.  Pearson Education. (2003). {{ISBN|0-582-43826-8}} p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Golden Bull of 1222]] was a [[golden bull]], or [[edict]], issued by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]. The law established the rights of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary's]] noblemen, including the right to disobey the King when he acted contrary to law (''jus resistendi''). The Golden Bull is often compared to the Magna Carta; the Bull was the first constitutional document of the nation of Hungary, while the Magna Carta was the first constitutional charter of the nation of England.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] also wrote of the right to resist tyrannical rule in the [[Summa Theologica]]. [[John of Salisbury]] advocated direct revolutionary assassination of unethical tyrannical rulers in his ''Policraticus''. This theological notion was expanded in the [[Early Modern Period]]. The [[Jesuits]], especially [[Robert Bellarmine]] and [[Juan de Mariana]], were widely known and often feared for advocating resistance to tyranny and often tyrannicide&amp;mdash;one of the implications of the [[natural law]] focus of the [[School of Salamanca]].

[[John Calvin]] believed something similar. In a commentary on the [[Book of Daniel]], he observed that contemporary monarchs pretend to reign “by the grace of God,” but the pretense was “a mere cheat” so that they could “reign without control.” He believed that “Earthly princes depose themselves while they rise up against God,” so “it behooves us to spit upon their heads than to obey them.” When ordinary citizens are confronted with tyranny, he wrote, ordinary citizens have to suffer it. But magistrates have the duty to “curb the tyranny of kings,” as had the Tribunes in ancient [[Rome]], the Ephori in [[Sparta]], and the Demarchs in ancient [[Athens]]. That Calvin could support a right of resistance in theory did not mean that he thought such resistance prudent in all circumstances. At least publicly, he disagreed with the Scottish Calvinist [[John Knox]]’s call for revolution against the Catholic Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davekopel.com/religion/calvinism.htm Dave Kopel: The Calvinist Connection, Liberty magazine, October 2008, pp. 27-31]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church shared Calvin's prudential concerns -  the Pope condemned [[Guy Fawkes]]' [[Gunpowder Plot]], and ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'' was widely considered to be a mistake. Instead, the safest course of action for the people was to endure tyranny for as long as it could be borne, rather than run the larger risks of armed revolution.

The right of revolution was expounded by the [[Monarchomachs]] in the context of the [[French Wars of Religion]], and by [[Huguenot]]s thinkers who legitimized [[tyrannicide]]s.

===Modern development===
[[File:LockeTreatiseAmerica.png|200px|thumb|right|''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', written by [[John Locke]], developed the idea of 'right of revolution'. This notion was used as a basis for the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.]]
The concept of the right of revolution was developed at the beginning of the [[Enlightenment era]] in the work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Written by the philosopher [[John Locke]], the right to revolution formed an integral part of his [[social contract|social contract theory]], in which he tried to define the origins and basis for social conditions and relationships. Locke declared that under [[natural law]], all [[people]] have the right to [[life]], [[liberty]], and [[estate (law)|estate]]; under the social contract, the people could instigate a [[revolution]] against the government when it acted against the interests of [[citizenship|citizens]], to replace the government with one that served the interests of citizens. In some cases, Locke deemed revolution an obligation. The right of revolution thus essentially acted as a safeguard against [[tyrant|tyranny]].

Locke affirmed an explicit right to revolution in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'': “''whenever the Legislators endeavor to take away, and destroy the Property of the People'', or to reduce them to Slavery under Arbitrary Power, they put themselves into a state of War with the People, who are thereupon absolved from any farther Obedience, and are left to the common Refuge, which God hath provided for all Men, against Force and Violence. Whensoever therefore the ''Legislative'' shall transgress this fundamental Rule of Society; and either by Ambition, Fear, Folly or Corruption, ''endeavor to grasp'' themselves, ''or put into the hands of any other an Absolute Power'' over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People; By this breach of Trust ''they forfeit the Power'', the People had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the People, who have a Right to resume their original Liberty.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property#axzz2qx7Z9g7e Powell, Jim (01. August 1996): John Locke: Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property. In: The Freemann. Publisher: The Foundation for Economic Education, Irvington, New York, USA.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use in history====
Revolutionary movements subsequent to this, all drew on Locke's theory as a justification for the exercise of the right of revolution.

During the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the [[Parliament of England]] effectively deposed [[James II of England]] and replaced him with [[William III of England|William III of Orange-Nassau]], due to the former's unacceptable leanings towards [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and [[Catholicism]]. Although Locke's treatise was published the year after, his ideas were already widely current in the English political system at the time.

[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|left|300px|thumb|The [[storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 has come to symbolize the [[French Revolution]], when a people rose up to exercise their right of revolution.]]
Although Locke claimed that his book's purpose was to justify [[William III of England|William III]]'s ascension to the throne, it has been argued that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679–1680 during the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion Crisis]], which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], Locke's mentor, patron and friend, introduced the bill, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, Peter. "Introduction." ''Two Treatises of Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the work is better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the [[Rye House Plot]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, ''Revolutionary Politics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to revolution played a large part in the writings of the [[American Revolution|American revolutionaries]] in the run up to the [[American Revolution]]. The political tract ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' used the concept as an argument for rejection of the British Monarchy and separation from the [[British Empire]], as opposed to merely self-government within it. It was also cited in the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] of the [[United States]], when a group of representatives from the various states signed a declaration of independence citing charges against King [[George III]]. As the American [[Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 expressed it, natural law taught that the people were “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” and could alter or abolish government “destructive” of those rights.

The right of revolution was also included in the 1793 preface to the [[French Constitution of 1793]] during the [[French Revolution]]. This preface from 24 June 1793 contained a declaration of the rights of man and citizen including right to rebellion in §35: "When the government violates the rights of the people, insurrection is for the people, and for every portion thereof, the most sacred of rights and the most indispensable of duties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Readings from the French Revolution - Chapter 13: Preface to the Constitution of 1793|work=Columbia University|publisher=Columbia University|url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/frerev.htm|accessdate=11 December 2013|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the right==

===Individual or collective right===
Although some explanations of the right of revolution leave open the possibility of its exercise as an individual right, it was clearly understood to be a collective right under English constitutional and political theory.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Christian G. Fritz, ''American Sovereigns: The People and America’s Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2008), 14 (noting that under English constitutional law the right of revolution “belonged to the community as a whole, as one of the parties to the original constitutional contract”). ''See also'' John Phillip Reid, ''Constitutional History of the American Revolution'' (4 vols., [[University of Wisconsin Press]], 1986-1993), I:111 (identifying the collective right of the people “to preserve their rights by force and even rebellion against constituted authority”), III:427n31 (quoting Viscount Bolingbroke that the “collective Body of the People” had the right to “break the Bargain between the King and the Nation”).&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Pauline Maier]] has noted in her study ''From Resistance to Revolution'', “private individuals were forbidden to take force against their rulers either for malice or because of private injuries....”&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Maier, ''From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain'', 1765-1776 (Alfred A. Knopf, 1972), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, “not just a few individuals, but the ‘Body of the People’ had to feel concerned” before the right of revolution was justified and with most writers speaking of a “ ‘whole people who are the Public,’ or the body of the people acting in their ‘public Authority,’ indicating a broad consensus involving all ranks of society.”&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''From Resistance to Revolution'', 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right versus duty===
Some philosophers argue that it is not only the right of a people to overthrow an oppressive government but also their ''duty'' to do so. Howard Evans Kiefer opines, "It seems to me that the ''duty'' to rebel is much more understandable than that ''right'' to rebel, because the right to rebellion ruins the order of power, whereas the duty to rebel goes beyond and breaks it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1R8bi1m9NvIC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;dq=%22duty+to+rebel%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=xdUGaHk_fz&amp;sig=KbTANyl6oRDdLrb736Hq1iK017s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA327,M1|title=Ethics and Social Justice|publisher=|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morton White]] writes of the American revolutionaries, "The notion that they had a ''duty'' to rebel is extremely important to stress, for it shows that they thought they were complying with the ''commands'' of natural law and of nature's God when they threw off absolute despotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0thewbdTMsC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=%22duty+to+rebel%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=AmncN84fAl&amp;sig=f9RHPgKdL2XXRekmS6OXc2-gcgg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result|title=Prophetic Tradition and Radical Rhetoric in America|publisher=|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] states that "when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their ''duty'', to throw off such Government" (emphasis added). The phrase "long train of abuses" is a reference to John Locke's similar statement in Second Treatise of Government, where he explicitly established overthrow of a tyrant as an obligation. [[Martin Luther King]] likewise held that it is the duty of the people to resist unjust laws.

==Preconditions==
[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The presentation of the draft of the Declaration of Independence in [[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' depicts another idealization of the exercise of the right of revolution.]]

Some theories of the right of revolution imposed significant preconditions on its exercise, limiting its invocation to the most dire circumstances. In the American Revolutionary context, one finds expressions of the right of revolution both as subject to precondition and as unrestrained by conditions.

On the eve of the American Revolution, for example, Americans considered their plight to justify exercise of the right of revolution.  [[Alexander Hamilton]] justified American resistance as an expression of “the law of nature” redressing violations of “the first principles of civil society” and invasions of “the rights of a whole people.”&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, ''The Farmer Refuted'', [Feb. 23], 1775, ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton'', I:136&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Thomas Jefferson]] the Declaration was the last-ditch effort of an oppressed people—the position in which many Americans saw themselves in 1776. Jefferson’s litany of colonial grievances was an effort to establish that Americans met their burden to exercise the natural law right of revolution.

Certain scholars, such as legal historian [[Christian Fritz]], have written that with the end of the Revolution, Americans did not renounce the right of revolution.  In fact they codified it in their new constitutions&lt;ref&gt;See Christian G. Fritz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpKCvUacmSwC&amp;amp;pg=RA1-PA168&amp;amp;lpg=RA1-PA168&amp;amp;dq=christian+g+fritz+%22american+sovereigns%22&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=UjY_WKHNjv&amp;amp;sig=Y2_7OZMg6ksk_866oiD44FArH-w&amp;amp;hl=en#PRA1-PA1,M1 ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War']' (In Chapter 2, entitled "Revolutionary Constitutionalism," Professor Fritz notes that after the Revolution, "[i]ncreasingly, as Americans included it in their constitutions, the right of revolution came to be seen as a constitutional principle permitting the people as the sovereign to control government and revise their constitutions without limit.")(Cambridge University Press, 2008) at p. 25 [{{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even today 35 constitutions of American states have the same or similar provisions on the right of revolution as in the preamble of the [[American Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;See Marsavelski, A. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2329401 ''The Crime of Terrorism and the Right of Revolution in International Law']', Connecticut Journal of International Law, Vol. 28, at p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, constitutions considered to be "conservative," such as those of post-revolutionary [[Massachusetts]] in 1780, preserved the people's right "to reform, alter, or totally change" government not only for their protection or safety but also whenever their "prosperity and happiness reduire[d] it."&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts 1780 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Art. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This expression was not unusual in the early American constitutions.  [[Connecticut]]'s 1818 constitution articulated the people's right "at all times" to alter government "in such a manner as they may think expedient."&lt;ref&gt;Connecticut 1818 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fritz, in ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'', describes a duality in American views on preconditions to the right of revolution: "Some of the first state constitutions included 'alter or abolish' provisions that mirrored the traditional right of revolution" in that they required dire preconditions to its exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Christian G. Fritz, ''American Sovereigns: The People and America’s Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2008), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryland]]'s 1776 constitution and [[New Hampshire]]'s 1784 constitutions required the perversion of the ends of government and the endangering of public liberty and that all other means of redress were to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;See Maryland 1776 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 4; New Hampshire 1784 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Art. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; But in contrast, other states dispensed with the onerous preconditions on the exercise of the right.  In the 1776 [[Virginia]] constitution the right would arise simply if government was "inadequate" and [[Pennsylvania]]'s 1776 constitution required only that the people considered a change to be "most conducive" to the public welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia 1776 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 3; Pennsylvania 1776 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural law or positive law==
Descriptions of the Right of Revolution also differ in whether that right is considered to be a [[natural law]] (a law whose content is set by nature and that therefore has validity everywhere) or [[positive law]] (law enacted or adopted by proper authority for governing of the state).

An example of the dual nature of the right of revolution as both a natural law and as positive law is found in the American revolutionary context. Although the [[American Declaration of Independence]] invoked the natural law right of revolution, natural law was not the sole justification for American independence. English constitutional doctrine also supported the colonists’ actions, at least up to a point. By the 1760s, English law recognized what [[William Blackstone]]’s ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'' called “the law of redress against public oppression.”&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'' (4 vols., Oxford, 1765-1769, Facsimile ed., repr., 1979), I:238.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the natural law’s right of revolution, this constitutional law of redress justified the people resisting the sovereign. This law of redress arose from a contract between the people and the king to preserve the public welfare. This original contract was “a central dogma in English and British constitutional law” since “time immemorial.”&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, “The Irrelevance of the Declaration,” in Hendrik Hartog, ed., ''Law in the American Revolution and the Revolution in the Law'' (1981), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration’s long list of grievances declared that this bargain had been breached.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey 1776 Constitution, Preamble in Francis Newton Thorpe, ed., T''he Federal and State Constitutions Colonial Charters, and Other Organic Laws of the ... United States of America'', V:2594 (noting that the King breached his contract with the people).&lt;/ref&gt;

This well-accepted law of redress justified a people resisting unconstitutional acts of government. Liberty depended upon the people’s “ultimate” right to resist. Unconstitutional commands breaching the “voluntary compact between the rulers and the ruled” could be “ignored” and arbitrary commands opposed with force.&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, ''Constitutional History of the American Revolution'' (4 vols., 1986-1993), III:140.&lt;/ref&gt; This right implied a duty on the part of the people to resist unconstitutional acts. As Alexander Hamilton noted in 1775, government exercised powers to protect “the absolute rights” of the people and government forfeited those powers and the people could reclaim them if government breached this constitutional contract.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, “The Farmer Refuted,” [Feb. 23], 1775, ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton'', I:88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of redress had limits like the right of revolution under natural law. The law of redress, like the right of revolution, was not an individual right. It belonged to the community as a whole, as one of the parties to the original constitutional contract.&lt;ref&gt;See Reid, ''Constitutional History'', I:111 (identifying the collective right of the people “to preserve their rights by force and even rebellion against constituted authority”), III:427n31 (quoting Viscount Bolingbroke that the “collective Body of the People” had the right to “break the Bargain between the King and the Nation”); Pauline Maier, ''From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain'', 1765-1776, 33-34 (“Private individuals were forbidden to take force against their rulers either for malice or because of private injuries, even if no redress for their grievances were afforded by the regularly constituted government”).&lt;/ref&gt; It was not a means of first resort, or response to trivial or casual errors of government.&lt;ref&gt;Some commentators endorsed the right of resistance if Parliament “jeopardized the constitution,” but most identified the need for oppression and tyranny before its exercise. See Reid, ''Constitutional History'', III:121, 427n31; Maier, ''Resistance'', 33-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackstone’s ''Commentaries'' suggested that using the law of redress would be “extraordinary,” for example applying if the king broke the original contract, violated “the fundamental laws,” or abandoned the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''Commentaries'', I:243 and 238.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Stamp Act crisis of the 1760s the Massachusetts Provincial Congress considered resistance to the king justified if freedom came under attack from “the hand of oppression” and “the merciless feet of tyranny.”&lt;ref&gt;Reid, ''Constitutional History'', I:112&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later the “indictment” of George III in the Declaration of Independence sought to end his sovereign reign over the colonies because he violated the original constitutional contract.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, “Irrelevance of the Declaration,” 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

As explained in legal historian Christian Fritz’s description of the role of the right of revolution in American Revolution, American independence was justified by conventional theories under Anglo-American constitutional thought at the time about the people’s collective right to cast off an arbitrary king. “Both natural law and English constitutional doctrine gave the colonists a right to revolt against the sovereign’s oppression.”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, ''American Sovereigns'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt; But these understandings about the right of revolution on the eve of the American Revolution rested on a traditional model of government. That model posited the existence of a hypothetical bargain struck in the mists of antiquity between a king and a people. “In this bargain, the people were protected by the monarch in exchange for the people giving the king allegiance. This was a contractual relationship. American revolutionaries accused George III of breaching his implied duty of protection under that contract, thereby releasing the people in the colonies from their allegiance. The sovereign’s breach of the hypothetical contract gave rise to the subjects’ right of revolution”—grounded on both natural law and English constitutional doctrine.”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, ''American Sovereigns'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples as positive law===
Although many [[declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] seek legitimacy by appealing to the right of revolution, far fewer [[constitution]]s mention this right or guarantee this right to citizens because of the destabilizing effect such a guarantee would likely produce. Among the examples of an articulation of a right of revolution as positive law include:

*The [[szlachta]], nobles of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], also maintained a right of rebellion, known as [[rokosz]].
*[[New Hampshire]]'s [[Constitution of New Hampshire|constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nh.gov/constitution/billofrights.html|title=NH.gov - The Official Web Site of New Hampshire State Government - State Constitution, Bill of Rights|publisher=|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; guarantees its citizens the right to reform government, in Article 10 of the New Hampshire constitution's [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]]:
*:''Whenever the [[Purpose of government|ends of government]] are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought to reform the old, or establish a new government. The doctrine of nonresistance against arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.''
*The [[Kentucky]] [[Constitution of Kentucky|constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.ky.gov/research/history.htm Constitution of the Commonwealth of Kentucky] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703062053/http://courts.ky.gov/research/history.htm |date=2009-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also guarantees a right to alter, reform or abolish their government in the Kentucky Bill of Rights:
*:''All power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their peace, safety, happiness and the protection of property. For the advancement of these ends, they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform or abolish their government in such manner as they may deem proper.''
*Similar wording is used in [[Pennsylvania]]'s [[Constitution of Pennsylvania|constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.state.pa.us/PA_Constitution.html Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt; under Article 1, Section 2 of the Declaration of Rights:
*:''All power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their peace, safety and happiness. For the advancement of these ends they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform or abolish their government in such manner as they may think proper.''
*Article I, §1 of the [[Tennessee]] [[Constitution of Tennessee|constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://state.tn.us/sos/bluebook/05-06/46-tnconst.pdf Constitution of the State of Tennessee]&lt;/ref&gt; states:
*:'' That all power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety, and happiness; for the advancement of those ends they have at all times, an unalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform, or abolish the government in such manner as they may think proper''
*[[North Carolina]]'s [[Constitution of North Carolina|constitution]] of November 21, 1789 also contains in its Declaration of Rights:&lt;ref&gt;[http://friesian.com/nullif.htm#dread Randy Barnett, The Rights Retained by the People, The History and Meaning of the Ninth Amendment, George Mason University Press, 1989), p. 364]&lt;/ref&gt;
*:''3d. That Government ought to be instituted for the common benefit, protection and security of the people; and that the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression is absurd, slavish, and destructive to the good and happiness of mankind.''
*The [[Constitution of Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlc.state.tx.us/pubslegref/TxConst.pdf The Texas Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; also contains similar wording in Article 1, Sect 2:
*:''All political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their benefit. The faith of the people of Texas stands pledged to the preservation of a republican form of government, and, subject to this limitation only, they have at all times the inalienable right to alter, reform or abolish their government in such manner as they may think expedient.''
* The preface to the [[French Constitution of 1793]] is a "Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen" with several right of revolution provisions which stated in 
*: Article 11:  ''Any act directed against a person, apart from the cases and without the forms determined by law, is arbitrary and tyrannical; if attempt is made to execute such act by force, the person who is the object thereof has the right to resist it by force.''&lt;ref name="1793PrefaceConstitution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preface to the Constitution of 1793 (Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen) |url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/sites/core/files/text/Preface%20to%20the%20Constitution%20of%201793.pdf |work=National Assembly of France |publisher=college.columbia.edu |accessdate=5 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227022845/http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/sites/core/files/text/Preface%20to%20the%20Constitution%20of%201793.pdf |archivedate=February 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*: Article 27: ''Let any individual who would usurp sovereignty be put to death instantly by free men.''&lt;ref name="1793PrefaceConstitution" /&gt;
*: Article 33-35: ''Resistance to oppression is the consequence of the other rights of man. There is oppression against the social body when a single one of its members is oppressed. There is oppression against every member when the social body is oppressed. When the government violates the rights of the people, insurrection is for the people, and for every portion thereof, the most sacred of rights and the most indispensable of duties.''&lt;ref name="1793PrefaceConstitution" /&gt;
*The 1949 [[Grundgesetz]], the Constitution of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], contains both entrenched, un-amendable clauses protecting human and [[natural and legal rights|natural rights]], as well as a clause in its Article 20 (since 1968) recognizing the right of the people to resist unconstitutional tyranny, if all other measures have failed:
*: ''All Germans shall have the right to resist any person seeking to abolish this constitutional order, if no other remedy is available.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf ''Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany''] (English translation; PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;
*All [[Greece|Greek]] constitutions since the [[Greek Revolution]] have contained a right to resist in their concluding article. The current [[Greek Constitution]] states in Article 120:
*: ''Observance of the constitution is entrusted to the patriotism of the Greeks who shall have the right and the duty to resist by all possible means against anyone who attempts the violent abolition of the Constitution.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf The official English language translation of the Greek Constitution as of May 27, 2008] on the website of Hellenic Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms]], a part of the constitutional systems of both the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovak Republic]], states in Article 23:
*: ''Citizens have the right to resist anybody who would do away with the democratic order of human rights and fundamental freedoms, established by this Charter, if the actions of constitutional bodies or the effective use of legal means have been frustrated.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usoud.cz/en/charter-of-fundamental-rights-and-freedoms/ English translation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613083740/http://www.usoud.cz/en/charter-of-fundamental-rights-and-freedoms |date=2013-06-13 }} on the website of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt;
*This right is inferred in the third paragraph of the preamble to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] which states:
*: ''Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that [[human rights]] should be protected by [[rule of law]].''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights], United Nations website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern relevance==
Some have argued that because in modern times [[Democracy|democratic governments]] can be overthrown by [[election|popular vote]], the right of the people to remove the government has become embedded into the [[political system]]. In a study of the idea of rule by the people in the American Revolution and in early post-revolutionary America, legal historian [[Christian G. Fritz]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The constitutional logic of recognizing the people, not a king, as the sovereign implied the irrelevance of a right of revolution in America. This did not develop instantly or uniformly after the establishment of American governments. Some of the first state constitutions included ‘alter or abolish’ provisions that mirrored the traditional right of revolution....  Other state constitutions adopted different versions of this right to ‘alter or abolish’ government that did not sound like the traditional right of revolution. In these provisions, the ability of the people to revise constitutions existed regardless of the traditional preconditions for the right of revolution....  Increasingly, as Americans included it in their constitutions, the right of revolution came to be seen as a constitutional principle permitting the people as the sovereign to control government and revise their constitutions without limit. In this way, the right broke loose from its traditional moorings of resistance to oppression. The alter or abolish provisions could now be interpreted consistent with the constitutional principle that in America, the sovereign was the people.”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, American Sovereigns, 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the [[Arab Spring]] is clear evidence that revolutions are still happening, which raises the importance of the right of revolution in 21st century. As [[terrorism]] is gaining recognition as a crime under [[international law]], the right of revolution is seen as an instrument to distinguish terrorists from [[freedom fighter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Aleksandar Marsavelski, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2329401 ''The Crime of Terrorism and the Right of Revolution in International Law']' (In Chapter II.A.4., entitled "Criteria for the Use of Revolutionary Force" Marsavelski notes that there are certain limits to the right of revolution, guided by four principles: (1) principle of democracy, (2) principle of proportionality, (3) principle of just cause, and (4) principle of distinction), (Connecticut Journal of International law, Vol. 28) at pp. 278-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14190">'''The Summer Community Organization and Political Education (SCOPE)''' Project of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) was a voter registration civil rights initiative conducted from 1965-66 in 120 counties in six southern states.

== Founding ==
While leading the Chatham County Crusade For Voters in Savannah, Georgia, one of many SCLC affiliates across the South, Rev. [[Hosea Williams]], an SCLC aide to SCLC chairman [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], had been joined by white college students for various short term civil rights projects. From that interracial success, the idea of SCOPE grew to fruition. Dr. King and SCLC decided that there was a need for white college students to journey south to join with local activists. The goals included preparing formerly disenfranchised African Americans for voting, and, if necessary, organizing street demonstrations to help put political pressure on the Congress, should the proposed [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] be met with congressional resistance and stalling by segregationist forces.

In the winter and spring of 1965, the Voting Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama, and the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] were challenging the segregated status quo. During the spring of 1965 Dr. King assigned Williams, SCLC's Director of Voter Registration and Political Education, to lead the SCOPE Project which had been approved by the SCLC executive committee in December 1964. It continued into the Fall of 1965 and Spring of 1966. Some of the white college volunteers returned in the summer of 1966, and a few enrolled in Black southern colleges and continued community organization activities beyond the spring of 1966.

Dr. King announced the SCOPE project in a speech at UCLA on April 27, 1965, and his visit resulted in the recruitment of twenty UCLA students, including the late [[Joel Siegel]], who later became the film critic for [[Good Morning America]], and [[Rick Tuttle]], who worked with Williams and [[Andrew Young]] and spent two months in a Savannah jail as a result of his movement activities. Tuttle’s case won the right to use property bonds for civil rights workers bail. Later he would serve 16 years as Los Angeles City Controller. The SCLC staff sent regional recruitment teams to visit colleges and universities nationwide. Gwendolyn Green, the executive director of the Western Christian Leadership Conference, joined Dr. King at UCLA and was temporarily assigned to the Atlanta office to serve as the Assistant SCOPE director, reporting to Williams and King.

== Youth Volunteers ==

Initially, the SCLC had hoped to recruit 2000 volunteers, but due to the sometimes extreme danger involved with mid-60s civil rights movement in the southern states, college students from the north and west did not respond in the hoped for numbers. Eventually about 500 predominantly white college volunteers—representing nearly 100 universities—were deployed in 90 of the 120 SCOPE Project targeted counties across six southern states.  Some students were re-deployed and assigned to more than one county by Williams, who had received leadership training as a World War II Army Sgt. in General [[George Patton]]'s Black tank brigade and was a combat decorated  veteran.

== Training ==

The SCOPE project began on June 14, 1965,  with a week-long Orientation at [[Morris Brown College]] in Atlanta, which was led by [[Bayard Rustin]], the organizer of the 1963 [[March On Washington]]. The "faculty" for the orientation included: [[Vernon Jordan]] of the [[Urban League]]; Ralph Helstein, president of the meatpackers union; [[John Doar]], Assistant Attorney for Civil Rights); [[Michael Harrington]], author of “The Other America”; civil rights lawyer [[Charles Morgan, Jr.]], as well as Dr. King, Young, Rev. [[Ralph Abernathy]], Junius Griffin, Rev. [[James Bevel]], and others on the SCLC Executive Staff.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford University "Project South" SCOPE interview archives, Green Llibrary Special Collections&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activist Accomplishments ==
The students were led by local African American leaders in the targeted counties and joined by Black community volunteers, including local ministers and large numbers of local high school and college youth. The SCOPE Project registered an estimated 49,000 new voters through the combined efforts of the local community and the SCOPE college volunteers during a ten-week initiative, from June 14 - August 28.  In addition, SCOPE educated thousands of citizens in political and voter literacy education classes.
 
The volunteers also tested and reported violations of the [[1964 Civil Rights Act]] and the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] to Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, John Doar, which led to U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) investigations and the deployment of Federal voter registrars to counties that denied African Americans the right to vote.  SCLC field staff and SCOPE volunteers also worked with the DOJ [[Community Relations Service]] (CRS), and engaged in nonviolent demonstrations to dramatize the denial of voting rights and the refusal to remove "white only" signs and desegregate public accommodations.

SCLC and other organizations bridged racial and religious barriers to forge partnerships with both white Christian and Jewish groups, along with progressives in the [[Southern Regional Council]] and other organizations. SCOPE volunteers were assigned to work with African-American community leaders who had requested the white college volunteers.
  
The students lived with African-American families, who were paid $15 a week for their room and board, which barely covered expenses. About 40 of the college volunteers were asked by Dr. King, Williams and his assistant, Gwendolyn Green, to join the SCLC Field Staff. They were then paid a subsistence salary of $5 a week, with the African American community providing housing and meals. Many veterans from other SCLC campaigns were assigned to the SCOPE project including: Field Staff members Rev. Willie Bolden, Benjamin Van Clark, Jimmie L. Wells, Lula Williams, Lena Turner, Gloria Wise, Jewell Wise, Patricia Simpson, R. B. Cottonreader, J.T. Johnson, Tom Houck, Dana Swan, Rev. [[James Orange]], Ben “Sunshine” Owens, “Big Lester” Hankerson, Leon Hall, [[Bruce Hartford]], and others. Both Albert Turner and Stony Cooks worked closely with Williams in statewide leadership roles.

SCOPE volunteers experienced violence, tear-gassing, harassment and threats with guns on numerous occasions, according to "incident reports"&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, Willy. ''The Scope of Freedom: The Leadership of Hosea Williams with Dr. King's '65 Student Volunteers''. (2005) Montgomery: Challenge Publishing, pp. 367-389&lt;/ref&gt; from the project's administrative records. On June 18, 1965 in Camden, AL, for example, 18 SCOPE workers were arrested in a church for "illegal possession of boycott materials." One SCOPE worker, Mike Farley, was beaten in jail by a white prisoner, who was reportedly both bribed and threatened by a jailer. On July 8 in Wilcox County, AL, three cars carrying SCOPE workers were shot at by white men, after police stopped SCOPE workers and spoke with white men. On July 15, in Chatham County, Georgia, SCOPE worker Shirley Savaris was threatened by a white man with a gun and told to leave town. The next day in Taliafferro County, Georgia, SCOPE workers were threatened by a deputy sheriff and county attorney with beatings and killings, "if they did not leave town the next day." Also in Taliaferro County, on July 23, SCOPE volunteer Richard Copeland was beaten by two whites on the courthouse steps in Crawfordsville. On July 28 in Sussex County, Virginia, two SCOPE workers, Gary Imsland and Elke Wiedenroth, were run off the road while returning from a church meeting and threatened by a white man with a shotgun. In Luverne, Alabama, on August 3, SCOPE workers Dunbar Reed, Bruce Hartford, and Carol Richardson, along with a number of local students were attacked and beaten by a white mob after they integrated a local cafe. On August 18 in Berkeley County, South Carolina, two SCOPE volunteers were beaten after attempting to integrate restaurants in Monk's Corner and the local SCOPE office and volunteer residence was shot up the following day.

== SCOPE Veterans Legacy ==
The SCOPE volunteers were profoundly impacted on a personal level by the inter-racial experiences throughout their lives, as were the host families and communities.  Press accounts termed the SCOPE volunteers "the freedom corps." Although the college students were in no way  leaders of the civil rights movement, they were a part of a generational vanguard of about only 3,000 whites between 1961–1966,  who were willing to put themselves in harms way during the movement struggle in the South. Rev. Hosea Williams predicted in an interview with the Stanford University radio station in August, 1965, that SCOPE volunteers would provide significant leadership to America in the future. And, within the ranks of the SCOPE students there have been many who provided impressive leadership in various fields, including: Dr. [[Jo Freeman]], an author/journalist; Father [[James Groppi]], as an activist Catholic priest; Dr. Barbara Jean Emerson, a college administrator; [[Elizabeth Omilami]], actress and current CEO of Hosea's Feed The Hungry and Homeless  Inc - a non-profit that provides food and assistance to the poor in Atlanta; Rabbi Moshe Shur, Hillel Rabbi at Queens College; international educator Peter Geffen, founder of the [[Abraham Heschel]] Day School in NYC; Dr. Dean Savage, chair, Dept of Sociology, Queens College;, Dr. James Simons, M.D., Oncologist, Kaiser Hospital, Oakland, CA;, Judy Van Allen (Institute For African Development, Cornell University; Dick Reavis, professor, NC State University); Dr. Bruce Mirhoff, professor, SUNY); Bruce Hartford, co-founder Civil Rights Vets website; Beth Pickens, attorney – NYC and others. Additional SCOPErs who became leaders can be found on the civil rights vets website.

[[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) Chairman from 1963–1966 (later a U.S. Congressman representing Atlanta), welcomed the SCOPE volunteers as “Brothers and sisters in the movement,” who were willing to put their lives on the line for freedom. Lewis was jailed with white SCOPE workers, along with local African American SNCC and SCLC volunteers, in Americus, Georgia on August 1, 1965, after attempting to integrate to local churches. As Lewis said during a question and answer session at Atlanta's Oglethorpe University in 2006, "The SCOPE volunteers were no different than [[Freedom Summer]] workers, we were all together that summer of 1965, and we all took the same risks.  The SCOPE volunteers stood shoulder to shoulder with us in our struggle for civil and voting rights."

In assessing the courageous contributions of the SCOPE volunteers, Andrew Young, who went on from the Civil Rights Movement to serve as a U.S. Congressman, United Nations Ambassador and Mayor of Atlanta, told a King Holiday audience in Atlanta “The volunteers in SCOPE knew that some of the Freedom Summer workers had been killed the Summer before, but they came anyway.” On another occasion, he told a reunion of civil rights Movement volunteers, including SCOPE veterans “Most of you were taking your lives in your hands by associating with us. It made us truly a national movement, when the students came. Their parents had to learn about the South.”

Books about SCOPE by SCOPE Participants include: ''This Bright Light of Ours: Stories from the Voting Rights Fight'', Maria Gitin, University of Alabama Press Feb 2014. For more information see: www.thisbrightlightofours.com.

Willy Siegel Leventhal offered his collection of SCOPE documents and essays: ''The SCOPE of Freedom'', to enable Gitin to contact some of her co-workers and to conduct some fact checking.

The three-dimensional structure of a protein is required for a protein to be functional. This hypothesis then lays the essential link between information stored and inherited in nucleic acids to the chemical processes which enable life to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brenner | first1 = Sydney | authorlink1 = Sydney Brenner| title = Retrospective [[Frederick Sanger]] (1918-2013) | doi = 10.1126/science.1249912 | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6168 | pages = 262 | year = 2014 | pmid =  24436413| pmc = | bibcode = 2014Sci...343..262B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Or, as Crick put it in 1958:

{{pull quote|text=In its simplest form it [the Sequence Hypothesis] assumes that the specificity of a piece of [[nucleic acid]] is expressed solely by the sequence of its [[base pair|bases]], and that this sequence is a (simple) code for the amino acid sequence of a particular protein.

This hypothesis appears to be rather widely held. Its virtue is that it unites several remarkable pairs of generalisations: the central biochemical importance of proteins and the dominating role of [[genes]], and in particular of their nucleic acid; the linearity of protein molecules (considered covalently) and the genetic linearity within the functional gene [...]; the simplicity of the composition of protein molecules and the simplicity of the nucleic acids. |author=Francis Crick{{sfn|Crick|1958|p=152}} }}

This description is further amplified in the article and, in discussing how a protein folds up into its three-dimensional structure, Crick suggested that "the ''folding is simply a function of the order of the amino acids''" in the protein.{{sfn|Crick|1958|p=144}}

The '''Shouwang Church''' (守望教会) is a [[Protestant]] [[house church (China)|house church]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and almost the biggest of about 3,000 of such  congregations in the city. The word ''shouwang'' means "to keep watch" in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].&lt;ref name=Gauthier&gt;{{cite news|last=Gauthier|first=Ursula|title=Why Do Christian Groups in China Put Authorities on Red Alert?|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2075386,00.html|accessdate=19 June 2011|newspaper=[[Time Magazine]]|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and membership==
The church was founded in 1993 by Jin Tianming, a chemical engineering graduate of [[Tsinghua University]] of [[Koreans in China|Korean]] ethnicity.&lt;ref name="duihua.org"&gt;''Dui Hua'', issue 46, Winter 2012: ''[http://duihua.org/wp/?p=5313 Uncovering China’s Korean Christians]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of its members has increased from 10 to 1,000 as of June 2011.&lt;ref name=Gauthier /&gt;

The services are conducted at members' homes or in rented conference rooms; its other activities include 40 [[biblical]] reading groups, [[choir]] practice and [[catechism]]. Shouwang members typically belong to the middle and upper classes, and include professors, doctors, lawyers, students and [[Communist Party of China|Party]] members.&lt;ref name=Gauthier /&gt;

==Persecution==
Like other house churches, the Shouwang Church is subject to [[harassment]] by the Chinese authorities, who disapprove of religious groups that are not subject to state control.&lt;ref name = Gauthier /&gt; The church was forced to change headquarters more than 20 times, and was prevented from buying or renting a [[church (building)|church]] building.&lt;ref name = Gauthier /&gt;

Persecution intensified in the context of the general [[2011 crackdown on dissidents in the People's Republic of China|2011 crackdown on dissidents]], following an announcement by church leaders that they would begin holding [[Sunday]] service meetings in public, if they were not allowed to acquire premises.&lt;ref name = "Köckritz"&gt;{{cite news | last = Köckritz| first = Angela| title = Hier stehen wir!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2308">'''The "No-Problem" Problem''' refers to an often spoken facet of [[systemic bias]], whereby exclusion of minorities or
marginalized people and knowledge occurs because the issue is perceived as either not a problem, or not the speaker's
problem. The term was defined in 1990 by [[Deborah Rhode]] who published a paper by this title in the 1991 [[Yale Law Journal]].&lt;ref name=article&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/796785.pdf The "No-Problem" Problem: Feminist Challenges and Cultural Change], by Rhode, Yale Law Journal, Vol. 100, nr. 6, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, inspired by difficulties of people grappling with class and racial issues, was applied by Rhode specifically to the women's movement as being a problem of ''perception'', since "the most traditional approach has been to acknowledge gender disparities, but to deny their injustice".&lt;ref name=article/&gt; Twenty years later, the problem was revisited by Brenda Frink of the [[Clayman Institute for Gender Research]] with her article ''The persistence of the no-problem problem''.&lt;ref name=Frink&gt;[https://gender.stanford.edu/news-publications/gender-news/persistence-no-problem-problem The persistence of the no-problem problem], by Brenda Frink, Clayman Institute for Gender Research, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She quoted Rhode's 2010 book on the subject of women's physical appearance, ''The Beauty Bias: The Injustice of Appearance in Life and Law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhode|first1=Deborah L.|authorlink1=Deborah Rhode|title=The Beauty Bias: the Injustice of Appearance in Life and Law |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=0195372875}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of perception in the problem had been taken a step further and been distilled into an issue of physical appearance, since "women who fall short of cultural beauty ideals are disadvantaged in jobs, salaries, and promotions even where looks bear no obvious relationship to performance". 
In 2014 Ilene Fischer wrote a blog in the Huffington Post titled ''The No-Problem Problem'' applying the term to the [[gender pay gap]] at [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ilene-fischer/the-noproblem-problem_b_6072774.html The No-Problem Problem], by Ilene Fischer, Huffington Post, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Library of Babel'''" ({{lang-es|La biblioteca de Babel}}) is a [[short story]] by [[Argentina|Argentine]] author and [[librarian]] [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (1899–1986), conceiving of a [[universe]] in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a certain format and [[character set]].

The story was originally published in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in Borges' [[1941 in literature|1941]] collection of stories ''El Jardín de senderos que se bifurcan'' (''The Garden of Forking Paths''). That entire book was, in turn, included within his much-reprinted ''[[Ficciones]]'' ([[1944 in literature|1944]]). Two [[English language|English-language]] [[translation]]s appeared approximately simultaneously in [[1962 in literature|1962]], one by James E. Irby in a diverse collection of Borges's works titled ''[[Labyrinths]]'' and the other by Anthony Kerrigan as part of a collaborative translation of the entirety of ''Ficciones''.

==Plot summary==
Borges' narrator describes how his universe consists of an enormous expanse of adjacent [[hexagon]]al rooms, each of which contains the bare necessities for human survival—and four walls of bookshelves. Though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless, the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic [[grapheme|characters]] (22 letters, the period, the comma, and space). Though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish, the library also must contain, somewhere, every coherent book ever written, or that might ever be written, and every possible [[permutation]] or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books. The narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information, including predictions of the future, biographies of any person, and translations of every book in all [[language]]s. Conversely, for many of the texts, some language could be devised that would make it readable with any of a vast number of different contents.

Despite—indeed, because of—this glut of information, all books are totally useless to the reader, leaving the librarians in a state of suicidal despair. This leads some librarians to [[superstitious]] and [[cult]]-like behaviors, such as the "Purifiers", who arbitrarily destroy books they deem nonsense as they scour through the library seeking the "Crimson Hexagon" and its illustrated, magical books. Others believe that since all books exist in the library, somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library's contents; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the "Man of the Book" has read it, and they travel through the library seeking him.

==Themes==
[[File:Jorge Luis Borges.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Borges in 1976]]
The story repeats the theme of Borges' [[1939 in literature|1939]] essay "[[The Total Library]]" ("La Biblioteca total"), which in turn acknowledges the earlier development of this theme by [[Kurd Lasswitz]] in his [[1901 in literature|1901]] story "The Universal Library" ("Die Universalbibliothek"):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain examples that [[Aristotle]] attributes to [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]] clearly prefigure it, but its belated inventor is [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], and its first exponent, [[Kurd Lasswitz]]. [...] In his book ''The Race with the Tortoise'' (Berlin, 1919), Dr [[Theodor Wolff]] suggests that it is a derivation from, or a parody of, [[Ramón Llull]]'s thinking machine [...T]he elements of his game are the universal orthographic symbols, not the words of a language [...] Lasswitz arrives at twenty-five symbols (twenty-two letters, the space, the period, the comma), whose recombinations and repetitions encompass everything possible to express in all languages. The totality of such variations would form a Total Library of astronomical size. Lasswitz urges mankind to construct that inhuman library, which chance would organize and which would eliminate intelligence. (Wolff's ''The Race with the Tortoise'' expounds the execution and the dimensions of that impossible enterprise.)&lt;ref&gt;Borges, Jorge Luis. ''The Total Library: Non-Fiction 1922–1986.'' Allen Lane The Penguin Press, London, 2000. Pages 214–216. Translated by Eliot Weinberger.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of Borges' signature motifs are featured in the story, including [[infinity]], [[reality]], [[Kabbalah|cabalistic reasoning]], and [[labyrinth]]s. The concept of the library is often compared to [[Infinite monkey theorem|Borel's dactylographic monkey theorem]]. There is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in "The Library of Babel", although Borges had mentioned that analogy in "The Total Library": "[A] half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum." In this story, the closest equivalent is the line, "A blasphemous sect suggested [...] that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books."

Borges would examine a similar idea in his 1975 story, "[[The Book of Sand]]" in which there is an infinite book (or book with an indefinite number of pages) rather than an infinite library. Moreover, the story's ''Book of Sand'' is said to be written in an unknown alphabet and its content is not obviously random. In The Library of Babel, Borges interpolates Italian mathematician [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]]'s suggestion that any solid body could be conceptualized as the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.

The concept of the library is also overtly analogous to the view of the universe as a [[sphere]] having its center everywhere and its [[circumference]] nowhere. The [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] [[Blaise Pascal]] employed this [[metaphor]], and in an earlier essay Borges noted that Pascal's manuscript called the sphere ''effroyable,'' or "frightful".

In any case, a library containing ''all'' possible books, arranged at random, might as well be a library containing ''zero'' books, as any true information would be buried in, and rendered indistinguishable from, all possible forms of false information; the experience of opening to any page of any of the library's books has been simulated by websites which create screenfuls of random letters.&lt;ref&gt;See https://libraryofbabel.info/&lt;/ref&gt;

The quote at the beginning of the story, "By this art you may contemplate the variation of the twenty-three letters," is from [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s 1621 ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]''.

==Philosophical implications==
There are numerous philosophical implications within the idea of the finite library which exhausts all possibilities. Every book in the library is "intelligible" if one decodes it correctly, simply because it can be decoded from any other book in the library using a third book as a [[one-time pad]]. This lends itself to the philosophical idea proposed by [[Immanuel Kant]], that our mind helps to structure our experience of reality; thus the rules of reality (as we know it) are intrinsic to the mind. So if we identify these rules, we can better decode 'reality'. One might speculate that these rules are contained in the crimson hexagon room which is the key to decoding the others. The library becomes a temptation, even an obsession, because it contains these gems of enlightenment while also burying them in deception. On a psychological level, the infinite storehouse of information is a hindrance and a distraction, because it lures one away from writing one's own book (i.e. living one's life). Anything one might write would of course already exist. One can see any text as being pulled from the library by the act of the author defining the search letter by letter until they reach a text close enough to the one they intended to write. The text already existed theoretically, but had to be found by the act of the author's imagination.&lt;ref name=Kelly1994&gt;{{citation|title=Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|year=1994|author=Kelly, Kevin|isbn=978-0-201-48340-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another implication is an argument against certain proofs of the [[existence of God]], as it is carried out by [[David Hume]] using the thought experiment of a similar library of books generated not by human mind, but by nature.&lt;ref name=Hume1779&gt;{{citation|title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion Part 3|year=1779|author=Hume, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinite extent===
In mainstream theories of natural language syntax, every syntactically-valid utterance can be extended to produce a new, longer one, because of [[Recursion#In_language|recursion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aspects of the theory of syntax|author=Noam, Chomsky|year=1969|orig-year=1965|publisher=M.I.T. Press|isbn=9780262030113|edition=1st pbk.|location=Cambridge|oclc=12964950}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this process can be continued indefinitely, then there is no upper bound on the length of a well-formed utterance and the number of unique well-formed strings of any language is [[countably infinite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pullum, Geoffrey K.|date=September 1, 2013|title=The Central Question in Comparative Syntactic Metatheory|journal=Mind &amp; Language|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=492–521|doi=10.1111/mila.12029|issn=1468-0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the books in the Library of Babel are of bounded length ("each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters"), so the Library can only contain a finite number of distinct strings, and thus cannot contain all possible well-formed utterances. Borges' narrator notes this fact, but believes that the Library is nevertheless infinite; he speculates that it repeats itself periodically, given an eventual "order" to the "disorder" of the seemingly-random arrangement of books.

===Quine's reduction===
In a short essay, [[W.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;O. Quine]] noted the interesting fact that the Library of Babel is finite (that is, we will theoretically come to a point in history where everything has been written), and that the Library of Babel can be constructed in its entirety simply by writing a dot on one piece of paper and a dash on another. These two sheets of paper could then be alternated at random to produce every possible text, in [[Morse code]] or equivalently [[binary code|binary]]. Writes Quine, "The ultimate absurdity is now staring us in the face: a universal library of two volumes, one containing a single dot and the other a dash. Persistent repetition and alternation of the two are sufficient, we well know, for spelling out any and every truth. The miracle of the finite but universal library is a mere inflation of the miracle of binary notation: everything worth saying, and everything else as well, can be said with two characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/universal_library.html|title=Universal Library|author=W.V.O Quine|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with biology==
The full possible set of protein sequences ([[sequence space (evolution)|Protein sequence space]]) has been compared to the Library of Babel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arnold, FH|title=The Library of Maynard-Smith: My Search for Meaning in the protein universe|journal=Advances in Protein Chemistry|date=2000|volume=55|pages=ix–xi|pmid=11050930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostermeier|first1=M|title=Beyond cataloging the Library of Babel.|journal=Chemistry &amp; Biology|date=March 2007|volume=14|issue=3|pages=237–8|pmid=17379136|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2007.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Library of Babel'', finding any book that made sense was impossible due to the sheer number and lack of order. The same would be true of protein sequences if it were not for natural selection, which has picked out only protein sequences that make sense. Additionally, each protein sequence is surrounded by a set of neighbors (point mutants) that are likely to have at least some function. [[Daniel Dennett]]'s 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'' includes an elaboration of the Library of Babel concept to imagine the set of all possible genetic sequences, which he calls the Library of Mendel, in order to illustrate the mathematics of genetic variation. Dennett uses this concept again later in the book to imagine all possible algorithms that can be included in his Toshiba computer, which he calls the Library of Toshiba. He describes the Library of Mendel and the Library of Toshiba as subsets within the Library of Babel.

==Influence on later writers==
*[[Umberto Eco]]'s postmodern novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980) features a labyrinthine library, presided over by a blind monk named Jorge of Burgos.
*In "The Net of Babel", published in ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' in 1995, [[David Langford]] imagines the Library becoming [[computer]]ized for easy access. This aids the librarians in searching for specific text while also highlighting the futility of such searches as they can find anything, but nothing of meaning as such. The sequel continues many of Borges's themes, while also highlighting the difference between [[data]] and [[information]], and [[satire|satirizing]] the [[Internet]].
*[[Russell K. Standish|Russell Standish]]'s ''Theory of Nothing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcoders.com.au/nothing.html|title=Theory of Nothing|publisher=Hpcoders.com.au|date=May 29, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the concept of the Library of Babel to illustrate how an [[ultimate ensemble]] containing all possible descriptions would in sum contain zero information and would thus be the simplest possible explanation for the existence of the universe. This theory, therefore, implies the reality of all universes.
*[[Michael Ende]] reused the idea of a universe of hexagonal rooms in the ''Temple of a Thousand Doors'' from ''[[The Neverending Story]]'', which contained all the possible characteristics of doors in the fantastic realm. A later chapter features the [[infinite monkey theorem]].
*[[Terry Pratchett]] uses the concept of the infinite library in his ''[[Discworld]]'' novels. The knowledgeable librarian is a human wizard transformed into an orangutan.
*''The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel'' (2008) by [[William Goldbloom Bloch]] explores the short story from a mathematical perspective. Bloch analyzes the hypothetical library presented by Borges using the ideas of topology, information theory, and geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bloch, William Goldbloom|title=The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/faculty-directory/bill-goldbloom-bloch/|title=William Goldbloom Bloch's home page|publisher=Faculty.wheatoncollege.edu|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[City at the End of Time]]'' (2008), the sum-runners carried by the protagonists are intended by their creator to be combined to form a 'Babel', an infinite library containing every possible permutation of every possible character in every possible language. Bear has stated that this was inspired by Borges, who is also namechecked in the novel. Borges is described as an unknown Argentinian who commissioned an encyclopedia of impossible things, a reference to either "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]" or the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]''.
*''Fone'', a short comic novel drawn by [[Milo Manara]], features a human astronaut and his alien partner stranded on a planet named Borges Profeta. The planet is overflowed by books containing all the possible permutations of letters.
*[[Steven L. Peck]] wrote a novella entitled ''A Short Stay in Hell'' (2012) in which the protagonist must find the book containing his life story in an afterlife replica of Borges' Library of Babel.
*The third season of ''Carmilla'', a Canadian single-frame web series based on the novella by [[Sheridan Le Fanu|J. Sheridan Le Fanu]], is set in a mystical library described as "non-Euclidean" and omnipotent.  It contains a door that, depending on the knocking pattern on its panels, can be opened into any universe. It also creates a temporary parallel universe and is able to shift a character between the parallel and the original.  As the parallel universe collapses, darkness falls, and a character perishes in the void after uttering the words, "O time thy pyramids," which are contained on the second-to-last page of a book in the Library of Babel.
*In [[Christopher Nolan]]'s film [[Interstellar (film)|''Interstellar'']], the protagonist, Cooper, played by [[Matthew McConaughey]], becomes trapped in a world which mirrors that of Borges' i.e. Cooper's universe consists of an enormous expanse of adjacent [[hexagonal]] rooms, or libraries, each of which contains the bare necessities for survival. Though the order and content of the books and rooms are random and apparently completely meaningless, Cooper can, by manipulating the books, affect change in the "real" world and is, as such, analogous to the "Man of the Book", the messianic figure in The Library of Babel. Unlike the Man of the Book, however, Cooper is something more than just a [[metaphor]] and has a transformative role in his [[Universe]], becoming a [[catalyst]] and an agent of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/reviews-recommendations/review-interstellar|author=Pinkerton, Nick|title=Review: Interstellar|date=July 21, 2017|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Atlantic]]|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/382636/|title=Interstellar Isn't About Religion (and Also It Is Totally About Religion)|author=Garber, Megan|date=November 12, 2014|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/11/13/363444786/the-science-of-interstellar|title=The Science Of 'Interstellar'|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=November 13, 2014|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jonathan Basile enterprised to recreate the Library in Borges' story on his website http://libraryofbabel.info, adapted to the English language. An algorithm he created generates a 'book' by iterating every permutation of 29 characters: the 26 English letters, space, comma, and period. Each book is marked by a coordinate, corresponding to its place on the hexagonal library (hexagon name, wall number, shelf number, and book name) so that every book can be found at the same place every time. The website is said to contain "all possible pages of 3200 characters, about 10&lt;sup&gt;4677&lt;/sup&gt; books".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libraryofbabel.info/About.html|title=Library of Babel Website : About|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, the number of [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] children in the world was about the same as the number of [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] children.&lt;ref&gt;Paradis, J., Genesee, F., &amp; Crago, M. (2011). ''Dual Language Development and Disorders: A handbook on bilingualism &amp; second language learning''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; TCKs are often exposed to a second (or third, fourth, etc.) language while living in their host culture, being physically exposed to the environment where the native language is used in practical aspects of life. "TCKs learn some languages in schools abroad and some in their homes or in the marketplaces of a foreign land. ... Some pick up languages from the nannies in the home or from playmates in the neighborhood" (Bell-Villada et al. 23). This [[language immersion]] is why TCKs are often bilingual, and sometimes even multilingual.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:National Multicultural Festival (6856303265).jpg|thumb|A banner from the National Multicultural Festival in Canberra, Australia]]
The term "third culture kid" was first coined by researchers John and [[Ruth Hill Useem|Ruth Useem]] in the 1950s, who used it to describe the children of American citizens working and living abroad.&lt;ref name="melles" /&gt; Ruth Useem first used the term after her second year-long visit to [[India]] with her fellow [[sociologist]]/[[anthropologist]] husband and three children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/footnotes/dec03/departments.html Ruth Useem's obituary in Footnotes, the Newsletter of the American Sociological Association], December 2003. Retrieved 2010-01-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Useem et al. (1963) depicted individuals who have undergone such an experience as having distinct standards of interpersonal behavior, work-related [[Norm (social)|norms]], codes of lifestyle and [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]], and communication. This creates a new cultural group that does not fall into their home or host culture, but rather share a culture with all other TCKs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Useem | first1 = J. | last2 = Useem | first2 = R. | year = 1967 | title = The interfaces of a binational third culture: A study of the American community in India | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 130–143 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1967.tb00567.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she wrote:
{{Quote|text=In summarizing that which we had observed in our cross-cultural encounters, we began to use the term "third culture" as a generic term to cover the styles of life created, shared, and learned by persons who are in the process of relating their societies, or sections thereof, to each other. The term "Third Culture Kids" or TCKs was coined to refer to the children who accompany their parents into another society.|sign=Ruth Hill Useem|source=[http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art1.html TCK World: The Official Home of Third Culture Kids]}}

Kay Branaman Eakin, the former Education Counselor for the [[United States Department of State]], worked with American families returning to the United States after having lived abroad. She described a TCK as "someone who, as a child, has spent a significant period of time in one or more culture(s) other than [his/her] own, thus integrating elements of those cultures and their own birth culture, into a third culture."&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, K.B. (1998). According to my passport, I'm coming home. ''U.S. Department of State'', 18. Retrieved from http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/2065.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, K.B. Our consultants: Kay Branaman Eakin. ''Bennett Schoolplacment Worldwide.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, author and researcher Norma McCaig used the term "[[global nomad]]", which is synonymous with TCK, but was used in order to take into account that the child's situation was as a result of a parent or parents' [[career]] or life choice(s).&lt;ref&gt;McCaig, N. (1994, September). Growing up with a world view. ''Foreign Service Journal'', 32–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Third culture kids can also be referred to as cultural hybrids, cultural chameleons, and global nomads.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; TCKs are particularly adept at building relationships with other cultures while not possessing a [[cultural identity]] of their own.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; It has been discussed in the past that the characteristics that have been put forth by prominent researchers in the TCK field have only been discussed when referring to American children who have lived abroad. However, there has been further research done on TCKs that shows that the same characteristics described by Pollock and Useem in the most prominent TCK literature also apply to individuals from other nations who have also lived abroad for extended periods of time during their developmental years.&lt;ref name ="pollock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="useem"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "bonebright"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonebright | first1 = D.A. | year = 2010 | title = Adult third culture kids: HRD challenges and opportunities | url = | journal = Human Resources Development International | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 351–359 | doi=10.1080/13678861003746822}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are benefits and challenges to being a TCK according to various researchers on the subject.  The term TCKs may be applied to all social classes and although there are certain distinctions between TCKs and immigrants, it can include immigrant and refugee students (Dewaele 8c van Oudenhoven, 2009).&lt;ref name="Limberg, D. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Limberg | first1 = D. | last2 = Lambie | first2 = G. W. | year = 2011 | title = Third Culture Kids: Implications for Professional School Counseling | url = | journal = Professional School Counseling | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 45–54 | doi=10.5330/psc.n.2011-15.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
*Expanded [[World view|worldview]]: TCKs have an understanding that there is more than one way to look at situations that they are exposed to or experience. This can also be a challenge however, when TCKs return to a culture that is [[homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogenous]] in their belief system, as an expanded worldview is perceived as offensive or useless.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lyttle" /&gt;
*Third-dimensional view of the world: With an increased number of hands-on [[experience]]s in multiple cultures, there is a difference in the way that the world is perceived. For example, there has been an increase in [[cross-cultural]] authors, such as [[Khaled Hosseini]], author of ''[[The Kite Runner]]'', who have received awards for their works that are written from a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] perspective. These authors are able to provide vivid descriptions about the cultures they have directly experienced and thus their work appears to be "three-dimensional."&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;
*Interpersonal sensitivity: Increased exposure to a variety of perceptions and lifestyles allow TCKs to monitor their emotions, and register societal norms and cues more adeptly so as to produce higher [[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] to other cultures and ways of life.&lt;ref name="lyttle" /&gt;
*Cross-cultural competence or [[cultural intelligence]]: the capacity to function effectively across national, ethnic, and organizational cultures. 
*TCK have been found to have higher levels of general adjustment as opposed to mono cultural children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selmer | first1 = J. | last2 = Lauring | first2 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Self-initiated expatriates: An exploratory study of adjustment of adult third-culture kids vs. Adult mono-culture kids | url = | journal = Cross Cultural Management | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 422–436 | doi = 10.1108/CCM-01-2013-0005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural adaptability is also a benefit, although may also come as a challenge which results from lack of cultural balance.&lt;ref name="Tokuhama-Espinosa"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2i0h2Oxh7EoC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=third+culture+kids#v=onepage&amp;q=third%20culture%20kids&amp;f=false|title=The Multilingual Mind: Issues Discussed By, For, and about People Living with Many Languages|last=Tokuhama-Espinosa|first=Tracey|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780897899185|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The major benefit, however, is related to language exposure. As pointed out by Tokuhama-Espinosa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Multilingual Mind: Issues Discussed By, For and about People Living with Many Languages|last=Tokuhama-Espinisa|first=Tracy|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2003|isbn=978-0897899192|location=Santa Barbara|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; language opens the doors to new realms including that of new cultures. TCKs, through prolonged exposure to native language use, can thus also learn to see themselves through the eyes of others.

===Challenges===
*Confused [[Loyalty|loyalties]]: Third culture kids can experience a lot confusion with politics and values. This is especially the case when moving from [[collectivism|collectivist]] to [[individualism|individualist]] cultures, or vice versa, as the values within each culture are different from the other.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt; This issue is also related with the [[identity crisis]], on a cultural level, not being able to feel a sense of oneness with any one nationality or culture. Oftentimes, TCKs cannot answer the question: "Where is home?"&lt;ref name="Tokuhama-Espinosa"/&gt;  
*Painful awareness of reality: difficulty adjusting to cultures where the only culture that is discussed or focused on is itself.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;
*Ignorance of home culture: TCKs are often lacking in knowledge about their home nation, culture, town, and/or family. With current technology leading to the globalization of information, this is becoming increasingly less of a challenge provided the TCKs use modern technology in their host cultures to connect to their home culture. Understanding a culture’s sense of humor, however, is a commonly cited difficulty with the transition back to a home culture. There are also general societal norms and practices that will not be known when a TCK is first re-introduced to his/her home culture but those are eventually learned.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;
*Difficulties with adjusting to adult life: the mixture of influences from the various cultures that the individual has lived can create challenges in developing an identity as well as with a sense of belonging. Feelings of rootlessness and restlessness can make the transition to [[emerging adulthood and early adulthood|adulthood]] a challenging period for TCKs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hervey | first1 = E | year = 2009 | title = Cultural transitions during childhood and adjustments to college | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology and Christianity | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 3–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"American ATCKs reported significantly higher levels of prejudice than non-American ATCKs on the Cognitive subscale of the QDI and the Social Dominance Orientation scale (SDO)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Melles | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Does the third culture kid experience predict levels of prejudice? | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 260–267 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is a need for special attention of young TCK in educational settings to make sure they are supported when and if entering a new school. This would allow for an optimal learning experience for the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = P. L. | year = 2013 | title = It's not all about academic achievement: supporting the social and emotional needs of migrant worker children | url = | journal = Pastoral Care in Education | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 173–190 | doi = 10.1080/02643944.2012.747555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Walters and Auton-Cuff (2009) found that female TCKs hesitate to develop relationships and have less emotional affect as compared to non-TCKs. Furthermore, female TCKs' identity development was delayed because of their focus on adjusting rather than creating a sense of belonging (Walters &amp; Auton-Cuff, 2009)."&lt;ref name="Limberg, D. 2011"/&gt;

==Psychological effect==

===Identity===
One of the challenges of being a third culture kid during childhood is developing a sense of [[Belongingness|belonging]], commitment, and [[attachment theory|attachment]] to a culture. These factors play a strong role in one's [[self-esteem]] and [[Identity (psychology)|identity]], and are especially apparent as present or not present among TCKs.&lt;ref name="hoersting"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoersting | first1 = R.C. | year = 2010 | title = No place to call home: Cultural homelessness, self-esteem, and cross-cultural identities | url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc10991/| journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 17–30 | doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are psychological benefits to being a bi-culturally competent individual, meaning that adjustment to the host culture and [[repatriation]] do not pose a difficulty for the individual. Individuals who do not experience this same smooth transition into the new culture are referred to as "culturally rootless" and "cultural homelessness". Culturally homeless (CH) individuals often experience confusion over their identity and especially because the TCK is frequently abroad during the adolescent development years when identity is most solidified psychologically.&lt;ref name="hoersting"/&gt;

When individuals who have spent a significant number of their developmental years in a host culture and have not been able to adapt, develop an identity, and do not feel as though they belong, they are considered "culturally homeless". Cultural homelessness has been found to have both advantages and disadvantages, at times to being associated with low self-esteem, perceiving less control over one's own life, and an unsatisfactory level of experience with belonging and attachment.&lt;ref name="hoersting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hoersting"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism===
TCKs have the unique experience of being exposed to and living in cultures different from their home culture for extended periods of time. Based on only one source, this has been found to affect their level of [[authoritarian personality|authoritarianism]], both positively and negatively depending on the circumstance of the TCK. Within the context of the methodology and subjects selected in the study, authoritarianism measurements were used by the researchers on individuals, and high scores on the [[right-wing authoritarianism|right-wing authoritarian]] scale (RWA) have been found to possess the following three personality characteristics: a tendency to submit themselves to [[authority]] figures, a willingness to commit an act of aggression for the sake of this authority or authorities, and possessing significant concern with acting according to the rules and norms of their group.&lt;ref name="peterson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = B.E. | last2 = Plamondon | first2 = L.T. | year = 2009 | title = Third culture kids and the consequence of international sojourns on authoritarianism, acculturative balance, and positive affect | doi = 10.1016/j.jrp.2009.04.014 | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 755–763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Though research initially largely focused on children in missionary families or children of [[diplomat]]s, it has since expanded to other populations, including non-U.S. citizens. The researchers who pioneered the TCK research, such as Ruth Useem, were not expecting to find as many participants as they did. Useem and Cottrell, for example, were seeking at least 100 participants to respond to a survey that they believed to be "unconsciously long" but instead had 680 participants (ranging in age from 25–84 years) respond to the [[questionnaire]]. Instances like this one indicate to researchers the potential in exploring a subject matter that is still open to much research.&lt;ref name="bonebright"/&gt;

===Increased tolerance===
From the research that has been conducted on TCKs, it has been found that subjects are generally more [[tolerant]] of different cultures and of people of different backgrounds than subjects from the same home country who are not TCKs. In addition, TCKs generally feel that they are better able to adapt to new cultures and understand how to behave appropriately in these new environments.&lt;ref name="sheard"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheard | first1 = W | year = 2008 | title = Lessons from our kissing cousins: Third culture kids and gifted children | url = | journal = Roeper Review: A Journal on Gifted Education | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 31–38 | doi=10.1080/02783190701836437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher and teacher Wenda Sheard surveyed some of her multi-cultural students, most of whom were either [[fluency|fluent]] in two or more languages, and found that many felt that they had an increased tolerance of other cultures. However, as one student explained, part of this tolerance was out of necessity for maintaining a healthy social life in one's new environment and culture.&lt;ref name="sheard" /&gt;
 
In a study by Dewaele and van Oudenhoven (2009), it was found that TCKs scored higher on the open-mindedness scale on the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ). According to the study, "this dimension [of the test] evaluates for open and unprejudiced attitudes toward out-group members, as well as diverse cultural norms and values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dewaele | first1 = J.M. | last2 = van Oudenhoven | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = The effect of multilingualism/multiculturalism on personality: no gain without pain for third culture kids? | url = | journal = International Journal of Multilingualism | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 443–459 | doi=10.1080/14790710903039906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual effect===
Though the intellectual effect of being a TCK has not yet been widely explored, there has been some research in the area. One particular study by Lee and Bain (2007) that was found to have significant findings was conducted on young native [[Koreans]] who had recently moved to the United States and were attending school in America. The researchers were looking to see how these students would respond to explicit instruction aimed to work with their [[originality]] and [[fluency]] and that is specific to TCKs. This was measured through the level of [[creativity]] demonstrated in assigned tasks given to the students. TCKs were found to be able to demonstrate significantly higher levels of creativity and originality for [[problem solving]] than TCKs not given this same explicit instruction. This study has implications for the ways that TCKs can be instructed differently from the traditional [[curriculum]] to enhance their creativity and problem solving abilities because of their third culture experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Y.J. | last2 = Bain | first2 = S.K. | last3 = McCallum | first3 = R.S. | year = 2007 | title = Improving creative problem-solving in a sample of third culture kids | url = | journal = School Psychology International | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 449–463 | doi = 10.1177/0143034307084135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual effect is also possible through differences in choosing to continue studies in [[higher education]] after high school. In 2001, it was found by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]] that 61.7 percent of 2001 high school graduates were enrolled in college. That same year, it was found that 95 percent of the TCK population were either enrolled or had some college education. Twenty-nine percent of this population had received an advanced degree, which is also higher than the percentage of the general population.&lt;ref name="bonebright"/&gt;

===Gender differences===
Much of the literature and research surrounding TCKs has found that these individuals are more open to learning new languages, demonstrate more flexibility when interacting with a novel culture than their monoculture peers, and a greater interest in continuing a global nomad lifestyle, which includes an interest in international careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerner | first1 = M | year = 1993 | title = A profile of an American international school | url = | journal = Global Nomad Quarterly | volume = 2 | issue = 1| page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that women are more inclined to seek out [[interpersonal relationships]] while men are more task-oriented in their relationships and choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cann | first1 = A. | last2 = Siegfried | first2 = W. D. | year = 1990 | title = Gender stereotypes and dimensions of effective leader behavior | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 23 | issue = 7–8| pages = 413–419 | doi=10.1007/bf00289229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such findings were used in the hypothesis of a study conducted by Gerner &amp; Perry (2000) that predicted that [[gender role|gender differences]] would also be found in the cultural acceptance and experiences of TCKs.&lt;ref name="gerner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerner | first1 = M.E. | last2 = Perry | first2 = F. | year = 2000 | title = Gender differences in cultural acceptance and career orientation among internationally mobile and non-internationally mobile adolescents | url = | journal = School Psychology Review | volume = 29 | issue = | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both non-U.S. citizen females and U.S. citizen females were found to have more positive ratings of cultural acceptance, acquisition or exposure to a new language, travel, and interest in going into an international career in the future and were less prone to stereotypes.&lt;ref name="sheard" /&gt;

==Education and counseling==
With the growing number of international business, military placements, and immigration there has been a growing number of TCKs. Third culture kids are being educated in a culture that is not their own. Schools and teachers need to be aware of the culture differences these students face. Studies have found that educators and counselors should be culturally competent and possess the knowledge to properly educate these type of students. This would create an effective and optimal environment for their learning and adjusting abilities. Research conducted on TCKs have  been found to need special attention during their transition phase. The stress and grief students feel during transitional phases can distort their psycho-social development which can affect their grades and school work. Therefore, Third Culture Kid students need a comfortable and inviting school setting to offset the effect of their transition. The best way for counselors to work with TCKs is to have sound knowledge about the students and their unique characteristics.&lt;ref name="Limberg, D. 2011"/&gt;

===Emotions===
An empirical research was done by Katholiki Georgiades, Michael H. Boyle, and Kelly A. Fife over the Emotional and Behavior Problems Among Adolescent Students, in specific immigrant students. They examined the relationship between immigrants and racial/ethnic congruence in school. They hypothesized that school belonging is the connection between the congruency and the emotional problems. Although their study was unable to find enough evidence to support their hypothesis they agree that school belonging will influence emotional behavioral problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Georgiades | first1 = K. | last2 = Boyle | first2 = M. | last3 = Fife | first3 = K. | year = 2003 | title = Emotional and Behavioral Problems Among Adolescent Students: The Role of Immigrant, Racial/Ethnic Congruence and Belongingness in Schools | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 42 | issue = 9| pages = 1473–1492 | pmid = 23192451 | doi=10.1007/s10964-012-9868-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other studies, TCKs are proven to have less emotional stability than those who grew up in more culturally and socially stable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/14790710903039906|pages=443–459|title=The effect of multilingualism/multiculturalism on personality: no gain without pain for Third Culture Kids?|journal=International Journal of Multilingualism|volume=6|issue=4|year = 2009|last1 = Dewaele|first1 = Jean-Marc|last2=Van Oudenhoven|first2=Jan Pieter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers that lead to third culture kids==

===Military===
TCKs who have parents or guardians affiliated with the military have varying levels of exposure to local culture. This is due to the possibility of living on base or off base. TCKs who live off base or who are not closely affiliated with the military (such as contractors) will have higher exposure and cultural shaping, while those who spend the majority of their time on the base will have lower exposure and minimal cultural shaping.&lt;ref name="Pearce2002" /&gt; Military children who are immersed in local culture from birth tend to show an extremely high level of cultural shaping, and upon relocation they are likely to cling to said culture for years, if not their lifetime. Relocation for these particular TCKs has shown to be particularly marring for them emotionally.&lt;ref name=Pearce2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|title=Children's International Relocation and the Development Process, in 'Military Brats and Other Global Nomads', M. Ender, ed.|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|location=Portland|isbn=978-0-275-97266-0|pages=157, 168–170|url=http://www.transition-dynamics.com/milbrats.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See also [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)]].

===Non-military government===
Some of these TCKs may grow up moving from country to country in the diplomatic corps (see [[Foreign Service Brat]]) while others may live their lives near military bases.&lt;ref name = "sponsor" /&gt;

===Religious===
[[Missionary Kids]] (MKs) typically spend the most time overseas, of any TCKs, in one country. 85% of MKs spend more than 10 years in foreign countries and 72% lived in only one foreign country. Of all TCKs, MKs generally have the most interaction with the local populace and the least interaction with people from their passport country. They are also the most likely of the TCKs to integrate themselves into the local culture.&lt;ref name = "sponsor"&gt;Cotrell (2002) p 231{{Full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  83% of missionary kids have at least one parent with an advanced degree.&lt;ref name=Cottrell2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Cottrell|first=Ann|title=Educational and Occupational Choices of American Adult Third Culture Kids, in 'Military Brats and Other Global Nomads', M. Ender, ed.|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-275-97266-0|url=http://www.transition-dynamics.com/milbrats.html|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Missionary kids struggle adjusting to the parents culture; the majority of MKs identify mostly with the country in which their parents served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bikos|first=L.H.|author2=Kocheleva, J. |author3=King, D. |author4=Chang, G.C. |author5=McKenzie, A. |author6=Roenicke, C. |author7=Eckard, K. |title=A consensual qualitative investigation into the repatriation experiences of young adult, missionary kids|journal=Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture|year=2009|volume=7|issue=7|series=12|pages=735–754|doi=10.1080/13674670903032637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Preacher's kid|Priests' Kids (PKs) or Pastor's Kids]] are sometimes considered TCKs because they, like military brats, grow up moving from place to place regularly, but are sometimes excluded because they do not often grow up outside their passport country.

===Business===
Another career that can lead to TCKs is a career in business. Sixty-three percent of business TCKs have lived in foreign countries at least 10 years but are more likely than children in missionary families to live in multiple countries.  Business TCKs have fairly high interaction with both their host nationals and people from their host country.&lt;ref name = "sponsor" /&gt;

===Other===
Not all TCK families have one of the fours careers listed above. Other careers include working for an intergovernmental agency (for example, the [[Nuclear Energy Agency]], the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie#Intergovernmental agency|International Agency of the Francophonie]]), an international non-governmental organization (for example, an international school or serving as international staff of the United Nations or one of their agencies), and a local organization such as a [[hospital]]. Working in media and/or athletic industries (for example, [[Wally Szczerbiak]]) can also mean being moved abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2002) p 227.{{Full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the other careers that send employees abroad, involvement with the host culture can vary greatly.&lt;ref name = "sponsor" /&gt;

Recent research into the 'other' category has identified a subgroup of TCKs now labelled EdKids. These are children who relocate to various countries with their parents who are educators in the international schools.  This creates a unique paradigm of a nuclear family whose family-work-school-social experiences are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Zilber, E. (2009). Third Culture Kids: Children of International School Educators. London: John Catt Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career decisions==

===Effect on the workforce===
Third culture kids, with their international experience, generally value the international aspect of their lives. In a [[survey methodology|survey]] given to TCKs in 2001, there was a strong interest among TCK participants to continue to travel as they move into adulthood and their future careers, and many continued to maintain their internationally acquired languages. It was also found in these surveys that approximately half of the participants continue to travel at least once a year and that just a little under 15 percent travel for business.&lt;ref name="bonebright"/&gt; TCKs have also been found to report selecting to study majors while in college that could have the options of having international careers. Some of these fields of study include business, [[nursing]], and [[teaching English as a foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell, A.B. (2002).

==Language and third culture kids==
[[File:Languages world map.svg|thumb|A map of the world's major language families.]]
Most international TCKs are expected to speak English and some countries require their expatriate families to be proficient with the English language.&lt;ref name="Pearce2002"/&gt; This is largely because most international schools use the English language as the norm.&lt;ref name=Pearce2002 /&gt;

Families tend to seek out schools whose principal languages they share, and ideally one which mirrors their own educational system. Many countries have American schools, French schools, British schools, German Schools and 'International Schools' which often follow one of the three [[International Baccalaureate]] programs. These will be populated by [[expatriate]]s' children and some children of the local upper middle class. They do this in an effort to maintain linguistic stability and to ensure that their children do not fall behind due to linguistic problems. Where their own language is not available, families will often choose English-speaking schools for their children. They do this because of the linguistic and cultural opportunities being immersed in English might provide their children when they are adults, and because their children are more likely to have prior exposure to English than to other international languages. This poses the potential for non-English speaking TCKs to have a significantly different experience from TCKs for whom English is a native language.&lt;ref name=Hylmo&gt;{{cite book|last=Hylmö|first=Annika|title=Other Expatriate Adolescents: A Postmodern Approach to Understanding Expatriate Adolescents Among Non-U.S. Children, in 'Military Brats and Other Global Nomads', M. Ender, ed.|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|location=Portland|isbn=978-0-275-97266-0|pages= 196, 201|url=http://www.transition-dynamics.com/milbrats.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on TCKs from Japan, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the United States and Africa has shown that TCKs from different countries share more in common with other TCKs than they do with their own peer group from their passport country.&lt;ref name=Hylmo /&gt;

A few sociologists studying TCKs, however, argue that the commonality found in international TCKs is not the result of true commonality, but rather the researcher's bias projecting expectations upon the studied subculture. They believe that some of the superficial attributes may mirror each other, but that TCKs from different countries are really different from one another.&lt;ref name=Hylmo /&gt; The exteriors may be the same, but that the understanding of the world around them differs.&lt;ref name=Pearce2002 /&gt;

===Kikokushijo===
In Japan, the use of the term "third culture kids" to refer to children returned from living overseas is not universally accepted; they are typically referred to both in Japanese and in English as ''[[kikokushijo]]'', literally "returnee children", a term which has different implications. Public awareness of ''kikokushijo'' is much more widespread in Japan than awareness of TCKs in the United States, and government reports as early as 1966 recognised the need for the school system to adapt to them. However, views of ''kikokushijo'' have not always been positive; in the 1970s, especially, they were characterised in media reports and even by their own parents as "educational orphans" in need of "rescue" to reduce their foreignness and successfully reintegrate them into Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kano Podolsky|first=Momo|title=Crosscultural upbringing: A comparison of the "third culture kids" framework and "Kaigai/Kikokushijo" studies|journal=Gendai Shakai Kenkyū|volume=6|pages=67–78|url=http://www.cs.kyoto-wu.ac.jp/bulletin/6/kanou.pdf|format=PDF|date=2004-01-31|accessdate=2007-11-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306105426/http://www.cs.kyoto-wu.ac.jp/bulletin/6/kanou.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;nCottrell, Ann Baker (2011).

==Statistics (U.S. TCKs)==
Research has been done on American TCKs to identify various characteristics:&lt;ref name=McCaig1994&gt;McCaig NM (1994).

''International Schools Services''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive and emotional development===
* Teenage TCKs are more mature than non-TCKs, but in their twenties take longer than their peers to focus their aims.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1993b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottrell | first1 = AB | last2 = Useem | first2 = RH | year = 1993 | title = TCKs Experience Prolonged Adolescence | url = http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art3.html | journal = International Schools Services | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Depression is comparatively prevalent among TCKs.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1993b" /&gt;
* TCKs' sense of identity and well-being is directly and negatively affected by repatriation.&lt;ref name=Plamondon2008&gt;Plamondon, Laila (2008). Third Culture Kids: Factors that Predict Psychological Health after Repatriation. Honors Thesis, Smith College.&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of the effect from repatriation may also depend on the degree of cultural and linguistic differences between the TCK's place of recent residence and place of repatriation (e.g. relocating from London to Sydney vs London to Seoul for a Korean individual that spent most of his/her childhood away from Korea in a Western environment).  
* TCKs are highly linguistically adept (not as true for military TCKs).&lt;ref name=Cottrell1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottrell | first1 = AB | last2 = Useem | first2 = RH | year = 1994 | title = ATCKs maintain global dimensions throughout their lives | url = http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art5.html | journal = International Schools Services | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edited Carolyn Smith, Alethia Publications: New York. 1996. pp&amp;nbsp;88–90&lt;/ref&gt;
*Like all children, TCKs may experience [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and even [[grief]] from the [[Relocation (personal)|relocation]] experience.&lt;ref name="NITLC Brief Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlcinst.org/Moving.html|title=Moving Can Become Traumatic|last=Sheppard|first=Caroline H.|author2=William Steele |year=2003|work=Trauma and Loss: Research and Interventions|publisher=Nat'l Inst for Trauma and Loss in Children|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iowa State University paper by Lesia Oesterreich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1529G.pdf|title=Understanding children: moving to a new home|last=Oesterreich|first=Lesia|date=April 2004|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and career===
* TCKs are 4 times as likely as non-TCKs to earn a bachelor's degree (81% vs 21%)&lt;ref name=Cottrell1993a&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottrell | first1 = AB | last2 = Useem | first2 = RH | year = 1993 | title = TCKs Four Times More Likely to Earn Bachelor's Degrees | url = http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art2.html | journal = International Schools Services | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 44 percent earned undergraduate degree after the age of 22.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1994" /&gt;

{{Conservation status}}
'''Threatened species''' are any species (including [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], etc.) which are vulnerable to [[Species endangerment|endangerment]] in the near future.  Species that are threatened are sometimes characterised by the [[population dynamics]] measure of ''[[critical depensation]]'', a mathematical measure of [[biomass]] related to [[population growth rate]]. This quantitative metric is one method of evaluating the degree of endangerment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liermann|first=Martin|year=2001|title=Depensation: evidence, models and implications|url=http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/LiermannM_2001_FishFish.pdf|journal=Fish and Fisheries|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==IUCN definition==
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) is the foremost authority on threatened species, and treats threatened species not as a single category, but as a group of three categories, depending on the degree to which they are threatened:

*[[Vulnerable species]]
*[[Endangered species]]
*[[Critically endangered species]]

Less-than-threatened categories are [[near threatened]], [[least concern]], and the no longer assigned category of [[conservation dependent]]. Species which have not been evaluated (NE), or do not have sufficient data ([[data deficient]]) also are not considered "threatened" by the IUCN.

[[File:Status iucn3.1 threatened.svg|thumb|left|The three categories of the threatened species [[IUCN Red List]].]]

Although ''threatened'' and ''vulnerable'' may be used interchangeably when discussing IUCN categories, the term ''threatened'' is generally used to refer to the three categories (critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable), while ''vulnerable'' is used to refer to the least at risk of those three categories. They may be used interchangeably in most contexts however, as all vulnerable species are threatened species (''vulnerable'' is a category of ''threatened species''); and, as the more at-risk categories of threatened species (namely ''endangered'' and ''critically endangered'') must, by definition, also qualify as vulnerable species, all threatened species may also be considered vulnerable.

Threatened species are also referred to as a [[red-listed]] species, as they are listed in the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].

[[Subspecies]], populations and stocks may also be classified as threatened.

==United States definition==
[[File:Status ESA LT.svg|left|thumb|"Threatened" in relation to "endangered" under the [[Endangered Species Act|ESA]].]]

Under the [[Endangered Species Act]] in the United States, "threatened" is defined as "any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-3.html|title=Endangered Species Program - Laws &amp; Policies - Endangered Species Act - Section 3 Definitions|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Endangered Species|last=Program|date=|website=www.fws.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429155642/https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-3.html|archivedate=29 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the less protected of the two protected categories. The [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] (''Euphydryas editha bayensis'') is an example of a threatened subspecies protected under the ESA.

Within the U.S., state wildlife agencies have the authority under the ESA to manage species which are considered endangered or threatened within their state but not within all states, and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species.  For example, the [[trumpeter swan]] (''Cygnus buccinator'') is threatened in the state of [[Minnesota]], while large populations still remain in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf|title=Minnesota Endangered &amp; Threatened Species List|author=|date=|website=state.mn.us|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519114000/http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf|archivedate=19 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

==Australian definition==
The Commonwealth of Australia has legislation for categorising and protecting endangered species, namely the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]], which is known in short as the EPBC Act.  This act has six categories;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species.html#categories Threatened species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221072705/http://environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species.html |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extinct, extinct in the wild, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, and conservation dependent, defined in Section 179 of the act, and could be summarised as;
*"Extinct" - "no reasonable doubt that the last member of the species has died",
*"Extinct in the wild" - "known only to survive in cultivation" and "despite exhaustive surveys" has not been seen in the wild,
*"Critically endangered" - "extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future",
*"Endangered" - "very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future",
*"Vulnerable" - "high risk of extinction in the wild in medium-term future", and
*"Conservation dependent" - "focus of a specific conservation program" without which the species would enter one of the above categories.

The EPBC Act also recognises and protects threatened ecosystems such as plant communities, and [[Ramsar Convention]] wetlands used by migratory birds.

Individual states and territories of Australia are bound under the EPBC Act, but may also have legislation which gives further protection to certain species, for example Western Australia's [[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950]].  Some species, such as [[Lewin's rail]] (''Lewinia pectoralis''), are not listed as threatened species under the EPBC Act, but they may be recognised as threatened by individual states or territories.
===NSW Definition===
====Threatening Processes====
Pests and weeds, climate change and habitat loss are some of the key threatening processes facing native plants and animals [http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/threatened-species/about-threatened-species/key-threatening-processes listed by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage.]

'''Time's Up''' 
is an interactive media and machine art group from Linz, Austria. Founded in 1996, the group has developed  [[Interactive art|interactive media]] and mechanical art works exhibited throughout Europe and Australasia.

Time's Up runs [[Dorkbot]] Linz and is  involved in the [[Wireless community network|Funkfeuer]] community, the local artists "Freie Szene" and educational institutions.

==Work Series==
Time's Up has shown a large number of works as individual objects and as complete environments internationally. The exhibitions fall into four main phases:
*  Hyperfitness Studio (1997-2004), media machines for the whole body&lt;ref&gt;Arnd Wesemann, "Die Zeit ist um", Frankfurter Rundschau 18.09.1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerfried Stocker und Christine Schöpf, "FleshFactor: Informationsmaschine Mensch", Springer Wien, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Spherical Projection Interface SPIN (2000-2006), premiered at the Ars Electronics Festival 2000&lt;ref&gt;Gerfried Stocker und Christine Schöpf, "Next Sex:

* Since 2007 main works have been around narrative and living environments.&lt;ref&gt;Basis Wien Arts Archive: http://www.basis-wien.at/cgi-bin/browse.pl?t=fipo.tpl&amp;fipoid=53829&lt;/ref&gt;


The group has been involved in an extensive network of European projects, working closely with groups such as [[Foam_(organization)|FoAM]], [[Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute| M-ITI]] and ATOL &lt;ref&gt;Entangled, Chris Salter, MIT Books, 2010. https://books.google.at/books?id=ZBJbIP0fMr0C&amp;dq=Entangled:+Technology+and+the+Transformation+of+Performance&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Matt Heckert]] worked closely with the group in the first year, members of the group have worked closely with [[Chico MacMurtrie]] within the Amorphic Robot Works.


==Publications==
The Anchortronic series of residencies culminated in the release of the same named DVD on the Dutch-German label [[Staalplaat]].&lt;ref&gt;Reviews: http://industrial.org/news.php?t=15833, {{cite web |url=http://boomkat.com/dvds/9786-various-anchortronic-5-1-laboratory-for-updating-experimental-sound |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708011317/http://boomkat.com/dvds/9786-various-anchortronic-5-1-laboratory-for-updating-experimental-sound |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book "PARN: Physical and Alternate Reality Narratives" was published in 2012 at the end of the project with the same name. 
The books "Futurish" and "Turtles and Dragons" were created using the [[book sprint]] methodology and published in short runs on demand.

In the system of [[Aristotelian logic]], the '''triangle of opposition''' is a diagram representing the different ways in which each of the three propositions of the system is logically related ('opposed') to each of the others. The system is also useful in the analysis of syllogistic logic, serving to identify the allowed logical conversions from one type to another.

==Origin==

Vulgar auteurism derives its name&lt;ref name=brody /&gt; from the [[auteur theory]], a key component of [[film criticism]] which posits that the director is the author ("auteur") of a film and that films should be analyzed in terms of how they fit into a director's larger body of work.&lt;ref name=brody /&gt; Also known as "auteurism," the auteur theory was introduced by French critics associated with the film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' during the 1950s and popularized in the [[United States]] in the 1960s by [[Andrew Sarris]].&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;

Several critics, including Richard Brody of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', have drawn parallels between the earliest French and American proponents of the auteur theory and vulgar auteurism.&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=brody /&gt; However, many commentators on the movement consider vulgar auteurism to be distinct from the classical auteur theory, pointing to its concern with visual style over theme.&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; The question of whether vulgar auteurism is a legitimate separate movement or a subset of the auteur theory remains a source of controversy in the [[film critic]] community.&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;
According to film critic Peter Labuza, vulgar auteurism "seems to have been an unconscious movement before it ever had a name."&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; The earliest criticism identified as exhibiting "vulgar auteurism" was published in the Canadian film magazine ''Cinema Scope'' in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; ''Cinema Scope'' writer Andrew Tracy coined the term&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; in his 2009 article, "Vulgar Auteurism: The Case of Michael Mann".&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; Initially pejorative,&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; the term was repurposed by [[Mubi (website)|Mubi]] user John Lehtonen.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; In the early-going, the theory was explored not through text, but through images via a [[Tumblr]] simply entitled "Vulgar Auteurism",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://vulgarauteurism.tumblr.com/ Vulgar Auteurism]"&lt;/ref&gt; spearheaded by Lehtonen and filmmaker Kurt Walker, with contributions from Mubi critics Adam Cook and Daniel Kasman. Over the years which followed, Mubi's online film magazine began to publish more and more articles defending genres and directors which were unpopular with the critical mainstream.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; 

Vulgar auteurist ideas gained currency&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; when one of the movement's leading proponents,&lt;ref name=patches /&gt; critic [[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]], became the co-host of the television program ''[[Ebert Presents: At the Movies]]'', produced by [[Roger Ebert]]. However, while "vulgar auteurist" criticism was becoming popular, the term and the movement to which it corresponded remained obscure until the publication of an article by Calum Marsh, "Fast &amp; Furious &amp; Elegant: Justin Lin and the Vulgar Auteurs", in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' on May 24, 2013.&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;&lt;ref name=singer /&gt;&lt;ref name=kenigsberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenigsberg|first=Ben|title=From the Wire: Pinkerton's Notes on Vulgar Auteurism|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/from-the-wire-pinkertons-notes-on-vulgar-auteurism|publisher=Indiewire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===

Marsh's article was immediately controversial.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;&lt;ref name=singer /&gt; While some took issue with the films and filmmakers being championed by the proponents of vulgar auteurism,&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt; others took issue with the idea that vulgar auteurism was a movement distinct from the auteur theory.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;

One of the most vocal opponents of vulgar auteurism is former ''Village Voice'' critic Nick Pinkerton,&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=singer /&gt; 
&lt;ref name=kenigsberg /&gt; who has written essays in praise of directors championed by the movement&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt; and whose 2012 article "The Bigger and Better Mousetraps of [[Paul W.S. Anderson]]" has been described as vulgar auteurist.&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt; Writing in his SundanceNow column following the publication of Marsh's article, Pinkerton described vulgar auteurism as "a shameless attention grab",&lt;ref name=pinkerton&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinkerton|first=Nick|title=BOMBAST #96|url=http://blog.sundancenow.com/weekly-columns/bombast-96|publisher=SundanceNow|access-date=2014-02-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302090231/http://blog.sundancenow.com/weekly-columns/bombast-96|archive-date=2014-03-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding: "Even more galling is the assumed attitude that the VA position stands alone against a vast, unsympathetic critical conspiracy to marginalize and underrate the products of industrial filmmaking. [...] The numbers, meanwhile, do not bear out claims of a highbrow conspiracy: ''[[Fast &amp; Furious 6]]'', which we’re assured is scorned by critics the world over, currently stands at 61% at [[Metacritic]], above ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'' (54%), and within striking distance of arty jazz like ''[[Simon Killer]]'' and ''[[Post Tenebras Lux (film)|Post Tenebras Lux]]''."&lt;ref name=pinkerton /&gt;
