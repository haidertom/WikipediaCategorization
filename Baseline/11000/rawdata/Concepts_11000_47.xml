      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47133">The '''2015 Iglesia ni Cristo leadership controversy''' is a dispute between senior  members of the [[Christian denomination]] [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] (INC) in the Philippines. In July 2015, it was reported that the INC had [[Excommunication|expelled]] some of its ministers, along with high-profile members Felix Nathaniel "Angel" and [[Cristina Villanueva Manalo|Cristina "Tenny" Manalo]]. Angel is the brother of current INC Executive Minister [[Eduardo Manalo]] and Tenny is the mother of Eduardo, and widow of former Executive Minister [[Eraño Manalo]].&lt;ref name=supporters&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamil|first1=Jaymee|title=Supporters gather outside home of Manalo matriarch|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707216/supporters-gather-outside-home-of-manalo-matriarch-son#ixzz3gjR4fqaK|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angel and Tenny were expelled from the INC for allegedly "sowing disunity" in the Church. The INC administration released a statement claiming that Eduardo had agreed to the expulsion of his brother and mother from the INC, as decided upon by its overall leadership.&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt; However, both Angel and Tenny claimed their lives were threatened by the Iglesia administration. Angel and Tenny had reportedly been illegally detained at the Iglesia's Central Office Complex in [[Tandang Sora]], [[Quezon City]], and that at least ten ministers of the Church were missing and alleged to have been abducted.&lt;ref name=coverup&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cayabyab|first1=Marc Jayson|title=Manalo kin held to cover up INC scam?|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707184/manalo-kin-held-to-stop-them-from-exposing-inc-mess-minister|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former INC ministers Roel Rosal and Isaias Samson, Jr., claimed that the ''Sanggunián'' (the highest administrative council of the INC) had unlawfully abducted and detained ministers, along with members of the Manalo family, to cover up corruption surrounding the chief auditor, Glicerio "Jun" Santos, Jr.&lt;ref name=Inquirer6&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quismundo|first1=Tarra|title=SuspendedINC minister details detention|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707291/suspended-inc-minister-details-detention|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, 2015, INC, represented by Glicerio B.

==Overview==

===Angel and Tenny Manalo===
On July 22, 2015, a video was uploaded to [[YouTube]] featuring Felix Nathaniel "Angel" Manalo, the brother to nominal INC leader [[Eduardo V. Manalo]] and a former General Manager of GemNet (formerly the TV station of INC, replaced by [[INCTV]]), along with his mother, Cristina "Tenny" Manalo, the widow of Eraño Manalo.&lt;ref name=Youtube&gt;{{cite web|title=Bro EGM's family - Call for help|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSbDN7vEYdw|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, they claimed their lives had been threatened by the Iglesia leadership, along with that of Angel's sister, [[Lottie Hemedez]]. Tenny Manalo also claimed that there had been a mass [[kidnapping]] of ministers who had not been accounted for, implying that their disappearance somehow traced to the INC leadership, and that she had not been able to speak to Eduardo V. Manalo.&lt;ref name=ABS-CBN&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/07/23/15/iglesia-ni-cristo-expel-tenny-manalo-son-angel |title=Iglesia ni Cristo expels Tenny Manalo, son Angel |website=ABS-CBN News |date=1914-07-27 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, INC denies the claims. Bienvenido Santiago, INC's chief evangelist, announced a few hours after the video's release that INC was expelling Cristina "Tenny" Manalo, along with Felix Nathaniel "Angel" Manalo, for allegedly causing divisions in the Church and wanting to seize power.&lt;ref name="Rappler"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Francisco |first1=Katerina  |first2=Chay F. |last2=Hofileña |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100225-iglesia-cristo-manalo-expel-mother-brother |title=Iglesia ni Cristo head expels mother, brother |work=[[Rappler]] |date=23 July 2015 |accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago claimed that their video was a sympathy ploy to gather support to meddle in the leadership of the INC and that the INC administration was acting on the wishes of [[Eduardo V. Manalo]] to prevent discord in the Church. Edwil Zabala, a spokesman for the INC stated that the INC would consider having Tenny and Angel Manalo return to the Church if they would pledge to uphold and obey their teachings.&lt;ref name="Rappler 3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Iglesia ni Cristo head expels mother, brother|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100225-iglesia-cristo-manalo-expel-mother-brother|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Eraño "Marc" Villanueva Manalo and Lolita "Lottie" Manalo Hemedez, the younger siblings of Eduardo and Angel, were also expelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iglesia Ni Cristo announces expulsion of Eduardo Manalo's mother, siblings|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527206/news/nation/watch-iglesia-ni-cristo-announces-expulsion-of-eduardo-manalo-s-mother-siblings|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the response from the INC, an unidentified individual was photographed holding a sign saying "''Tulong'', hostage ''kami''" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''Help, we're [held] hostage'') in a building that is part of the INC Central Office in Tandang Sora, Quezon City. An interview to Angel Manalo later confirmed that it was just a "playing child" who was the promotor of the sign and is nothing serious at all. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sign outside INC building: 'Tulong, hostage kami'|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100237-iglesia-cristo-help-hostage-sign|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When contacted by reporters, INC spokesman Edwil Zabala referred them to a CD recording of Santiago's statement regarding the expulsions.

In a press briefing that same afternoon, Santiago confirmed the expulsions. Santiago said in Tagalog, "Painful as it is to our brother Eduardo Manalo, they have decided to expel those who have been causing division within the Church. That is why in future worship services of the Church of Christ, from this day, the Overall Leadership will let this be known by all of our brothers".&lt;ref name="whereare"&gt;{{cite news | first1=Marc Jayson | last1=Cayabyab | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707189/where-are-the-missing-ministers | title=‘Where are the missing ministers?’ | publisher=Inquirer.net | date=23 July 2015 | accessdate=23 July 2015 | last2=Sauler | first2=Erika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JfCiudadINC9725PhilArenafvf 22.JPG|200px|thumbnail|Angel Manalo has criticized the Church's decision to build the [[Philippine Arena]] and suggested that funds used to build the sports venue could have been used to build more houses of worship.&lt;ref name=hitscorruption/&gt;]]

The [[Philippine National Police]], through its Quezon City Police District (QCPD), sent its personnel to the INC compound on July 23. They were able to contact Angel in the evening, and Angel himself talked to the reporters around 1:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]], denying he was detained and saying that sign pleading for help was done by a child joking around. QCPD Joel Pagdilao said that the police is ruling out case of abduction and described the concerned persons inside as peaceful and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sabillo|first1=Kristine Angeli|title=Police to ensure safety amid INC dispute — Malacañang|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707436/police-to-ensure-safety-amid-inc-dispute-malacanang|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer.net|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Cops rule out abduction in Iglesia compound|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100298-iglesia-cristo-police-tandang-sora-compound?cp_rap_source=ymlScrolly|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angel Manalo also spoke to the reporters and criticized the Church's Sanggunian, denied that he is challenging the leadership of his brother, [[Eduardo Manalo]]. He also advised his brother Eduardo against trusting people within the Sanggunian he alleged to be corrupt. He also criticized the decision's to build the [[Philippine Arena]] instead of more houses of worship. He lamented the situation that his Church is facing saying in Tagalog, "Why is it that these days, there are many anomalies? Others might say we're challenging our brother. No, we love our brother. But our problem is with people around him." He added "The doctrine of the Iglesia ni Cristo is now damaged. In the same way that you looked up to us before, now you can see there are many anomalies. There are many acts of corruption in the Church. That's what we want to avoid" &lt;ref name=hitscorruption&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Manalo brother hits Iglesia ni Cristo 'corruption'|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100304-manalo-brother-iglesia-cristo-corruption|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2015, church guards prevented Manalo and his housekeepers from allowing members of the media to enter their ancestral house in Tandang Sora, following the inspection of the sheriff of the Quezon City RTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/747894/angel-manalo-protests-illegal-fencing-off-of-inc-manalo-compound|title=Angel Manalo protests ‘illegal’ fencing off of Iglesia family compound|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|last=Sauler|first=Erika|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court inspection  was requested by church officials in order to identify the occupants of property, following reports that unknown masked and hooded persons were going in and out of the compound which is right beside the INC central office, as well as in response to several ex-Marines who tried to go inside the INC Compound, led by renegade soldier Capt. Nicanor Faeldon, and who were only stopped by INC security. INC spokesman Zabala also claimed that the #36 TS property was owned by INC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journal.com.ph/news/top-stories/inc-cleared|title=INC cleared|publisher=Journal Online|last=Gutierrez|first=Paul M.|date=17 December 2015|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angel Manalo also protested the construction of the high fences in the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rappler.com/nation/116062-angel-manalo-eduardo-manalo-barriers-tandang-sora-residence|title=Angel Manalo to brother Eduardo: Stop building barriers in 36 Tandang Sora|publisher=Rappler|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Quezon City RTC branch 22 ordered INC to restore the electricity supply of the compound, remove and dismantle the blocking fences, and remove the guardhouse and portalet that blocked the vehicle gate #3 of the Manalo's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/116116-court-iglesia-blockade-electricity-manalo-tandang-sora|title=Court to INC: Remove blockade, restore power at Tandang Sora|publisher=Rappler|last=Cepeda|first=Mara|date=17 December 2015|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INC planned to file an ejectment case against Manalo and Hemedez if the siblings refused to leave their residence in Tandang Sora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politics.com.ph/walang-kapatid-kapatid-inc-files-ejectment-case-vs-expelled-manalos/|title=Walang kapatid, kapatid: INC to file ejectment case vs. expelled Manalos|publisher=Politiko|date=January 15, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On her part, Manalo-Hemedez said that she is the real owner of the #36 Tandang Sora compound, having been owned the property since 1983. She maintained that she and her household would not leave the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/119209-lottie-iglesia-ni-cristo-erano-manalo|title=Lottie Manalo to Iglesia: We are heirs of 'God's Messenger'|publisher=''[[Rappler]]''|last=Francisco|first=Katarina|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidential aspirant [[Roy Señeres]] visited the compound in January 2016. Guards barred Señeres from entering and refused to let him provide the occupants with food and bottled water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Señeres dinedma ng Manalo family|publisher=''Inquirer Bandera''|date=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministers===
That same day, allegations from former and current INC ministers claimed that the Manalo family were hostages. Roel Rosal, a former Iglesia ni Cristo minister who stated that he and his wife were expelled from the church for trying to expose corruption,&lt;ref name=Inquirer4&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cayabyab|first1=Marc Jayson|title=Manalo kin held to cover up INC scam?|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707184/manalo-kin-held-to-stop-them-from-exposing-inc-mess-minister#ixzz3ghmIkmLc|website=Inquirer.net|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; made a public statement that ten ministers along with the Manalos were under house arrest at the INC Central Office, at the behest of INC auditor general Glicerio B. "Jun" Santos, Jr. in order to prevent the revelation of financial corruption by Santos and his staff. Rosal claims that Santos has pilfered and misused church offerings, and is holding the Manalos for "revenge."&lt;ref name=Inquirer2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cayabyab|first1=Marc Jayson|title=Manalo kin held to cover up INC scam?|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707184/manalo-kin-held-to-stop-them-from-exposing-inc-mess-minister#ixzz3ghmIkmLc|website=Inquirer|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Tenny and Angel Manalo gathered outside the compound demanding to know the whereabouts of the Manalos and missing ministers. [[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News]] reported that they saw an individual resembling Angel Manalo inside of the house, along with guards wielding long firearms.&lt;ref name=GMANews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Medina|first1=Andrei|title=Ka Angel, Ka Tenny’s supporters gather outside Manalo compound |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527318/news/nation/ka-angel-ka-tenny-s-supporters-gather-outside-manalo-compound |publisher=GMA News Online |accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dasmariñas jf9441 13.JPG|thumbnail|[[Dasmariñas]] the city where INC minister Menorca was reported to have been arrested.]]
At least ten ministers are reported to be missing according to expelled minister Roel Rosal.&lt;ref name=coverup/&gt; One of the reported ministers, Lowell Menorca II was reported to be arrested by the [[Philippine National Police]] in [[Dasmariñas]] after two construction workers were allegedly threatened by Menorca with a grenade. Menorca's lawyer, Allen Blair Boy from the New Era University Legal Aid, questioned whether he was abducted and Boy said that Menorca told him that he was indeed arrested. It is not clear why he was in Dasmariñas, because Menorca is based in [[Sorsogon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Allegedly abducted Iglesia minister nabbed by Dasmariñas PNP|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527330/news/nation/allegedly-abducted-iglesia-minister-nabbed-by-dasmarinas-pnp|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2015, Rosal reiterated his claims against the INC leadership. He also stated that the Quezon City Police were taking sides in the conflict by supporting the INC administration, and denying Angel and Tenny Manalo deliveries of food and water. Rosal also claimed that the captives in the Manalo compound were running out of food and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Araja|first1=Rio N.|title=QC cops hit for INC bias|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2015/07/29/qc-cops-hit-for-inc-bias/|website=Manila Standard|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference held July 23, INC minister Isaias Samson, Jr. cited Menorca's case alleging that the military had taken him from Sorsogon to Dasmariñas. He said that the missing ministers were held in Rosalia Compound and Caringal in Quezon City.&lt;ref name=govint/&gt;

Arnel Tumanan,&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt; Joven Sepillo of [[Tacloban]], and Nolan Olarte of [[Cebu]] are among the other reported missing ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meruenas|first1=Mark|title=DOJ steps in, orders NBI to probe ‘abduction’ of Iglesia ni Cristo ministers|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527722/news/nation/doj-steps-in-orders-nbi-to-probe-abduction-of-iglesia-ni-cristo-ministers|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INC, thru attorney Serafin Cuevas, Jr., had also filed [[libel]] charges against Samson and Joy Yuson, former administrative coordinator of GEM TV,  then the TV arm of INC, for accusing INC and its Sanggunian members of involvement in various anomalies and alleged abductions of ministers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chavez|first1=Chito|title=INC files libel charges vs expelled minister|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/inc-files-libel-charges-vs-expelled-minister/|publisher=''Manila Bulletin''|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; preliminary investigations for the said case started on September 16, 2015 at the Quezon City RTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Former Iglesia minister appears in court over libel complaint|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/106102-iglesia-ni-cristo-isaias-samson-libel-preliminary-investigation|publisher=''Rappler''|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menorca released a video on October 23, 2015, a few days after he was allegedly rescued from abduction by the Sanggunian and the filing of writ of ''habeas corpus'' by his brother Anthony and sister-in-law Jungko Azuka. In it he supported the claim that he was abducted and illegally detained from July 25-October 21 in the Central Compound together with his wife, children  and housekeeper, and orchestrated by the Sanggunian. He further claimed that he and his family never asked to the Church to give them a house, or to be put into protective custody. The supposed rescue of the Menorca Family was first supported by attorney Trixie Cruz-Angeles, the lawyer of the INC's expelled ministers, including Jun Samson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/734041/ex-iglesia-ni-cristo-minister-lowell-menorca-confirms-abduction|title=Ex-Iglesia ni Cristo minister Lowell Menorca confirms abduction|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|first=Yuji Vincent|last=Gonzales|date=2015-10-23|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the alleged illegal detention they claimed to have not been allowed to leave the premises nor had the right to accept guests. Cellphones and gadgets were also said to not be allowed in the premises. After the video was uploaded, INC expelled him and his family. The expulsion papers was signed by minister Radel Cortez.&lt;ref name=

===Isaias Samson, Jr.===
Isaias Samson, Jr., was a second-generation INC minister, former Sanggunian member and head of Foreign Department. He had been demoted due to some cases in his department to be an editor of INC's ''Pasugo'' magazine (a section of INC's Evangelism Department) and part of the Philippine government's Official Prayer Day and regular minister during prayers in SONA. He held a press conference on July 23 confirming his own detention, stating that he and his family were placed under house arrest by the INC administration, with the involvement of military and police officials. Samson stated that he was detained because of his opposition to Santos and gave a rough estimate of the amount of fund misused by Santos as in the "millions" of pesos, but he gave no evidence. Samson also stated that communication from the outside world was cut off and that passports, computers, phones and other electronic devices were confiscated. He was accused by INC leadership of being "Antonio Ebangelista," a pseudonym used by a minister who had written critical articles that reveal details on Church administration and Santos, a charge Samson denies. Samson and his family escaped by telling the guards they wanted to go to church service. Samson described his imprisonment as "unlawful detention," and called some in the INC administration "dishonest," but stated that he retained his faith in the INC.&lt;ref name="Inquirer6"/&gt; Samson later claimed corruption within the INC leadership regarding misuse of funds, such as in the "Lingap sa Mamamayan" fund, use of private planes and oil business. On July 25, 2015, INC spokesman Edwil Zabala stated that Samson and his family were expelled from the church for refusing to submit to authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former ‘Pasugo’ editor expelled from Iglesia Ni Cristo|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527642/news/nation/former-pasugo-editor-expelled-from-iglesia-ni-cristo|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samson was replaced by Dennis C. Lovendino, a minister who became the new editor of ''Pasugo'' as of the June 2015 issue.

In a separate interview with [[CNN Philippines]], INC Spokesperson Zabala said that the so-called house arrest of the family of Samson, Jr. was a disciplinary act within the Church (preventive  suspension) in which Samson was under investigation, due to his connection to the group in social media that was claiming corruption issues inside the church.

In November 17, the Department of Justice dismissed the criminal raps filed by Samson and fellow expelled member Lito de Luna Fruto against the INC leaders for lack of [[probable cause]]. Both Samson and Fruto accused INC of holding them against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/17/15/doj-junks-criminal-raps-vs-iglesia-execs|title=DOJ junks criminal raps vs Iglesia execs|last=Reformina|first=Ina|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=2015-11-17|accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
On July 24, 2015, the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] ordered the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] (NBI) to investigate allegations of abduction of INC members. However it added that it would not interfere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Francisco |first1=Katerina |title=DOJ orders probe into Iglesia ni Cristo 'abduction' |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100344-doj-probe-iglesia-cristo-abduction |accessdate=24 July 2015 |publisher=Rappler |date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Loyola |first1=Jun |title=VIDEO &amp;#124; DOJ orders probe of INC 'detentions, abductions' but Angel Manalo snubs NBI team |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/114814/video--doj-orders-probe-of-inc-detentions-abductions-but-angel-manalo-snubs-nbi-team |accessdate=July 27, 2015 |publisher=News5 Interaksyon |date=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, 2015, in a statement by Manuel Eduarte, chief of the NBI Anti-Organized Transnational Crime Division, said that the NBI concluded that insufficient evidence showed that the Iglesia ni Cristo abducted some of its ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NBI on Iglesia ni Cristo 'abduction': Case closed |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100695-nbi-iglesia-ni-cristo-abduction-case-closed |accessdate=27 July 2015 |publisher=Rappler |date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on July 29, 2015, Former Justice department secretary (now Senator) [[Leila de Lima]] clarified that the case had not been closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meruenas|first1=Mark|title=De Lima: NBI probe on Iglesia ni Cristo 'abduction' not yet closed|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/530630/news/nation/de-lima-nbi-probe-on-iglesia-ni-cristo-abduction-not-yet-closed|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Vice President [[Jejomar Binay]] criticized de Lima's "unwarranted statements" asserting that the case remained open and noted her statement contradicts the reported findings of NBI Anti-Organized Transnational Crime Division. "By your actuations, you are promoting the image of disunity, discord and even corruption in the INC to its clear prejudice and detriment," Binay said that De Lima must respect the [[separation of church and state]] and "unwarranted interference" from the government in the church must not happen. Binay also describe De Lima's dealings with the Iglesia ni Cristo controversy as similar to what he describes as a "[[Character assassination|policy of demolition]]" targeted towards his own person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VP to de Lima: Stop meddling with INC|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/vp-to-de-lima-stop-meddling-with-inc/207132/|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=The Manila Times|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests in response to the investigation===
{{main article|2015 Iglesia ni Cristo protests}}
On late evening of August 27, about 2,000 Iglesia members led by INC spokesman Edwil Zabala held a vigil outside the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] office and later moved to [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]. The demonstrators protested against the government agency, led by De Lima, for allegedly persecuting their church and called for upholding the [[separation of church and state]]. They also called for the agency to prioritize more important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esmaquel|first1=Paterno II|title=Iglesia ni Cristo rallies flock: ‘Inaapi tayo!’|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/104004-iglesia-ni-cristo-zabala-doj-rally-persecution|accessdate=28 August 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Iglesia ni Cristo===

====Religious leaders====
INC general evangelist Bienvenido Santiago on July 23, 2015, responding to allegations made by the Manalos in a July 22 video, dismissed the accusations that some INC ministers were abducted and claimed that the two were attacking the church to make it appear that it was involved in the abductions. He also added that the video was an attempt to rally support from church members and to distract the church's management. Santiago said that the church's decision to expel the two Manalos was to show that the INC is a religion that follows the teachings of God found in the Bible, not a business.&lt;ref name=whereare/&gt;

In a morning Sunday worship in July 26, INC executive minister Eduardo Manalo repeated that members should strictly follow the church's leadership and rules to attain salvation.&lt;ref name=pdievm&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes-Estrope|first1=Carmela|title=Manalo asks Iglesia ni Cristo members to follow church leadership|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707847/manalo-asks-iglesia-ni-cristo-members-to-follow-church-leadership|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer Central Luzon|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media reported that an INC member said that provincial ministers issued a set of ''tagubilin'' (instructions) towards the church's members during the weekend ahead of the church's 101st anniversary celebrations to be held in July 26 in [[Ciudad de Victoria]] complex in [[Bulacan]]. Among these reported instructions were that members decline media inquiries and travel by private cars to the celebrations. During the centennial celebrations, members were provided with service vehicles. Stickers for vehicles with "One with EVM" were reportedly distributed.&lt;ref name=pdievm2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cinco|first1=Maricar|title=Iglesia ni Cristo members told: carry ‘EVM’ tarps; shun media interviews|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707823/inc-members-told-carry-evm-tarps-shun-media-interviews|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer Southern Luzon|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media reported an unusually high number of worshipers and vehicles at the INC church in [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]]. Several taurpalins bearing the words "One with EVM" were posted outside the building.&lt;ref name=pdievm2/&gt;

====Expelled members====
Expelled INC minister Roel and his spouse, Shirley Rosal told reporters on July 23, 2015 that at least 10 ministers were under [[house arrest]]. Roel Rosal claimed that auditor Jun Santos and his staff were using donations for the INC to purchase [[luxury car|luxury vehicles]]. He also said that Angel and Tenny Manalo were hostages. Roel said that the expulsion of the Manalos might have been influenced by a "third party" in the church administration.&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt;&lt;ref name=coverup/&gt;

Isaias Samson, Jr. at a July 23 press conference, said that government intervention in the crisis would help resolve the issue.&lt;ref name=govint&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torres-Tupas|first1=Tetch|title=INC crisis: Suspended minister urges gov’t intervention|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707267/inc-crisis-suspended-minister-urges-govt-intervention|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer.net|date=23 July 2015|language=English, Tagalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samson was expelled from the INC the day after his press conference.

====Other members and supporters====
Fewer than 12 supporters of the church wearing white armbands organized a vigil in support of the Manalos in front of the INC compound in Tandang Sora.&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Frustrated INC members back leader's kin|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100257-inc-members-manalo-house-rally?cp_rap_source=ymlScrolly#cxrecs_s|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2:00 am of July 25, no INC member was seen camping outside the compound.&lt;ref name=novigil&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Jovic|title=No vigil outside Angel Manalo’s residence|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707548/no-vigil-outside-angel-manalos-residence|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members used social media to express their support for Eduardo V. Manalo and the Sanggunian. Some members changed their profile photo to an image bearing the words  "I am one with EVM," in support of the leadership of Eduardo Manalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mateo|first1=Janvic|title=Iglesia rift widens online|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/26/1481030/iglesia-rift-widens-online|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2015, Louie Cayabyab, the minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo locale in [[Fremont, California]], resigned his position as minister as a response to the expulsions of Samson and Tenny and Angel Manalo. Cayabyab stated "Beloved brethren, there are two circulars that are supposed to be read this morning. The first circular is about the expulsion from the Church of the wife and children of Bro. Erano G. Manalo. And another circular is the expulsion from the Church of Bro. Isaias T. Samson Jr., former editor-in-chief of the ''Pasugo''. I decided, brethren, that I won’t read those circulars. You might be asking, 'why?' Because in my heart, in my heart of hearts, I can’t take it. It is, it is just so so difficult to betray one’s heart..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/528746/news/nation/iglesia-ni-cristo-minister-in-california-quits-post |title=Iglesia ni Cristo minister in California quits post &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online |website=Gmanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Cayabyab asked INC members to remain in the church, he urged them to support peaceful vigils held in their areas, and implored them to support brethren in the Philippines "who are risking their lives" to expose corruption and reform the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esmaquel|first1=Paterno|title=US-based INC minister: 'Never my intention to quit'|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100595-iglesia-ni-cristo-minister-louie-cayabyab-quit|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Cayabyab's resignation, members of the INC in [[Northern California]], numbering in the "dozens," according to [[ABS-CBN News]], held a protest at the INC's main United States office in [[Burlingame, California]], demanding an investigation and tribunal into the corruption allegations, along with the reinstatement of Angel and Tenny Manalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surprising move: Iglesia ni Cristo members in California hold protest|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/07/27/15/surprising-move-iglesia-ni-cristo-members-california-hold-protest|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a week later those who were identified as having taken part in the protests were expelled from the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conclara|first1=Rommel|title=INC expels members who joined protest in US|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/08/06/15/inc-expels-members-who-joined-protest-us|accessdate=7 August 2015|agency=ABS-CBN North America News Bureau|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of INC from 26 ecclesiastical districts picketed the Department of Justice office in [[Manila]], when Secretary Leila de Lima, on her birthday, officially announced her 2016 senatorial bid. The assembly happened a few days after former minister Samson, Jr., his wife and son, filed illegal detention charges against eight members of the Sanggunian. A respondent of the case, Bienvenido Santiago, Sr., the church's general evangelist, wanted De Lima to focus instead on the SAF 44 case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iglesia Ni Cristo Press Statement as read during Aug. 26 press conference|url=http://www.eaglenews.ph/iglesia-ni-cristo-press-statement-as-read-during-aug-26-press-conference/|accessdate=August 27, 2015|publisher=Eagle News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iglesia ni Cristo members: ‘Why, why, why, De Lima?’

====Net 25 TV interview with allegedly missing ministers====
In an interview with Eagle News Service/Net 25 on July 29, 2015, a broadcaster owned and operated by INC affiliate [[Eagle Broadcasting Corporation]], ministers Lowell "Boyet" Menorca II, Joel San Pedro, Jojo Nemis and Arnel Tumanan denied they were held captive or tortured. They also affirmed their loyalty to the church administration and executive minister [[Eduardo Manalo]] and that they were still church members. The ministers also stated that members should not believe the claims of abduction.&lt;ref name="Eagle News"&gt;{{cite web|title=INC ministers come out in the open to say they were not abducted, hit lies spread in media|url=http://www.eaglenews.ph/inc-ministers-come-out-in-the-open-to-say-they-were-not-abducted-hit-lies-spread-in-media/|website=Eagle News|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Anthony Menorca, Boyet Menorca's brother, stated that his older brother was forced to deny his abduction because INC Sanggunian was holding Boyet Menorca's wife, Seiko Otsuka Menorca, and one year old child. Anthony stated that in a meeting with his brother, he told him "Binantaan kami ng kapatid ko na kami ay papatayin" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''"My brother warned us we will be killed"'') Anthony Menorca stated that he was in an undisclosed location and feared for the life of his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cepeda|first1=Mara|title=Sibling of ‘abducted’ minister to INC Council: Free my brother|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/101041-inc-lowell-menorca-brother-abduction|website=Rappler|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a new video released after he was allegedly rescued from the captivity of the Sanggunian on October 21, Menorca clarified, claiming that everything he said in the interview on Net 25 were "scripted".&lt;ref name=
"Rappler 1"/&gt;

====Interview with Boyet Menorca====
On August 1, 2015, Boyet Menorca, along with his wife and child, were interviewed in person outside the INC compound, wherein he denied all allegations of his abduction and pleaded for his brother to stop making claims. He added that he and his family voluntarily decided to stay within the compound because of safety concerns. He was worried that he could potentially be attacked in order to direct the resulting blame on the INC. After the interview, he and his family returned to the INC compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/531300/news/nation/iglesia-minister-lowell-menorca-ii-denies-church-holding-his-family-against-their-will|title=Iglesia minister Lowell Menorca II denies church holding his family against their will|date=3 August 2015|website=gmanetwork|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Menorca stated the interview was held "under duress."&lt;ref name="rappler1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/110561-lowell-menorca-iglesia-ni-cristo-abduction-story |title=Ex-minister Lowell Menorca recounts Iglesia 'detention' ordeal |website=Rappler.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Menorca recounts capture and being held hostage====
On October 21, 2015, Lowell Menorca's brother Anthony petitioned the Supreme Court of the Philippines to issue writs of ''habeas corpus'' and ''amparo'' against the INC administration. The request was granted and on October 25, Menorca stated that he was illegally detained by INC, kidnapped by police officers allegedly in INC's employ and had been interrogated for 17 hours. He also stated that police officials tried to kill him afterwards using a hand grenade and that he had to beg for his life, successfully convincing a police officer allegedly hired to murder him not to go through with the killing.&lt;ref name="rappler1"/&gt;

====Menorca's arrest in connection with libel charges====
On January 20, 2016, on his way to the Court of Appeals to attend a hearing on the illegal detention case, policemen wearing civilian clothes and without badges led by Supt. Ed Leonardo and INC member, arrested Menorca on libel charges filed by the SCAN International in Kapatagan, Lanao del Norte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/551925/news/metro/manila-cops-arrest-ex-iglesia-minister-before-ca-appearance|title=Manila cops arrest ex-Iglesia minister before CA appearance|publisher=''[[GMA News]]''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A standoff between the police, Menorca and his wife Jinky occurred along Roxas Boulevard and Quirino Avenue when Menorca refused the arrest and claimed that the court had not notified him of libel charges. After the commotion, 20 policemen in uniform showed up to arrest Menorca.&lt;ref name="Menorca 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/757081/ex-iglesia-minister-lowell-menorca-surrenders|title=Ex-Iglesia minister Lowell Menorca surrenders|publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPD Director Chief Supt.

The church, thru its spokesman Edwil Zabala, said the INC strongly denied any involvement with the standoff and told Menorca to face the libel charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/119633-iglesia-ni-cristo-lowell-menorca-arrest|title=Ex-INC minister Menorca arrested on the way to court|publisher=''Rappler''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaglenews.ph/iglesia-ni-cristo-official-press-statement/|title=Iglesia Ni Cristo Official Press Statement|publisher=''Eagle News''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Menorca receives asylum in Canada====
Menorca fled to [[Vietnam]] in March 2016. Moises Tolentino Jr., a lawyer for the Iglesia ni Cristo responded that: "Beset by several libel suits and an adultery charge to boot, [Menorca] took the cowardly option. He took a hurried flight last night bound for Vietnam. He is now a fugitive from justice.." and "Menorca is supposed to be the aggrieved party. If they were sincere, if they believed that they were in the right, they should not leave the country. They should face all opportunities that should be given to respondents..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/124970-lowell-menorca-fugitive-iglesia-ni-cristo|title=INC: Menorca a 'fugitive,' robbed Iglesia of chance to expose lies|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|publisher=[[Rappler]]|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menorca left Vietnam two weeks later and arrived in [[Vancouver]].

In [[programming languages]], an '''abstract type''' is a type in a [[nominative type system]] that cannot be [[Instance (computer science)|instantiated]] directly; a type that is not abstract – which ''can'' be instantiated – is called a ''concrete type''. Every instance of an abstract type is an instance of some concrete [[subtype]]. Abstract types are also known as ''existential types''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, John C.; Plotkin, Gordon D.; [http://theory.stanford.edu/~jcm/papers/mitch-plotkin-88.pdf ''Abstract Types Have Existential Type''], ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Vol. 10, No. 3, July 1988, pp. 470–502&lt;/ref&gt;

An abstract type may provide no implementation, or an incomplete implementation. In some languages, abstract types with no implementation (rather than an incomplete implementation) are known as ''[[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]]'', ''interfaces'', ''signatures'', or ''class types''. In [[Class-based programming|class-based]] [[object-oriented programming]], abstract types are implemented as ''abstract classes'' (also known as ''[[abstract base class]]es''), and concrete types as ''[[concrete class]]es''. In [[generic programming]], the analogous notion is a [[Concept (generic programming)|concept]], which similarly specifies syntax and semantics, but does not require a subtype relationship: two unrelated types may satisfy the same concept.

Often, abstract types will have one or more implementations provided separately, for example, in the form of concrete subtypes that ''can'' be instantiated. In object-oriented programming, an abstract class may include ''abstract methods'' or ''abstract properties''&lt;ref&gt;http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html&lt;/ref&gt; that are shared by its subclasses. Other names for language features that are (or may be) used to implement abstract types include ''[[Trait (computer science)|traits]]'', ''[[mixin]]s'', ''flavors'', ''roles'', or ''type classes''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Signifying abstract types ==

Abstract classes can be created, signified, or simulated in several ways:
* By use of the explicit [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] &lt;tt&gt;abstract&lt;/tt&gt; in the class definition, as in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[D (programming language)|D]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].
* By including, in the class definition, one or more [[abstract method]]s (called ''pure [[virtual functions]]'' in [[C++]]), which the class is declared to accept as part of its protocol, but for which no implementation is provided.
* By [[inheritance (computer science)|inheriting]] from an abstract type, and not overriding all missing features necessary to complete the class definition.
* In many dynamically typed languages such as [[Smalltalk]], any class that sends a particular method to [[this (computer science)|this]], but doesn't implement that method, can be considered abstract.  (However, in many such languages, like [[Objective-C]], the error is not detected until the class is used, and the message returns results in an exception error message such as "Does not recognize selector: xxx" as &lt;code&gt;- [NSObject doesNotRecognizeSelector:(SEL)selector]&lt;/code&gt; is invoked upon detection of an unimplemented method).

=== Example (Java) ===

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;

//By default, all methods in all classes are concrete, unless the abstract keyword is used.
abstract class Demo {
    // An abstract class may include abstract methods, which have no implementation.
    abstract public int sum(int x, int y);

    // An abstract class may also include concrete methods.
    public int product(int x, int y) { return x*y; }
}

//By default, all methods in all interfaces are abstract, unless the default keyword is used.
interface DemoInterface {
    [abstract] int getLength(); //Abstract can be used here, though is completely useless
    
    //The default keyword can be used in this context to specify a concrete method in an interface
    default int product(int x, int y) {
        return x * y;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Use of abstract types ==

Abstract types are an important feature in [[static typing|statically typed]] OOP languages. Many [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]] languages have no equivalent feature (although the use of [[duck typing]] makes abstract types unnecessary); however ''[[Trait (computer programming)|traits]]'' are found in some modern dynamically-typed languages.

Some authors argue that classes should be [[Leaf class (programming language)|leaf class]]es (have no subtypes), or else be abstract.&lt;ref name="riel1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riel|first=Arthur|title=Object-Oriented Design Heuristics|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=1996|isbn=0-201-63385-X|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meyers1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=Scott|title=More Effective C++|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=1996|isbn=0-201-63371-X |page=258
|quote=Make non-leaf classes abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract types are useful in that they can be used to define and enforce a ''[[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocol]]''; a set of operations that all objects implementing the protocol must support.

{{History of Bangladesh}}

The Bengali '''Language Movement''' ({{lang-bn|ভাষা আন্দোলন}} ''Bhasha Andolôn'') was a political movement in former [[East Bengal]] &lt;!-- Please note that East Bengal was the administrative division of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] corresponding to today's Bangladesh from 1947 to 1955 --&gt; (currently [[Bangladesh]]) advocating the recognition of the [[Bengali language]] as an [[official language]] of the then-[[Dominion of Pakistan]] in order to allow its use in government affairs, the continuation of its use as a medium of education, its use in media, currency and stamps, and to maintain its writing in the [[Bengali script]].

When the Dominion of Pakistan was formed by the [[partition of India]] in 1947, it was composed of various ethnic and linguistic groups, with the geographically non-contiguous East Bengal province (that was [[One Unit|renamed]] in 1956 as [[East Pakistan]]) having a mainly [[Bengali people|Bengali]] population. In 1948, the [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Government of the Dominion of Pakistan]] ordained [[Urdu]] as the sole national language, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Bengal. Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies. The students of the [[University of Dhaka]] and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952. The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day. The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest. After years of conflict, the central government relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956.

The Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in East Bengal and later East Pakistan, and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements, including the [[6 Point Movement|6-Point Movement]] and subsequently the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. In Bangladesh, 21 February (''Ekushey February'') is observed as [[Language Movement Day]], a national holiday. The [[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]] monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College in memory of the movement and its victims. In 1999, [[UNESCO]] declared 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]],&lt;ref&gt;Glassie, Henry and Mahmud, Feroz.2008.Living Traditions. Cultural Survey of Bangladesh Series-II. Asiatic Society of Bangladesh. Dhaka. International Mother Language Day&lt;/ref&gt;  in tribute to the Language Movement and the ethno-linguistic rights of people around the world.

==Background==
The current nations, Pakistan and Bangladesh, were part of an undivided India during the British colonial rule. From the mid-19th century, the [[Urdu]] language had been promoted as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Islam in India|Indian Muslims]] by political and religious leaders, such as [[Khwaja Salimullah|Sir Khwaja Salimullah]], [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]], [[Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]].&lt;ref name="urducontrov"&gt;{{cite web

While the use of Urdu grew common with Muslims in northern India, the Muslims of [[Bengal]] (a province in the eastern part of British Indian sub-continent) primarily used the Bengali language. Bengali is an [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan language]] that arose from the eastern [[Middle Indic languages]] around 1000 CE&lt;ref name="bhatta"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhattacharya |first=T |editor=Garry, J. |editor2=Rubino, C. |title=Encyclopedia of World's Languages: Past and Present (Facts About the World's Languages)|year=2001 |publisher=HW Wilson |location=New York |isbn=0-8242-0970-2|pages= |chapter= Bangla}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed considerably during the [[Bengal Renaissance]]. As early as the late 19th century, social activists such as the [[Islamic feminism|Muslim feminist]] [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]] were choosing to write in Bengali to reach out to the people and develop it as a modern literary language.  Supporters of Bengali opposed Urdu even before the [[partition of India]], when delegates from Bengal rejected the idea of making Urdu the lingua franca of Muslim India in the 1937 [[Lucknow]] session of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. The Muslim League was a [[British India]]n political party that became the driving force behind the creation of [[Pakistan]] as a [[Muslim]] state separate from British India.&lt;ref name="tariqcontrov"&gt;{{cite journal

==Early stages of the movement==
[[Image:Partition of India.PNG|thumb|Britain's holdings on the [[Indian subcontinent]] were granted independence in 1947 and 1948, becoming four new independent states: the [[Dominion of India]], the [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–1962|Union of Burma]] (now Myanmar), [[Dominion of Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] (now part of India), and the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] (including [[East Bengal]], from 1956 [[East Pakistan]], 1971-today [[Bangladesh]]).]]

After the partition of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in [[East Bengal]], the non-contiguous eastern part of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan's 69 million people.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Al Helal |first=Bashir |year=2012 |chapter=Language Movement |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307033428/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement |archivedate=7 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion of Pakistan's government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg"&gt;{{cite journal

Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of [[Principal Abul Kashem|Abul Kashem]], the secretary of [[Tamaddun Majlish]], a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal.&lt;ref name="umarharv1"&gt;{{Harv|Umar|1979|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Pakistan Public Service Commission]] removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from currency notes and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the Dominion of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=227–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public outrage spread, and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;

Leading Bengali scholars argued why Urdu should not be the only state language. The writer [[Abul Mansur Ahmed]] said if Urdu became the state language, the educated society of East Bengal would become 'illiterate' and 'ineligible' for government positions.&lt;ref name="umarharvmansur"&gt;{{Harv|Umar|1979|pp=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad]] (National Language Action Committee), an organisation in favour of Bengali as a state language was formed towards the end of December 1947. Professor [[Nurul Huq Bhuiyan]] of the Tamaddun Majlish  convened the committee.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sri"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ekusher Shongkolon '80|year=1980 |publisher=[[Bangla Academy]] |location=Dhaka |language=bn |pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Parliament member [[Shamsul Huq]] convened a new committee to push for Bengali as a state language. Assembly member [[Dhirendranath Datta]] proposed legislation in the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]] to allow members to speak in Bengali and authorise its use for official purposes.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt; Datta's proposal was supported by legislators Prem Hari Burman, [[Bhupendra Kumar Datta]] and Sris Chandra Chattaopadhyaya of East Bengal, as well as the people from the region.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt; Prime minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] and the Muslim League denounced the proposal as an attempt to divide the Pakistani people, thus the legislation was defeated.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swadhinotajuddho"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rahman |first=Hasan Hafizur |title=Bangladesher Swadhinotajuddher Dolilpotro|year=1982 |month= |publisher=Ministry of Information, People's Republic of Bangladesh |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agitations of 1948===
[[File:Quaid-delivering-speech copy2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] on 21 March 1948 told at a public meeting that ''State language of Pakistan is going to be Urdu and no other language.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jinnah.pk/2009/09/27/national-consolidation/# |title=NATIONAL CONSOLIDATION |access-date=21 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521104719/http://jinnah.pk/2009/09/27/national-consolidation/# |archive-date=21 May 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Students of the [[University of Dhaka]] and other colleges of the city organised a general strike on 11 March 1948 to protest the omission of Bengali language from official use, including coins, stamps and recruitment tests for the navy. The movement restated the demand that Bengali be declared an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Political leaders such as Shamsul Huq, [[Shawkat Ali]], [[M Sirajul Islam]], [[Kazi Golam Mahboob]], [[Oli Ahad]], Abdul Wahed and others were arrested during the rallies. Rally leader [[Mohammad Toaha]] was hospitalised after attempting to snatch a rifle from a police officer. Student leaders, including [[Abdul Matin (language activist)|Abdul Matin]] and [[Abdul Malek Ukil]] took part in the procession.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"/&gt;

In the afternoon of 11 March, a meeting was held to protest police brutality and arrests. A group of students marching towards the chief minister [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]]'s house was stopped in front of the [[Dhaka High Court]]. The rally changed its direction and moved in the direction of the Secretariat building. Police attacked the procession injuring several students and leaders, including [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]].&lt;ref name="helal263"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=263–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing strikes were observed the following four days. Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;

In the height of civic unrest, [[Governor-General of Pakistan]] [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] arrived in Dhaka on 19 March 1948. On 21 March, at a civic reception at [[Suhrawardy Udyan|Racecourse Ground]], he claimed that the language issue was designed by a "[[fifth column]]" to divide Pakistani Muslims.&lt;ref name="choudhury"&gt;{{cite journal

Jinnah delivered a similar speech at [[Curzon Hall]] of the University of Dhaka on 24 March.&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg" /&gt; At both meetings, Jinnah was interrupted by large segments of the audience.

The government suggested that Bengali be written in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]], as a potential solution to the language conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper =The Azad  | date =24 May 1950

==Events of 1952==

[[Image:1952 Bengali Language movement.jpg|thumb|Procession march held on 21 February 1952 in [[Dhaka]]]]
The Urdu-Bengali controversy was reignited when Jinnah's successor, governor-general [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], staunchly defended the "Urdu-only" policy in a speech on 27 January 1952.&lt;ref name="helal263" /&gt; On 31 January, the ''[[Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod]]'' (All-Party Central Language Action Committee) was formed in a meeting at the Bar Library Hall of the University of Dhaka, chaired by [[Maulana Bhashani]].&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Umar|2004|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central government's proposal of writing the Bengali language in [[Arabic script]] was vehemently opposed at the meeting. The action committee called for an all out protest on 21 February, including strikes and rallies.&lt;ref name="helal263" /&gt; In an attempt to prevent the demonstration, the government imposed [[Section 144]] in Dhaka, thereby banning any gathering.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"/&gt;

===21 February===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Meeting at Amtala on Ekushey February.JPG|thumb|Meeting on the University of Dhaka premises on 21 February 1952]] --&gt;
At nine o'clock in the morning, students began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired [[tear gas]] shells towards the gate to warn the students.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt; A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When a group of students sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including [[Abdus Salam (language martyr)|Abdus Salam]], [[Rafiq Uddin Ahmed]], [[Abul Barkat]] and [[Abdul Jabbar (activist)|Abdul Jabbar]].&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began.&lt;ref name="UStudies" /&gt; At the assembly, six legislators including [[Manoranjan Dhar]], Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and [[Dhirendranath Datta]] requested that chief minister [[Nurul Amin]] visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning.&lt;ref name="bashir377393"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=377–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including [[Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish]], Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed.&lt;ref name="bashir377393" /&gt; However, Nurul Amin refused the requests.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bashir377393" /&gt;

===22 February===
Disorder spread across the province as large processions ignored [[section 144]] and condemned the actions of the police.&lt;ref name="helal263" /&gt; More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, to boycott offices and join the procession.&lt;ref name="UStudies" /&gt; Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the ''Jubilee Press'' and the ''Morning News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Continued unrest===

Through the night of 23 February, students of Dhaka Medical College worked on the construction of a ''Shaheed Smritistombho'', or Monument of Martyrs. Completed at dawn on 24 February, the monument had a handwritten note attached to it with the words ''"Shaheed Smritistombho"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/its-true-3041|title=IT'S TRUE!|date=2015-02-21|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inaugurated by the father of the slain activist Sofiur Rahman, the monument was destroyed on 26 February by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shaheed_Minar|title=Shaheed Minar|last=Rafique|first=Ahmed|date=|website=en.banglapedia.org|publisher=Banglapedia|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February, industrial workers in the town of [[Narayanganj]] observed a general strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Umar|2004|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest followed on 29 February whose participants faced severe police beating.&lt;ref name="umarnarayan"&gt;{{Harv|Umar|1979|pp=417–418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction in West Pakistan===
Although the Language Movement is considered to have laid the foundations for [[ethnic nationalism]] in many of the Bengalis of East Bengal and later East Pakistan, it also heightened the cultural animosity between the authorities of the two wings of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="B2g" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uddin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;{{cite web

This kind of thinking also provoked considerable opposition in the western wing, wherein there existed several linguistic groups.&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg" /&gt; As late as in 1967, military dictator Ayub Khan said, "East Bengal is ... still under considerable Hindu culture and influence."&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg" /&gt;

==Events after 1952==
[[Image:21feb1956 Shaheed Minar Dhaka.jpg|right|thumb|Foundation of the Shaheed Minar laid down in Dhaka by Abul Barkat's family members.]]
The ''Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod'', with support from the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami Muslim League]], decided to commemorate 21 February as ''Shohid Dibosh'' . On the first anniversary of the protests, people across East Bengal wore black badges in solidarity with the victims. Most offices, banks and educational institutions were closed to observe the occasion. Student groups made agreements with college and police officials to preserve law and order. More than 100,000 people assembled at a public meeting held in Dhaka, where community leaders called for the immediate release of Maulana Bhashani and other political prisoners.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt; However, West Pakistani politicians such as Fazlur Rahman aggravated sectional tensions by declaring that anyone who wanted Bengali to become an official language would be considered an "enemy of the state". Bengali students and civilians disobeyed the restrictions to celebrate the anniversary of the protests. Demonstrations broke out on the night of 21 February 1954 with various halls of the University of Dhaka raising black flags in mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=604–609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Front in 1954===
Political tensions came to a head as elections to the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954. The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition [[United Front (East Pakistan)|United Front]] coalition, which—led by [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] and the Awami League—wanted greater provincial autonomy. Several United Front leaders and activists were arrested.&lt;ref name="Helal601603"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=600–603}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting of parliament's Muslim League members, chaired by prime minister [[Muhammad Ali Bogra]], resolved to give official recognition to Bengali. This decision was followed by a major wave of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages. Proponents of Urdu such as [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]] condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali. He led a rally of 100,000 people to protest against the Muslim League's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The United Front ministry ordered the creation of the [[Bangla Academy]] to promote, develop, and preserve Bengali language, literature, and heritage.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Al Helal |first=Bashir|year=2012 |chapter=Bangla Academy |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Academy |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United Front rule was temporary, as [[Governor General of Pakistan|Governor General]] [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Ghulam Muhammad]] cancelled the government and started Governor's rule on 30 May 1954.&lt;ref name="Helal601603" /&gt; The United Front again formed the ministry on 6 June 1955 after the governor's regime ended. The Awami League did not participate in this ministry though.&lt;ref name="bashir608613"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=608–613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the return of the United Front to power, the anniversary on 21 February 1956 was observed for the first time in a peaceful atmosphere. The Government supported a major project to construct a new Shaheed Minar. The session of the constituent assembly was stopped for five minutes to express condolence for the students slain in the police shootings. Major rallies were organised by Bengali leaders and all public offices and businesses remained closed.&lt;ref name="bashir608613" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Constitutional reform===
On 7 May 1954, the constituent assembly resolved, with the Muslim League's support, to grant official status to Bengali.&lt;ref name="Pakspace" /&gt; Bengali was recognised as the second official language of Pakistan on 29 February 1956, and article 214(1) of the constitution of Pakistan was reworded to "The state language of Pakistan shall be Urdu and Bengali."

However, the military government formed by [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] made attempts to re-establish Urdu as the sole national language. On 6 January 1959, the military regime issued an official statement and reinstated the official stance of supporting the 1956 constitution's policy of two state languages.&lt;ref name="lambert"&gt;{{cite journal

===Assam===
Outside East Bengal, movement for equal status of Bengali also took place in the Indian state of [[Assam]]. On 19 May 1961, 11 Bengalis were killed in police firing in [[Silchar]] Railway Station, Assam, while demanding state recognition of Bengali language. Subsequently, Bengali was given co-official status in the three Bengali-majority districts of Assam.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sarkar |first=Gautam |date=20 May 2008 |title=Court route for language status |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080520/jsp/jharkhand/story_9294570.jsp |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence of Bangladesh===
{{Main|Bangladesh Liberation War}}
[[File:Shaheed Minar 1963.png|thumb|The second Shaheed Minar (martyrs' monument) completed in 1963]]
Although the question of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of [[West Pakistan]] at the expense of [[East Pakistan]]. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of [[democracy|representative government]] in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League,&lt;ref name="uddin" /&gt; which invoked the [[Six point movement|6-point movement]] for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called ''Bangladesh'' (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.&lt;ref name="B2g" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg" /&gt;

[[File:International Mother Language Day Celebration.PNG|thumb|right|[[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]], or the Martyr's monument, located near [[Dhaka Medical College]] commemorates those who lost their life during the protests on 21 February 1952]]
The Language Movement had a major cultural impact on Bengali society. It has inspired the development and celebration of the Bengali language, literature and culture. 21 February, celebrated as Language Movement Day or ''Shohid Dibosh'' (Martyrs' Day), is a major national holiday in Bangladesh. A month-long event called the [[Ekushey Book Fair]] is held every year to commemorate the movement. ''[[Ekushey Padak]]'', one of the highest civilian awards in Bangladesh, is awarded annually in memory of the sacrifices of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khan |first=Sanjida |year=2012 |chapter=National Awards |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=National_Awards |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songs such as [[Abdul Gaffar Choudhury]]'s ''[[Ekusher Gaan]]'', set to music by Shaheed [[Altaf Mahmud]], as well as plays, works of art and poetry played a considerable role in rousing the people's emotions during the movement.&lt;ref name="cultureimp"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aminzade |first=Ronald |authorlink= |author2=Douglas McAdam |author3=Charles Tilly |date=17 September 2001 |chapter=Emotions and Contentious Politics |title=Silence and Voice in the Study of Contentious Politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=h8PNEOZRRt8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bangladesh+language+movement |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=42 |isbn=0-521-00155-2 |accessdate=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the events of February 1952, poems, songs, novels, plays, films, cartoons and paintings were created to capture the movement from varied point of views. Notable artistic depictions include the poems ''Bornomala, Amar Dukhini Bornomala'' and ''February 1969'' by [[Shamsur Rahman (poet)|Shamsur Rahman]], the film ''[[Jibon Theke Neya]]'' by [[Zahir Raihan]], the stage play ''Kobor'' by [[Munier Chowdhury]] and the novels ''Ekushey February'' by Raihan and ''Artonaad'' by [[Shawkat Osman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Rafiqul |title=Amar Ekushey O Shaheed Minar|year=2000 |publisher=Poroma |location=Dhaka |language=bn |isbn=984-8245-39-1 |pages=62–85  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the first monument was destroyed by the police, a new ''[[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]]'' (Monument of Martyrs) was constructed in 1954 to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives. Work on a larger monument designed by the architect [[Hamidur Rahman (artist)|Hamidur Rahman]] began in 1957 with the support of the United Front ministry. Hamidur Rahman's model consisted of a large complex in the yard of the Dhaka Medical College Hostel. The design included a half-circular column  symbolizing a mother with her martyred sons standing at the dais in the centre of the monument. Although the imposition of martial law in 1958 interrupted the work, the monument was completed and inaugurated on 21 February 1963 by [[Abul Barkat]]'s mother, Hasina Begum. Pakistani forces demolished the monument during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, but the Bangladeshi government reconstructed it in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Imam |first=Jahanara |authorlink=Jahanara Imam |title=Ekattorer Dingulee|year=1986 |publisher=Shondhani Prokashani |location=Dhaka |language=bn |isbn=984-480-000-5 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ekushey Television]], the first private terrestrial TV channel of Bangladesh was named after the Event of 21 February.

===India===
{{main| Bengali Language Movement in India}}
The states of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]] in [[India]] also follow and celebrate the Day by paying tribute to the unsung heroes. Moreover, all the bengalees in India and abroad celebrate the Day for the sacrifice of lives just for the sake of the [[First language]].

===Worldwide===
Bangladesh officially sent a proposal to UNESCO to declare 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]]. The proposal was supported unanimously at the 30th General Conference of UNESCO held on 17 November 1999.&lt;ref name="UN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.bd/21february/imld_back.htm|title=International Mother Language Day – Background and Adoption of the Resolution|work=Government of Bangladesh|accessdate = 2007-06-21| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520205804/http://www.pmo.gov.bd/21february/imld_back.htm| archivedate=20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1433">A '''boxology''' is a representation of an organized structure as a [[graph theory|graph]] of labeled nodes ("[[rectangle|boxes]]") and connections between them (as [[line (geometry)|line]]s or [[arrow (symbol)|arrows]]).  The concept is useful because many problems in systems design are reducible to modular "black boxes" and connections or flow channels between them.  The term is somewhat tongue-in-cheek &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Raymond |first=Eric |title=The New Hacker's Dictionary|url=https://archive.org/stream/jarg422/jarg422.txt|date=1996|isbn=978-0262680929|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the generic nature of diagrams containing labelled nodes and (sometimes directed) paths between them.

The archetypical example of a boxology is a corporate [[organizational chart|"org chart"]], which describes lines of control through the corporation.  Other boxologies include programming [[flow chart]]s, system-level [[circuit diagram]]s for designing large complex circuits, and even economic models.  [[Feynman diagrams]] are useful because they reduce the complicated [[mathematics]] of [[quantum mechanics]] to a simple boxology of particle interactions.

Depending on application, the boxes are optional; for example, the global [[carbon cycle]] is modeled as a boxology, but many figures explaining the model include only labels and directed connections.

'''Cabin fever''' is an [[idiom]]atic term for a [[Claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] reaction that takes place when a person or group ends up in an isolated or solitary location, or stuck indoors in confined quarters for an extended period of time. Cabin fever describes the extreme irritability and restlessness a person may feel in these limiting situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cabin+fever?show=0&amp;t=1341386865|title= Cabin fever|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabin fever is also associated with [[boredom]] from being indoors for a lengthy amount of time.

A person may experience cabin fever in a situation such as being isolated within a [[vacation]] cottage out in the country, or away from a civilization.

When experiencing cabin fever, a person may tend to sleep, to have a distrust of anyone they are with, or to have an urge to go outside even in bad weather. The phrase is also used humorously to indicate simple [[boredom]] from being home alone for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/03/garden/reports-from-the-bunkers-by-some-survivors-homebound-and-happy.html|title= Reports From the Bunkers, by Some Survivors; Homebound and Happy|author=Ron Alexander|date=2004-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabin fever is not directly fatal to an individual suffering from the peculiar disorder. However, related symptoms can lead the sufferer to make irrational decisions that could potentially cause them to lose their life. Some examples would be suicide from the seclusion or paranoia, or leaving the safety of a cabin during a terrible snow storm that one may be stuck in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kehoe|first=J.

==Therapy==



One therapy for cabin fever is as simple as getting out and interacting with nature directly. Research has demonstrated that even brief interactions with nature can promote improved cognitive functioning, support a positive mood, and overall well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berman|first=Marc G.|author2=John Jonides|author3=Stephen Kaplan|date=2008-02-18|title=The Cognitive Benefits of Interacting With Nature|url=http://www.umich.edu/~jlabpsyc/pdf/2008_2.pdf|journal=Psychological Science|volume=19|issue=12|pages=1207–1212|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02225.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escaping the confinement of the indoors and changing one’s scenery and surroundings can easily help an individual experiencing cabin fever overcome their mania. Going outside to experience the openness of the world will stimulate the brain and body enough to eliminate feelings of intense claustrophobia, paranoia, and restlessness associated with cabin fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenblatt|first=Paul C.|last2=Anderson|first2=Roxanne Marie|last3=Johnson|first3=Patricia A.|date=June 1984|title=The Meaning of “Cabin Fever”|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F00224545.1984.9924512|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=123|issue=1|pages=43–53|doi=10.1080/00224545.1984.9924512|issn=0022-4545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little evidence of those suffering from cabin fever seeing therapists or counselors for treatment, most sufferers simply discuss their symptoms with family or friends as a way of changing the feelings of loneliness and boredom. However, there are cases of “cabin fever” that are diagnosed as mid-winter depression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=Russ|last2=Dowrick|first2=Peter W.|date=1983|title=Myths of mid-winter depression|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00759551|journal=Community Mental Health Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=177–186|doi=10.1007/bf00759551|issn=0010-3853}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Seasonal affective disorder|Seasonal Affective Disorder]] (SAD). &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rohan|first=Kelly J.|title=Symptoms, Prevalence, and Causes of SAD|date=September 2008|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/med:psych/9780195341379.003.0002|work=Coping with the Seasons: Workbook|pages=7–16|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195341379|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==In popular culture==

The concept of Cabin fever was used as a theme in Charlie Chaplin's 1925 film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'', the 1980 horror film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Mountain of Madness]]", and the 2010 video game ''[[Alan Wake]]''. A song called "Cabin Fever" features in the 1996 musical comedy ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'', afflicting sailors on a ship trapped in the [[doldrums]]. Cabin Fever was the name of Wiz Khalifa's 2011 mixtape which was released February 17th. There is a quest in the popular [[Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game|MMORPG]] ''[[RuneScape]]'' of the same name.

Cabin fever is one of the possible afflictions the [[player character]] can suffer from in the video game set in the post-apocalyptic Canadian wasteland, ''[[The Long Dark]]''; the condition prevents one from sleeping indoors, thus forcing them to brave the elements in order to rest.

In ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'', fictional female character Joi, who is a virtual girlfriend of main character K, at the beginning of the movie is stating that she is suffering from "cabin fever".

''[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]'' is a 2002 American horror film directed by [[Eli Roth]] and starring [[Rider Strong]], [[Jordan Ladd]], James DeBello, and [[Giuseppe Andrews]].
The story follows a group of college graduates who rent a cabin in the woods and begin to fall victim to a [[Necrotizing fasciitis|flesh-eating virus]]. The inspiration for the film's story came from a real life experience during a trip to [[Iceland]] when Roth developed a skin infection. The film spawned a sequel ''[[Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever]]'' (2009), a prequel ''[[Cabin Fever: Patient Zero]]'' (2014), and a 2016 remake of the original, also called ''[[Cabin Fever (2016 film)|Cabin Fever]]''.

A '''capital call''' (also known as a draw down or a capital commitment) is a legal right of an [[investment firm]] or an [[insurance firm]] to demand a portion of the money promised to it by an investor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/glossary_view.asp?glossary_id=225 Capital Call - Glossary - Encyclopedia - Library - VC Experts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524022133/http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/glossary_view.asp?glossary_id=225 |date=May 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://companycrafters.onlinetech.net/Entry.aspx?Id=1292 capital call - Entrepreneurs Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526002111/http://companycrafters.onlinetech.net/Entry.aspx?Id=1292 |date=May 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A capital call fund would be the money that had been committed to the fund. The capital call is the act of actually transferring the promised funds to the investment target. A capital call agreement defines capital call terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://definitions.uslegal.com/c/capital-call/&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when an investor buys into a [[real estate]] fund, that fund's managers may wait some time before using the investor's money to buy real estate, either because they are waiting for real estate prices to be favorable, or because they are researching new deals. When they are ready to  buy real estate, the fund managers issue a capital call, requiring investors who have [[Capital commitment|committed]] money to the fund to  transfer that money over.

The fund might also borrow funds instead of using the investor's money. This allows the fund to benefit from [[leverage (finance)|leverage]]. The financing of the real estate purchase is realized through borrowing from banks. When the fund has reached a certain level of [[rate of return|return]], capital calls are issued and the borrowing is paid off.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26248">'''Cognitive specialization''' suggests that certain behaviors, often in the domain of social communication, are passed on to offspring and refined to be maximally beneficial by the process of natural selection. Specializations serve an [[adaptive]] purpose for an organism by allowing the organism to be better suited for its habitat. Over time, specializations often become essential to the species' continued survival.  Cognitive specialization in humans has been thought to underlie the acquisition, development, and evolution of [[language]], [[theory of mind]], and specific social skills such as [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]]. These specializations are considered to be critical to the survival of the species, even though there are successful individuals who lack certain specializations, including those diagnosed with [[autism spectrum disorder]] or who lack language abilities.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995"&gt;Povinelli D., Preuss T (1995). Theory of mind: evolutionary history of a cognitive specialization, Trends in Neurosciences, Volume 18, Issue 9, Pages 418–424, ISSN 0166-2236, doi:10.1016/0166-2236(95)93939-U. {{PMID|7482808}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive specialization is also believed to underlie adaptive behaviors such as [[self-awareness]], [[navigation]], and problem solving skills in several animal species such as [[chimpanzees]] and [[bottlenose dolphins]].

== Background ==
First studied as an adaptive mechanism specific to humans,&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; cognitive specialization has since evolved to encompass many behaviors in the social realm. Organisms have evolved over millions of years to become well-adapted to their [[habitats]]; this requires becoming specialized in behaviors that improve an organism’s likelihood of survival and reproduction. Not to be confused with [[functional specialization (brain)|functional specialization]], which examines the specific parts of the brain that are engaged during specific behaviors or processes,&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, B. Z., &amp; Cantlon, J. F. (2011). The specialization of function: Cognitive and neural perspectives. Cognitive neuropsychology, 28(3–4), 147–155. doi:10.1080/02643294.2011.633504 {{PMID|22185234}}&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive specialization is focused on characteristics of the mind (an internal entity), which in turn affects external behaviors. Most of these specializations are thought to have developed in areas of the [[neocortex]] unique to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1994). The language instinct: The new science of language and mind (Vol. 7529). Penguin UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant cognitive specializations among humans include theory of mind and language acquisition and production, while non-human animals may specialize in [[foraging]] behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Toth, A. Robinson, G. (2007). Evo-devo and the evolution of social behavior, Trends in Genetics, Volume 23, Issue 7, Pages 334–341, ISSN 0168-9525 doi: 10.1016/j.tig.2007.05.001 {{PMID|17509723}}&lt;/ref&gt; self-awareness, or other adaptive abilities.

== Social behavior ==
Social communication is critical to effective human interaction, and has evolved over time to support the complex exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., Cosmides, L., &amp; Price, M. E. (2006). Cognitive adaptations for n‐person exchange: the evolutionary roots of organizational behavior. Managerial and Decision Economics, 27(2–3), 103–129. {{PMID|23814325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, S. (2006). Cognition at the heart of human interaction. Discourse Studies, 8(1), 85–93&lt;/ref&gt; Some social behaviors, such as helping and [[wikt:altruism|altruism]], are largely unique to humans and are instrumental in ensuring the survival of the species.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, H. C., Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (2010) Coevolution of cooperation, causal cognition and mindreading. Communicative &amp; integrative biology, 3(6), 522–4. {{PMID|21331228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] argue that the human mind contains "specialized mechanisms" that were designed by natural selection to facilitate social communication and exchange.&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992"&gt;Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive adaptations for social exchange. The adapted mind, 163–228. doi: 10.1073/pnas.122352999&lt;/ref&gt; Without this specialized "[[algorithm]]",&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992" /&gt; Cosmides and Tooby claim, social exchange among humans would be closer to that of our closest evolutionary ancestors, the great apes. In addition to humans' broad abilities supporting positive social interaction, Stone et al. (2002) put forth evidence for more specific specializations including "cheater detection" and "precautionary reasoning," both of which appear to serve strong adaptive purposes by allowing humans to share resources with only those who are likely to share with them in the future, and avoid sharing resources with untrustworthy individuals.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;Stone, V. E., Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., Kroll, N., &amp; Knight, R. T. (2002) Selective impairment of reasoning about social exchange in a patient with bilateral limbic system damage. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99(17), 11531–11536. doi  10.1073/pnas.122352699 {{PMID|12177408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the adaptiveness of social communication has been examined in children, adults, and older adults,&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli, D. J., Prince, C. G., &amp; Preuss, T. M. (2005). Parent-Offspring Conﬂict and the Development of Social Understanding. The Innate Mind: Structure and Contents: Structure and Contents, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; across cultures,&lt;ref name="Shiw"&gt;Sugiyama, L. S., Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (2002). Cross-cultural evidence of cognitive adaptations for social exchange among the Shiwiar of Ecuadorian Amazonia. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99(17), 11537–11542. doi 10.1073/pnas.122352999 {{PMID|12177409}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[neuropsychiatric]] populations.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;

=== Evidence for universality ===
If social behavior is to be considered a cognitive specialization unique to human neural architecture, it should be present in every human society.&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; To provide cross-cultual evidence that cognitive adaptations specifically support social communication, Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosmides  investigated social reasoning in a tribe in the Ecuadorian Amazon.&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; The Shiwiar, who are a hunter-horticulturalist group previously unexposed to the presented psychological stimuli, were "as highly proficient" in determining who cheated in a given situation as their counterparts in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; This performance indicates that social communication, at least in the domain of cheater detection, is not determined by one's culture. According to Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosimdes, the social "algorithms" discussed above are present in both Western and non-Western populations, providing strong evidence for the universality of such a skill.&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt;

== Theory of mind ==
[[Theory of mind]], or the ability to attribute mental states to other people, is thought to be a cognitive specialization unique to humans, with a few possible exceptions discussed below.&lt;ref&gt;Heyes, C.M. (1998). Theory of mind in nonhuman primates. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp 101-114. doi 10.1017/s0140525x98000703 {{PMID|10097012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jellema, T., Baker, C. I., Wicker, B., &amp; Perrett, D. I. (2000). Neural representation for the perception of the intentionality of actions. Brain and cognition, 44(2), 280–302. doi 10.1006/brcg.2000.1231 {{PMID|11041992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind is thought to be critical in social cognition and communication because it allows us to distinguish between [[Vagrancy (biology)|accidental]] and purposeful actions, to make judgments about others' internal states, and to determine how another's thoughts may differ from our own.&lt;ref name ="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; The acquisition of theory of mind in humans mostly takes place during early childhood, and is thought to be fully developed by the early school years.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., Cross, D., &amp; Watson, J. (2001). Meta‐analysis of theory‐of‐mind development: the truth about false belief. Child development, 72(3), 655–684. {{PMID|11405571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind research in [[chimpanzees]] by social psychologists [[David Premack]] and Guy Woodruff in 1978 brought it to the forefront of psychological inquiry, though true theory of mind is only thought to exist in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, D., and Woodruff, G. (1978). Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind? Behav. Sci. 4: 515–526&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been analyzed in many fields, and it is thought to be among the most beneficial specializations for survival of the human species, due to its facilitation of [[cooperation]] and interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1999). How the mind works. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 882(1), 119–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In autism ===
Theory of mind appears to be lacking in children with [[autism| autism spectrum disorders]], and this deficit is thought to be a major contributor to frequent impairments in some areas of social understanding in people with autism.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20&amp;%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that a [[developmental delay]] in (or absence of) theory of mind can impair social functioning—a skill imperative in the survival of the human species—is argued to be evidence for theory of mind as an adaptive cognitive specialization.&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; Understanding that others may be thinking different thoughts than I am (colloquially, "putting oneself in another person's shoes") allows humans to communicate effectively and to live in large [[social groups]]. This adaptability is what makes theory of mind a cognitive specialization, rather than just another byproduct of [[human evolution]]: humankind has unique and beneficial communication skills, and this is partially due to our ability to recognize that other people may not think or know the same things we do.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt;

== Language ==
Though some (including Bates et al.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, E., Thal, D., &amp; Marchman, V. (1991). Symbols and syntax: A Darwinian approach to language development. Biological and behavioral determinants of language development, 29, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2003). Language as an adaptation to the cognitive niche. STUDIES IN THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE, 3, 16–37.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that language arose as a byproduct of the evolution of humans' general cognitive abilities, [[Steven Pinker]] argues that it is, on its own, an adaptive mechanism. Drawing on existing literature and theory, he proposes several types of evidence for this claim, including the universality and [[ontogeny]] of language. Pinker also uses the [[double dissociation]] between general intelligence and language to argue for language as a specific adaptation. Those who lose language capabilities due to [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[stroke]] but maintain many other cognitive abilities exemplify Pinker's idea that language and general cognition are not always perfectly overlapping in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pink" /&gt; Using language "multiplies the benefit of knowledge" in multiple domains, including technology, tool use, and intentions of ourselves and others.&lt;ref name="Pink" /&gt;

=== Evolution ===
Arbib puts forth a hypothesis that [[mirror neurons]] in the primate brain were a precursor to language abilities in humans.&lt;ref name="Arbib"&gt;Arbib, M. A. (2005). From monkey-like action recognition to human language: An evolutionary framework for neurolinguistics. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 28(02), 105–124 {{PMID|16201457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without these neurons in [[Broca's area]] in humans (which is analogous to F5 in monkeys), Arbib claims, we could not have evolved a specialization for language—which is used to explain why non-human animals do not have linguistic capabilities.&lt;ref name="Arbib" /&gt; In addition, Meguerditchian and Vauclair have argued that our evolutionary ancestors' communicative [[gestures]] (such as threat gestures and "food begs" among [[baboons]]) established a foundation on which to build human language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Meguerditchian, A., &amp; Vauclair, J. (2009). Contrast of hand preferences between communicative gestures and non-communicative actions in baboons: Implications for the origins of hemispheric specialization for language. Brain and language, 108(3), 167–174. {{PMID|19091390}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior was selected for, built upon, and modified, leading to the capabilities humans have today. Early theories explained early language as an adaptive way to communicate during a [[hunting|hunt]], but recent research has focused on [[ecological]] theories that incorporate social demands; or, as Flinn et al. put it, a "social [[arms race]]" against non-human primates.&lt;ref name = Flinn&gt;Flinn, M. V., Geary, D. C., &amp; Ward, C. V. (2005). Ecological dominance, social competition, and coalitionary arms races: Why humans evolved extraordinary intelligence. Evolution and Human Behavior, 26(1), 10–46.&lt;/ref&gt; As a behavior selected for over the long term, with many successful "intermediary stages," human language differs from all other social behaviors among chimpanzees, which are thought to be more gradual in their evolutionary development.&lt;ref name="Flinn" /&gt; Further evidence for language as a cognitive specialization includes Ferreira et al.'s finding that some parts of language (for instance, [[syntax]]) can be spared in [[amnesia]], while other abilities (like [[memory]] retention) are drastically reduced.&lt;ref name="Fer"&gt;Ferreira, V. S., Bock, K., Wilson, M. P., &amp; Cohen, N. J. (2008). Memory for syntax despite amnesia. Psychological science, 19(9), 940–946. {{PMID|18947361}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and similar dissociations support the theory that specific neural architecture, which has evolved over time, supports language function.&lt;ref name="Fer" /&gt;

=== Universal Grammar ===
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] proposed a biological component of language, which he termed [[Universal Grammar]].&lt;ref name="Chom"&gt;Chomsky, N. (1972). Language and mind (p. 100). New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chomsky, an essential part of language processing is hard-wired into the human brain. This allows language to be produced with or without specific linguistic instruction (which is closely associated with the [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument).&lt;ref name="Chom" /&gt;  All humans—and only humans—have this biological trait, but building blocks of universal grammar have been reported in other species.&lt;ref&gt;Marc D. Hauser; Noam Chomsky; W. Tecumseh Fitch (November 22, 2002). "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?". Science 298 (5598): 1569–1579. doi 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569. {{PMID|12446899}} {{PMID|12446899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackendoff argues that Universal Grammar is itself a "pre-existing cognitive specialization":&lt;ref name="Jack"&gt;Jackendoff, R. (2001). Language in the ecology of mind. The Routledge companion to semiotics and linguistics, 52–65.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than needing explicit instruction on how to speak their native language, or having [[vocabulary]] and syntactical rules of a specific language present in their brains from birth, children seem to be [[genetically]] pre-disposed to ''learn'' language.&lt;ref name="Jack" /&gt; Complementary to the connection made between area F5 in macaques' brains,&lt;ref name="Arbib" /&gt; the theory of Universal Grammar allows for an evolutionary perspective on language use as a cognitive specialization. There is some controversy, however, on whether or not Universal Grammar can have evolved by standard Darwinian evolutionary principles, or must be explained using different mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hinzen, Wolfram (September 2012). "The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar". Language Sciences 34 (5): 635–649. doi:10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
According to Nowak and Sigmund, language is essential to human life as we know it.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;Nowak, M. A., &amp; Sigmund, K. (2005). Evolution of indirect reciprocity. Nature, 437(7063), 1291–1298 {{PMID|16251955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the ability to verbally communicate with members of our social group, there would be no [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] (that is, returning of favors), and no way to cooperate with one another for a greater good.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt; Some have argued that unique aspects of human language have evolved for unexpectedly beneficial reasons, besides simply asking for help or sharing information about the world. [[Gossip]], viewed by many &lt;ref name="gossip"&gt;Miller, G. (2011). The mating mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature. Random House LLC. doi:10.1525/aa.2001.103.4.1196&lt;/ref&gt; to be a superfluous aspect of human communication, may even serve an adaptive purpose. The spread of information about other people, even if it is malicious, may serve as an indicator of social intelligence and a way to deter [[wikt:illicit|illicit]] behaviors.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt; Though gossip likely helps some humans and hinders others' [[social standing]], it appears to be an overall benefit of the ability to produce verbal language.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt; Without an overall specialization for language (including such sub-specializations as gossip), [[linguists]] argue, humans would not be able to share information efficiently and effectively.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt;

== Other possible specializations ==
Watson et al. provide support for a specific specialization in language-dependent [[humor]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, K. K., Matthews, B. J., &amp; Allman, J. M. (2007). Brain activation during sight gags and language-dependent humor. Cerebral Cortex, 17(2), 314–324. {{PMID|16514105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[adaptive]] value has both [[extrinsic]] and [[intrinsic]] components: humor facilitates social bonding if shared extrinsically, and provides pleasure if enjoyed in one's own mind. In addition, Johnson-Frey (2003) proposed a unique human specialization for tool use.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Frey, S. H. (2003). What's so special about human tool use?. Neuron, 39(2), 201–204. doi:10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00424-0 {{PMID|12873378}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Johnson-Frey, humans' ability to use tools is based on complex cognitive mechanisms, not just advanced [[motor skill|sensorimotor]] skills. Rather than it being considered a purely physical specialization based only in [[motor areas]] of the brain, Johnson-Frey argues that tool use should be classified as a cognitive phenomenon due to its foundation in cognition. On a more [[philosophical]] level, Boyer (2003) argues that "[[religious]] thought and behavior" is a specialization that originally developed as a by-product of brain function, and its adaptive purposes led to its continued evolution by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P. (2003). Religious thought and behavior as by-products of brain function. Trends in cognitive sciences, 7(3), 119–124. {{PMID|12639693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krueger et al. (2007) have argued that trust, which may form the foundation for helping and altruism and thus the basis of human social interaction, is also a cognitive specialization.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, F., McCabe, K., Moll, J., Kriegeskorte, N., Zahn, R., Strenziok, M., &amp; Grafman, J. (2007). Neural correlates of trust. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(50), 20084–20089. doi 10.1073/pnas.0710103104 {{PMID|18056800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-human specialization ==

=== In non-human primates ===
Humankind’s closest ancestors, the [[great apes]], have evolved a number of specialized behaviors: [[orangutans]] are specialists at climbing trees, while [[chimpanzees]] and [[gorillas]] have evolved to walk on their knuckles.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; However, in considering non-behavioral specializations, Penn et al. (2008) argue that the "profound continuity" [[Charles Darwin]] noted between human and non-human animals in the biological domain is matched by a "profound discontinuity" between human and non-human animal minds.&lt;ref&gt;Penn, D. C., Holyoak, K. J., &amp; Povinelli, D. J. (2008). Darwin's mistake: Explaining the discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31(02), 109–130. {{PMID|18479531}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in addition to cognitive-behavioral adaptations, it is possible that chimpanzees have acquired more socially advanced skills through natural selection, including self-recognition (indicated by chimpanzees' established ability to pass the "[[mirror test]]").&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Heyes (1998). Theory of mind in nonhuman primates. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp 101–114. {{PMID|10097012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task—in which a successful trial is simply one in which an animal recognizes itself in a mirror—is thought to be a basic building block of theory of mind development.&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli, D. J., Eddy, T. J., Hobson, R. P., &amp; Tomasello, M. (1996). What young chimpanzees know about seeing. Monographs of the society for research in child development, i–189. doi 10.2307/1166159 {{PMID|8795292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rhesus monkeys]] have also been shown to realize when they remember certain events and items, which is considered to be an instrumental building block in the formation of social relationships, as one must remember who owes him favors, who he can trust, and who he should avoid in order to prosper in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, R. R. (2001). Rhesus monkeys know when they remember. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98(9), 5359–5362. doi 10.1073/pnas.071600998 {{PMID|11274360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other animals ===
More recent evidence has shown that cognitive specialization is not just present in [[primates]]: domesticated [[dogs]] may show signs of understanding human behavior and communication, indicating a social-cognitive specialization that is argued to make them more likely to receive food, shelter and love from their human owners. Being receptive to human behavioral indicators and responding accordingly has allowed dogs to survive and thrive as a [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Hare, B., Tomasello, M. (2005) Human-like social skills in dogs?, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Volume 9, Issue 9, pages 439–444, ISSN 1364-6613 {{PMID|16061417}} doi 10.1016/j.tics.2005.07.003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bottlenose dolphins]] and [[elephants]] have also been shown to pass the "mirror test" explained above. This indication of some elementary self-awareness provides more evidence for foundational theory of mind skills in organisms throughout the [[Animal|animal kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Marten, K. &amp; Psarakos, S.

{{Rights}}
The '''cultural rights''' movement has provoked attention to protect the rights of groups of people, or their [[culture]], in similar fashion to the manner in which the [[human rights]] movement has brought attention to the needs of individuals throughout the world.

==Protecting a culture==
Cultural Rights are rights related to art and culture, both understood in a large sense. The objective of these rights is to guarantee that people and communities have an access to culture and can participate in the culture of their selection. Cultural rights are human rights that aim at assuring the enjoyment of culture and its components in conditions of equality, human dignity and non-discrimination. They are rights related to themes such as [[linguistic rights|language]]; cultural and artistic production; participation in cultural life; cultural heritage; intellectual property rights; [[cultural diversity|author’s rights]]; [[minority group|minorities]] and access to culture, among others. Focusing less on the preservation of cultures as an end in itself and more on the realization of "ecological" relations between cultural groups as a condition for equitable interactions and the potential for organic cultural change, Meyjes proposes the interchangeable terms cultural justice &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ethno-cultural justice&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|pp=12, 381ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intercultural justice]] — which he defines as the principle of maximally accommodating the culturally-specific values and practices of minority groups and their members, in the form of rights, within the overall legal, regulatory, or policy limits of the institution, community, or society concerned (also see [[universalization]]).

==Ethnic Groups Cultural preservation==
Cultural rights of groups focus on such things as religious and ethnic minorities and indigenous societies that are in danger of disappearing. Cultural rights include a group’s ability to preserve its way of life, such as child rearing, continuation of [[language]], and security of its economic base in the nation, which it is located. The related notion of indigenous '''''intellectual property rights''''' (IPR) has arisen in attempt to conserve each society’s culture base and essentially prevent [[ethnocide]].

The cultural rights movement has been popularized because much traditional cultural knowledge has commercial value, like ethno-medicine, cosmetics, cultivated plants, foods, [[folklore]], arts, crafts, songs, dances, costumes, and [[rituals]]. Studying ancient cultures may reveal evidence about the history of the human race and shed more light on our origin and successive cultural development. However, the study, sharing and commercialization of such cultural aspects can be hard to achieve without infringing upon the cultural rights of those who are a part of that culture.

Cultural rights should be taken into consideration also by local policies. In that sense, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]], the first document with worldwide mission that advocates establishing the groundwork of an undertaking by cities and local governments for cultural development, includes as cultural rights as one of the principles and states: “''Local governments recognize that cultural rights are an integral part of human rights, taking as their reference the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948)''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenda21culture.net Agenda 21 for culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural anthropology==
"Cultural rights are vested not in individuals but in groups, such as religious and ethnic [[minority group|minorities]] and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies." All cultures are brought up differently, therefore cultural rights include a group's ability to preserve its culture, to raise its children in the ways it forebears, to continue its language, and to not be deprived of its economic base by the nation in which it is located." Anthropologists sometimes choose not to study some cultures beliefs and rights, because they believe that it may cause misbehavior, and they choose not to turn against different diversities of cultures. Although anthropologists sometimes do turn away from studying different cultures they still depend a lot on what they study at different archaeological sites.

{{Antisemitism}}

'''David Ernest Duke''' (born July 1, 1950) is an American [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[politician]], [[white separatist]], [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|antisemitic conspiracy theorist]], [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]], [[convicted felon]], and former [[Grand Wizard]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

A former [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana State Representative]], Duke was a candidate in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1988|Democratic presidential primaries in 1988]] and the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1992|Republican presidential primaries in 1992]]. Duke also ran unsuccessfully for the [[Louisiana State Senate]], [[United States Senate]], [[United States House of Representatives]], and for [[List of Governors of Louisiana|Governor of Louisiana]].

In 2002, Duke pled guilty to felony fraud. Specifically, he defrauded his political supporters by pretending to be in dire financial straits, and asking them for money to help him pay for basic necessities. At the time, Duke was financially secure, and he used his supporters' money for recreational gambling.&lt;ref name="guilty" /&gt; He subsequently served a 15-month sentence at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Big Spring]] in Texas.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,80944,00.html David Duke Gets 15-Month Sentence for Fraud] Fox News Channel&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke speaks against what he alleges as Jewish control of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]], the [[United States federal government|U.S. federal government]], and the media.  Duke supports the preservation of what he considers to be [[Western culture]] and [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] Christian [[family values#United States|family values]], as well as [[tax resistance|abolition]] of the [[Internal Revenue Service]], voluntary [[racial segregation]], [[anti-communism]], and [[white separatism]].&lt;ref name="duke_ma_39"&gt;{{cite web |last = Duke |first = David |title = An Aryan Vision |website = My Awakening |publisher = SolarGeneral |url = http://www.solargeneral.com/library/ma/39.html |accessdate = November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Duke |first = David |title = Kayla Rolland: One More Victim |date = October 23, 2004 |url = http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=21 |accessdate = November 13, 2006 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029061208/http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=21 |archivedate = October 29, 2006 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = David Duke: In His Own Words / On Segregation |publisher = Anti-Defamation League |url = http://www.adl.org/special_reports/duke_own_words/on_segregation.asp |accessdate = November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Duke was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]], to Alice Maxine (Crick) and David Hedger Duke. As the son of an engineer for [[Shell Oil Company]], Duke frequently moved with his family around the world. They lived a short time in the Netherlands before settling in [[Louisiana]]. In the late 1960s, Duke met [[William Luther Pierce]], the leader of the white nationalist, [[neo-Nazi]], [[Holocaust denial]] and antisemitic [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], who would remain a lifelong influence on him. Duke joined the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Issues '92 Profile: David Duke; ''[[The Orange County Register]]''. [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], [[California]]: March 2, 1992. pp. a.04&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Duke enrolled at [[Louisiana State University]] (LSU) in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], and in 1970, he formed a [[White people|white]] student group called the ''White Youth Alliance'' that was affiliated with the [[American Nazi Party|National Socialist White People's Party]]. The same year, to protest lawyer [[William Kunstler]]'s appearance at [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]], Duke appeared at a demonstration in [[Nazism|Nazi]] uniform. Picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s birth, he became known on the LSU campus for wearing a Nazi uniform.&lt;ref name="rise"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The Rise of David Duke|year=1995|publisher=University of Mississippi Press|isbn=978-0-87805-678-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke says that he spent nine months in Laos, calling it a "normal tour of duty." He actually went to Laos in order to join his father, who was working there and had asked him to visit during the summer of 1971.&lt;ref name="Bridges 1995 26–29"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The Rise of David Duke|year=1995|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-0-87805-684-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X2WD3EnAVvEC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=%22David+Duke%E2%80%8E;%22++vietnam#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%20%20vietnam|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father helped him gain a job teaching English to Laotian military officers, from which he was dismissed after six weeks when he drew a [[Molotov cocktail]] on the blackboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=B.G.|last=Burkett|title=Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation was robbed of its heroes and history|publisher=Verity Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xd0DAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=stole+valor|isbn=978-0-9667036-0-3|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to have gone behind enemy lines 20 times at night to drop rice to anti-communist insurgents in planes flying {{convert|10|ft|m}} off the ground, narrowly avoiding receiving a shrapnel wound. Two [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] pilots who were in Laos at that time said that the planes only flew during the day and that they also flew no less than {{convert|500|ft|m}} from the ground. One pilot suggested that it might have been possible for Duke to have gone on a safe "milk run" once or twice but no more than that. Duke was also unable to recall the name of the airfield that he had used.&lt;ref name="Bridges 1995 26–29" /&gt;

Duke graduated from LSU in 1974. Shortly after graduation, Duke founded the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (KKKK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/david-duke|title=David Duke|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972 arrest in New Orleans===
In January 1972, Duke was arrested in New Orleans for "[[Riot|inciting a riot]]". Several racial confrontations broke out that month in the Crescent City, including one at the [[Robert E. Lee Monument (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Robert E. Lee Monument]] involving Duke, [[Addison Roswell Thompson]]—a perennial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]] candidate for [[governor of Louisiana]] and [[mayor of New Orleans]]—and his 89-year-old friend and mentor, Rene LaCoste (not to be confused with the French [[tennis]] player [[René Lacoste]]). Thompson and LaCoste dressed in Klan robes for the occasion and placed a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] flag at the monument. The [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] began throwing bricks at the pair, but police arrived in time to prevent serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2-84635lwKYC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=a+roswell+thompson

== Political and ideological activities ==

=== Early campaigns ===
Duke first ran for the Louisiana Senate as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from a [[Baton Rouge]] district in 1975. During his campaign, he was allowed to speak on the college campuses of [[Vanderbilt University]], [[Indiana University]], the [[University of Southern California]], [[Stanford University]], and [[Tulane University]].&lt;ref name="imperialwizardofkkk"&gt;{{cite news|title=David Ernest Duke: 'My race has never been defeated, and we will not fall this time.' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/67860148/?terms=%22vanderbilt%2Buniversity%22%2B%22ku%2Bklux%2Bklan%22 |newspaper=The Daily Tar Heel (Chapel Hill, North Carolina) |date=January 20, 1975 |page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = July 15, 2015 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received 11,079 votes, one-third of those cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wayne King|title=David Duke:Cleaning up the Klan's image |date=November 25, 1975|work=St. Petersburg Times via New York Times|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JjIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UF8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4666,22684&amp;dq=david-duke|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1979, he ran as a Democrat for the 10th District Senate seat and finished second in a three-candidate race with 9,897 votes (26%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=328064 |title=Our Campaigns – LA State Senate 10 Race – October 27, 1979 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, Duke was accused by several Klan officials of stealing the organization's money. "Duke is nothing but a con artist", Jack Gregory, Duke's Florida state leader, told the ''Clearwater Sun'' after Duke allegedly refused to turn over proceeds from a series of 1979 Klan rallies to the Knights. Another Klan official under Duke, Jerry Dutton, told reporters that Duke had used Klan funds to purchase and refurbish his home in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]]. Duke later justified the repairs by saying most of his home was used by the Klan.

In 1979, after his first, abortive run for president (as a Democrat) and a series of highly publicized violent Klan incidents, Duke quietly [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] the nonprofit [[National Association for the Advancement of White People]] (NAAWP) in an attempt to leave the baggage of the Klan behind.

Duke allegedly conducted a direct-mail appeal in 1987, using the identity and mailing-list of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[Nationalist Movement|Forsyth County Defense League]] without permission. League officials described it as a fundraising scam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin A.

=== 1988 presidential campaign ===
{{main|David Duke presidential campaign, 1988}}

In 1988, Duke ran initially in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential [[primary election|primaries]]. His campaign had limited impact, with the only exception—winning the little-known [[New Hampshire primary#Vice-Presidential results|New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=393638 |title=Our Campaigns – D Primary Race – February 16, 1988 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke, having failed to gain much traction as a Democrat, then sought and gained the [[President of the United States|Presidential]] nomination of the [[Populist Party (United States, 1984)|Populist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=294226|title=Our Campaigns - US President - Pop Convention Race|date=March 11, 1988|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on the ballot for president in 11 states and was a write-in candidate in some other states, some with Trenton Stokes of [[Arkansas]] for vice president, and on other state ballots with Floyd Parker, a [[physician]] from [[New Mexico]],&lt;ref name="Bridges1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The rise of David Duke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2WD3EnAVvEC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=1 December 2011|year=1994|publisher=Univ.

=== 1989: Successful run in special election for Louisiana House seat ===
In December 1988, Duke changed his political affiliation from the Democratic Party to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=Zatarain&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CXzQ2VSpyZsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=John+Treen+of+Louisiana&amp;q=John%20Treen%20of%20Louisiana|title=Michael Zatarain, ''David Duke: Evolution of a Klansman''|accessdate=November 11, 2009|isbn=978-0-88289-817-9|author1=Zatarain, Michael|date=July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Republican State Representative [[Charles Cusimano]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] resigned his District 81 seat to become a 24th Judicial District Court judge, and a [[special election]] was called early in 1989 to select a successor. Duke entered the race to succeed Cusimano and faced several opponents, including fellow Republicans [[John S. Treen|John Spier Treen]], a brother of former [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[David C. Treen]]; Delton Charles, a school board member; and [[Roger F. Villere, Jr.]], who operates Villere's Florist in Metairie. Duke finished first in the primary with 3,995 votes (33.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=328066|title=Louisiana State Representative Election, 1989|publisher=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As no one received a majority of the vote in the first round, a [[runoff election]] was required between Duke and Treen, who polled 2,277 votes (18.9%) in the first round of balloting. Treen's candidacy was endorsed by U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]], former President [[Ronald Reagan]], and other notable Republicans,&lt;ref&gt;"GOP Condemns Duke" ''[[Newsday]]''. Long Island, N.Y.: February 25, 1989, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Democrats [[Victor Bussie]] (president of the Louisiana [[AFL-CIO]]) and [[Edward J. Steimel]] (president of the [[Louisiana Association of Business and Industry]] and former director of the "good government" [[think tank]], the Public Affairs Research Council). Duke, however, hammered Treen on a statement the latter had made indicating a willingness to entertain higher [[property tax]]es, anathema in that suburban district.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas D.

Freshman legislator [[Odon Bacqué]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], a [[Independent (politics)|No Party]] member of the House, stood alone in 1989 when he attempted to deny seating to Duke on the grounds that the incoming representative had resided outside his district at the time of his election. When Treen failed in a court challenge in regard to Duke's residency, Duke was seated. Lawmakers who opposed Duke said that they had to defer to his constituents, who narrowly chose Duke as representative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Gomez]], "David Duke? He's Just Another Freshman", ''My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative'', [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Louisiana]]: Zemog Publishing, 2000, pp. 157-164; {{ISBN|0-9700156-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As state representative===
Duke took his seat on the same day as [[Jerry Luke LeBlanc]] of [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette Parish]] (who won another special election, held on the same day as the Duke-Treen runoff, to choose a successor to [[Kathleen Blanco]]), the future governor who was elected to the [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]. Duke and LeBlanc were sworn in separately.

Colleague [[Ron Gomez]] of Lafayette stated that Duke, as a short-term legislator, was "so single minded, he never really became involved in the nuts and bolts of House rules and parliamentary procedure. It was just that shortcoming that led to the demise of most of his attempts at lawmaking."&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator'', pg. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

One legislative issue pushed by Duke was the requirement that [[welfare]] recipients be tested for the use of [[narcotics]]. The recipients had to show themselves to be drug-free to receive state and federal benefits under his proposal.&lt;ref&gt;"Duke welfare bill wins panel favor," ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', May 9, 1989, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez, a longtime journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke in the mid-1970s when Duke was a state senate candidate:&lt;blockquote&gt;He was still in his mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', p. 228. Gomez has implied that Duke had a facelift by the time he entered the legislature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Joshua Benton|Benton, Joshua]]|title=National: David Duke Reverts to Unabashed Racism in Congress run |date=May 1, 1999|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|publisher=Block News Alliance|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/19990501davidduke3.asp|accessdate=September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gullixson|first=Paul|title=Part 4: Taking on David Duke|date=April 12, 1995|work=Palo Alto Weekly|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/page4/1995_Apr_12.NOTES12.html|accessdate=September 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez, in his 2000 autobiography, wrote about Duke:&lt;blockquote&gt;He once presented a bill on the floor, one of the few which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up the aisle to his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Gomez, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pgs. 231-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez added that Duke's "tenure in the House was short and uninspired. Never has anyone parlayed an election by such a narrow margin to such a minor position to such international prominence. He has run for numerous other positions without success but has always had some effect, usually negative, on the outcome."&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pg. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez continued: &lt;blockquote&gt;[Duke's] new message was that he had left the Klan, shed the Nazi uniform he had proudly worn in many previous appearances, and only wanted to serve the people. He eliminated his high-octane anti-Semitic rhetoric. He was particularly concerned with the plight of "European-Americans." He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the "growing underclass." He used the tried and true demagoguery of [[class envy]] to sell his message: excessive taxpayers' money spent on welfare, school busing practices, [[affirmative action]]... and set-aside programs. He also embraced a subject near and dear to every Jefferson Parish voter, protection of the [[homestead exemption]].&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Duke launched unsuccessful campaigns for the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1990 and governor in 1991. Villere did not again seek office but instead concentrated his political activity within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] organization.&lt;ref name=sabludowsky&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Politics/Jindal_Has_Mighty_Duke_In_Louisiana_GOP_and_Roger_Villere__9076.asp |title=Stephen Sabludowsky, "Jindal Has Mighty Duke in Louisiana GOP and Roger Villere" |publisher=bayoubuzz.com |accessdate=November 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701031015/http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Politics/Jindal_Has_Mighty_Duke_In_Louisiana_GOP_and_Roger_Villere__9076.asp |archivedate=July 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990 campaign for U.S. Senate ===
{{Main|United States Senate election in Louisiana, 1990}}

Duke has often criticized federal policies that he believes discriminate against white people in favor of racial minorities. To that end he formed the controversial group the National Association for the Advancement of White People, a play on the African American civil rights group, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]].&lt;ref&gt;"Duke undecided on Senate race", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', November 6, 1989, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Duke had first hesitated about entering the Senate race, he made his announcement of candidacy for the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 6, 1990. Duke was the only Republican in competition against three Democrats, including incumbent U.S. Senator [[Bennett Johnston, Jr.|J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.]], of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3516 |title=Our Campaigns – LA US Senate Race – October 6, 1990 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom Duke derided as "J. Benedict Johnston".&lt;ref&gt;"Can Johnston be beaten?", ''Minden Press-Herald'', November 19, 1989, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Governor [[David Treen]], whose brother, John Treen, Duke had defeated for state representative in 1989, called Duke's senatorial platform "garbage. ... I  think he is bad for our party because of his espousal of [[Nazi]]sm and racial superiority."&lt;ref&gt;"Treen: Renounce David Duke's 'garbage'", ''Minden Press-Herald'', December 22, 1989, p. 7A&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican Party officially endorsed state Senator [[Ben Bagert]] of New Orleans in a state convention on January 13, 1990, but national GOP officials in October, just days before the primary election, concluded that Bagert could not win. To avoid a runoff between Duke and Bagert, the GOP decided to surrender the primary to Johnston. Funding for Bagert's campaign was halted, and after initial protest, Bagert dropped out two days before the election. With such a late withdrawal, Bagert's name remained on the ballot, but his votes, most of which were presumably cast as absentee ballots, were not counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Republican quits to help Democrat |author=Kevin McGill |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nwghAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gXYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3886,613940&amp;dq=duke+1990+not+endorsed |newspaper=The Hour |date=October 5, 1990 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Louisiana Republican Quits, Reducing Duke's Chances|date=October 5, 1990|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke received 43.51 percent (607,391 votes) of the primary vote to Johnston's 53.93 percent (752,902 votes).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Duke's views prompted some of his critics, including Republicans such as journalist [[Quin Hillyer]], to form the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, which directed media attention to Duke's statements of hostility to blacks and [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Monteverde|first=Danny|title=Elizabeth Rickey, GOP activist|newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=September 15, 2009|url=http://www.nola.com/obituaries/t-p/index.ssf?/base/obits-33/125299209991370.xml&amp;coll=2|accessdate=September 15, 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 ''[[Financial Times]]'' editorial, [[Gideon Rachman]] recalled interviewing Duke's 1990 campaign manager, who said, "The Jews just aren't a big issue in Louisiana. We keep telling David, stick to attacking the blacks.

In the primary, Duke finished second to former governor [[Edwin W. Edwards]] in votes; thus, he faced Edwards in a runoff. In the initial round, Duke received 32% of the vote. Incumbent Governor [[Buddy Roemer]], who had switched from the Democratic to Republican parties during his term, came in third with 27% of the vote. Duke effectively killed Roemer's bid for re-election. While Duke had a sizable core constituency of devoted supporters, many voted for him as a "protest vote" to register dissatisfaction with Louisiana's establishment politicians. In response to criticism for his past white supremacist activities, Duke's stock response was to apologize for his past and declare that he was a born-again Christian.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-24/opinion/op-92_1_duke-blacks-louisiana |title=Duke Gets His Comeuppance From the Victims of His Hate Message : Politics: Up until an amazing TV exchange, Louisiana's blacks had remained on the sidelines.

The [[Christian Coalition of America]], which exerted considerable impact on the Republican State Central Committee, was led in Louisiana by its national director and vice president, [[Billy McCormack (Louisiana pastor)|Billy McCormack]], then the pastor of University Worship Center in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. The coalition was accused of having failed to investigate Duke in the early part of his political resurgence. By the time of the 1991 gubernatorial election, however, its leadership had withdrawn support from Duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theocracywatch.org/clarkson_inside.html|title=Frederick Clarkson, "Church and State", November 1993|publisher=theocracywatch.org|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Duke's status as the only Republican in the runoff, incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush]] (a Republican) opposed his candidacy and denounced him as a charlatan and a racist.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; White House Chief of Staff [[John H. Sununu]] stated that "The President is absolutely opposed to the kind of racist statements that have come out of David Duke now and in the past."&lt;ref&gt;West, Paul. (October 21, 1991).

The Louisiana Coalition against Racism and Nazism rallied against Duke's gubernatorial campaign. [[Beth Rickey]], a moderate member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee and a PhD student at [[Tulane University]], began to follow Duke to record his speeches and expose what she saw as instances of racist and neo-Nazi remarks. For a time, Duke took Rickey to lunch, introduced her to his daughters, telephoned her late at night, and tried to convince her of his worldview: the Holocaust was a myth, notorious [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] physician [[Josef Mengele]] was a medical genius, and that blacks and Jews were responsible for various social ills.  Rickey released transcripts of their conversations to the press and also provided evidence establishing that Duke sold Nazi literature (including ''[[Mein Kampf]]'') from his legislative office and attended neo-Nazi political gatherings while he held elective office.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Kenneth (September 16, 2009).

Between the primary and the runoff, called the "general election" under Louisiana election rules (in which all candidates run on one ballot, regardless of party), [[white supremacist]] organizations from around the country contributed to Duke's campaign fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Martin A.|title=Detailing David Duke|year=2003|website=Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=27|accessdate=August 31, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002073754/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=27|archive-date=October 2, 2006|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Duke: In His Own Words|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/duke_own_words/duke_intro.asp|accessdate=August 31, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831083918/http://www.adl.org/special_reports/duke_own_words/duke_intro.asp|archivedate=August 31, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke's rise garnered national media attention. While he gained the backing of the [[Quixotism|quixotic]] former [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]] Mayor [[John K. Snyder]], Duke won few serious endorsements in Louisiana. Celebrities and organizations donated thousands of dollars to former Governor [[Edwin Edwards]]' campaign. Referencing Edwards' long-standing problem with accusations of corruption, popular bumper stickers read: "Vote for the Crook. It's Important",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Appelbome|first=Peter|title=An Epoch Is Ending But Why?|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/08/us/an-epoch-is-ending-but-why.html|accessdate=January 16, 2011|date=June 8, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.nola.com/tpphotos/2011/12/175duke.html Photo of bumper sticker] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925004604/http://photos.nola.com/tpphotos/2011/12/175duke.html |date=September 25, 2012 }}, New Orleans, ''The Times-Picayune''&lt;/ref&gt; and "Vote for the Lizard, not the Wizard." When a reporter asked Edwards what he needed to do to triumph over Duke, Edwards replied with a smile: "Stay alive."

The runoff debate, held on November 6, 1991, received significant attention when journalist [[Norman Robinson (television news reporter)|Norman Robinson]] questioned Duke. Robinson, who is African-American, told Duke that he was "scared" at the prospect of Duke winning the election because of his history of "diabolical, evil, vile" racist and antisemitic comments, some of which he read to Duke. He then pressed Duke for an apology and when Duke protested that Robinson was not being fair to him, Robinson replied that he didn't think Duke was being honest. [[Jason Berry]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "startling TV" and the "catalyst" for the "overwhelming" turnout of black voters who helped Edwards defeat Duke.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;

Edwards received 1,057,031 votes (61.2%), while Duke's 671,009 votes represented 38.8% of the total. Duke nevertheless claimed victory, saying, "I won my constituency. I won 55% of the white vote", a statistic confirmed by exit polls.&lt;ref name="rise" /&gt;

Duke ran as a Republican in the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992|1992 presidential primaries]], although Republican Party officials tried to block his participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials reject putting Duke on ballot for state primary|first=Edward T.|last=McHugh|work=Telegram &amp; Gazette. |location=Worcester, Mass.|date=December 13, 1991|page=A.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received 119,115 (0.94%) votes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55213 |title=Our Campaigns – US President – R Primaries Race – February 1, 1992 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the primaries, but no delegates to the national convention.

A 1992 film, ''Backlash: Race and the American Dream'', investigated Duke's appeal among some white voters. ''Backlash'' explored the [[Demagogue|demagogic]] issues of Duke's platform, examining his use of black crime, welfare, affirmative action and white supremacy and tied Duke to a legacy of other white backlash politicians, such as [[Lester G. Maddox]] and [[George Wallace]], and the use in the successful 1988 presidential campaign of [[George H. W. Bush]] of these same racially themed hot buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Examining the Appeal of David Duke's Oratory|date=July 10, 1992|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1996 campaign for U.S. Senate ===
{{main|United States Senate election in Louisiana, 1996}}

When Johnston announced his retirement in 1996, Duke ran again for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He polled 141,489 votes (11.5%). Former Republican state representative [[Woody Jenkins]] of Baton Rouge and Democrat [[Mary Landrieu]] of New Orleans, the former state treasurer, went into the general election contest. Duke was fourth in the nine-person, [[Nonpartisan blanket primary|jungle primary]] race.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5DC163EF930A35752C0A96F958260 David Duke Heads North to Raise Money for House Race"] By Michael Janofsky, ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1999 campaign for U.S. House ===
A special election was [[Louisiana's 1st congressional district special election, 1999|held in Louisiana's First Congressional District]] following the sudden resignation of powerful Republican incumbent [[Bob Livingston]] in 1999. Duke sought the seat as a Republican and received 19% of the vote. He finished a close third, thus failing to make the runoff. His candidacy was repudiated by the Republicans.&lt;ref name=livingston&gt;{{cite news|last= Edsall|first=Thomas B.|title=David Duke to Seek Livingston's Seat|work=The Washington Post|date=December 21, 1998|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces99/stories/duke122198.htm|accessdate=September 20, 2008|quote=Yesterday, the party moved quickly once again to disassociate itself from Duke.

=== New Orleans Protocol ===
Duke organized a weekend gathering of "European Nationalists" in [[Kenner, Louisiana]]. In an attempt to overcome the splintering and division in the white nationalist movement that had followed the death of leader [[William Luther Pierce|William Pierce]] in 2002, Duke presented a unity proposal for peace within the movement and a better image for outsiders. His proposal was accepted and is now known as the ''New Orleans Protocol'' (NOP). It pledges adherents to a pan-European outlook, recognizing national and ethnic allegiance, but stressing the value of all European peoples. Signed by and sponsored by a number of white supremacist leaders and organizations, it has three provisions:&lt;ref name="SPLC-2004"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freed from prison, David Duke mounts a comeback |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=477 |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] Intelligence Report, Summer 2004 |access-date=September 21, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194814/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=477 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The New Orleans Protocol | publisher=[[Canadian Heritage Alliance]] website | url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=477 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Zero tolerance for violence.
# Honorable and ethical behavior in relations with other signatory groups. This includes not denouncing others who have signed this protocol. In other words, no enemies on the right.
# Maintaining a high tone in our arguments and public presentations.

Those who signed the pact on May 29, 2004, include Duke, Don Black, [[Paul Fromm (activist)|Paul Fromm]], [[Willis Carto]] (whose Holocaust-denying ''[[Barnes Review]]'' helped sponsor the event), [[Kevin Alfred Strom]], and [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] (signing as an individual, not on behalf of his [[British National Party]]).&lt;ref name="SPLC-2004" /&gt;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]] noted that the "high tone" of the NOP contrasted with statements at the event where the pact was signed, such as Paul Fromm's calling a Muslim woman "a hag in a bag" and Sam Dickson (from the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]], another sponsor) speaking about the "very, very destructive" effect of opposing the Nazis in World War II—opposition that caused people to view Hitler's "normal, healthy racial values" as evil.&lt;ref name="SPLC-2004" /&gt; The SPLC described the NOP as a "smokescreen," saying that "most of the conference participants' ire was directed at what they consider to be a worldwide Jewish conspiracy to destroy the white race through [[immigration]] and [[miscegenation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 2004|title=White Supremacists Target Jews in New Alliance|url=http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=83|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019031428/http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=83|website=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|archivedate=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later political activity ===
Duke joined the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform]] Party in 1999 while working for [[Pat Buchanan]]'s 2000 presidential campaign. Duke and Buchanan would both leave the party after the election.

In 2004, Duke's bodyguard, roommate, and longtime associate Roy Armstrong made a bid for the [[United States House of Representatives]], running as a Democrat, to serve Louisiana's First Congressional District. In the open primary, Armstrong finished second in the six candidate field with 6.69% of the vote, but Republican [[Bobby Jindal]] received 78.40%, thus winning the seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4156 |title=Our Campaigns – LA – District 1 Race – November 2, 2004 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke was the head advisor of Armstrong's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabludowsky |first=Steve |title=David Duke Close Associate Runs for Congress in Race With Indian-American Bobby Jindal |date=August 6, 2004 |publisher=BayouBuzz.com |url=http://www.bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=2044 |accessdate=September 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124153531/http://www.bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=2044 |archivedate=November 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burdeau|first=Cain|title=KKK Leader David Duke's Home is Raided by Federal Agents|date=November 17, 2000|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/KKK-Duke-Home-Raided.htm|accessdate=September 1, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310030504/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/KKK-Duke-Home-Raided.htm|archivedate=March 10, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed that his platform has become the Republican mainstream and added, "I'm overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that I've championed for years." However, Trump's campaign reaffirmed that Trump disavows Duke's support, and Republican organizations said they will not support him "under any circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/politics/david-duke-senate-race/|title=Former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke running for Senate seat in Louisiana|last=Scott|first=Eugene|date=July 23, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 5, 2016, National Public Radio ([[NPR]]) aired an interview between Duke and Steve Inskeep in which Duke claimed that there was widespread racism against European Americans, that they have been subject to vicious attacks in the media, and that Trump's voters were also his voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/05/488802494/former-kkk-leader-david-duke-says-of-course-trump-voters-are-his-voters|title=Former KKK Leader David Duke Says 'Of Course' Trump Voters Are His Voters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2016/08/a-defense-on-steve-inskeeps-interview-with-david-duke/|title=A defense of Steve Inskeep's interview with David Duke|first=Bob|last=Collins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research Inc.|Mason-Dixon]] poll released on October 20, 2016, showed Duke receiving support from 5.1% of voters in the state, barely clearing the 5% requirement for a candidate to be allowed to participate in a November 2 debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/10/john_kennedy_leads_in_latest_l.html|title=John Kennedy leads in latest Louisiana Senate poll; David Duke makes debate cut|author=Richard Rainey|website=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2016-10-20|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran ===
Duke has taken part in Iranian government sponsored events in Iran. In 2006, at the invitation of Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], Duke took part in an [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust|event held in Tehran to question the Holocaust]]. "The Zionists have used the Holocaust as a weapon to deny the rights of the Palestinians and cover up the crimes of Israel," Duke told a gathering of nearly 70 participants in Tehran at Ahmadinejad's invitation. "This conference has an incredible impact on Holocaust studies all over the world," said Duke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/12/13/kkk-david-duke-tells-iran-holocaust-conference-that-gas-chambers-not-used-to.html] KKK's David Duke Tells Iran Holocaust Conference That Gas Chambers Not Used to Kill Jews, Published December 13, 2006, Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Stormfront'' ===
In 1995, [[Don Black (white supremacist)|Don Black]] and Chloê Hardin, Duke's ex-wife, began a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) called ''[[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]''. The website has become a prominent online forum for [[white nationalism]], [[white separatism]], [[holocaust denial]], [[neo-Nazism]], [[hate speech]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/12/5/143556/393 "RedState, White Supremacy, and Responsibility"], ''[[Daily Kos]]'', December 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;[[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,86338,00.html "Circling the Wagons in Georgia"], ''[[Fox News Channel]]'', May 8, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2001/dtv2001-0023.html |title=WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center: Case No. DTV2001-0023 |publisher= World Intellectual Property Organization |date=January 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke is an active user of ''Stormfront'', where he posts articles from his own website and polls forum members for opinions and questions, in particular during his Internet broadcasts. Duke has worked with Don Black on numerous projects, including [[Operation Red Dog]] (the attempted overthrowing of Dominica's government) in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manana.com/dominica.htm Captmike works undercover with the US Government to stop the invasion of the Island Nation of Dominica.] manana.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiancontent.ca/articles/031401reddog.html Operation Red Dog: Canadian neo-Nazis were central to the planned invasion of Dominica in 1981] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519071411/http://www.canadiancontent.ca/articles/031401reddog.html |date=May 19, 2003 }} canadiancontent.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British National Party ===
In 2000, [[Nick Griffin]] (then leader of the [[British National Party]] in the United Kingdom) met with Duke at a seminar with the [[American Friends of the British National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010312173817/http://www.americabnp.net/april.htm|url=http://www.americabnp.net/april.htm|archivedate=March 12, 2001|date=April 2000|title=April Meeting|website=American Friends of the BNP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin said:
{{quote|instead of talking about racial purity, we talk about identity … that means basically to use the saleable words, as I say, freedom, security, identity, democracy.  Nobody can criticise them.

This was widely reported in the media of the United Kingdom, as well as the meeting between Duke and Griffin, following electoral successes made by the party in 2009.&lt;ref name=gun&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6481475.ece|work=[[The Times]]|title=White supremacist gunman James W. von Brunn had links to BNP|first=Kaya|last=Burgess|date=June 12, 2009|accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Indep&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cahal Milmo|author2=Kevin Rawlinson|title=10 things you should know about the BNP when you watch Question Time tonight|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/10-things-you-should-know-about-the-bnp-when-you-watch-question-time-tonight-1806874.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=January 19, 2015|date=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pano&gt;{{cite web|title=PANORAMA: UNDER THE SKIN [Transcript]|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/audio_video/programmes/panorama/transcripts/transcript_25_11_01.txt|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=January 19, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026080017/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/audio_video/programmes/panorama/transcripts/transcript_25_11_01.txt|archivedate=October 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alt-right===
Duke has written in praise of the [[alt-right]], describing one broadcast as "fun and interesting"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidduke.com/incredible-conversation-dr-duke-andrew-anglin-alt-right-revolution-jewish-supremacism/|title=An Incredible Conversation Between Dr. Duke and Andrew Anglin on the Alt Right Revolution Against Jewish Supremacism!|date=June 9, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another as "this great show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidduke.com/patrick-slattery-and-mark-collett-discuss-brexit-the-british-immigration-situation-and-what-can-be-done|title=Dr. Duke interviews Andrew Anglin on Why the Alt-Right is Growing like Wildfire and is Winning!|date=October 3, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[People for the American Way]] reported Duke championing the alt-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/david-duke-donald-trump-speaks-like-an-alt-right-leader/|title=David Duke: Donald Trump Speaks Like An Alt-Right Leader - Right Wing Watch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke described them as "our people" when describing their role in [[Donald Trump]]'s election victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/former-ku-klux-klan-leader-and-us-alt-right-hail-election-result|title=Former Ku Klux Klan leader and US alt-right hail election result|first=Esther|last=Addley|date=November 9, 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also claims that whilst he is not an active member of the alt-right, he is an inspiration for the movement. The ''[[International Business Times]]'' described Duke as having '[[Nazi salute|Zieg-heiling]] acolytes in the so-called "alt-right"'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/decoding-alt-right-how-fringe-white-nationalism-invaded-mainstream-1594035|title=Is Hillary Clinton to blame for the alt-right?

== Publications ==

=== ''Finders-Keepers'' ===
To raise money in 1976, Duke (using the double pseudonym James Konrad and Dorothy Vanderbilt) wrote a [[self-help]] book for women, ''Finders-Keepers: Finding and Keeping the Man You Want''.&lt;ref name="Powell448"&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Lawrence N.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mjfqCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA448|title=Troubled Memory: Anne Levy, the Holocaust, and David Duke's Louisiana|location=Chapel Hill, NC|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2000|page=448|isbn=9780807860489}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contains sexual, diet, fashion, cosmetic and relationship advice, and was published by Arlington Place Books, an offshoot of the National Socialist White People's Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sims|first=Patsy|url=|title=The Klan|location=Lexington, Kentucky|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=–1996|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tulane University]] history professor Lawrence N. Powell, who read a rare copy of the book given to him by journalist Patsy Sims, wrote that it includes advice on vaginal exercises, [[Oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] and advocated adultery. The puritan inclined Klan was shocked by Duke's writing.&lt;ref name="Powell448"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cjr"&gt;{{cite web | last = Amend | first = Jeanne W. | title = The Picayune Catches Up With David Duke |date=January–February 1992 | publisher = Columbia Journalism Review | url = https://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/11886935.html | accessdate = May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adl_dukeprofile"&gt;{{cite web | title = David Duke | publisher = Anti-Defamation League | url = http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/duke.asp | accessdate = September 1, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060831051628/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/duke.asp | archivedate = August 31, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Tyler Bridges, ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' obtained a copy and traced its provenance to Duke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duke Paints a Dark Picture of Jews|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|date=August 26, 1990|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|pages=A7}}&lt;/ref&gt; who compiled the content from women's self-help magazines.&lt;ref name="rise" /&gt; Duke has admitted being Konrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jack|last2=Van Atta|first2=Dale|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/09/17/skeletons-in-dukes-closet-loom-larger/a6c63904-3c6d-46c8-9129-0220325f5804/|title=Skeltons in Duke's Closet Loom Larger|work=The Washington Post|date=September 17, 1990|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''My Awakening'' ===
In 1998, Duke published the autobiographical ''[[My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding]]''. The book details Duke's social philosophies, particularly his reasoning in support of [[Racial segregation|racial separation]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We [Whites] desire to live in our own neighborhoods, go to our own schools, work in our own cities and towns, and ultimately live as one extended family in our own nation. We shall end the racial genocide of integration. We shall work for the eventual establishment of a separate homeland for African Americans, so each race will be free to pursue its own destiny without racial conflicts and ill will.&lt;ref name="duke_ma_39" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Anti-Defamation League book review refers to it as containing racist, antisemitic, sexist and homophobic views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Foxman | first = Abraham | title = David Duke's My Awakening: A Minor League Mein Kampf | date = January 1999 | publisher = Anti-Defamation League | url = http://www.adl.org/opinion/david_duke_review.asp | accessdate = November 16, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061114030826/http://www.adl.org/opinion/david_duke_review.asp | archivedate = November 14, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To raise the money to republish a new, updated edition of ''My Awakening'', Duke instigated a 21-day fundraising drive on November&amp;nbsp;26, 2007, stating he had to raise "$25,344 by a December 17 deadline for the printers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/general/day-1-of-the-21-day-fundraising-drive-for-the-new-updated-edition-of-my-awakening_3162.html The Official Website of Representative David Duke, PhD » Day 1 of the 21 Day Fundraising Drive for the New, Updated Edition of My Awakening] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704203021/http://www.davidduke.com/general/day-1-of-the-21-day-fundraising-drive-for-the-new-updated-edition-of-my-awakening_3162.html |date=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke states the drive was necessary because the work "has become the most important book in the entire world in the effort to awaken our people for our heritage and freedom."

=== ''Jewish Supremacism'' ===
[[File:David Duke and Udo Voigt (2002) cropped.jpg|right|thumb| David Duke (right) and [[Udo Voigt]] (left), the former leader of the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD)]]

In 2001, Duke traveled to Russia to promote his next book, ''Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening to the Jewish Question'', in which he purports to "examine and document elements of ethnic supremacism that have existed in the Jewish community from historical to modern times."&lt;ref name="duke_js_preface"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duke|first=David|title=Jewish Supremacism: Author's Preface|date=December 5, 2005|website=Jewish Supremacism|url=http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=129|accessdate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is dedicated to [[Israel Shahak]], a critical author of what Shahak saw as supremacist religious teachings in Jewish culture. Former [[Boris Yeltsin]] press minister Boris Mironov wrote an introduction for the Russian edition, printed under the title ''The Jewish Question Through the Eyes of an American''.

The ADL office in Moscow urged the Moscow prosecutor to open an investigation into Mironov. The ADL office initiated a letter from Alexander Fedulov, a prominent member of the [[Duma]], to Prosecutor General [[Vladimir Ustinov]], urging a criminal case be opened against the author and the Russian publisher of Duke's book. In his letter, Fedulov described the book as antisemitic and a violation of [[Hate crime|Russian anti-hate crime laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/anti_semitism/duke_russia.html|title=David Duke in Russia|publisher=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around December 2001, the prosecutor's office closed the investigation of Boris Mironov and Jewish Supremacism. In a public letter, [[Yury Biryukov]], First Deputy of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, stated that a [[Psychological evaluation|psychological examination]], which was conducted as a part of the investigation, concluded that the book and the actions of Boris Mironov did not break Russian hate-crime laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorama.ru/works/patr/govpol/gov/01/12/all.html "Закрыто дело Миронова"], Русский вестник, December 19, 2001. Retrieved November 16, 2006. ('''Russian''')]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADL referred to the book as antisemitic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_the_news/White_Supremacy/new_orleans_052005.htm |title=David Duke's European American Conference: Racists Gather in New Orleans |publisher=ADL |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515120720/http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_the_news/White_Supremacy/new_orleans_052005.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; though Duke had denied the claim that the book is motivated by [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Duke, David|url=http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=129|publisher=davidduke.com|title=''Jewish Supremacism'': Author's Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, the book was sold in the main lobby of the building of Russian State [[Duma]] (lower house of parliament).&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; The first printing of 5,000 copies sold out in several weeks.

In 2004, the book was published in the United States. Originally published in English and Russian, the book has subsequently been translated internationally into [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], Hungarian, Spanish&lt;ref name="DavidDuke-1957"&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/general/1957_1957.html The Official Website of Representative David Duke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408144006/http://www.davidduke.com/general/1957_1957.html |date=April 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently (2010) into Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-952-92-8137-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an updated edition was published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/general/my-awakening-chapter-24-the-jewish-role-in-immigration_2518.html Davidduke.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022172900/http://www.davidduke.com/general/my-awakening-chapter-24-the-jewish-role-in-immigration_2518.html |date=October 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Duke purports to be a "fine quality hardback edition with full color dust jacket and it has a new index and a number of timely additions".&lt;ref name="DavidDuke-1957" /&gt;

In 2006, Duke said his views had been "vindicated" with the publication of ''[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]]'' by professors [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]], and said he was "surprised how excellent [the paper] is". Duke dedicated several radio webcasts to the book and the authors comparing it to his work ''Jewish Supremacism'',&lt;ref&gt;Duke, David.

On February 5, 2002, Duke said on his [[Internet radio|Internet broadcast]] that Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] was "the world's worst terrorist" and that [[Mossad]] was involved in the [[September 11 attacks]]. The broadcast said that [[Zionism|Zionists]] were behind the attacks in order to reduce sympathy for [[Muslim]] nations in the West, and that the number of Israelis killed in the attack was lower than it would be under normal circumstances, citing early assessments by ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' and "the legendary involvement of Israeli nationals in businesses at the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]". According to Duke, this indicated that Israeli security services had prior knowledge of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/?p=114&amp;page=1 Ariel Sharon: The terrorist behind the 9-11 Attack!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515010938/http://www.davidduke.com/?p=114&amp;page=1 |date=May 15, 2006 }} by David Duke&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public address in Syria ===
On November 24, 2005, Duke visited [[Damascus]], Syria, addressing a rally broadcast on Syrian television and giving an interview.&lt;ref name="memritv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=941 |title=American White Supremacist David Duke: Israel Makes the Nazi State Look Very Moderate. interview with David Duke on Syrian television |publisher=Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) |date=November 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memritv.org/Search.asp?ACT=S1# |title=Clip of the interview and of Duke's speech to a Syrian rally |publisher=memritv.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the rally, he referred to Israel as a "war-mongering country" and stated that Zionists "occupy most of the American media and now control much of the American government … It is not just the West Bank of Palestine, it is not just the Golan Heights that are occupied by the Zionists, but Washington, D.C., and New York and London and many other capitals of the world." He concluded by stating: "Your fight for freedom is the same as our fight for freedom." In a second interview, he said Israel "makes the [[Nazism|Nazi]] state look very, very moderate." Syrian parliament member [[Mohammad Habash]], leader of the Islamic revivalist movement in Syria, later stated that Duke's visit gave Syrians a "new and very positive view of the average American."&lt;ref name="memritv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=93809 David Duke in Syria: Zionists Occupy Washington, NY and London] by Ezra HaLevi, Arutz Sheva, November 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whoknew.us/archives/images/david_duke_tv.jpg Screenshot] whoknew.us&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comments in the media ===
Since 2005, Duke has appeared three times on ''Current Issues'', a [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]–based television show hosted and produced by Palestinian-American [[Hesham Tillawi]], which has recently been picked up by [[Bridges TV]]. Tillawi gave Duke the opportunity to discourse at length about his beliefs on Jewish supremacism. On a show in October 2005, Duke claimed that Jewish extremists are responsible for undermining the morality of America and are attempting to "wash the world in blood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/hesham_tillawi.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=tillawi Interview with David Duke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529144707/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/hesham_tillawi.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=tillawi |date=May 29, 2006 }} broadcast on "Bridges TV" network&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mearsheimer and Walt's [[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy|paper on the Israel lobby]] appeared in March 2006, Duke praised the paper in a number of articles on his website, on his March 18 web broadcast, and on [[MSNBC]]'s March 21 ''[[Scarborough Country]]'' program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11959495/ 'Scarborough Country' for March 21], show transcript, MSNBC, March 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Sun]]'', Duke said in an email, "It is quite satisfying to see a body in the premier American university essentially come out and validate every major point I have been making since even before the war even started." Duke added that "the task before us is to wrest control of America's foreign policy and critical junctures of media from the [[Jew]]ish extremist [[Neoconservatism|Neocons]] that seek to lead us into what they expectantly call World War IV."

In 2015, after 47 Senate Republicans warned Iran that agreements made with the US that were not ratified by the Senate were liable to be repudiated by a future President, Duke told Fox News' Alan Colmes that the signatories "should become a Jew, put on a yarmulke because they are not Americans, they have sold their soul to the Jewish power in this country and the Jewish power overseas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coffey|first=Chris|url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2015/03/16/david-duke-accuses-gop-of-selling-soul-to-jewish-power-calls-netanyahu-a-crazy-jew/|title=David Duke Accuses GOP of Selling Soul to ‘Jewish Power’, Calls Netanyahu a 'Crazy Jew'|work=The Algemeiner|date=March 16, 2015|access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feldman |first1=Josh |title=David Duke: GOPers Behind Iran Letter Not American, Sold Souls to ‘Jewish Power’ |url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/david-duke-gopers-behind-iran-letter-not-american-sold-souls-to-jewish-power/ |website=Mediaite|date=March 12, 2015|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences ===
{{See also|International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust}}

Duke organized a gathering of European Nationalists who signed the New Orleans Protocol on May 29, 2004. The signatories agreed to avoid infighting among far-right [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racialists]].

On June 3, 2005, Duke co-chaired a conference named "Zionism As the Biggest Threat to Modern Civilization" in Ukraine, sponsored by the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management. The conference was attended by several notable Ukrainian public figures and politicians, and writer [[Israel Shamir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/NR/exeres/B74CD7C8-4878-4EF8-A8BA-AFA79C54AE9D,18AA02A5-13A1-44F3-B4D4-6176E1ECC36C,frameless.htm |title=David Duke participates in anti-Semitic conference in the Ukraine |publisher=Adl.org |date=June 30, 2005 |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515205042/http://www.adl.org/NR/exeres/B74CD7C8-4878-4EF8-A8BA-AFA79C54AE9D%2C18AA02A5-13A1-44F3-B4D4-6176E1ECC36C%2Cframeless.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke claims that Swedish police thwarted an attempted assassination against him, in August 2005, while Duke was speaking in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/?p=368 Assassination Attempt Against David Duke Fails] by David Duke&lt;/ref&gt;

On the weekend of June 8–10, 2006, Duke attended as a speaker at the international "White World's Future" conference in Moscow, which was coordinated and hosted by Pavel Tulayev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/?p=581 Historic Moscow Conference] davidduke.com&lt;/ref&gt; From December 11–13, Duke attended the [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]] in [[Tehran]], Iran, opened by [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], stating "The Holocaust is the device used as the pillar of Zionist imperialism, Zionist aggression, Zionist terror and Zionist murder."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16149717/ "Iranian leader says Israel will be ‘wiped out’: Ahmadinejad renews heated rhetoric at meeting of Holocaust deniers"], [[Associated Press]], December 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax fraud conviction and defrauding followers===
On December 12, 2002, David Duke pleaded guilty to the felony charge of filing a false tax return under {{usc|26|7206}} and [[mail fraud]] under {{usc|18|1341}}&lt;ref name="guilty"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-12-18-david-duke_x.htm David Duke pleads to mail fraud, tax charges] USA Today. December 18, 2002. Retrieved July 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''The New York Times'': "Mr.&amp;nbsp;Duke was accused of telling supporters that he was in financial straits, then misusing the money they sent him from 1993 to 1999. He was also accused of filing a false 1998 tax return... Mr. Duke used the money for personal investments and gambling trips... [T]he [supporter] contributions were as small as $5 and [according to the United States attorney, Jim Letten] there were so many that returning the money would be 'unwieldy.'"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/19/us/david-duke-pleads-guilty-to-tax-charge-and-fraud.html|title=David Duke Pleads Guilty To Tax Charge And Fraud|date=December 19, 2002|agency=Associated Press|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months later, Duke was sentenced to 15 months in prison, and he served the time in [[Big Spring, Texas]]. He was also fined US$10,000 and ordered to cooperate with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the [[United States federal courts|United States federal court system]] and not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.

The mail fraud charges stemmed from what prosecutors described as a six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations. Using the postal service, Duke appealed to his supporters for funds by fraudulently stating he was about to lose his house and his life savings. Prosecutors alleged that Duke raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in this scheme. Prosecutors also stipulated that in contrast to what he stated in the mailings, he sold his home at a hefty profit, had multiple investment accounts, and spent much of his money gambling at casinos.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/18/national/main533483.shtml Ex-Klan Leader David Duke Indicted] CBS News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/12/18/duke.plea/index.html Duke pleads guilty to fraud, false tax claims] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114175833/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/12/18/duke.plea/index.html |date=November 14, 2007 }} CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 arrest in the Czech Republic ===
In April 2009, Duke traveled to the Czech Republic on invitation by a Czech [[Neo Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group known as ''Národní Odpor'' ("National Resistance") to deliver three lectures in [[Prague]] and [[Brno]] to promote the Czech translation of his book ''My Awakening''.&lt;ref name="Edelweiß für den Grand Wizard"&gt;[http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2009/22/35175.html Edelweiß für den Grand Wizard], [[Jungle World]], Nr. 22, 28. May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested on April 23 on suspicion of "denying or approving of the Nazi genocide and other Nazi crimes" and "promotion of movements seeking suppression of human rights," which are crimes in the Czech Republic punishable by up to three years' imprisonment. At the time of his arrest, Duke was reportedly guarded by members of the ''Národní Odpor''.&lt;ref name=Czechpolicearrest&gt;[http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/czech-police-arrest-former-ku-klux-klan-leader-duke/373167 Czech police arrest former Ku Klux Klan leader Duke], [[ČTK]], April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/news/Louisiana+chief+arrested+Prague+Police/1531723/story.html Ex-Louisiana KKK chief arrested in Prague: Police] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717055415/http://www2.canada.com/news/louisiana+chief+arrested+prague+police/1531723/story.html |date=July 17, 2014 }}, Agence France-Presse (reprinted by Canada.com), April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke's first lecture had been scheduled at [[Charles University in Prague]], but it was canceled after university officials learned that neo-Nazis were planning to attend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-04-21-prague-duke_N.htm Prague university bans lecture by David Duke], Associated Press (reprinted by USA Today), April 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Czech politicians, including Interior Minister [[Ivan Langer]] and Human Rights and Minorities Minister [[Michael Kocáb]], had previously expressed opposition to Duke's being allowed entrance into the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=Czechpolicearrest /&gt;

In September 2009, the office of the District Prosecutor for Prague dropped all charges, explaining that there was no evidence that Duke had committed any crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/rasismus-v-cesku/statni-zastupkyne-zastavila-stihani-duka-kvuli-knize_140970.html |title=Státní zástupkyně zastavila stíhání Duka kvůli knize |publisher=Tyden.cz |date=September 29, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013 expulsion from Italy; Schengen Area ban ===
In 2013, an Italian court ruled in favor of expelling Duke from Italy.&lt;ref name="Expulsion from Italy 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jucca|first=Lisa|title=Italian court moves to expel former Ku Klux Klan leader|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/12/05/uk-italy-kukluxklan-idUKBRE9B40T120131205|accessdate=December 19, 2013|agency=Reuters|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke, then 63, was living in mountain village [[Valle di Cadore]]  in northern Italy. Although Duke had been issued a visa to live there by the Italian embassy in Malta, Italian police later found that Switzerland had issued a residence ban against Duke that applied throughout Europe's [[Schengen Area]].&lt;ref name="Expulsion from Italy 2013" /&gt;

==Personal life==
While working in the White Youth Alliance, Duke met Chloê Eleanor Hardin, who was also active in the group. They remained companions throughout college and married in 1974. Hardin is the mother of Duke's two daughters, Erika and Kristin. The Dukes divorced in 1984,&lt;ref name=uipqz&gt;The Rise of David Duke, Tyler Bridges, pg. 80, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and Chloe moved to [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], [[Florida]], in order to be near her parents.

Lemaire, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1979) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of demand was developed by Lacan in parallel to those of need and desire to account for the role of speech on human aspirations.&lt;ref name = enotes&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/demand Gabriel Balbo, "Demand"]&lt;/ref&gt; Demand forms part of Lacan's battle against the approach to [[language acquisition]] favored by [[ego psychology]], and makes use of [[Kojeve]]'s theory of desire.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1994) p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; Demand is not a [[Freud]]ian concept.&lt;ref name = enotes/&gt;

==Language acquisition==

For Lacan, demand is the result of language acquisition on physical needs - the individual's wants are automatically filtered through the alien system of external signifiers.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sheridan, "Translator's Note", Lacan, ''Four'' p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

Where traditionally [[psychoanalysis]] had recognised that learning to speak was a major step in the ego's acquisition of power over the world,&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and celebrated its capacity for increasing instinctual control,&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987) p. 133-4 and p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan by contrast stressed the more sinister side of man's early submergence in language.

He argued that "demand constitutes the Other as already possessing the 'privilege' of satisfying needs", and that indeed the child's biological needs are themselves altered by "the condition that is imposed on him by the existence of the discourse, to make his need pass through the defiles of the signifier".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 286 and p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Thus even in speaking one's demands, the latter are altered; and even when they are met, the child finds that it no longer wants what it thought it wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Schneiderman, ''Returning to Freud'' (New York 1980) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desire==

In Lacanian thought, a demand results when a [[lack (manque)|lack]] in [[the Real]] is transformed into [[the Symbolic]] medium of [[language]]. Demands faithfully express [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] signifying formations, but always leave behind
a residue or kernel of [[desire (psychoanalysis)|desire]], representing a lost surplus of [[jouissance]] for the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], (because the Real is never totally symbolizable).

As a result, for Lacan, "desire is situated in dependence on demand - which, by being articulated in signifiers, leaves a [[Metonymy|metonymic]] remainder which runs under it".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Four'' p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The frustration inherent in demand -  whatever is actually asked for is 'not it' - is what gives rise to desire.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners'' (London 1997) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Other's demands==

The demands of human society are initially mediated via the Mother;&lt;ref name="Ecrits321"&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; with the discourse of whom the infant comes to identify, subsuming its own non-verbal self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/demand Gabriel Balbo "Demand"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The result in the neurotic may be a dominance of parental demand, and of the social objects valued by such demands - jobs, degrees, marriage, success, money and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fink, ''The Lacanian Subject'' (Princeton 1997) p. 189 and p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan considered indeed that for the neurotic "the demand of the Other assumes the function of an object in his phantasy...this prevalence given by the neurotic to demand".&lt;ref name="Ecrits321"/&gt;

==Transference==

Lacan considered that the [[transference]] appears in the forms of demands from the patient&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Four'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;  - demands which he stressed the analyst must resist.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Through such demands, he states, "the whole past opens up right down to early infancy. The subject has never done anything other than demand, he could not have survived otherwise, and...[[regression (psychology)|regression]] shows nothing other than a return to the present of signifiers used in demands".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 254-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Roustang]] however has challenged the Lacanian view, arguing that the patient's demand, rather than undermining the analysis, may be a positive attempt to get the analyst to shift their therapeutic stance.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Campbell, ''Psychoanalysis and the Time of Life'' (2006) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Display rules''' are a social group or culture's informal norms that distinguish how one should express themselves.They can be described as culturally prescribed rules that people learn early on in their lives by interactions and socializations with other people.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Safdar|first=Saba|last2=Matsumoto|first2=David|date=2009|title=Variations of Emotional Display Rules Within and Across Cultures: A Comparison Between Canada, USA, and Japan|url=http://davidmatsumoto.com/content/2009SafdaretalCanadianJBehaviouralScience.pdf|journal=Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science|doi=10.1037/a0014387|pmid=|access-date=2015-04-16|volume=41|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They learn these cultural standards at a young age which determine when one would express certain emotions, where and to what extent.

Emotions can be conveyed through both non-verbal interactions such as facial expressions, hand gestures and body language as well as verbal interactions. People are able to intensify emotions in certain situations such as smiling widely even when they receive a gift that they are not happy about or “masking” their negative emotions with a polite smile. As well, people learn to de-intensify emotions in situations such as suppressing the urge to laugh when somebody falls or neutralizing their emotions such as maintaining a serious poker face after being dealt a good hand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social psychology|last=Thomas|first=Gilovich|others=Keltner, Dacher,, Chen, Serena,, Nisbett, Richard E.|isbn=9780393938968|edition= Fourth|location=New York|oclc=794032898|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Display rules determine how we act and to what extent an emotion is expressed in any given situation. They are often used to protect one’s own feelings or those of another person.

The understanding of display rules is a complex, multifaceted task. Display rules are understood differentially depending upon their mode of expression (verbal/facial) and the motivation for their use (prosocial/self-protective).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gnepp | first1 = J. | last2 = Hess | first2 = D.L.R. | year = 1986 | title = Children's understanding of verbal and facial display rules | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 103–108 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.1.103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotion ==
[[Emotions]] can be defined as brief, specific and multidimensional responses to challenges or opportunities that are important to both personal and social goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emotions last up to a few seconds or minutes, and not hours or days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Manstead, A. (2007). Emotion. In R. F. Baumeister &amp; K. D. Vohs (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of social psychology'' (Vol. 1, pp. 286-291). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications Ltd. doi: 10.4135/9781412956253.n175&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions are very specific which suggest that there is a clear reason of why a person may be feeling a certain emotion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emotions are also used to help individuals achieve their social goals. Individuals may respond to certain challenges or opportunities during social interactions with different emotions. The selected emotions can guide a specific goal-directed behaviour that can either support or hinder social relationships.

=== Concepts of emotion ===
Emotions can be broken down into different components. The first component of emotion is the appraisal stage.  In this first stage, individual process an event and its impact on their personal goals. Depending on the outcome, the individual will either go through positive or negative feelings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Next, we have distinct physiological responses such as blushing, increased heart rate or sweating.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The next stage of emotion is the expressive behavior. Vocal or facial expressions follows an emotional state and serves to communicate their reactions or intentions (social). The next component is the subjective feeling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is the quality that defines the experience of a specific emotion by expressing it by words or other methods. Finally, the last component is action tendencies. This suggests that an emotion will motivate or guide specific behavior and bodily responses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Theories of emotion ===
Emotions can be expressed verbally, with facial expression and with gestures. Darwin’s hypothesis concerning emotion stated that the way emotions are expressed are universal, and therefore independent of culture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ekman and Frinsen conducted a study to test this theory. The study included introducing basic emotions found in the western world and introduced them to different cultures around the world (Japan, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the United States).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Across the 5 cultures they were all able to accurately determine the emotion (success rates of 70-90%).They also introduced these selected emotions to an isolated community in Papua New Guinea who was not in contact with the western world.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The results revealed that both the other cultures and isolated community could effectively match and detect the emotional meaning of the different faces. This became evidence that emotions are expressed facially in the same way across the world.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; To see other theories: [[Emotions]].

== Culture ==
Culture is defined as "shared behaviors, beliefs, attitudes, and values communicated from generation to generation via language or some other means."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=David|date=November 3, 1990|title=Cultural Similarities and Differences in Display Rules|url=http://www.davidmatsumoto.com/content/1990%20Cultural%20Similarities%20and%20Differences%20in%20Display%20Rules.pdf|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=14|issue=3|pages=195–214|doi=10.1007/bf00995569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique individuals within cultures acquire differences affecting displays of emotions emphasized by one's status, role, and diverse behaviours. Some cultures value certain emotions more over others. The [[affect theory]] argues that emotions that promote important cultural ideals will become focal in their social interactions. For example in America, they value the emotion excitement as it represents the cultural idea of independence. In many Asian cultures it is inappropriate to discuss personal enthusiasms. They place greater value on emotions such as calmness and contentedness, representing the ideal harmonious relationships.These different cultural values affect a person’s everyday behaviours, decisions and emotional display.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

People learn how to greet one another, how to interact with others, what, where, when and how to display emotions through the people they interact with and the place they grow up in. Everything can be traced back to one’s culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gestures is an example of how one may express themselves, however these gestures represent different meanings depending on the culture. For example, in Canada, sticking out your tongue is a sign of disgust or disapproval however in Tibet it is a sign of respect when greeting someone. In America, holding your middle finger and index finger up makes the [[V sign|peace sign]], in some countries such as the UK and Australia it a sign of disrespect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.busuu.com/what-hand-gestures-mean-in-different-countries/|title=: What hand gestures mean in different countries - busuu blog|website=blog.busuu.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High- and low-context cultures|High and low-contact cultures]] also vary in the amount of physical interaction and direct contact there is during one-on-one communication. High-contact cultures involve people practicing direct eye contact, frequent touching, physical contact, and having close proximity to others. Examples of countries that have a high-contact culture include Mexico, Italy, and Brazil. Low-contact cultures involve people who practice less direct eye contact, little touching, have indirect body orientation, and more physical distance between people. Examples of countries that have a low-contact culture include the United States, Canada, and Japan.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Choices &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication|last=McCornack|first=Steven|publisher=Bedford/St.Martin's|year=2015|isbn=978-1-319-04352-0|location=Boston|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Influence ==

=== Family and Peers ===
Ekman and Friesen (1975) have suggested that unwritten codes or "display rules" govern the manner in which emotions may be expressed, and that different rules may be internalized as a function of an individual's culture, gender or family background.&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P., &amp; Friesen, W. V. ''Unmasking the face''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, many different cultures necessitate that particular emotions should be masked and that other emotions should be expressed drastically. Emotions can have significant consequences on the founding of [[interpersonal relationships]].

Children's understanding and use of display rules is strongly associated with their social competence and surrounding.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mcdowell, D. J., &amp; Parke, R. D.|date=2005|title=Parental Control and Affect as Predictors of Childrens Display Rule Use and Social Competence with Peers|journal=Social Development|volume=14 |issue=3|pages=440–457|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9507.2005.00310.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many personal display rules are learned in the context of a particular family or experience; many expressive behaviour and rule displays are adopted by copying or adopting similar behaviours than their social and familial surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malatesta|first1=C.Z.|last2=Haviland|first2=J.M.|year=1982|title=Learning display rules: The socialization of emotion expression in infancy|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=53|issue=4|pages=991–1003|doi=10.2307/1129139|pmid=7128264|jstor=1129139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents' affect and control influence their children's display rule through both positive and negative responses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mcdowell and Parke (2005) suggested that parents who exert more control over their children's emotions/behaviour would deprive them if many opportunities to learn about appropriate vs. inappropriate emotional/rule displays.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hence, by depriving children from learning through control (i.e. not allowing them to learn from their own mistakes), parents are restraining children's learning of prosocial rule display.

The social environment can influence whether one controls or displays their emotions. There are few factors influencing the children's decision to either control or express an emotion that they are experiencing including the type of audience. In fact, depending on if children are in the presence of peers or of family (i.e. mother or father), they will report different control over their expression of emotions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeman|first=Janice|last2=Garber|first2=Judy|date=1996|title=Display Rules for Anger, Sadness, and Pain: It Depends on Who Is Watching|jstor=1131873|journal=Child Development|volume=67|issue=3|pages=957–973|doi=10.2307/1131873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the type of emotion experienced, children control significantly more their expression of emotion in the presence of peers than when they are with their caregiver or alone.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== School Environment ===
The school environment is also a place where emotions and behaviours are influenced. During a child's grade school years, they can become increasingly more aware of the accepted display rules that are found in their social environment. They learn more and more about which emotions to express and which emotions not to express in certain social situations at school.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social and Personality Development, Sixth Edition|last=Shaffer|first=David R.|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|year=2009|isbn=|location=USA|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotions and Social Relationships  ===
Emotions can serve as a way of communicating with others and can guide social interactions.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/socialpsychology/n177.xml|title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology|last=Brackett|first=Marc A.|last2=Salovey|first2=Peter|date=2007|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=294|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n177|chapter=Emotional Intelligence|isbn=9781412916707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to express or understand other emotions can help encourage social interactions and help achieve personal goals. When expressing or understanding one's emotions is difficult, social interactions can be negatively impacted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Emotional Intelligence is a concept that is defined by four skills:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

1.     The ability to accurately perceive other emotions.

2.     The ability to understand one’s own emotions.

3.     The ability to use current feelings to help in making decisions.

4.     The ability to manage one’s emotions to best match the current situation.

== Gender ==
Gender also plays a role in display rules and how emotions are expressed. Males are more likely than females to reveal their emotions during frazzled and frightened times. Females on the other hand display their emotions more frequently under many circumstances regarding feelings caused from various emotions. However, both sexes in general due to [[human nature]] and the way we have socially developed, regulate emotional displays in an intellectual sensitivity to others assessments. This is done in regard to amalgamation or fitting into the prevailing societal formation which surrounds our environment.

== Development of Display Rules ==
{{See also|Social emotional development}}
Age plays an important role in the development of display rules, throughout life a person will gain experience and have more social interactions. According to a study  by Jones,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Diane Carlson|last2=Abbey|first2=Belynda Bowling|last3=Cumberland|first3=Amanda|date=1998|title=The Development of Display Rule Knowledge: Linkages with Family Expressiveness and Social Competence|jstor=1132370|journal=Child Development|volume=69|issue=4|pages=1209–1222|doi=10.2307/1132370}}&lt;/ref&gt; social interactions are the main factor in the creation and understanding of display rules. It starts at a very young age with family, and continues with peers. By meeting more people, facing more challenges and advancing in life, a person will develop different responses, those responses will depend mostly on the age of the person, this explains why a young person will have different social interactions than someone older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConatha|first=Jasmin Tahmaseb|last2=Huba|first2=Haley M.|date=1999-06-01|title=Primary, secondary, and emotional control across adulthood|journal=Current Psychology|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=164–170|doi=10.1007/s12144-999-1025-z|issn=0737-8262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infancy ===
Infancy is a complex period when studying display rules. At a very young age, an [[infant]] does not know how to talk, therefore they express themselves in different ways. In order to communicate with others, they use facial and vocal displays that are specific for each age-period. A study conducted by Malatesta &amp; Haviland&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zander Malatesta|first=Carol|last2=M. Haviland|first2=Jeannette|date=1982-09-01|title=Learning Display Rules: The Socialization of Emotion Expression in Infancy|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16071343|journal=Child Development|volume=53|issue=4|pages=991–1003|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1982.tb01363.x|pmid=7128264}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that a baby can have 10 different categories for facial expression:
* Interest
* Enjoyment
* Surprise
* Sadness/distress
* Anger
* Knit brow
* Discomfort/pain
* Brow flash
* Fear
* Disgusting
However, [[Fear]] and [[Disgust]], will develop progressively during childhood. They are complex facial expressions that require knowledge and understanding, they must be learned and cannot be copied; this is why not everybody is afraid of the same things. Most of the facial expressions will be learned through the parents, mainly from the mother. The mother-infant&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; relationship is key in the development of display rules during infancy, it is the synchrony of mother-infant expressions. To express themselves vocally; babies require the use of “screaming” or “crying”. There is no differentiation for the request of a baby, this is why the relation with the parents is important, they must teach the infant when and for what reason to cry (i.e. need of food).

=== Childhood ===
During [[childhood]], the expression of display rules becomes more complex. Children develop the ability to modulate their emotional expressions growing up, this development depends on the level of maturity and the level of [[Social relation|social interactions]] with others. Children growing up start to become aware of oneself and slowly aware of others. At this time, they understand the importance of non-verbal communication, and shape the manner in which emotion may be expressed, with this change in perception, children will internalize different rules. Those rules are relative to two major factors:
* The [[Social environment|environment]]: The social environment impacts the way someone reacts emotionally. The audience and the context are essential to understand display rules among children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeman|first=Janice|last2=Garber|first2=Judy|date=1996-06-01|title=Display Rules for Anger, Sadness, and Pain: It Depends on Who Is Watching|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=67|issue=3|pages=957–973|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1996.tb01776.x|issn=1467-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[temperament]]: According to [https://www.bu.edu/psych/faculty/lesbro/ Leslie Brody], parents that [[Socialization|socialise]] their kids the same way with equal level of nurturance, will observe different responses and reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tS1C8Sl5ysEC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=temperament+and+display+rules#v=onepage&amp;q=temperament%20and%20display%20rules&amp;f=false|title=Gender and Emotion: Social Psychological Perspectives|last=Fischer|first=Agneta|date=2000-03-09|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521639866|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These two factors will help create “personal display rules” and the development of a sense of [[empathy]] toward others (i.e. feeling sad when a friend lost a relative even if you did not know the person).

This process will continue to change and grow until adulthood. During adolescence, a transition period where the person is not a child anymore but not an adult yet, is a test period as they learn to deal with internal conflict. Emotions are more intense and harder to control due to the hormonal changes that come at this period of time.

=== Adulthood ===
During adulthood, people are capable of using a lot of different display rules depending on the situation they are facing and the people they are with. Society governs how and when someone should express emotions, however display rules are not something static, they are in a constant evolution. Therefore, even during adulthood, a person will develop new ways to hide, express or cope with emotions. At the same time, adults will develop a greater control of their feelings and this can be seen mostly in the work environment. A study presented by the [[Journal of Occupational Health Psychology]] showed that nurses working in the same environment are more likely to share the same display rules in order to achieve an organisational objective. Display rules are not only personal, but they are shared between people and can differ according to the hierarchy of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diefendorff|first=James M.|last2=Erickson|first2=Rebecca J.|last3=Grandey|first3=Alicia A.|last4=Dahling|first4=Jason J.|date=April 2011|title=Emotional display rules as work unit norms: a multilevel analysis of emotional labor among nurses|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|volume=16|issue=2|pages=170–186|doi=10.1037/a0021725|issn=1939-1307|pmid=21244168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dyuloka''' is a [[Sanskrit]] term for "heavenly world". It appears in the Vedic text ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', in verses 16.6.1.8–9 as well later texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0500/mw__0533.html Dyuloka], Monier Monier-Williams, English Sanskrit Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, page 500&lt;/ref&gt; Its root is ''Dyu'' (द्यु) which in the ''[[Rigveda]]'' means "heaven, shining, sky".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0500/mw__0532.html Dyu], Monier Monier-Williams, English Sanskrit Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, page 499&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_६.५१ 6.51.5], Rigveda, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears in the ''[[Upanishads]]'', where it connotes "sky or heaven", as in sun lighting it up. For example, in the commentary to the [[Yajnavalkya]]-[[Gargi]] dialogue of section 6.2 in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'', Radhakrishnan translates ''Dyuloka'' as heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/PrincipalUpanishads/129481965-The-Principal-Upanishads-by-S-Radhakrishnan#page/n315/mode/2up/search/yonder Brihadaranyaka Upanishad], S. Radhakrishnan, George Allen &amp; Unwin, verse VI.2.9, page 312&lt;/ref&gt;

In another context, ''Dyuloka'' is the realm of existence ([[samsara]]) where souls are reborn as gods and goddesses, to live out a life based on one's [[karma]] before they die again, according to the ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/srimaddevibhagav26vijnuoft/srimaddevibhagav26vijnuoft_djvu.txt|title=Archived: Full text of "Srimad Devi Bhagavatam".

His crimes, committed around his hometown of [[Plainfield, Wisconsin]], gathered widespread notoriety after authorities discovered that Gein had [[Exhumation|exhumed]] corpses from local graveyards and fashioned trophies and keepsakes from their bones and skin. Gein confessed to killing two women – tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954, and a Plainfield hardware store owner, Bernice Worden, in 1957. Gein was initially found unfit to stand trial and confined to a mental health facility. In 1968, Gein was found guilty but legally insane of the murder of Worden,&lt;ref name="guilty"/&gt; and was remanded to a psychiatric institution. He died at [[Mendota Mental Health Institute]] of cancer-induced liver and respiratory failure at age 77 on July 26, 1984. He is buried next to his family in the Plainfield Cemetery, in a now-unmarked grave.

==Early life==
Ed Gein was born in [[La Crosse County, Wisconsin]], on August 27, 1906,&lt;ref name="birthrecord"/&gt; the second of two boys of George Philip Gein (1873–1940&lt;ref name="Schechter2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold Schechter|title=Deviant|year=2010|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0697-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Augusta Wilhelmine (née Lehrke) Gein (1878–1945).{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=59}} Gein had an older brother, Henry George Gein (1901–1944).{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=54}} Augusta despised her husband, an [[alcoholic]] who was unable to keep a job; he had worked at various times as a carpenter, [[tanning (leather)|tanner]], and insurance salesman. George owned a local grocery shop for a few years, but sold the business, and the family left the city to live in isolation on a 155-acre farm in the [[Plainfield (town), Wisconsin|town of Plainfield]] in [[Waushara County, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicmapworks.com/Map/US/58945/Plainfield+Township/Waushara+County+1924/Wisconsin/|title=Plainfield Township, Atlas: Waushara County 1924, Wisconsin Historical Map|last=LLC.|first=Historic Map Works|website=www.historicmapworks.com|access-date=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the Gein family's permanent residence.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;Flaster, Alex. (producer) ''Biography: Ed Gain''. 2004. ''Biography''. Los Angeles, California: A&amp;E Television Networks.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augusta took advantage of the farm's isolation by turning away outsiders who could have influenced her sons.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; Edward left the farm only to attend school. Outside of school, he spent most of his time doing chores on the farm. Augusta was fervently religious, and nominally [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. She preached to her boys about the innate immorality of the world, the evil of drinking, and her belief that all women (except herself) were naturally prostitutes and instruments of the [[devil]]. She reserved time every afternoon to read to them from the Bible, usually selecting graphic verses from the [[Old Testament]] concerning death, murder, and [[divine retribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Anne|last1=Williams|first2=Vivian|last2=Head|first3=Amy|last3=Williams|title=Fiendish Killers: Perpetrators Of The Worst Possible Evil|publisher=Futura Publishing|location=London, England|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was shy, and classmates and teachers remembered him as having strange mannerisms, such as seemingly random laughter, as if he were laughing at his own personal jokes. To make matters worse, his mother punished him whenever he tried to make friends. Despite his poor social development, he did fairly well in school, particularly in reading.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

===Deaths in immediate family===
On April 1, 1940, Ed's father George died of heart failure caused by his alcoholism; he was 66 years old. Henry and Ed began doing odd jobs around town to help cover living expenses. The brothers were generally considered reliable and honest by residents of the community. While both worked as handymen, Ed also frequently babysat for neighbors. He enjoyed babysitting, seeming to relate more easily to children than adults.  Henry began dating a divorced, single mother of two and planned on moving in with her; Henry worried about his brother's attachment to their mother and often spoke ill of her around Ed, who responded with shock and hurt.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

On May 16, 1944, Henry and Ed were burning away marsh vegetation on the property;{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=85}} the fire got out of control, drawing the attention of the local fire department. By the end of the day&amp;nbsp;– the fire having been extinguished and the firefighters gone&amp;nbsp;– Ed reported his brother missing. With lanterns and flashlights, a search party searched for Henry, whose dead body was found lying face down.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Rapids Page 1"&gt;"Rites Today For Man Who Died in Roche-a-Cri Fire". ''Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune'', Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, May 19, 1944, p. 1, col. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, he had been dead for some time, and it appeared that the cause of death was heart failure, since he had not been burned or injured otherwise.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Rapids Page 1"/&gt; It was later reported, in [[Harold Schechter]]'s biography of Gein, ''Deviant'', that Henry had bruises on his head.&lt;ref name="henry"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bell |first=Rachael |author2=Marilyn Bardsley |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/gein/2b.html |title=Henry |accessdate=2008-11-23 |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203124822/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/gein/2b.html |archivedate=December 3, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}{{better source|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}} The police dismissed the possibility of foul play and the county [[coroner]] later officially listed [[asphyxia]]tion as the cause of death.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}} The authorities accepted the accident theory, but no official investigation was conducted  and an autopsy was not performed.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=86}} Some suspected that Ed Gein killed his brother. Questioning Gein about the death of Bernice Worden in 1957, state investigator Joe Wilimovsky brought up questions about Henry's death.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=85}} George W. Arndt, who studied the case, wrote that, in retrospect, it was "possible and likely" that Henry's death was "the "[[Cain and Abel]]" aspect of this case".{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=8}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=9}}

Gein and his mother were now alone. Augusta had a paralyzing stroke shortly after Henry's death, and Gein devoted himself to taking care of her. Sometime in 1945, Gein later recounted, he and his mother visited a man named Smith, who lived nearby, to purchase straw. According to Gein, Augusta witnessed Smith beating a dog. A woman inside the Smith home came outside and yelled for him to stop but Smith beat the dog to death. Augusta was extremely upset by this scene, however, what bothered her did not appear to be the brutality toward the dog but rather the presence of the woman. Augusta told Ed that the woman was not married to Smith so had no business being there. "Smith's harlot", Augusta angrily called her. She had a second stroke soon after, and her health deteriorated rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Denise|last=Noe|url=http://mensnewsdaily.com/2007/04/27/augusta-gein-the-woman-who-drove-a-man-psycho/ |title=Augusta Gein, the woman who drove a man Psycho |work=Men's News Daily|date=April 27, 2007 |accessdate=September 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IviPHaro?url=http://mensnewsdaily.com/2007/04/27/augusta-gein-the-woman-who-drove-a-man-psycho/ |archivedate=August 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died on December 29, 1945, at the age of 67. Ed was devastated by her death; in the words of author Harold Schechter, he had "lost his only friend and one true love. And he was absolutely alone in the world."{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}}

==Work==
Gein held on to the farm and earned money from odd jobs. He boarded up rooms used by his mother, including the upstairs, downstairs parlor, and living room, leaving them untouched; while the rest of the house became increasingly squalid, these rooms remained pristine. Gein lived thereafter in a small room next to the kitchen. Around this time, he became interested in reading death-cult magazines and adventure stories, particularly those involving [[cannibals]] or [[Nazi]] atrocities.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

Gein was a handyman and received a farm subsidy from the federal government starting in 1951. He occasionally worked for the local municipal road crew and crop-threshing crews in the area. Sometime between 1946 and 1956, he also sold an 80-acre parcel of land that his brother Henry had owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mark |first1=Timothy |title=The "Ed Gein" Story |date=2015 |publisher=Lulu|isbn=9781312995697 |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6m2pCQAAQBAJ&amp;q=80+acre#v=snippet&amp;q=80%20acre|quote=Click on &gt;&gt; to expand page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
On the morning of November 16, 1957, Plainfield hardware store owner Bernice Worden disappeared. A Plainfield resident reported that the hardware store's truck had been driven out from the rear of the building around 9:30 am. The hardware store was closed the entire day; some area residents believed this was because of deer hunting season.  Bernice Worden's son, Deputy Sheriff Frank Worden, entered the store around 5:00 pm to find the store's cash register open and blood stains on the floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/183986412|title=Widow, 58, Found Slain in Wisconsin|last=|first=|date=November 17, 1957|work=Star Tribune|access-date=March 3, 2017|page=1|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank Worden told investigators that Ed Gein had been in the store the evening before his mother's disappearance, and that he would return the next morning for a gallon of antifreeze.

When questioned, Gein told investigators that between 1947 and 1952,{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=97}} he made as many as 40 nocturnal visits to three local graveyards to exhume recently buried bodies while he was in a "daze-like" state. On about 30 of those visits, he said he came out of the daze while in the cemetery, left the grave in good order, and returned home empty-handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gein Also Admits He Killed Mary Hogan; Results of Lie Tests Announced|date=November 20, 1957 |publisher=''Stevens Point Daily Journal''|page=13, col. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other occasions, he dug up the graves of recently buried middle-aged women he thought resembled his mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Case File – Ed Gein |url=http://www.fortunecity.com/roswell/streiber/273/gein_cf.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016184447/http://www.fortunecity.com/roswell/streiber/273/gein_cf.htm |archivedate=October 16, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2014}}{{better source|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Gein,%20Ed.pdf|title=Edward Theodore Gein, American Psycho|author=Radford University students |publisher=Department of Psychology, Radford University|website=radford.edu|quote=Beginning in 1947 - He saw a newspaper article of a woman who had been buried that day.

Allan Wilimovsky of the state crime laboratory participated in opening three test graves identified by Gein. The caskets were inside wooden boxes; the top boards ran crossways (not lengthwise). The tops of the boxes were about 2 feet (60&amp;nbsp;cm) below the surface in sandy soil. Gein had robbed the graves soon after the funerals while the graves were not completed. The test graves were exhumed because authorities were uncertain as to whether the slight Gein was capable of single-handedly digging up a grave during a single evening; they were found as Gein described: two of the exhumed graves were found empty (one had a crowbar in place of the body). One casket was empty; one casket Gein had failed to open when he lost his pry bar; and most of the body was gone from the third grave, but Gein had returned rings and some body parts.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=48}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=49}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=50}} thus apparently corroborating Gein's confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Empty Coffins Discovered in Graves at Plainfield; Appears To Back Up Gein's Story|date=November 25, 1957|publisher=''Stevens Point Daily Journal''|page=1, cols. 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DA Convinced Gein Actually Raided Graves|date=November 26, 1957|publisher=''Stevens Point Daily Journal''|page=1, col. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=5965868&amp;PIpi=95172936|title=The Milwaukee Sentinel, November 26, 1957|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel, November 26, 1957|accessdate=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Soon after his mother's death, Gein began to create a "woman suit" so that "...he could become his mother—to literally crawl into her skin".&lt;ref name="necrophile"/&gt; Gein denied having sex with the bodies he exhumed, explaining: "They smelled too bad."&lt;ref name="psycho"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bell |first=Rachael |first2=Marilyn |last2=Bardsley |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/gein/weird_3.html |title=Seriously weird |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130062755/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/gein/weird_3.html |archive-date=January 30, 2009 |work=[[Tru TV]] |access-date=July 24, 2018 |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During state crime laboratory interrogation, Gein also admitted to the shooting death of Mary Hogan, a tavern owner missing since 1954 whose head was found in his house, but he later denied memory of details of her death.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981}}

A 16-year-old youth, whose parents were friends of Gein and who attended ball games and movies with him, reported that Gein kept shrunken heads in his house, which Gein had described as relics from the [[Philippines]], sent by a cousin who had served on the islands during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Youth Tells of Seeing Gein's Heads|date=November 20, 1957|publisher=''Stevens Point Daily Journal''|page=1, col. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon investigation by the police, these were determined to be human facial skins, carefully peeled from corpses and used by Gein as masks.{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=128}}

Gein was also considered a suspect in several other unsolved cases in Wisconsin, including the 1953 disappearance of [[Evelyn Hartley]], a [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] babysitter.{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=95}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=100}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=105}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=177}}

During questioning, [[Waushara County, Wisconsin|Waushara County]] sheriff Art Schley reportedly assaulted Gein by banging his head and face into a brick wall. As a result, Gein's initial confession was ruled inadmissible.{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=31}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=32}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=33}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=34}} Schley died of heart failure at age 43 in 1968, before Gein's trial.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=34}} Many who knew Schley said he was [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] by the horror of Gein's crimes, and this, along with the fear of having to testify (especially about assaulting Gein), caused his death. One of his friends said: "He was a victim of Ed Gein as surely as if he had butchered him."{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}}

===Trial===
On November 21, 1957, Gein was [[arraignment|arraigned]] on one count of [[first degree murder]] in Waushara County Court, where he pleaded [[not guilty by reason of insanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gein Pleads Innocent By Reason of Insanity|date=November 21, 1957|publisher=Stevens Point Daily Journal|page=1, cols. 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gein was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and found mentally incompetent, thus unfit for trial. He was sent to the Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane (now the [[Dodge Correctional Institution]]), a maximum-security facility in [[Waupun, Wisconsin]], and later transferred to the [[Mendota State Hospital]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Moira|last=Martindale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgaTQ7eJOFMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage |title=Cannibal Killers  |place=New York City|publisher=St. Martin's |year=1993 |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, doctors determined Gein was "mentally able to confer with counsel and participate in his defense".{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=95}} The trial began on November 7, 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ed Gein Will Be in Court|newspaper=Oshkosh Daily Northwestern|location=Oshkosh, Wisconsin|date=November 6, 1968|page=4, col. 6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gein Trial Under Way", ''Oshkosh Daily Northwestern'', November 7, 1968, p. 1, col. 5.

A psychiatrist testified that Gein had told him that he did not know whether the killing of Bernice Worden was intentional or accidental. Gein had told him that while he examined a gun in Worden's store, the gun went off, killing Worden.&lt;ref&gt;"Psychiatrist Tells Gein Account of Worden Death", ''Oshkosh Daily Northwestern'', November 12, 1968, p. 1, col. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Gein testified that after trying to load a bullet into the rifle, it discharged. He said he had not aimed the rifle at Worden, and did not remember anything else that happened that morning.&lt;ref&gt;"Gein Takes Stand, Remembers Little", ''The Daily Telegram'', Eau Claire, Wisconsin, November 13, 1968, p. 1, col. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of the defense, Gein's trial was held without a jury,{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=227}} with Judge Robert H. Gollmar presiding. Gein was found guilty by Gollmar on November 14.&lt;ref name="guilty"/&gt; A second trial dealt with Gein's sanity;&lt;ref name="guilty"/&gt; after testimony by doctors for the prosecution and defense, Gollmar ruled Gein "not guilty by reason of insanity" and ordered him committed to Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=172}} Gein spent the rest of his life in a mental hospital.&lt;ref name="guilty"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ed Gein Found Guilty of 1957 Murder in Plainfield|quote=Ed Gein, the handyman whose home became known as a "house of horrors" 11 years ago, was found guilty today of first degree murder.|newspaper=The Capital Times |place=Madison, Wisconsin |date=November 14, 1958 |page=2, col. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wisconsin Killer Gein Ruled Guilty, Insane |quote=Ed Gein, 62, the recluse who horrified the nation in 1957 when the remains of 11 bodies were found on his farm, was ruled today to have been insane when he killed a Plainfield, Wis., woman. |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=November 15, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Gollmar wrote, "Due to prohibitive costs, Gein was tried for only one murder—that of Mrs. Worden. He also admitted to killing Mary Hogan."{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=81}}

===Aftermath===
Gein's house and property were scheduled to be auctioned March 30, 1958, amid rumors the house was to become a tourist attraction. On March 27, the house was destroyed by fire. Arson was suspected, but the cause was never officially determined.&lt;ref&gt;Gollmar, ''Edward Gein'', Pinnacle Books, 3rd ed., 1989, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; When Gein learned of the incident while in detention, he shrugged and said, "Just as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3X5WwY-hvKQC&amp;pg=PT99 |date=October 15, 1995 |page=90 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |title=Ed Gein–Psycho! |last=Woods |first=Paul Anthony |last2=Morris |first2=Errol |author2-link=Errol Morris |isbn=9780312130572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gein's car, which he used to haul the bodies of his victims, was sold at public auction for $760 to carnival [[sideshow]] operator [[Bunny Gibbons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hintz|first=Martin |title=Got Murder?: Shocking True Stories of Wisconsins Notorious Killers|publisher=Big Earth Publishing |year=2007 |page=62 |isbn=1-931599-96-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbons later charged carnival goers 25¢ admission to see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reavill|first=Gil Reavill|title=Aftermath, Inc.: Cleaning Up After CSI Goes Home|publisher=Gotham|year=2007|page=228|isbn=1-59240-296-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Ed Gein Headstone.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Ed Gein's vandalized grave marker as it appeared in 1999 before thieves stole it]]
Gein died at the Mendota Mental Health Institute due to [[respiratory failure]] secondary to [[lung cancer]] on July 26, 1984, at the age of 77.{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}} Over the years, souvenir seekers chipped pieces from his [[gravestone]] at the Plainfield Cemetery, until the stone itself was stolen in 2000. It was recovered in June 2001, near [[Seattle]], and was placed in storage at the Waushara County Sheriff's Department. The gravesite itself is now unmarked, but not unknown; Gein is interred between his parents and brother in the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Bie |title=It Happened in Wisconsin |publisher=TwoDot |location=[[Guilford, Connecticut]] |year=2007 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AfsoOl6qmiwC&amp;pg=PA97 97] |isbn=0-7627-4153-8 |oclc=76820808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
&lt;!---
Please refrain from adding minor listings of instances where Gein is mentioned, only in passing, in songs, movies or other media. ''Impact on Pop Culture'' sections are not intended to be exhaustive lists of minor data. If you have an item or items you think may be appropriate (notable, historically important, encyclopedic), please, bring it up on the talk page first. Any additions not previously discussed will likely be removed. It is preferred that we not list when Bart Simpson says his name or yet another band writes a song, especially if the mention has little regard for Gein's factual history. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

I would like to add that when "popular culture" headings become bloated with trivial references, they often get entirely deleted on Wikipedia. Before adding a book, movie, song, anime, etc influenced by Gein, ask: Is this as notable as Psycho or does it belong only as a note in the article on the influenced item with a link from there to Ed Gein. We need to be careful and encyclopedic or we will lose this. 
---&gt;
The story of Ed Gein has had a lasting effect on [[American culture|American]] popular culture as evidenced by its numerous appearances in film, music, and literature. The tale first came to widespread public attention in the fictionalized version presented by [[Robert Bloch]] in his 1959 suspense novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''. In addition to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film of Bloch's novel, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'',&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/167248-no-texas-no-chainsaw-no-massacre-the-true-links-in-the-chain/ | title=No Texas, No Chainsaw, No Massacre: The True Links in the Chain | work=[[PopMatters]] | date=February 4, 2013 | author=Maçek III, J.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gein's story was loosely adapted into a number of films, including ''[[Deranged (1974 film)|Deranged]]'' (1974),&lt;ref name=PM/&gt; ''[[In the Light of the Moon]]'' (2000) (released in the United States and Australia as ''Ed Gein'' (2001)), ''[[Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield]]'' (2007), ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012), and the [[Rob Zombie]] films ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' and its sequel, ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]''. Gein served as the inspiration for a myriad of fictional serial killers across different mediums, most notably the likes of [[Norman Bates]] (''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''), [[Leatherface]] (''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''),&lt;ref name=PM/&gt; [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Buffalo Bill]] (''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'')&lt;ref name=PM/&gt; and the character Dr. Oliver Thredson from the TV series ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]|title=All the Real-Life Scary Stories Told on American Horror Story|author=Eidell, Lynsey|date=October 7, 2015|url=http://www.glamour.com/story/all-of-the-real-life-scary-sto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American filmmaker [[Errol Morris]] and German filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] attempted unsuccessfully to collaborate on a [[Errol Morris#Biography|film project]] about Gein from 1975 to 1976. Morris interviewed Gein several times and ended up spending almost a year in Plainfield interviewing dozens of locals. The pair planned secretly to exhume Gein's mother from her grave to test a theory but never followed through on the scheme and eventually ended their collaboration. The aborted project was described in a 1989 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' profile of Morris.&lt;ref name="singer1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Predilections|last=Singer|first=Mark|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 2, 1989|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/content/profile/singer_predilections.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the news reports of Gein's crimes spawned a subgenre of "[[black humor]]".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Arndt, "Appendix A: Gein Humor" in Robert H. Gollmar, ''Edward Gein'' (Pinnacle Books, Windsor Publishing, 3rd ed., 1989) excerpted from Arndt's original "Horror, Humor and Human Nature" also published abridged as "Community Reactions to a Horrifying event" by Menninger School of Psychiatry; both versions reprinted in several psychology textbooks.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, Gein has frequently been exploited by [[transgressive art]] or "[[shock rock]]", often without association with his life or crimes beyond the shock value of his name. Examples of this include the song titled "[[Dead Skin Mask]]" (1990) from the [[Slayer]] album ''[[Seasons in the Abyss]]'', "[[Nothing to Gein]]" (2001) from [[Mudvayne]]'s album ''[[L.D. 50 (album)|L.D. 50]]'', and "Ed Gein" (1992) from [[The Ziggens]]' album ''Rusty Never Sleeps''.&lt;ref&gt;The Slayer song "[[Dead Skin Mask]]" features a young girl pleading with Gein to release her; Gein never held a live captive and his victims were middle-aged women.&lt;/ref&gt; There was the band [[Ed Gein (band)|Ed Gein]] called after the murderer.  Ed Gein's atrocities were also satirized in [[Blind Melon]]'s "Skinned" from the 1995 album ''[[Soup (Blind Melon album)|Soup]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
&lt;!---
Again, DO NOT add a trivia section or trivial listings of instances where Gein is mentioned in songs, movies or other arts and entertainment media. This is covered sufficiently in this section and is not intended to be an exhaustive list. If you have items you think may be encyclopedic, bring it up on the talk page. Any additions not previously discussed WILL BE REMOVED. Thank you.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59487">'''Felony disenfranchisement''' is the exclusion from [[voting]] of people otherwise eligible to vote (known as [[disfranchisement]]) due to conviction of a criminal offense, usually restricted to the more serious class of crimes: [[Felony|felonies]] (generally crimes of incarceration for a duration of more than a year and/or a fine exceeding $1000). Jurisdictions vary as to whether they make such disfranchisement permanent, or restore suffrage after a person has served a sentence, or completed [[parole]] or [[probation]].&lt;ref name="Bowers and Preuh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowers|first=Melanie M|author2=Preuhs, Robert R|title=Collateral Consequences of a Collateral Penalty: The Negative Effect of Felon Disenfranchisement Laws on the Political Participation of Nonfelons|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=September 2009|volume=90|issue=3|pages=722–743|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00640.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felony disenfranchisement is one among the [[collateral consequences of criminal conviction]] and the [[loss of rights due to conviction for criminal offense]].&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Jonah A.|title=Felon Disenfranchisement and the Fight for Universal Suffrage.|journal=Social Work|date=January 1, 2011|volume=56|issue=1|pages=89–91|doi=10.1093/sw/56.1.89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents have argued that persons who commit felonies have 'broken' the social contract, and have thereby given up their right to participate in a civil society. Some argue that felons have shown poor judgment, and that they should therefore not have a voice in the political decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;Eli L. Levine, "Does the Social Contract Justify Felony Disenfranchisement?", 1 ''Wash. U. Jur. Rev.'' 193 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have argued that such disfranchisement restricts and conflicts with principles of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] and the Sentencing Project |url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/File/FVR/fd_losingthevote.pdf |format=PDF |title=LOSING THE VOTE: The Impact of Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States |date=October 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710055712/http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/File/FVR/fd_losingthevote.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can affect civic and communal participation in general.&lt;ref name="Bowers and Preuh" /&gt;  Opponents argue that felony disenfranchisement can create dangerous political incentives to skew criminal law in favor of disproportionately targeting groups who are political opponents of those who hold power.

==History==
In Western countries, felony disenfranchisement can be traced back to ancient Greek and Roman traditions: disenfranchisement was commonly imposed as part of the punishment on those convicted of "infamous" crimes, as part of their "[[civil death]]", whereby these persons would lose all rights and claim to [[property]]. Most medieval [[common law]] jurisdictions developed punishments that provided for some form of exclusion from the community for felons, ranging from [[outlaw|execution on sight]] to exclusion from community processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:SD7ENGyN880J:www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/blj/vol22/schall.pdf+outlaw+disenfranchisement+%22Common+law%22&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl |title=pages-schall.blj.doc – Powered by Google Docs |publisher=docs.google.com |accessdate=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
The [[United States]] is among the most punitive nations in the world when it comes to denying the vote to those who have been convicted of a felony offense.&lt;ref name="guardian-12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/should-convicted-felons-be-allowed-to-vote-after-theyve-served-their-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the Constitution implicitly permits the states to adopt rules about disenfranchisement "for participation in rebellion, or other crime", by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], section&amp;nbsp;2. It is up to the states to decide which crimes could be grounds for disenfranchisement, and they are not formally bound to restrict this to felonies; however, in most cases, they do.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Felons who have completed their sentences are allowed to vote in most U.S. states. Between 1996 and 2008 twenty-eight states changed their laws on felon voting rights, mostly to restore rights or to simplify the process of restoration. Since 2008 state laws have continued to shift, both curtailing and restoring voter rights, sometimes over short periods of time within the same state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Felon Voting Rights|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=March 13, 2016|date=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Southern states, felony disenfranchisement was implemented as part of a strategy to bar blacks from voting. Conjoint with felony disenfranchisement, these Southern states implemented [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] which established severe penalties for petty crimes and were used to target black Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/magazine/ex-felons-voting-rights-florida.html|title=Will Florida’s Ex-Felons Finally Regain the Right to Vote?|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008 over 5.3 million people in the United States were denied the right to vote due to felony disenfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomes Magazine|date=November 1, 2008|publisher=Reason|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1553510,00.html|first=Reynolds|last=Holding}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the national elections in 2012, the various state felony disenfranchisement laws together blocked an estimated 5.85 million felons from voting, up from 1.2 million in 1976. This comprised 2.5% of the potential voters in general. The state with the highest number of disenfranchised voters was Florida, with 1.5 million disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="guardian-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/13/felon-voting-laws-disenfranchisement|title=Felon voting laws to disenfranchise historic number of Americans in 2012|author=Pilkington, Ed|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 13, 2012|accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform efforts===
Felony disenfranchisement was a topic of debate during the [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2012|2012 Republican presidential primary]]. Primary candidate [[Rick Santorum]] from Pennsylvania argued for the restoration of voting rights for convicted felons who had completed sentences and parole/probation.&lt;ref name="motherjones"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Murphy |url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/01/rick-santorum-voting-rights-activist |title=Rick Santorum, Voting Rights Activist |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum's position was attacked and distorted by [[Mitt Romney]], who alleged that Santorum supported voting rights for felons while [[incarceration|incarcerated]].&lt;ref name="motherjones" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jan/17/restore-our-future/super-pac-rick-santorum-felon-voting-rights/ |title=PolitiFact Florida &amp;#124; Super PAC attacks Rick Santorum for supporting felon voting rights |publisher=[[Politifact.com]] |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former President [[Barack Obama]] supports voting rights for ex-offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2012election.procon.org/sourcefiles/NAACP-questionnaire.pdf |title=The NAACP 2008 Presidential Candidate Civil Rights Questionnaire |publisher=2012election.procon.org |accessdate=2013-11-08|quote="I support restoration of voting rights for ex-offenders. I am a cosponsor of the Count Every Vote Act, and would sign that legislation into law as president."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1997 to 2008, there was a trend to lift the disenfranchisement restrictions, or simplify the procedures for applying for the restoration of civil rights for persons who had fulfilled their punishments for felonies. As a result, in 2008 more than a half million people had the right to vote who would have been disenfranchised under the older rules.&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States |publisher=[[The Sentencing Project]] |date=March 2011 |url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_statedisenfranchisement.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119133453/http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_statedisenfranchisement.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more severe disenfranchisement rules have been passed in several states.

===State reforms===
In 2007, [[Florida]]'s Republican Governor [[Charlie Crist]] pushed to make it easier for most convicted felons to regain their voting rights reasonably quickly after serving their sentences and probation terms.&lt;ref name=Crist&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, however, Republican Governor [[Rick Scott]] reversed the 2007 reforms. Felons were not able to apply to the court for restoration of voting rights until seven years after completion of sentence, probation and parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Steve Bousquet |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/state-toughens-policy-of-restoring-rights-to--freed-felons/1184821 |title=State toughens policy of restoring rights to freed felons &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times |publisher=Tampabay.com |date=2011-08-07 |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020012121/http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/state-toughens-policy-of-restoring-rights-to--freed-felons/1184821 |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, 2018, Florida voters approved an amendment to the state constitution to automatically restore voting rights to convicted felons who have served their sentences.&lt;ref name="voxreveal"/&gt; Lifetime bans still apply for those convicted of either murder or sexual offenses.&lt;ref name=cnbcnov2018&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/florida-restores-voting-rights-to-more-than-1-million-former-felons.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=voxreveal&gt;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/6/18052374/florida-amendment-4-felon-voting-rights-results&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iowa in July 2005, Democratic Governor [[Tom Vilsack]] issued an executive order restoring the right to vote for all persons who had completed supervision.&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;  On October 31, 2005, Iowa's Supreme Court upheld mass re-enfranchisement of convicted felons. But, on his inauguration day, January 14, 2011, Republican Governor [[Terry Branstad]] reversed Vilsack's executive order, disenfranchising thousands of people.&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foley |first=Ryan J. |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/24/iowa-felons-voting-rights-terry-branstad_n_1622742.html |title=Iowa Felons' Voting Rights: Terry Brandstad Executive Order Disenfranchises Thousands |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-11-08 |date=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia legislature in 2017 debated relaxation of the [[Felony disenfranchisement in Virginia|state's policy]] that restoration of voting rights requires an individual act by the governor.&lt;ref name="ta171024"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Matt|title=The Strangest Political Attack Ad of 2017|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/gillespie-criminal-justice-ad/543762/|accessdate=4 January 2018|publisher=The Atlantic|date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine other states disenfranchise felons for various lengths of time following their conviction. Except for Maine and Vermont every state prohibits felons from voting while in prison.&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;

{{as of|2018}}, Iowa and Kentucky are the only two states with lifetime voting bans for felons, regardless of the crime committed.&lt;ref name=cnbcnov2018 /&gt;

===Constitutionality===
Unlike most laws that burden the right of citizens to vote based on some form of social status, felony disenfranchisement laws have been held to be [[constitutional]].  In ''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' (1974), the [[United States Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of felon disenfranchisement statutes, finding that the practice did not deny equal protection to disenfranchised voters. The Court looked to Section 2 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which proclaims that States in which adult male citizens are denied the right to vote for any reason other than "participation in rebellion, or other crime," will suffer a reduction in the basis of their [[United States congressional apportionment|representation in Congress]]. Based on this language, the Court found that this amounted to an "affirmative sanction" of the practice of felon disenfranchisement, and the 14th Amendment could not prohibit in one section that which is expressly authorized in another.

But, critics{{who|date=September 2018}} of the practice argue that Section 2 of the 14th Amendment allows, but does not represent an endorsement of, felony disenfranchisement statutes as constitutional in light of the [[equal protection clause]] and is limited only to the issue of reduced representation. The Court ruled in ''[[Hunter v. Underwood]]'' 471 U.S. 222, 232 (1985) that a state's crime disenfranchisement provision will violate Equal Protection if it can be demonstrated that the provision, as enacted, had "both [an] impermissible racial motivation and racially discriminatory impact." (The law in question also disenfranchised people convicted of vagrancy, adultery, and any misdemeanor "involving [[moral turpitude]]"; the test case involved two individuals who faced disenfranchisement for presenting [[Cheque fraud|invalid checks]], which the state authorities had found to be morally [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/turpid turpid] behavior.)  A felony disenfranchisement law, which on its face is indiscriminate in nature, cannot be invalidated by the Supreme Court unless its enforcement is proven to racially discriminate and to have been enacted with racially discriminatory [[animus nocendi|animus]].{{Citation needed|reason=In ''Hunter v. Underwood'', the S.C. explicitly did not endorse the constitutionality of designing disenfranchisement to deprive poor whites suffrage to undermine support for an opposition party; but there then was no further need for them to decide finally one way or the other. This means that the question was left open.|date=August 2014}}

===Classifications===
Restoration of voting rights for people who are ex-offenders varies across the United States. Primary classification of voting rights include:

====Unrestricted====
[[Maine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/21-A/title21-Asec112.html |title=Title 21-A, §112: Residence for voting purposes |publisher=Mainelegislature.org |date=2012-10-16 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=17&amp;Chapter=043&amp;Section=02121 |title=The Vermont Statutes Online |publisher=Leg.state.vt.us |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the only states with unrestricted voting rights for people who are felons.  Both states allow the person to vote during incarceration, via [[absentee ballot]] and after terms of conviction end.

====Ends after release====
In fourteen states and the District of Columbia, disenfranchisement ends after incarceration is complete:

In February 2016 the [[Maryland]] General Assembly restored the right to vote for more than 40,000 released felons, overriding a veto by Governor [[Larry Hogan]]. Maryland's Senate approved the bill on a narrow 29-18 vote, while the state House of Delegates voted 85-56 in favor of it on January 20. Convicted felons under parole or probation had their right to vote restored. The law went into effect in late March, one month before the state's April 26 primaries.&lt;ref name="restore"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/maryland-felon-voting/462000/ Matt Ford, "Restoring Voting Rights for Felons in Maryland"], ''The Atlantic,'' 9 February 2016, accessed 23 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Circumstantial====
Six states have laws that relate disenfranchisement to the detail of the crime. These laws restore voting rights to some offenders on the completion of incarceration, parole, and probation. Other offenders must make an individual petition that could be denied.

*[[Alabama]] –  A person convicted of a felony loses the ability to vote if the felony involves moral turpitude. Prior to 2017, the state Attorney General and courts have decided this for individual crimes; however, in 2017, moral turpitude was defined by House Bill 282 of 2017, signed into law by [[Kay Ivey]] on May 24, to constitute 47 specific offenses.&lt;ref name=2017law&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://legiscan.com/AL/text/HB282/2017|title=Bill Text: AL HB282, 2017, Regular Session, Engrossed|accessdate=January 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a convicted person loses the ability to vote based on having committed a defined act of moral turpitude, he can petition to have it restored by a pardon or by a certificate of eligibility; if the loss of elective franchise was based on a crime not under moral turpitude, eligibility to vote is automatically restored once all sentence conditions have been satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/17-3-31.htm |title=Section 17-3-31 |publisher=Alisondb.legislature.state.al.us |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107072426/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/17-3-31.htm |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="al-pardons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |title=Alabama Pardons Unit |publisher=Pardons.state.al.us |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107072227/http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NACDL|title=State narrative: Alabama|url=https://www.nacdl.org/uploadedFiles/files/resource_center/2012_restoration_project/state_narr_al.pdf|work=NACDL Jurisdiction Profiles|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alabama ex-felon voting brochure 2010|url=http://www.aclualabama.org/WhatWeDo/ALExFelonVotingBrochure2010.pdf|publisher=ACLU of Alabama|accessdate=7 January 2014|year=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107071155/http://www.aclualabama.org/WhatWeDo/ALExFelonVotingBrochure2010.pdf|archive-date=7 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2017, a person convicted of a number of crimes having to do with sexual assault or abuse, including [[sodomy]], was ineligible to receive a certificate of eligibility; today, only impeachment and treason remain ineligible for a certificate of eligibility.&lt;ref name="pardons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |title=Pardons Unit |publisher=Pardons.state.al.us |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107072227/http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Voting rights in the United States}}

==In Europe==
In general, during the recent centuries, the European countries have increasingly made suffrage more accessible. This has included retaining disenfranchisement in fewer and fewer cases, including for criminal offenses. Moreover, most European states, including most of those outside the [[European Union]], have ratified the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and thereby agreed to respect the decisions of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;In the neutral field in Strasbourg is still wide open the play on rule of law in electoral matters: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Decreto Severino: c'è un giudice a Strasburgo|journal= Mondoperaio edizione online|date=2015| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89429887}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case ''[[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)]]'' the Court in 2005 found that general rules for automatic disenfranchisements resulting from convictions to be against human rights. This ruling applied equally for prisoners and for ex-convicts. The ruling did not exclude the possibility of disenfranchisement as a consequence of deliberation in individual cases (such as that of [[Mohammed Bouyeri]]). The United Kingdom has not respected this Court opinion, although it is a signatory to the Convention (see below).

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, prohibitions from voting are codified in section 3 and 3A of the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]].&lt;ref name = RPA83&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2353486 |title=Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2) – Statute Law Database |publisher=www.statutelaw.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excluded are incarcerated criminals&lt;ref&gt;although not specifically felons; the distinction between felony and misdemeanor was abolished by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]&lt;/ref&gt; (including those sentenced by [[courts-martial]], those unlawfully at large from such sentences, and those committed to psychiatric institutions as a result of a criminal court sentencing process). Civil prisoners sentenced (for non-payment of fines, or [[contempt of court]], for example), and those on [[Remand (detention)|remand]] unsentenced retain the right to vote.

The UK is subject to Europe-wide rules due to various treaties and agreements associated with its membership of the [[European Community]]. The Act does not apply to elections to the [[European Parliament]]. Following ''[[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)]]'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;42 EHHR 41&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled such a ban to be disproportionate, the policy was reviewed by the UK government. In 2005 the [[Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs]], [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Falconer of Thoroton]], stated that the review may result in the UK allowing some prisoners to vote.&lt;ref name="uk-review"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4315348.stm |title=Convicts 'will not all get vote'|publisher=BBC News|date= October 6, 2005| accessdate= December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the UK was still reviewing the policy, following an "unprecedented warning" from the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name = update&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/09/prisoners-vote-general-election-europe |title=Prisoners must be allowed to vote, Council of Europe warns Britain |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-30 |location=London |first=Alan |last=Travis |date=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government position was then that

{{quote|It remains the government's view that the right to vote goes to the essence of the offender's relationship with democratic society, and the removal of the right to vote in the case of some convicted prisoners can be a proportionate and proper response following conviction and imprisonment. The issue of voting rights for prisoners is one that the government takes very seriously and that remains under careful consideration.&lt;ref name = update/&gt;}}

Parliament voted in favor of maintaining disenfranchisement of prisoners in 2011 in response to Government plans to introduce legislation. Since then the Government has repeatedly stated that prisoners will not be given the right to vote in spite of the ECHR ruling.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20053244], 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the ECHR ruling, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice [[Chris Grayling]] produced a draft [[Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Bill]] for discussion by a Joint Committee, incorporating two clear options for reform and one which would retain the blanket ban.

===Ireland===
For [[elections in the Republic of Ireland]], there is no disenfranchisement based on criminal conviction, and prisoners remain on the [[electoral register]] at their pre-imprisonment address.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/prison_system/prisoners_rights.html|title=Prisoners' Rights|publisher=Citizens Information Board|accessdate=25 October 2012|location=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 2006, the grounds for [[postal voting]] did not include imprisonment, and hence those in prison on election day were in practice unable to vote, although those on [[temporary release]] could do so.&lt;ref name="dail20061005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2006/10/05/00008.asp |title=Dáil Eireann - 05/Oct/2006 Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2006: Second Stage |publisher=Debates.oireachtas.ie |date=2006-10-05 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/europe-court-rules-prisoners-should-be-let-vote-in-elections-234642.html|title=Europe court rules prisoners should be let vote in elections|last=Quinn|first=Ben|author2=Conor Sweeney|date=7 October 2005|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] ruled that this breached the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]], and the government drafted a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] extending postal voting to prisoners on [[Detention of suspects|remand]] or serving sentences of less than six months.&lt;ref name="ind226084"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/goahead-for-prisoners-to-cast-vote-at-next-election-226084.html |title=Go-ahead for prisoners to cast vote at next election |last=Brady |first=Tom |date=15 December 2005 |work=[[Irish Independent]] |accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2001, the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] overturned the High Court ruling and the bill was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="ind226084"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breathnach -v- Ireland &amp; anor; [2001] IESC 59: Judgments of [http://courts.ie/Judgments.nsf/bce24a8184816f1580256ef30048ca50/fddba2cbc75b154e80256ccc005c3756?OpenDocument Keane C.J.] and [http://courts.ie/Judgments.nsf/bce24a8184816f1580256ef30048ca50/fded91c3fda8f0bf80256ccc00384f9a?OpenDocument Denham J.]&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 2005 ECHR ruling in [[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)|the Hirst case]], the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006 was passed to allow postal voting by all prisoners.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dail20061005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0033/print.html |title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In Italy, the most serious offenses involve the loss of voting rights, while for less serious offenses disqualification the judge can choose if there will be some disenfranchisement. Recently, however, the 'decree Severino' added a loss of only the right to stand for an election, against some offenders above a certain threshold of imprisonment:&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/17100946/Dopo_la_sentenza_20_ottobre_2015 Severino: c'è un giudice a Strasburgo Mondoperaio, 21 ottobre 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; it operates administratively, with fixed duration and without intervention of the court.

===Other European countries===
Several European countries permit disenfranchisement by special court order, including France, Germany (reinstated after 2–5 years) and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kiesraad.nl/verkiezingen/tweede-kamer/stemmen/uitsluiting-kiesrecht|title=Uitsluiting kiesrecht|last=Kiesraad|website=www.kiesraad.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several others, no disenfranchisements due to criminal convictions exist. Moreover, many European countries encourage people to vote, such as by making pre-voting in other places than the respective election locales easily accessible. This often includes possibilities for prisoners to pre-vote from the prison itself. This is the case for example in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1998/en19980714.pdf |title= Election Act 714/1998 |date= |year= 1998 |department= |website= Finlex |series= Translations of Finnish acts and decrees |publisher= Ministry of Justice, Finland |pages= 1, 24 |format= pdf |access-date= 25 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the law calls on prisons to encourage prisoners to vote. Only those convicted of [[electoral fraud]] and crimes undermining the "democratic order", such as [[treason]], are barred from voting while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;"Losing the Vote," p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Australia==
At [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in Australia the ''Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902'' denied the franchise to vote to anyone 'attainted of treason, or who had been convicted and is under sentence or subject to be sentenced for any offence ... punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer'.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{citation|title=Prisoner voting rights|first=Lisa|last=Hill|publisher=Australian Review of Public Affairs|url=http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2009/11/hill.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318061231/http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2009/11/hill.html|archivedate=18 March 2013|deadurl=no|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Howard Government]] legislated in 2006 to ban all prisoners from voting. In 2007, the [[High Court of Australia]] in ''[[Roach v Electoral Commissioner]]'' found that the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]] enshrined a limited right to vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/court-gives-vote-back-to-some-inmates/2007/08/30/1188067277253.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824053414/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/court-gives-vote-back-to-some-inmates/2007/08/30/1188067277253.html|archivedate=24 August 2008|title=Court gives vote back to some inmates|date=31 August 2007|first=Jonathan|last=Pearlman|publisher=Fairfax Media|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant that citizens serving relatively short prison sentences (generally less than three years) cannot be barred from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/right-vote-not-enjoyed-equally-all-australians#fnB9a |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814083152/https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/right-vote-not-enjoyed-equally-all-australians |archivedate=14 August 2014 |title=The right to vote is not enjoyed equally by all Australians: 4.

Depending on the threshold of exclusion which is distinct in each state, a prisoner may be able to vote in either state elections or federal elections. For example, prisoners in New South Wales serving a sentence of longer than one year are not entitled to vote in state elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|peea1912|Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act 1912|25(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other countries ==
Most democracies give convicted criminals the same voting rights as other citizens.

In [[Taiwan]] the abrogation of political rights is a form of punishment used in sentencing, available only for some crimes or along with a sentence of death or imprisonment for life. Rights that are suspended in such a sentence include the right to vote and to take public office, as well as the rights to political expression, assembly, association, and protest. In China, there is a similar punishment of [[Deprivation of Political Rights]].

In New Zealand, people who are in prison are not entitled to enroll while they are in prison. Persons who are convicted of electoral offenses in the past 3 years cannot vote or stand for office. In November 2018, the New Zealand Supreme Court ruled that such restrictions are inconsistent with the nation's Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12156876|archiveurl=http://archive.is/FBl2P|archivedate=9 November 2018|title=Supreme Court upholds decision saying ban on prisoner voting inconsistent with Bill of Rights
|date=9 November 2018|first=Sam|last=Hurley|publisher= New Zealand Media and Entertainment |newspaper= The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries allow inmates to vote, including  [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2010/index.do Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer), [2002&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 SCR 519, 2002 SCC 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-2.01/section-245.html ''Canada Elections Act'', SC 2000, c 9, s 245.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[Kenya]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

On 8 December 2008, [[Leung Kwok Hung]] (Long Hair), member of [[Hong Kong]]'s popularly elected [[Legislative Council]] (LegCo), and two prison inmates, successfully challenged disenfranchisement provisions in the LegCo electoral laws. The court found blanket disenfranchisement of prisoners to be in violation of Article 26 of the Basic Law and Article 21 of the Bill of Rights and the denial to persons in custody of access to polling stations as against the law. The government introduced a bill to repeal the provisions of the law disenfranchising persons convicted of crimes (even those against the electoral system) as well as similar ones found in other electoral laws, and it made arrangements for polling stations to be set up at detention centers and prisons. LegCo passed the bill, and it took effect from 31 October 2009, even though no major elections were held until the middle of 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5170">'''Feminist Hulk''' ('''@feministhulk''') is a parody [[Twitter]] account written from the perspective of a [[feminism|feminist]] incarnation of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], a [[Marvel Comics]] superhero with boundless rage and strength but a limited vocabulary.  Feminist Hulk incorporates [[feminist theory]] into tweets, notably threatening to smash the [[patriarchy]] and [[gender binary]]. Blogger Christopher Shea observed that part of the humor "comes from hearing feminist theory spouted by such a [[hypermasculinity|hypermasculine]] figure."&lt;ref name="Shea"/&gt;

==Overview==
The Feminist Hulk Twitter profile reads "HULK SAYS FUCK PATRIARCHY. HULK SMASH GENDER BINARY."&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; The Twitter [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] for Feminist Hulk is an image of the Marvel Comics superhero holding a copy of philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]]'s book ''[[Gender Trouble]]''.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; Feminist Hulk tweets in [[all caps]], but makes an exception for feminist author [[bell hooks]], tweeting "HULK MAKE CAPITALIZATION EXCEPTION FOR bell hooks. HULK LOVE HER ESSAY ON [[Madonna (entertainer)|MADONNA]] AND RACIST [[Cultural appropriation|APPROPRIATION]]".&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;

==History==
Feminist Hulk started tweeting on May 11, 2010, quickly followed by the online magazine ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Traister|first=Rebecca|title=FEMINIST HULK MAKE TWITTER FUN!|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/05/18/feminist_hulk/|newspaper=Salon|date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2010, the account had gained over 15,000 followers&lt;ref name="Shea"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shea|first=Christopher|title=FEMINIST HULK SMASH SEXISM|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2010/06/whats_big_green.html|website=Brainiac|publisher=Boston.com|date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been interviewed on ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bilger|first=Audrey|title=FEMINIST HULK SMASH EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH MS.!|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/07/feminist-hulk-smash-exclusive-interview-with-ms/|newspaper=Ms.|date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Feministing blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Feministing Five: Feminist Hulk|url=http://feministing.com/2011/07/09/the-feministing-five-feminist-hulk/|newspaper=Feministing|date=July 9, 2011|first=Chloe|last=Angyal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, Feminist Hulk garnered over 40,000 followers and was included in [[Amanda Palmer]]'s "Most Amusing Tweets of the Year" song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bilger|first=Audrey|title=FEMINIST HULK MEET MS.

She described herself as a "[[White people|white]], [[vegan]], [[queer]], [[The Woman-Identified Woman|woman-identified female]]."&lt;ref name="Ms3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bilger|first=Audrey|title=Who’s Behind the Mask of Feminist Hulk?

By 2013, Feminist Hulk had 74,000 followers on Twitter.&lt;ref name="Huffpo"/&gt;

===WIC/Formula Resource Project===
In the wake of the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]], insufficient funding disrupted some [[WIC]] food and nutrition programs. Lawson, herself a single mother, set up the website feministhulk.net, using the site as a directory for women who need to find resources during the shutdown and for people who would like to make donations.&lt;ref name="Huffpo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Belkin|first=Lisa|title=Where To Find Formula And Baby Food During A WIC Shutdown|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/where-to-find-formula-baby-food-wic-shutdown_n_4059616.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site includes links to lists of [[food bank]]s and a state-by-state guide to resources for [[infant formula]] and updates on the status of WIC.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Woodsome|first=Kate|title=Feminist Hulk Smash Shutdown, Rescue Women On Food Aid!|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/10/12/232306911/feminist-hulk-smash-shutdown-rescue-women-on-food-aid|newspaper=NPR|date=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

The proposed megastructure would incorporate all of Earth's matter. Sunlight would enter through two large windows, and [[gravity]] would be simulated by the [[centrifugal effect]]. Humans would live on two vast regions that face each other and that are connected through the empty center. The [[hydrosphere]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] would be retained on its inside. The ecosphere would be restricted to the [[equator]]ial zones, while at the low-gravity [[Tropics|tropic]] zones a thin atmosphere would allow only for plantations. The [[polar region]]s would have neither gravity nor atmosphere and would therefore be used for storage of raw materials and microgravity production processes.

===Geometric structure===
Globus Cassus has the [[shape|form]] of a compressed [[geodesic dome|geodesic]] [[icosahedron]] with two diagonal openings. Along the edges of the icosahedron run the skeleton beams, the gaps between the beams contain a shell and, where there are windows, inward-curving domes.

===Building material===
Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[Planetary core|core]] are gradually excavated, transported outwards and then transformed to larger strength and reduced density. While the crust is mined from open pits in the continents' centers, [[magma]] and the liquid mantle are pumped across transfer hoses. The core is dismantled from the surface.

===Planetary scale===
Since the stationary cables would stay clear inside the [[moon]]'s trajectory, the construction of Globus Cassus would not alter the Earth-Moon system. However, on a planetary scale the proportions would be altered, with Globus Cassus being only slightly smaller than [[Saturn]], the [[Solar System|Solar System's]] second-largest planet.

==Construction process==
Starting at four precisely defined points in the [[geostationary orbit]], four [[space elevators]] are built. Eventually they become massive towers, each measuring several hundred kilometers in diameter and extending to a length of about 165,000&amp;nbsp;km. The towers contain elevators which are used to transport silicate building material to the construction sites at geostationary orbit.

===Skeleton and shell===
The building material is converted into vacuum-porous aggregate and used to form the skeleton. It is built retaining constant [[symmetry]] and balance at every moment and will ultimately span around all sides of the earth. Then [[magma]] is pumped towards the skeleton, where it is used to form thin shells in the skeletal openings. Eight of these openings are fitted with large, inward-curving window domes made out of silicon glass.

===The Great Rains===
Having been used up to a large degree, the Earth has shrunk, the polar ice caps have melted and the Earth's mass and therefore [[gravity]] has declined. This leads to the sudden loss of the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[hydrosphere]], which wander outwards towards the new World. Globus Cassus' equator zones are equipped with a system of trenches and moulds that will become [[river]]s, [[lake]]s and [[sea]]s as soon as the water has settled. The transfer process of atmosphere and hydrosphere is called "The Great Rains".

===Colonization===
The moment the Great Rains start, the Earth becomes uninhabitable. Along with massive amounts of seed for all existing plants, the regions of high cultural value, that need to be conserved and reapplied on Globus Cassus have been stored in the skeleton nodes which touch the towers. Humans and animals rise in the towers to await the end of the rains and start settling on the two equator regions.

===Plant growth===
The remaining Earth core is dismantled to build the shells that lie in the pole regions. During this process, the massive heat radiation of the core accelerates plant growth and therefore aids the process of establishing a functioning [[biosphere]].

The '''history of creationism''' relates to the history of thought based on the premise that the natural [[universe]] had a beginning, and came into [[being]] [[supernaturally]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Montgomery|2012|pp=4–9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[creationism]]'' in its broad sense covers a wide range of views and interpretations, and was not in common use before the late 19th century. Throughout [[recorded history]], many people have viewed the universe as a [[creation myth|created entity]]. Many ancient historical accounts from around the world refer to or imply a [[creation myth|creation]] of the earth and universe. Although specific historical understandings of creationism have used varying degrees of [[empirical]], [[spirtuality|spiritual]] and/or [[philosophical]] investigations, they are all based on the view that the universe was created. The [[Genesis creation narrative]] has provided a basic framework for Jewish and Christian [[epistemological]] understandings of how the universe came into [[being]] - through the divine intervention of the [[god]], [[Yahweh]]. Historically, literal interpretations of this narrative were more dominant than [[allegorical interpretations of Genesis|allegorical ones]].{{sfn|Forster|Marston|2001|}}

From the 18th century on, various views aimed at reconciling the [[Abrahamic religions]] and Genesis with [[geology]], [[biology]] and other [[science]]s developed in [[Western culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author-last = Montgomery | author-first = David R. | title = The evolution of creationism | journal = GSA Today | volume = 22 | number = 11 | pages = 4–9 | publisher = Geological Society of America | doi = 10.1130/GSATG158A.1 | date = November 2012  | url = http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/22/11/article/i1052-5173-22-11-4.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Numbers_Ordinary_View"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterbalance.net/history/ordcreat-frame.html|title=The ‘Ordinary’ View of Creation|last=Numbers|first=Ronald L|authorlink=Ronald Numbers|website=Counterbalance Interactive Library|publisher=Counterbalance Foundation|location=Seattle, WA|accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the word [[Creationism (soul)|creationism]] referred to a doctrine of creation of the soul. Those holding that [[species]] had been created in a separate act, such as [[Omphalos (book)|Philip Gosse]] in 1857, were generally called "advocates of creation", though they were also called "creationists" in private correspondence between [[Charles Darwin]] and his friends, dating from 1856.&lt;ref name="Darwin_letters_1856_1863" /&gt;

In the 20th century the word "creationism" became associated with the anti-evolution movement of the 1920s and [[young Earth creationism]], but this usage was contested by other groups, such as [[old Earth creationism|old Earth creationists]] and [[theistic evolution|evolutionary creationists]], who hold different concepts of creation, such as the acceptance of the [[age of the Earth]] and biological evolution as understood by the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref name="Stewart2009"&gt;[[#Stewart 2010|Haarsma 2010]], p. 168,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} "Some Christians, often called 'Young Earth creationists,' reject evolution in order to maintain a semi-literal interpretation of certain biblical passages. Other Christians, called 'progressive creationists,' accept the scientific evidence for some evolution over a long history of the earth, but also insist that God must have performed some miracles during that history to create new life-forms. The theory of Intelligent Design, as it is promoted in North America is a form of progressive creation. Still other Christians, called 'theistic evolutionists' or 'evolutionary creationists,' assert that the scientific theory of evolution and the religious beliefs of Christianity can both be true."&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' (1961) became the most successful young earth creationist publication after 1945''.'' From the mid-1960s, creationists in the United States promoted the teaching of "scientific creationism" using "[[Flood geology]]" in public school science classes.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Numbers |first=Ronald L |encyclopedia=[[Encarta|Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009]] |title=Creationism |url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761580511___0/Creationism.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022061756/http://encarta.msn.com/text_761580511___0/Creationism.html |archivedate=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2014-03-09 |publisher=[[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]] |location=Redmond, WA}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the legal judgment of the case ''[[Daniel v. Waters]]'' (1975) ruled that teaching creationism in public schools contravened the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the content was stripped of overt biblical references and renamed creation science. When the court case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' (1987) ruled that creation science similarly contravened the constitution, all references to "creation" in a draft school textbook were changed to refer to intelligent design, which was presented by creationists as a new scientific theory. The ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]]'' (2005) ruling concluded that intelligent design is not science and contravenes the constitutional restriction on teaching religion in public school science classes.&lt;ref name="Flank_April2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |title=Creationism/ID: A Short Legal History |last=Flank |first=Lenny |website=Talk Reason |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063247/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |archivedate=August 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, [[Bill Nye]] ("[[Bill Nye the Science Guy|The Science Guy]]") expressed his concern that ''creationist views'' threaten [[science education]] and [[innovation]]s in the United States.&lt;ref name="APNews-20120924"&gt;{{cite news |last=Luvan |first=Dylan |date=September 24, 2012 |title=Bill Nye Warns: Creation Views Threaten US Science |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bill-nye-warns-creation-views-threaten-us-science |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Youtube-20120823"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fowler |first=Jonathan |last2=Rodd |first2=Elizabeth |title=Bill Nye: Creationism Is Not Appropriate For Children |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHbYJfwFgOU |date=August 23, 2012 |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=[[Big Think]] |location=New York |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141103-JD"&gt;{{cite news |last=Deiviscio |first=Jeffrey |title=A Fight for the Young Creationist Mind - In ‘Undeniable,’ Bill Nye Speaks Evolution Directly to Creationists |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/science/in-undeniable-bill-nye-speaks-evolution-directly-to-creationists.html |date=November 3, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and Modern science==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}
In the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Columbian Exchange|discoveries in new lands]] brought knowledge of the diversity of life. In 1605, [[Francis Bacon]] emphasized that the works of God in nature teach us how to interpret the [[Bible]], and the [[Baconian method]] introduced the empirical approach which became central to modern science.&lt;ref name="James_Moore"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Moore |first=James |authorlink=James Moore (biographer) |interviewer=[[Krista Tippett]] |title=Evolution and Wonder: Understanding Charles Darwin |url=http://www.onbeing.org/program/evolution-and-wonder-understanding-charles-darwin/transcript/899 |publisher=[[NPR]] |work=[[On Being|Speaking of Faith with Krista Tippett]] |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural theology]] sought evidence in nature supporting an active role of God, and attempts were made to reconcile new knowledge with the biblical [[Flood myth|deluge myth]] and story of [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name="floodgeol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p82.htm |title=History of the Collapse of 'Flood Geology' and a Young Earth |website=PhilVaz.com |publisher=Philip J. Porvaznik |accessdate=2014-03-09}} Adapted from [[#Young 1995|Young 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; The development of modern [[geology]] in the 18th and 19th centuries found [[Stratum|geological strata]] and [[Fossil#Fossilization processes|fossil]] sequences indicating a very ancient Earth. The [[diluvial]] cosmogonies fell victim to their own success, as the spirit of scientific inquiry they had stimulated, gradually led to discoveries that undercut the biblical premises of flood geology and [[catastrophism]].&lt;ref name="floodgeol" /&gt;

From around the start of the 19th century, ideas such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s concept of [[transmutation of species]] had gained supporters in Paris and [[Edinburgh]], mostly amongst anatomists.&lt;ref name="rsf" /&gt; The anonymous publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' in 1844 aroused wide public interest with support from [[Quakers]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], but was strongly criticised by the religious establishment and the scientific community, which called for solidly backed science. In 1859, Charles Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' provided that evidence from an authoritative and respected source, and within a decade or so convinced scientists that evolution occurs. This view clashed with that of conservative evangelicals in the [[Church of England]], but in 1860 their attention turned to the much greater uproar about ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Anglican theologians]], which introduced "[[Historical criticism|higher criticism]]", a hermeneutic method re-examining the Bible and questioning literal readings.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991}} By 1875 most American [[natural history|naturalists]] supported ideas of theistic evolution, often involving [[special creation]] of [[human|human beings]].&lt;ref name="encarta" /&gt;

At this time those holding that species had been separately created were generally called "advocates of creation," but they were occasionally called "creationists" in private correspondence between Charles Darwin and his friends.&lt;ref name="Numbers_Antievolutionists"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterbalance.net/history/anticreat-frame.html |title=Antievolutionists and Creationists |last=Numbers |first=Ronald L |website=Counterbalance Interactive Library |publisher=Counterbalance Foundation |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in letters Darwin wrote between 1856 and 1863,&lt;ref name="Darwin_letters_1856_1863"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-1919 |title=Darwin, C.

By this time, geologists recognised that the Earth was millions of years old. The exact chronology proposed by Darwin was disputed by other geologists, and the leading physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin#Age of the Earth: geology and theology|William Thomson]] (later enobled as Lord Kelvin) produced an analyses of the heat energy and thermal histories of [[Age of the Earth#Convective mantle and radioactivity|the Earth]] and Sun which yielded age estimates that were too short for gradual evolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4AWPFdyrWIC|title=Lord Kelvin and the Age of the Earth|last=Burchfield|first=Joe D.|date=1990-05-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226080437|location=|pages=69 ff|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson's colleague [[Fleeming Jenkin]] wrote an 1867 review of Darwin's ''On the Origin of species'' which opposed evolution on the basis of the shortened time available.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kelvin's age paradox was not [[Age of the Earth#Convective mantle and radioactivity|resolved]] until it was discovered in the 20th century that the Earth is heated by radioactive decay, that its internal thermal gradient is affected by mantle convection, and that the Sun is heated by nuclear fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|title=Kelvin's age of the Earth paradox revisited|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=105|issue=B6|pages=13155–13158|bibcode=2000JGR...10513155S|doi=10.1029/2000JB900028|last1=Stacey|first1=Frank D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, the [[Big Bang|big-bang theory]] has been the prevailing [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Scientific model|model]] for the [[universe]]. It was envisioned by a Roman Catholic priest, Monsignor [[Georges Lemaître]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dp27bi.html|title=People and Discoveries: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[PBS]]|work=A Science Odyssey|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemaître suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemaître|first=G.|date=1931|title=The Evolution of the Universe: Discussion|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=128|issue=3234|pages=699–701|bibcode=1931Natur.128..704L|doi=10.1038/128704a0|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist subscribed to a view that the universe is in an eternal [[Steady state theory|steady state]]. After Lemaître proposed his theory, some scientists complained that its assumption that time had a beginning amounted to a reimportation of religious concepts into physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cosmology and Controversy|last=Kragh|first=H.|date=1996|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0-691-02623-8|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the expression "Big Bang" was coined by [[Fred Hoyle]] in 1949, he meant it to be slightly pejorative, but the term stuck and gained currency. Lemaître himself concluded that an initial "[[Ex nihilo|creation]]-like" event must have occurred. The Big-Bang is contrary to young-Earth creationism, sensu stricto. But it has been welcomed by other Christian creeds, and it is in line with the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] concept of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a8nuAAAAMAAJ|title=Coming of age in the Milky Way|last=Ferris|first=T.|date=1988|publisher=[[William Morrow and Company|Morrow]]|isbn=978-0-688-05889-0|pages=274, 438|ref=harv}}, citing {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eYHvAAAAMAAJ|title=The Big bang and Georges Lemaître: proceedings of a symposium in honour of G.

==Pre-scientific era==
{{Life timeline}}

===Early history===
[[File:Augustine of Hippo.jpg|right|150px|thumb|St. Augustine of Hippo]]

[[David Sedley]], in his book ''Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity'', traces creationary thought to the [[presocratic]] thinkers [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Empedocles]], in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sedley|2009|p=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedley states that Anaxagoras was recognized by [[Plato]] as "the first overt champion of a creative cosmic intelligence. Anaxagoras theory was that the original state of the world was a roughly even mixture of all opposites, and that it was the effect of the action of ''nous'' (intelligence or mind) that led to the partial separation of such opposites, hot from cold, land from water, rarefied from dense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sedley|2009|pp=8, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anaxagoras also developed the philosophical innovation of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of mind from matter, diverging from the stringent [[monism]] of his predecessor, [[Parmenides]].{{sfn|Sedley|2009|p=11}} Empedocles proposed a system whereby two competing divine forces, Love (harmony and blending) and Strife (separation) had alternating dominion over the universe and the four elements, earth, water, air and fire.{{sfn|Sedley|2009|p=32, 33}}

Around 45 BCE, [[Cicero]] made a [[teleological argument]] that anticipated the [[watchmaker analogy]],{{Synthesis inline|date=November 2010}} in ''De natura deorum'', ii. 34
:When you see a sundial or a water-clock, you see that it tells the time by design and not by chance. How then can you imagine that the universe as a whole is devoid of purpose and intelligence, when it embraces everything, including these artifacts themselves and their artificers? (Gjertsen 1989, p. 199, quoted by Dennett 1995, p. 29){{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

c. 170 &amp;ndash; Theophilus of Antioch wrote in defense of creation beliefs and a relatively young Earth:
:"There are not myriads of myriads of years, even though Plato said such a period had elapsed between the deluge and his own time, . . . The world is not uncreated nor is there spontaneous production of everything, as Pythagoras and the others have babbled; instead the world is created and is providentially governed by the God who made everything. And the whole period of time and the years can be demonstrated to those who wish to learn the truth. . . . The total number of years from the creation of the world is 5,695.29 ... If some period has escaped our notice, say 50 or 100 or even 200 years, at any rate it is not myriads, or thousands of years as it was for Plato . . . and the rest of those who wrote falsehoods. It may be that we do not know the exact total of all the years simply because the additional months and days are not recorded in the sacred books."{{cite quote|date=November 2010}}

170 &amp;ndash; [[Galen]], [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[physician]] wrote against creation beliefs in ''On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body'', 11.14:
:It is precisely this point in which our own opinion and that of Plato and of the other Greeks who follow the right method in natural science differ from the position taken up by Moses. For the latter it seems enough to say that God simply willed the arrangement of matter and it was presently arranged in due order; for he believes everything to be possible with God, even should he wish to make a bull or a horse out of ashes. We, however, do not hold this; we say that certain things are impossible by nature and that God does not even attempt such things at all but that he [sic] chooses the best out of the possibility of becoming.

In the 5th century, [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] wrote ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'' in which he argued that Genesis should be interpreted as God forming the Earth and life from pre-existing matter and allowed for an allegorical interpretation of the first chapter of Genesis. For example: he argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. On the other hand, Augustine called for a historical view of the remainder of the history recorded in Genesis, including the creation of [[Adam and Eve]], and the [[Noah's Ark|Flood]]. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that Christians should be willing to change their minds about it as new information comes up. He also warned believers not to rashly interpret things literally that might be allegorical, as it would discredit the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Young | first = Davis A. | authorlink = | title = The Contemporary Relevance Of Augustine's View Of Creation | journal = [[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]] | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–45 | publisher = [[American Scientific Affiliation]] | url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html| doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

610 - 632 &amp;ndash; [[Muhammad]] reports receiving the [[Qur'an]] by [[divine revelation]]. The Qur'an holds many of the core concepts of creationism, including a 6-day creation, [[Adam and Eve]], [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], and [[Noah's ark]], but also provides some details absent from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], including reference to a fourth [[Sons of Noah|son of Noah]] who chose not to enter the ark. Through [[Islam]], creation beliefs and [[monotheism]] replace [[paganism]] among the [[Arabs]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Renaissance and protoscience===

The [[Renaissance]] starting in the 14th century saw the establishment of [[protoscience]] that eventually became modern [[science]]. This was a period of great [[social change]].

The [[Baconian method]] introduced the empirical [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite web | last = Moore | first = James | authorlink = James Moore (biographer) | title = Evolution and Wonder - Understanding Charles Darwin | work = Speaking of Faith (Radio Program) | publisher = American Public Media | url = http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/darwin/transcript.shtml | accessdate = 2007-06-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081222020720/http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/darwin/transcript.shtml | archivedate = 2008-12-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural theology]] sought evidence in nature supporting Christianity.

[[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s idea of [[Heliocentrism]] was proposed in the 16th century and established by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. This overturned the Greek [[Ptolemaic system]] of [[geocentrism]], which had been adopted as Church dogma with the [[Influence of Hellenic philosophy on Christianity|fusion of Christianity with Greek Philosophy]] in the first few centuries AD.

The English naturalist [[John Ray]] (29 November 1627 - 17 January 1705) is sometimes referred to{{By whom|date=November 2010}} as the father of English natural history. As well as collecting and classifying plants, he wrote two books entitled ''The Wisdom of God manifested in the Works of the Creation'' (1691), and ''Miscellaneous Discourses concerning the Dissolution and Changes of the World'' (1692), which included essays on ''The Primitive Chaos and Creation of the World'', ''The General Deluge, its Causes and Effects'', and ''The Dissolution of the World and Future Conflagrations''. In ''The Wisdom of God'' he included many of the familiar examples of purposive adaptation and design in nature (the [[teleological argument]]), such as the structure of the eye, the hollowness of the bones, the camel's stomach and the hedgehog's armor.

[[Carl Linnaeus]], in the 18th century, established a system of classification of [[species]] by similarity. At the time, the system of classification was seen as the plan of organization used by God in his creation. Later, the theory of evolution applied it as groundwork for the idea of [[common descent]].

====Religious arguments====
In 1650 the [[Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh]], [[James Ussher]], published a monumental history of the world from creation to 70 A.D. He used the recorded genealogies and ages in the [[bible]] to derive what is commonly known as the [[Ussher chronology]]. This calculated a date for [[Creation myth|creation]] at 4004 BC. The date was widely accepted in the English-speaking world.

In 1696, [[William Whiston]] published ''[[A New Theory of the Earth]]'', in which he proposed an account of the creation of the world. He grounded his argument in the following three ''Postulata'':
:1) The obvious or literal sense of scripture is the true and real one, where no evidence can be given to the contrary.
:2) That which is clearly accountable in a natural way, is not, without reason to be ascribed to a miraculous power.
:3) What ancient tradition asserts of the constitution of nature, or of the origin and primitive states of the world, is to be allowed for true, where ‘tis fully agreeable to scripture, reason, and philosophy.
Whiston was the first to propose that the [[deluge (mythology)|global flood]] was caused by the water in the tail of a [[comet]].

The English divine [[William Derham]] (26 November 1657 - 5 April 1735) published his ''Artificial Clockmaker'' in 1696 and ''Physico-Theology'' in 1713. These books were [[teleological argument]]s for the being and attributes of God, and were used by Paley nearly a century later.

The [[Watchmaker analogy]] was put by [[Bernard Nieuwentyt]] (1730) and referred to several times by Paley. A charge of wholesale [[plagiarism]] from this book was brought against Paley in the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum]] for 1848, but the famous illustration of the watch was not peculiar to Nieuwentyt, and had been appropriated by many others before Paley.

[[David Hume]] (26 April 1711 - 25 August 1776), a Scottish naturalist, empiricist, and skeptic, argued for naturalism and against belief in God. He argued that order stems from both design and natural processes, so it is not necessary to infer a designer when one sees order; that the design argument, even if it worked, would not support a robust or even moral God, that the argument [[begging the question|begged the question]] of the origin of God, and that design was merely a [[anthropomorphism|human projection]] onto the forces of nature.

==Scientific era==

===Modern geology and gap theory===
{{See also|Gap creationism}}
[[James Hutton]] is often viewed as the first modern [[geology|geologist]]. In 1785 he presented a paper entitled ''Theory of the Earth'' to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. Based upon a detailed examination of what we now recognise as the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere he showed that the present forces seen on the earth were sufficient to explain all the phenomena observed.  He wrote "The Mosaic history places this beginning of man at no great distance; and there has not been found, in natural history, any document by which a high antiquity can be attribted to the human race.  But this is not the case with regard to the inferior species of animals, particularly those which inhabit the ocean and its shorees.  We find in natural history monuments which prove that those animals had long existed; and thus we thus preocure a measure for the computation of time extremely remote though far from being precisely ascertained"(p8)  Based upon these principles of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], he demonstrated that the Earth is much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be [[erosion|eroded]] and for [[sediment]] to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Hutton|Hutton, J.]] (1785) ''Theory of the Earth''&lt;/ref&gt;  The presumption that the world was only 6,000 years old was scientifically abandoned as a result of Hutton's work.

This development of the scientific discipline of geology, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the discovery that the Earth was far older than a literal interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]] could account for, led to the development, and popularity, of the ''Gap Theory'' (now known as [[gap creationism]]) to accommodate these discoveries. Gap Theory assumes a recent six-day creation, but also that the Earth existed for many ages before this event, ending in cataclysm and a new creation (hence its alternative title 'ruin-restoration theory').&lt;ref name=McIver&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, "a heterogeneous group of writers," known as [[scriptural geologist]]s, arose to oppose these discoveries,&lt;ref name = Rudwick&gt;''[[The Great Devonian Controversy]]'', [[Martin J. S. Rudwick]], 1988, {{ISBN|0-226-73102-2}}, pp 42-44&lt;/ref&gt; and the Gap Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Livingstone|Hart|Noll|1999|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their views were marginalised and ignored by the [[scientific community]] of their time.&lt;ref name = Rudwick/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"But since &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[William Henry Fitton]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and other geologists regarded [scriptural geology] as scientifically worthless…" — ''Worlds before Adam'', [[Martin J.

From 1830 to 1833, the geologist and clergyman Sir [[Charles Lyell]] released a three volume publication called ''Principles of Geology'', which developed Hutton's ideas of uniformitarianism, and in the second volume set out a gradualist variation of creation beliefs in which each species had its "centre of creation" and was designed for the habitat, but would become extinct when the habitat changed. [[John Herschel]] supported this gradualist view and wrote to Lyell urging a search for natural laws underlying the "mystery of mysteries" of how species formed.&lt;ref&gt;Herschel, J.F.W and Paul l Kesaris (1990), "Letters and papers of Sir John Herschel: a guide to the manuscripts and microfilm" (University Publications of America)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, [[Philip Henry Gosse]] published ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos: Untying the Geological Knot]]''. The [[Omphalos hypothesis]] argued that the World had been created by God recently, but with the appearance of old age. This was largely ignored, and some considered it [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] because it accused the Creator of deceit. Some [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth creationists]] would later incorporate parts of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Henry Gosse|Gosse, P.H.]] (1857) ''Omphalos: Untying the Geological Knot''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Darwinian biology===
[[Erasmus Darwin]] published his [[Zoönomia]] between 1794 and 1796 foreshadowing Lamarck's ideas on evolution, and even suggesting ''"that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great First Cause endued with animality ... possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity."''

Advances in [[paleontology]], led by [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] saw the recording of the first [[fossil record]]s that showed the [[transmutation of species]]. Then, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] proposed, in his ''Philosophie Zoologique'' of 1809, a theory of evolution, later known as [[Lamarckism]], by which traits that were "needed" were passed on.

[[File:WilliamPaley.jpg|frame|right|William Paley (1743 - 1805) proponent of the [[Watchmaker analogy]], a variant of the [[teleological argument]]]]
In 1802, [[William Paley]] published ''[[Natural Theology]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[William Paley|Paley, Wm]] (1802) ''Natural Theology''&lt;/ref&gt; in response to naturalists such as Hume, refining the ancient [[teleological argument]] (or argument from design) to argue for the existence of God. He argued that life was so intricately designed and interconnected as to be analogous to a watch. Just as when one finds a watch, one reasonable infers that it was designed and constructed by an intelligent being, although one has never seen the designer, when one observes the complexity and intricacy of life, one may reasonably infer that it was designed and constructed by God, although one has never seen God.

The official eight ''[[Bridgewater Treatises]]'' "On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation" included the Reverend [[William Buckland]]'s 1836 ''Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology'' setting out the logic of day-age, gap theory, and theistic evolution.
The computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] then published his unofficial ''Ninth Bridgewater Treatise'' in 1837, putting forward a thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) that then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required.

By 1836 the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] had theories influenced by [[Johannes Peter Müller]] that living matter had an "organising energy," a life-force that directed the growth of tissues and also determined the lifespan of the individual and of the species. In the 1850s Owen developed ideas of "archetypes" in the Divine mind producing a sequence of species in "ordained continuous becoming" in which new species appeared at birth.

Late in 1844 the anonymous publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' popularised the idea of divinely ordered development of everything from [[stellar evolution]] to [[transmutation of species]]. It quickly gained fashionable success in court circles and aroused interest in all sections of society. It also aroused religious controversy, and after initially being slow to respond, the scientific establishment attacked the book. It continued to be a best seller to around the end of the century.

[[Herbert Spencer]] was a 19th-century English philosopher who developed ideas about the unifying concept of evolution across the natural and social sciences. Spencer is the first to develop a theory of [[cultural evolution]] and is considered by some to be the father of [[Social Darwinism]]. It is also he and not Darwin who coined the phrase ''[[survival of the fittest]]''. Much of the [[positivist]] ideas of progress that dominated the social science philosophy of Spencer and subsequent Social Darwinists has been criticized by present-day [[sociologists]], but such ideas continue to be one of the major critiques made by creationists against evolution in general, even though strict biological evolution does not depend on it nor offer any type of endorsement of so-called "social Darwinism" or its derivative philosophies such as [[eugenics]].

==Age of Darwin==
[[File:Darwin sexual caricature.gif|thumb|right|When Darwin appeared in public with a beard in 1866, cartoonists were quick to satirise his ideas about [[common descent]] with apes. In this 1872 cartoon Darwin is fascinated by the apparent [[steatopygia]] in the new fashion for [[bustle]]s. The woman asks him to "leave my emotions alone," a reference to Darwin's new book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.]]
The decades following [[Charles Darwin]]'s publication of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', in 1859, saw the overwhelming majority of North American and British naturalists accept some form of evolution, with many liberal and educated churchmen following their example, and thereby rejecting a [[biblical literalism|biblically literalist]] interpretation of Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p 15&lt;/ref&gt; Although Darwin's work rejected "the dogma of separate creations," he invoked creation as the probable source of the first lifeforms ("into which life was first breathed"). This led [[Asa Gray]], who was both religiously orthodox, and Darwin's most prominent American supporter, to suggest that Darwin had accepted "a supernatural beginning of life on earth" and that he should therefore allow a second "special origination" for humanity. Darwin however rejected this view, and used uncompromisingly naturalistic language in place of biblical idiom, starting with ''The Descent of Man'' in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) pp 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book caused less controversy than he had feared, as the idea of evolution had been widely popularized in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by the 1844 publication of ''[[Vestiges of Creation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/darwin.html Charles Darwin: gentleman naturalist: A biographical sketch], John van Wyhe, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it posed fundamental questions about the [[relationship between religion and science]]. Though ''Origin'' did not explicitly deal with human evolution, the jump was one both supporters and opponents of the theory immediately made, and the idea that man was simply an animal ([[common descent]]) who had evolved a particular set of characteristics &amp;mdash; rather than a spiritual being created by God &amp;mdash; continued to be one of the most divisive notions of the 19th century. One of the most famous disputes was the [[Oxford]] Debate of 1860, in which [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.H. Huxley]], Darwin's self-appointed "bulldog," [[debate]]d evolution with [[Samuel Wilberforce]], the [[Bishop]] of Oxford. Both sides claimed victory, then the controversy was overshadowed by the even greater theological furore over the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' questioning whether miracles were atheistic, bringing to a head arguments in the [[Church of England]] between [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theologians]] supporting [[higher criticism]], and conservative [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/essays.html Introduction to Essays and Reviews (1860)], Glenn Everett, Associate Professor of English, University of Tennessee at Martin, VictorianWeb.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  The essays were described by their opponents as [[heresy|heretical]], and the essayists were called "The Seven Against Christ."&lt;ref name=dm500-1&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991| pp=500–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, the [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin)]] published calculations, based on his presumption of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], and that the heat of the sun was caused by its gravitational shrinkage, that fixed the [[age of the Earth]] and the [[solar system]] at between 20&amp;nbsp;million and 400&amp;nbsp;million years, i.e. between ~3,000 and ~70,000 times Ussher's value. This came as a blow to Darwin's anticipated timescale, though the idea of an ancient Earth was generally accepted without much controversy. Darwin and Huxley, while not accepting the timing, said it merely implied faster evolution. It would take further advances in [[geology]] and the discovery of [[radioactivity]] that showed that the sun was in fact heated by [[nuclear fusion]] that demonstrated the present estimated 4.567&amp;nbsp;billion years, or ~700,000 times Ussher's value. A way to measure the [[age of the universe]] would be discovered by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the 1930s, but due to observational constraints, an accurate measurement of the [[Hubble constant]] would not be forthcoming until the late 1990s. According to the [[ESA]]/[[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] data, released in March 2013, the age of the universe is approximately 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; or some ~2,000,000 times Ussher's value.

The Swiss-American paleontologist [[Louis Agassiz]] opposed evolution. He believed that there had been a series of catastrophes with divine re-creations, evidence of which could be seen in rock fossils. Though uniformitarianism dominated ideas from the 1840s onwards, [[Catastrophism]] remained a major [[scientific paradigm|paradigm]] in [[geology]] until replaced by new models that allowed for both cataclysms (such as [[meteorites|meteor strikes]]) and gradualist patterns (such as [[ice age]]s) to explain observed geologic phenomena.

In 1878, American Presbyterians held the first annual [[Niagara Bible Conference]], founding the [[Christian fundamentalist]] movement, which took its name from the "Five Fundamentals" of 1910, and came to be concerned about the implications of evolution for the accuracy of the Bible. But by no means all orthodox Presbyterians were opposed to evolution as a possible method of the Divine procedure. Dr [[Charles Hodge]] of Princeton Seminary objected in 1874 to the atheism he considered inplied in the naturalistic explanation but both he and Dr [[B. B. Warfield]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield]] Evolution, Science &amp; Scripture (Baker 2000) ed. [[Mark Noll]] &amp; [[David N. Livingstone]]&lt;/ref&gt; were open to its possibility/probability within limits, and most churchmen sought to reconcile Darwinism with Christianity.

Darwin died in 1882. In 1915, [[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope]], spread rumors that he had repented and accepted God on his deathbed. Lady Hope's story is almost certainly false, and it is unlikely that she visited Darwin as she claimed.&lt;ref&gt;"''Charles Darwin's Death-Bed: Story of Conversion Denied,''" Mrs R B Litchfield, The Christian, February 23, 1922, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
In the 1920s, the term ''creationism'' became particularly associated with a [[fundamentalist Christianity|Christian fundamentalist]] movement opposed to the idea of [[human evolution]], which succeeded in getting teaching of [[evolution]] banned in United States [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} From the mid-1960s [[young Earth creationism]] proposed "scientific creationism" using "[[Flood geology]]" as support for a literal reading of Genesis.&lt;ref name=encarta/&gt; After legal judgements that teaching this in public schools contravened constitutional [[separation of Church and State]], it was stripped of biblical references and called [[creation science]], then when this was ruled unacceptable, [[intelligent design]] was coined.&lt;ref name=lenny&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |title=Creationism/ID, A Short Legal History |author=Lenny Flank |publisher=Talk Reason |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063247/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decades before the start of the 20th century, and the first decades of that century, have been described as [[the eclipse of Darwinism]]. Darwin's work had quickly established scientific consensus that evolution occurred, but there was considerable disagreement about the mechanisms involved, and few gave as much significance to natural selection as Darwin himself. Evolution itself was assumed, but the ''mechanism'' of how it happened was in considerable debate, and none had anything near to a consensus. Among these theories were [[neo-Lamarckism]] (which merged certain aspects of Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics with certain aspects of Darwinian evolution), [[orthogenesis]] ("straight-line" evolution, which talked about evolution towards a specific goal by forces within the organism), and the discontinuous variation of [[Mendelism]] and [[Hugo De Vries]]' [[mutation theory]]. Some of these alternative theories, in particular neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, allowed more easily for an interpretation of the intervention of God, which appealed to many scientists at the time. The term ''[[Darwinism]]'' had covered a wide range of ideas, many of which differed from Darwin's views, but it became associated with the minority view of [[August Weismann]] who went further than Darwin by rejecting [[inheritance of acquired characters]] and attributing all evolution to natural selection, a view also called [[neo-Darwinism]]. By the first decades of the 20th century, the debate had become generally one between continuous-variation biometricians and discontinuous-variety Mendelians. In the 1930s and 1940s, though, they were combined with natural selection into the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], which soon became the dominant model in the scientific community. This model has also been called Darwinism and neo-Darwinism.

[[George McCready Price]] was important in developing ''[[flood geology]]'', and while he had limited influence at a time when all geologists had long accepted an ancient earth, many of his ideas that a young earth could be deduced from science were taken up later. Price was a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], and followed one of the founders of the church, [[Ellen White]], in seeing fossils as evidence of the [[Great Flood]]. In 1906, Price published ''Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory'' in which he offered $1000 ''"to any one who will, in the face of the facts here presented, show me how to prove that one kind of fossil is older than another."''&lt;ref name="Numbers2006"&gt;{{harv|Numbers|2006)}}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
In 1910, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church distilled the principles of Christian fundamentalism into what were known as the "five fundamentals," one of which was the inerrancy of the [[Bible|Scriptures]], including the Genesis account of creation. ''[[The Fundamentals]]'' were published as a series of essays. Its authors accepted ancient earth geology, while holding different ideas about how this was reconciled with biblical accounts. The views expressed on evolution were mixed: two short articles were anti evolution, one anonymous and one by the little-known Henry Beach. Their focus was on human evolution, as were attacks made on evolution by [[Dyson Hague]]. Major figures were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through a Lamarckian form of evolution: long articles by [[James Orr (theologian)|James Orr]] and [[George Frederick Wright]] expressed this openness, and [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield]] and A H Strong shared this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

After the [[First World War]] (1914&amp;ndash;1918), the teaching of [[creation and evolution in public education]] grew as a public controversy. By this time, many texts taught the theory of evolution as scientific fact. Many Christians in the U.S.A. and later Jews and Muslims, expressed concern that in teaching evolution as fact, the State was unconstitutionally infringing on their right to the free exercise of religion, as in their opinion this taught their children that the Bible had been proven false.

For example, the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] politician [[William Jennings Bryan]] "became convinced that the teaching of Evolution as a fact caused the students to lose faith in the Bible, first, in the story of creation, and later in other doctrines, which underlie the Christian religion."&lt;ref&gt;''William Jennings Bryan'', W. C. Williams, Putnam, New York, 1936, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.vt.edu/Barrow/Hist3706/readings/numbers.html ''Creationism in 20th-Century America''],
Ronald L. Numbers, Science 218 (5 November 1982): 538-544&lt;/ref&gt;

During the First World War, reports of horrors committed by [[Imperial Germany|Germans]], who were citizens of one of the most scientifically advanced countries in the World, led Bryan to state "The same science that manufactured poisonous gases to suffocate soldiers is preaching that man has a brute ancestry and eliminating the miraculous and the supernatural from the Bible."

A popular book published in 1917 by Stanford University professor and entomologist [[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Vernon L. Kellogg]] entitled ''Headquarters Nights'',&lt;ref&gt;First published in ''Atlantic Monthly in 1917&lt;/ref&gt; drew a direct association between German war ideology and Darwinian description of nature as a struggle. Kellogg was a leading authority on evolution of insects, and had published ''Darwinism Today'' in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/KELL1867.htm |title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch - Vernon L.

[[Benjamin Kidd]]'s 1918 book ''Science of Power'', claimed that there were historical and philosophical connections between Darwinism and German militarism.&lt;ref&gt;''Defender of The Faith William Jennings Bryan'', L. W. Levine, (Oxford Univ. Press. New York, 1965) pp. 261-265&lt;/ref&gt; This book and others around this time had an effect on many people.

In 1922, William Jennings Bryan published ''In His Image'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/2/7/4/12744/12744-8.txt |title=In His Image by William Jennings Bryan - Project Gutenberg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-06-25 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he argued that Darwinism was both irrational and immoral. On the former point, he pointed to examples such as the eye, which he argued could not be explained by Darwinian evolution. On the latter point, he argued that Darwinism advocated the policy of "scientific breeding" or [[eugenics]], by which the strong were to weed out the weak, a policy that directly contradicts the Christian doctrine of charity to the helpless.

In 1923, fundamentalist preacher and evangelist [[William Bell Riley]], known as "The Grand Old Man of Fundamentalism," founded the [[Anti-Evolution League of Minnesota]], which, in 1924, became the [[Anti-Evolution League of America]]. The organization was behind anti-evolution legislation in [[Kentucky]], where its efforts were supported by William Jennings Bryan.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, William. ''North Carolina Through Four Centuries.'' University of North Carolina Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, [[Clarence Darrow]] defended [[Nathan Leopold]] and [[Richard Loeb]] on the charge of kidnapping and killing [[Bobby Franks]]; his defense included an argument that "this terrible crime was inherent in his organism, and it came from some ancestor."

In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Harry Rimmer]] was one of the most prominent American creationists. Known as the "noisiest evangelist in America,"&lt;ref name=Teller&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardtbabinski.us/essays/froth.html |title='&amp;#39;Essays of an Atheist'&amp;#39;, Woolsey Teller, The Truth Seeker Company, Inc, 1945, Chapter V: Froth and Fraud in Fundamentalism |publisher=Edwardtbabinski.us |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; he published many creationist tracts, debated other creationists and was involved in a famous trial known as the "Floyd-Rimmer trial" against the atheist William Floyd.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Defeats Atheism - A Story of the Famous Harry Rimmer Trial as told by Attorney for Defendant James E. Bennet'', James E. Bennet, Zondervan; Frederick Naef, Printers, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, [[G. K. Chesterton]] published [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/everlasting_man.html ''The Everlasting Man''], in which he developed and articulated many creationist ideas and criticisms of the philosophical underpinnings and perceived logical flaws of evolution.

[[File:H l mencken.jpg|thumb|right|[[H. L. Mencken]], whose nationally published coverage of the [[Scopes Trial]] referred to the town's creationist inhabitants as "yokels" and "morons," referred to assisting counsel for the prosecution as a "buffoon" and his speeches as "theologic bilge," while referring to the defense as "eloquent" and "magnificent."]]

The [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925 is perhaps the most famous court case of its kind. The [[Butler Act]] had prohibited the teaching of evolution in [[public education|public schools]] in [[Tennessee]]. [[Clarence Darrow]] was the defense counsel, and William Jennings Bryan was the prosecutor. Bryan appealed for assistance to [[George McCready Price]], [[Johns Hopkins University]] physician [[Howard A. Kelly]], physicist [[Louis T. More]], and [[Alfred W. McCann]], all of whom had written books supporting creationism. Price was away in England, Kelly and More told Bryan they considered themselves more convinced by evolution, and McCann was not interested because of Bryan's stance on [[prohibition]].&lt;ref name="Numbers2006"/&gt; Nevertheless, a schoolteacher named [[John T. Scopes]] was found guilty of teaching evolution and fined, although the case was later dismissed on a technicality.

Following up on the [[Butler Act]], antievolutionary laws were passed in [[Mississippi]] in 1926, and then in [[Arkansas]] in 1928. However, the 1928 election and the onset of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] changed the playing field. Creationists shifted their attention from state legislatures to local school boards, having substantial success. They set themselves to the tasks of "the emasculation of textbooks, the 'purging' of libraries, and above all the, continued hounding of teachers." Discussions of evolution vanished from almost all schoolbooks. By 1941, about one third of American teachers were afraid of being accused of supporting evolution.&lt;ref name="Numbers2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Gatewood, 3r., Ed., Controversy in the Twenties (Vanderbilt Univ. Press, Nashville 1969), p. 39; J. V. Grabiner and P. D. Miller Science 185, 832 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, a book by one of [[George McCready Price]]'s former students, [[Harold W. Clark]] described Price's catastrophism as "creationism" in ''Back to Creationism''.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Harold W. (1929) ''Back to Creationism'' (Angwin, Calif.: Pacific Union Press, 1929), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Previously anti-evolutionists had described themselves as being "Christian fundamentalists" "Anti-evolution" or "Anti-false science." The term creationism had previously referred to the creation of [[soul]]s for each new person, as opposed to [[traducianism]], where souls were said to have been inherited from one's parents.

In 1933, a group of atheists seeking to develop a "new religion" to replace previous, deity-based religions, composed the [[Humanist Manifesto]], which outlined a fifteen-point belief system, the first two points of which provided that "Religious humanists regard the universe as self-existing and not created" and "Humanism believes that man is a part of nature and that he has emerged as a result of a continuous process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |title=Humanist Manifesto I |publisher=Americanhumanist.org |accessdate=2010-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730070437/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |archivedate=2007-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This document exacerbated the ideological tone of the discussion in many circles, as many creationists came to see evolution as a doctrine of the "religion" of atheism.

In 1935, the "Religion and Science Association" was formed by a small group of creationists, led by a Wheaton College professor, to form "a unified front against the theory of evolution."&lt;ref name=CFL&gt;Christian Faith and Life 42 (1936)&lt;/ref&gt; There were three main schools of creationist thought, represented by Price, Rimmer, and tidal expert [[William Bell Dawson]]. However, since Dawson was a proponent of [[day-age creationism]] and Rimmer was ardently convinced that [[gap creationism]] was correct, the staunch supporters of a literal 6&amp;nbsp;day creation and [[young earth creationism|6000-year-old earth]] were incensed, and the organization fell apart.&lt;ref name="Numbers2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Clark to G. M. Price, 12 September 1937 (Price Papers)&lt;/ref&gt;

Price and his supporters retreated to California, and with several doctors working at the College of Medical Evangelists (now Loma Linda University), formed the "Deluge Geology Society." The "Deluge Geology Society" published the ''Bulletin of Deluge Geology and Related Science'' from 1941 to 1945. They made secret plans to unveil discoveries of fossils of human footprints that were in rock that was purportedly older than accounted for in evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;Newsletters, Creation-Deluge Society, 19 August 1944 and 17 February 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; However, again the organization foundered over disagreements about a [[young earth creationism|6000 year old earth]].&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Allen to Board of Directors of the Creation-Deluge Society, 12 August 1945 (courtesy of Molleurus Couperus).&lt;/ref&gt;

Price was particularly strident in his attacks against fellow creationists. His friend and former student [[Harold W. Clark]]  had earned a masters degree in biology from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and felt that Price's book ''New Geology'' was "entirely out of date and inadequate." Unfortunately, Price responded angrily when he found out, accusing Clark of suffering from "the modern mental disease of universityitis" and of falling in with the "tobacco-smoking, Sabbath-breaking. God-defying" evolutionists. Clark pleaded with Price that he still believed in a 6&amp;nbsp;day creation and a young earth and a universal flood, but Price responded with a vitriolic publication entitled ''Theories of Satanic Origin'' about Clark and his views.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Numbers, Spectrum 9, 22 (January 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[George Gaylord Simpson]] argued that the paleontological record supported [[evolution]] in the 1940s. Some creationists, however, objected to his supposed equation of [[microevolution]] and [[macroevolution]], acknowledging the former but denying the latter, and continue to do so to this day.

==Post-war==

===United States===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
The [[Second World War]] (1939&amp;ndash;1945) saw the horrors of the [[Nazi]] [[Holocaust]]. The USA creationist explanation for the Holocaust is that it had been driven in part by [[eugenics]], or the principle that individuals with "undesirable" genetic characteristics should be removed from the gene pool. Eugenics was based in part on principles of cultural evolutionary theory, though many biologists had long opposed it. Although eugenics was rejected by other nations after the war, the memory of it did not quickly fade, and professional scientists sought to distance themselves from it and other racial ideologies associated with the Nazis.

Fissures within the creationist community, which had always been present, continued to deepen as fundamentalists received advanced training in the sciences. [[Geochemist]] [[J. Laurence Kulp]] had gone to the evangelical school [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] for his undergraduate degree and was a [[Plymouth Brother]]. He obtained a PhD from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] before taking a faculty position at Columbia. He felt it was his duty to warn fellow Christians in the evangelical scientific organization the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA) of the problems with Price's claims. Kulp wrote a review of Price's work, in which he stated that "major propositions of the theory are contradicted by established physical and chemical laws" in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1950/JASA3-50Kulp.html |title=Science in Christian Perspective |publisher=Asa3.org |date=1946-04-01 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused substantial consternation among his fellow members of the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA), an affiliation of Christians who are also scientists, causing many to claim that Kulp had been contaminated with "the orthodox geological viewpoint" and this was responsible for his faith in the Bible being badly shaken.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Kulp, J. Am. Sci.20 (June 1949); J. L. Kulp J. Am. Sci. 2, 1 (No. 1) (1950); J. L. Kulp, J. Am. Sci. 2, 2 (June 1950); Page 304 of "The Creationists" by R.L. Numbers, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kulp's influence, however, continues today within the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], which continues to support [[old earth creationism]].

In the 1950s the [[United States]] slid into a [[Cold War]] with the [[communism|communist]] [[Soviet Union]], its former ally. Communism had as one of its principles [[atheism]]. Americans divided over the issues of [[Communism and atheism]], but with the [[Great Purge]], [[Cultural Revolution]] and [[1956 Hungarian Uprising]], many became concerned about the implications of Communism and atheism. At the same time, the scientific community was making great strides in developing the theory of evolution, which seemed to make belief in God unreasonable under [[Occam's razor]]. The American shock and panic about the 1957 [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] launch led to the passage of the [[National Defense Education Act]] in 1958 to reform American science curricula. This resulted in the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]], also begun in 1958 and with the goal of writing new up-to-date biology textbooks. These new biology textbooks included a discussion of the theory of evolution. Within a few years, half of American schools were using the new BSCS biology textbooks. In addition, the hundredth anniversary of the publication of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was in 1959, and this sparked renewed public interest in [[evolutionary biology]]. The creationist fervor of the past seemed like ancient history. A historian at [[Oklahoma]]'s [[Northeastern State University]], R. Halliburton, even made a prediction in 1964 that "a renaissance of the [creationist] movement is most unlikely."&lt;ref&gt;R. Halliburton, Jr., Arkansas Hist. Q. 23, 283 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, [[Henry M. Morris]] and [[John C. Whitcomb, Jr]] published a book entitled ''The Genesis Flood,'' in an effort to provide a scientific basis for [[young earth creationism]] and [[Flood geology]]. Morris had published several books previously, but none had the impact that ''The Genesis Flood''  did. Its publication resulted in ten like-minded creationists forming the [[Creation Research Society]] in 1963, and the [[Institute for Creation Research]] in 1972.

In 1968, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in [[Epperson vs. Arkansas]] that forbidding the teaching of evolution violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[US constitution]]. This clause lays out the [[Separation of church and state in the United States]] and states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or restricting the free exercise thereof."

In 1970, creationists in California established the [[Institute for Creation Research]], to "meet the need for an organization devoted to research, publication, and teaching in those fields of science particularly relevant to the study of origins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icr.org/abouticr/history.htm |title=Discover ICR |publisher=Icr.org |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, a famous anti-young earth creationist essay by the evolutionary biologist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] was published in the ''[[American Biology Teacher]]'' entitled ''[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dobzhansky | first1 = T.G. | year = 1973 | title = Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.525.3586&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf| journal = American Biology Teacher | volume = 35 | issue = 3| pages = 125–129 | doi = 10.2307/4444260 | citeseerx=10.1.1.525.3586}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that [[evolution]] was not incompatible with a belief in [[God]] nor a belief in the accuracy of scriptures.

In 1975, in [[Daniel v. Waters]], the U.S. Sixth Circuit of Appeals struck down [[Tennessee]]'s "[[equal time]]" bill.

In 1978 the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy developed the [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]], which denies "that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood."

In 1980, [[Walt Brown (creationist)|Walt Brown]] became director of the [[Center for Scientific Creation]].

In 1981, the [[San Diego]] based fundamentalist group the [[Creation Science Research Center]] claimed, in a trial dubbed the "Monkey Trial Replay," that teaching evolution as the sole theory of development violated the rights of children who believed in biblical creation. In his opening statement for the group lawyer Richard Turner argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is not a showdown at high noon between creation and evolution. It is not religion versus science. We are not trying to sneak the Bible into the classroom, or any other religious doctrine. The real issue here is that of religious freedom under the United States Constitution.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Turner went on to explain that the plaintiffs were seeking protection for the belief that "God created man as man, not as a blob." ''The Times'' of 7 March 1981 reported that some were of the opinion that the case was "a signal of things to come, with more and more fundamentalist groups trying to flex their not inconsiderable influence in schools across the country." At the same time [[Frank D. White]], the Governor of [[Arkansas]] signed a Bill requiring that creation science and the theory of evolution be given equal weight in schools. Although fifteen states attempted to introduce such Bills around this time, only that in Arkansas made it into law. Following hearings in [[Little Rock]] the law was overturned by Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] early in 1982, just as a similar (and equally unsuccessful) Bills were approved by legislators in [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]].

[[Carl Baugh]] established the Creation Evidence Museum in [[Glen Rose, Texas]] in 1984. [[Kent Hovind]]'s Young Earth Creationist ministry was founded in 1989.

In 1986, another creationist organization called "Reasons to Believe" was established. Unlike most current creationist organizations, RTB supports [[Old Earth creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reasons.org/about/index.shtml |title=Reasons To Believe: About RTB |publisher=Reasons.org |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the US Supreme Court again ruled, this time in [[Edwards v. Aguillard]], that requiring the teaching of "[[creation science]]" every time evolution was taught illegally advanced a particular religion, although a variety of views on origins could be taught in public schools if shown to have a basis in science. The court gave a clear definition of science, and further ruled that so-called "creation science" was simply creationism wrongly using a contrived dualism to assert that any evidence against evolution would prove Creation. Later that year, drafts of the creation science school textbook ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' were revised to change all references to "creation" to relate to "[[intelligent design]]."&lt;ref name=bfkitz&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day6am2.html#day6am889 Barbara Forrest's testimony] at [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]. Retrieved 2007-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]] published ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' by [[Percival Davis]] and [[Dean H. Kenyon]], editor [[Charles Thaxton]], with the definition that "Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact. Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, wings, etc."&lt;ref name=bfkitz/&gt; The publisher got church groups and Christian radio to campaign for state textbook approval, with a petition in [[Alabama]] urging that "Intelligent Design" be presented as an alternative to evolution, and their attorney arguing that it did not compel belief in the supernatural and was not a creationist text.&lt;ref&gt;Brande, Scott (January–February 1990): [http://ncse.com/ncser/10/1/science-text-adoptions-alabama-part-ii Science Text Adoptions in Alabama Part II] NCSE Resource&lt;/ref&gt; After setbacks it focussed efforts "outside the schools" to prompt grass-roots activity from local school boards, teacher's groups and parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/ncser/10/4/foundation-thought-ethics Thomas, The Foundation for Thought and Ethics], Thomas, John A. (July–August 1990), NCSE Reports, 10(4), pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, law professor [[Phillip E. Johnson]] set out his argument that the [[scientific method|ground rules of science]] as presented at Edwards v. Aguillard unfairly disqualified creationist explanations by excluding the supernatural,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/pjdogma1.htm Evolution as Dogma: The Establishment of Naturalism, Phillip E. Johnson, "A Reply to My Critics"] October 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1991, he brought out a book entitled ''[[Darwin on Trial]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, P.E. (1991) ''[[Darwin on Trial]]'' {{ISBN|0-8308-1758-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenging the principles of [[Humanistic naturalism|naturalism]] and [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] in contemporary [[philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;November 30, 1989, Johnson, Phillip, [http://www.apologetics.org/articles/positionpaper.html "Position paper on Darwinism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612062450/http://www.apologetics.org/articles/positionpaper.html |date=2007-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1992, a symposium at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas]] provided the public debut for a small group that included Phillip Johnson, [[Stephen C. Meyer]], [[William Dembski]], and [[Michael Behe]],&lt;ref name=bfwedge&gt;[[Barbara Forrest]], [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm#I The Wedge at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905230611/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm |date=2014-09-05 }}.

The 1993&amp;nbsp;second edition of the school textbook ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' added a section by Michael Behe making the argument he later called [[irreducible complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/rncse/24/5/design-trial-dover-pennsylvania Design on Trial in Dover, Pennsylvania] by Nicholas J Matzke, NCSE Public Information Project Specialist&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the rise of [[intelligent design]], which maintains that intelligent intervention was necessary for evolution and in other ways seeks to create doubt about the validity and feasibility of [[evolution]], and to change the [[scientific method]] so that supernatural explanations are accepted.

In 1994, the court case [[Peloza v. Capistrano School District]] was decided against a teacher who claimed that his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion was violated by the school district's requirement to teach evolution.

In 1996, the [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for Science and Culture]] (CSC), formerly known as the Center for Renewal of Science and Culture, was founded to promote [[Intelligent design]], and entered public discourse with the publication of ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' by [[Michael Behe]],&lt;ref&gt;Behe, M.J. (1996) ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' {{ISBN|0-684-83493-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing for evidence of [[Irreducible complexity]]. Critics claimed that this was a thinly veiled attempt to promote creationism, particularly in light of Edwards v. Aguillard. The Discovery Institute rejects the term creationism, which it defines narrowly as meaning [[young earth creationism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;program=CSC&amp;id=1329 |title=CSC - Intelligent Design and Creationism Just Aren't the Same |publisher=Discovery.org |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in court intelligent design was found to be creationism.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1999 the [[Michael Polanyi Center]] was founded in the science faculty of [[Baylor University]], a Baptist college, to study intelligent design. A year later was disbanded amidst faculty complaints that the center had been established without consulting them, and would cause the school to be associated with pseudoscience.

In December 2001, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which contained the following statement of policy, called the [[Santorum Amendment]], authored by Johnson:
:"The Conferees recognize that a quality scientific education should prepare students to distinguish the data and testable theories of science from religious or philosophical claims that are made in the name of science. Where topics are taught that may generate controversy (such as biological evolution), the curriculum should help students to understand the full range of scientific views that exist, why such topics may generate controversy, and how scientific discoveries can profoundly affect society."  [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?id=112]

In December 2001, Dembski established the [[International Society for Complexity, Information and Design]].

[[Answers In Creation]] was established in 2003 to provide answers to young earth creation organizations. They claim that the young earth position is unscientific, and through their website they claim to provide proof against young earth creation science. They are anti-young earth, and promote Christianity by endorsing old earth creationism.

In 2004 Ohio adopted education standards sympathetic to intelligent design promoted by the Discovery Institute. In February 2006 the Ohio Board of Education voted to drop the Discovery Institute's "[[Critical Analysis of Evolution]]" intelligent design lesson plan after the 2005 ruling against intelligent design in Kitzmiller v. Dover and revelations that the lesson plan was adopted despite warnings from the Ohio Department of Education, whose experts described it as wrong and misleading.

In May 2005, the [[Kansas]] school board held the [[Kansas evolution hearings]]. The court-style hearings were promoted by the Discovery Institute and attended by its Fellows and other intelligent design advocates but not by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a [[kangaroo court]]. The result of the hearings was the adoption by the Republican-dominated board of new science standards that relied upon the Discovery Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan employing the institute's [[Teach the Controversy]] approach, despite these having been rejected by the State Board Science Hearing Committee. With the 2006 ouster of the majority of the conservative board members, the Kansas State Board of Education approved a new curriculum that removed any reference to Intelligent Design as part of science in February 2007.

In 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania ruled on the case of [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] that intelligent design was religious in nature, a form of creationism, not scientific and thus violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The ruling barred the teaching of intelligent design in public school science classrooms for that district, but the 'Dover trial' as it came to be known, has had far-reaching effects.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time as the Kiztmiller ruling, many state legislators were considering bills promoted by the Discovery Institute supporting the teaching of intelligent design. Most were rejected in the light of the ruling in Dover trial out of what has been called the "Dover-effect."

In September 2012, [[Bill Nye]] ("[[Bill Nye The Science Guy|The Science Guy]]") warned that [[Creationism|creationist views]] threaten [[science education]] and [[innovations]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="APNews-20120924-a"&gt;{{cite news |last=Luvan |first=Dylan |title=Bill Nye Warns: Creation Views Threaten U.S. Science|url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20120924/DA1G1IKG2.html |date=September 24, 2012|publisher=[[AP News]] |accessdate=September 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Youtube-20120823"/&gt;([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHbYJfwFgOU Bill Nye video])

In [[mathematics]], the '''Hutchinson metric''' is a function which [[metric (mathematics)|measures]] "the discrepancy between two [[image]]s for use in [[fractal]] [[image processing]]" and "can also be applied to describe the similarity between [[DNA]] sequences expressed as real or complex [[genomic]] signals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drakopoulos |first=V. |last2=Nikolaou |first2=N. P. |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1355938 |title=Efficient computation of the Hutchinson metric between digitized images |journal=IEEE Transactions on Image Processing |volume=13 |issue=12 |date=December 2004 |doi=10.1109/tip.2004.837550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://isis.pub.ro/iafa2003/files/3-5.pdf Hutchinson Metric in Fractal DNA Analysis -- a Neural Network Approach] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818165407/http://isis.pub.ro/iafa2003/files/3-5.pdf |date=August 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definition==
Consider only nonempty, [[compact space|compact]], and finite [[metric space]]s. For a space &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;P(X) &lt;/math&gt; denote the space of Borel probability measures on &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt;, with 

:&lt;math&gt;\delta : X \rightarrow P(X) &lt;/math&gt; 

the embedding associating to &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; the point measure &lt;math&gt;\delta_x &lt;/math&gt;. The support &lt;math&gt;|\mu| &lt;/math&gt; of a measure  in P(X) is the smallest closed subset of measure 1. 

If 

:&lt;math&gt;f : X_1 \rightarrow X_2 &lt;/math&gt; 

is [[Borel measure|Borel measurable]] then the induced map 

:&lt;math&gt;f_* : P(X_1) \rightarrow P(X_2) &lt;/math&gt; 

associates to &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt;/math&gt; the measure &lt;math&gt; f_*(\mu) &lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;f_*(\mu)(B)= \mu(f^{-1}(B)) &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;B &lt;/math&gt; Borel in &lt;math&gt;X_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Then the '''Hutchinson metric''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;d(\mu_1,\mu_2)=\sup \left \lbrace \int u(x) \, \mu_1(dx) - \int u(x) \, \mu_2(dx) \right \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; is taken over all real-valued functions ''u'' with [[Lipschitz constant]]
&lt;math&gt;\le 1 \,.&lt;/math&gt;  

Then &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt; is an [[isometric embedding]] of &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;P(X) &lt;/math&gt;, and if 

:&lt;math&gt;f : X_1 \rightarrow X_2 &lt;/math&gt; 

is Lipschitz then 

:&lt;math&gt;f_* : P(X_1) \rightarrow P(X_2) &lt;/math&gt; 

is Lipschitz with the same Lipschitz constant.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/117923 "Invariant Measures for Set-Valued Dynamical Systems"] Walter Miller; Ethan Akin ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society'', Vol. 351, No. 3. (March 1999), pp. 1203–1225] &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1986">'''Imitation''' is the doctrine of [[artistic creativity]] according to which the creative process should be based on the close imitation of the [[masterpiece]]s of the preceding [[author]]s. This concept was first formulated by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the first century BCE as ''[[Dionysian imitatio|imitatio]]'', and has since dominated for almost two thousand years the Western [[history of the arts]] and [[classicism]];&lt;ref name="Shroder72p282"&gt;Shroder (1972) p.282 quote: {{quotation|The doctrine of imitation, to which Nodier indirectly refers, had of course dominated classicism from its inception, when Du Bellay recommended it in the ''Defense et illustration de la langue francaise''. The rejection of that doctrine was a basic tenet of romanticism; as Hugo put it in his preface to the 1826 edition of ''Odes et ballades, 'celui qui imite un poete ''romantique'' devient necessairement ''classique'', puisqu'il imite''.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century, [[Romanticism]] reversed it with the creation of the institution of [[romantic originality]].&lt;ref name="Shroder72p282"/&gt; In the 20th century, the [[modernist]] and [[postmodern]] movements in turn discarded the romantic idea of creativity, and heightened the practice of imitation, copying, plagiarism, rewriting, appropriation and so on as the central [[Literary technique|artistic device]].

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''Inevitable discovery''' is a doctrine in the [[United States]] criminal procedure that allows evidence of a [[defendant]]'s guilt that would otherwise be considered inadmissible under the [[exclusionary rule]] to be admitted into evidence in a [[trial]].

The doctrine was adopted first by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Nix v. Williams]]'' in 1984.  It holds that evidence obtained in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights is admissible in court if it can be established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that normal [[police investigation]] would have inevitably led to the discovery of the evidence.  The rationale for the rule is that [[police misconduct]] is sufficiently deterred and the interests of society are better served by putting police in the same position that they would have been in without the rights violation, not a worse position.&lt;ref&gt;Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 443–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{corporal punishment}}

'''Judicial corporal punishment''' ('''JCP''') is the infliction of [[corporal punishment]] as a result of a sentence by a court of law. The punishments include [[caning]], [[bastinado]], [[birching]], [[Flagellation|whipping]], or [[Strapping (punishment)|strapping]]. The practice was once commonplace in many countries, but it is no longer practised in any European country, and it has now been abolished in most Western countries, but remains a legal punishment in some Asian, African and Middle Eastern countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzin|first=Bryan|year=2015|title=The Theatre of Punishment: Case Studies in the Political Function of Corporal and Capital Punishment|url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/14/|journal=Washington University Global Studies Law Review|volume=14|pages=387-397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History by country==

===Jersey===
The last birching sentence in [[Jersey]] was carried out in 1966, and abandoned as a policy in 1969 but lingered on the statute books. Obsolete references to corporal punishment were removed from remaining statutes by the ''Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) (Jersey) Law 2007''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) (Jersey) Law 2007|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce\htm\LawFiles\2007%2FL-34-2007.htm|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guernsey===
The last birching sentence was carried out in 1968. The ''Corporal Punishment (Guernsey) Law, 1957'' was finally repealed by the ''Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2006''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2006|url=http://www.guernseylegalresources.gg/article/97883/Criminal-Justice-Miscellaneous-Provisions-Bailiwick-of-Guernsey-Law-2006|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isle of Man===
It was abolished in the [[Isle of Man]] after the judgment in ''[[Tyrer v. UK]]'' by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title =  Isle of Man to scrap birch at a stroke | newspaper = The Guardian | location =  London | date =  6 March 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial [[birching]] was abolished in 2000 (the last was in January 1976; the last [[caning]] was a 13-year-old boy, who was convicted of robbing another child of 10p, was the last recorded juvenile case in May 1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpun.com/manx.htm|title=CORPORAL PUNISHMENT: BIRCHING IN THE ISLE OF MAN|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In 1854 judicial corporal punishment was abolished in the [[Netherlands]] with the exception of whipping. Whipping itself was abolished in 1870.

In the [[Wetboek van Strafrecht]], article 9, this kind of punishment is not listed as primary or secondary punishment. Mainly because of human rights and/or human dignity, corporal punishment has been abolished and does not exist at this time.

===South Africa===
The [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] decided in 1995 in the case of ''[[S v Williams and Others]]'' that caning of juveniles was unconstitutional. Although the ruling in ''S v Williams'' was limited to the corporal punishment of males under the age of 21, Justice [[Pius Langa|Langa]] mentioned in ''[[dicta]]'' that there was a consensus that corporal punishment of adults was also unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SAFLII |litigants=S v Williams and Others |court=ZACC |year=1995 |num=6 |pinpoint=para. 10 |parallelcite=1995 (3) SA 632, 1995 (7) BCLR 861 |date=9 June 1995 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abolition of Corporal Punishment Act, 1997]] abolished judicial corporal punishment.&lt;ref name="corpun"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corpun.com/jcpza12.htm |title=Section 13: The abolition of JCP |work=Judicial Corporal Punishment in South Africa |publisher=World Corporal Punishment Research |year=2005 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://us-cdn.creamermedia.co.za/assets/articles/attachments/03115_abolofcorppunact33.pdf Abolition of Corporal Punishment Act, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], JCP generally was abolished in 1948;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.corpun.com/ukju4712.htm#8283 | title = Power to order flogging: Abolition approved in Committee | newspaper = The Times | location =  London | date =  12 December 1947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it persisted in prisons as a punishment for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff (ordered by prison's visiting justices) until it was abolished by s 65 (Abolition of corporal punishment in prison) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1967]] (the last ever prison flogging was in 1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/criminal-justice-policy.htm|title=Criminal justice policy|first=The National|last=Archives|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpun.com/counukj.htm|title=JUDICIAL AND PRISON FLOGGING AND WHIPPING IN BRITAIN|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
American colonies judicially punished in a variety of forms, including whipping, [[stocks]], the [[pillory]] and the [[Cucking stool#Ducking-stools|ducking stool]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Arnold Falk, CORPORAL PUNISHMENT – A SOCIAL INTERPRETATION OF ITS THEORY AND PRACTICE IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE UNITED STATES, 22–33 (1941).&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, whipping posts were considered indispensable in American and English towns.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, ''id''., 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1776, Gen. [[George Washington]] strongly advocated and utilized JCP in the [[Continental Army]], with due process protection, obtaining in 1776 authority from the  [[Continental Congress]] to impose 100 lashes, more than the previous limit of 39.&lt;ref&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, Articles of War – 20 September 1776, Section XVIII - Art. 3: “No person shall be sentenced to suffer death, except in the cases expressly mentioned in the foregoing articles; nor shall more than one hundred lashes be inflicted on any offender, at the discretion of a court-martial.”  Articles of War – 30 June 1775, Art. 51 limited JCP to 39 lashes. EUGENE D. GENOVESE, ROLL, JORDAN, ROLL – THE WORLD THE SLAVES MADE 308 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1778 Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, [[Thomas Jefferson]] provided up to 15 lashes for individuals pretending to witchcraft or prophecy, at the jury’s discretion; castration for men guilty of rape, polygamy or sodomy, and a minimum half-inch hole bored in the nose [[cartilage]] of women convicted of those sex crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas |last=Jefferson|authorlink=Thomas Jefferson|title= A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments §14 (castration; cartilage), §15 (maiming), §24 (witchcraft) (1778) |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs10.html|website=press-pubs.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1781, Washington requested legal authority from the Continental Congress to impose up to 500 lashes, as there was still a punishment gap between 100 lashes and the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Geo. Washington to President of Continental Congress, 3 February 1781 available at memory.loc.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; The Founders believed whipping and other forms of corporal punishment effectively promoted pro-social and discouraged anti-social behavior.  Two later presidents, [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], advocated judicial corporal punishment as punishment for [[Domestic violence|wife-beating]].&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Gleissner, "Prison Overcrowding Cure: Judicial Corporal Punishment of Adults," Vol. 49, Issue No. 4, The Criminal Law Bulletin, (c) Thomson-Reuters/Westlaw(2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] judicial flogging was last used in 1952 in [[Delaware]] when a wife beater got 20 lashes. In Delaware, the criminal code permitted floggings to occur until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jnjreid.com/cdb/hannah.html|title=Collecting Delaware Books - Red Hannah - Delaware's Whipping Post|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cecilcounty.wordpress.com/2008/08/01/an-ancient-punishment-the-whipping-post/|title=An Ancient Punishment – The Whipping Post Last Used in Cecil in 1940|date=2 August 2008|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19640303&amp;id=VjwaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YScEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5219,1701473 The Milwaukee Journal - Mar 3, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major objections to judicial corporal punishment in the United States was that it was unpleasant to administer.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Judicial corporal punishment has never been held unconstitutional in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Gleissner, "Prison Overcrowding Cure: Judicial Corporal Punishment of Adults," Vol. 49, Issue No. 4, The Criminal Law Bulletin, (c) Thomson-Reuters/Westlaw(2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the [[Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] specifically mentions amputation of limbs as a possible sentence for offenders, perhaps referencing Thomas Jefferson's proposed legislation punishing rapists.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Gleissner, "Prison Overcrowding Cure: Judicial Corporal Punishment of Adults," Vol. 49, Issue No. 4, The Criminal Law Bulletin, (c) Thomson-Reuters/Westlaw(2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other countries ===
It was removed from the statute book in [[Canada]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/canada.htm ''The Canadian Prison Strap''], World Corporal Punishment Research.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[India]] in the 1950s, in [[New Zealand]] in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010210020748/http://epochnz.virtualave.net/newsletter7_fall_corporal.html "The Fall and Fall of Corporal Punishment"], November 1999 Newsletter, EPOCH New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Australia]] at various times in the 20th century according to State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/rules.htm#australia Australia: Judicial CP], World Corporal Punishment Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judith Lorber''' (born November 28, 1931) is Professor Emerita of Sociology and Women’s Studies at The [[CUNY Graduate Center]] and [[Brooklyn College]] of the [[City University of New York]]. She is a foundational theorist of [[social construction of gender difference]] and has played a vital role in the formation and transformation of gender studies. She has more recently called for a de-gendering of the social world.

Lorber was actively involved in [[Sociologists for Women in Society]] from the early 1970s. She developed and taught some of the first courses in the [[sociology of gender]], [[women's studies]], and [[feminist theory]] at Brooklyn College and the Graduate School, where she was the first Coordinator of the Women's Studies Certificate Program in 1988–1991. She was Chair of the [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] Sex and Gender Section in 1992–93 and was awarded the [[Jessie Bernard Award]] in 1996 “in recognition of scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society.”

== Biography ==

Judith Lorber was born in [[Brooklyn]] New York where she attended public elementary and high school. She graduated from [[Queens College]], CUNY in 1952, and received an M.A. and Ph.D. from [[New York University]] in 1971. She started developing and teaching courses in [[women’s studies]] in 1972, and taught at [[Fordham University]] in the [[Bronx]] and at [[Brooklyn College]] and the [[CUNY Graduate School]] until she retired from teaching in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Center-for-the-Study-of-Women-and-Society/Faculty-and-Staff#Profiles|title=Faculty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in New York/NY. She is the sister of artist Stephen Lorber (born 1943).

== Work ==

=== Gender, mental health and illness ===

The main perspective of Lorber’s work has been [[social construction]]—the idea that in social interaction, people produce their identities and statuses, and at the same time, reproduce the structure and constraints of their social world. This perspective analyzes illnesses as social states in which norms and expectations for behavior while ill emerge from the interaction of patients and health-care workers with each other and with family members, friends, and co-workers. Lorber’s next research project (with Roberta Satow) was interviewing psychiatric residents, social workers, and indigenous paraprofessionals in a ghetto community mental health center on issues of cultural congruity with patients and the stratification of prestige and work assignments.&lt;ref&gt;see co-authored articles out of this project under publications http://www.robertasatow.com/author.html#books&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Lorber’s last work on gender and health care, ''Gender and the Social Construction of Illness'', was published in 1997 as part of the Gender Lens series. A second edition, which she co-authored with Lisa Jean Moore, was published by [[Rowman and Littlefield]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gender and the Social Construction of Illness – Second Edition | publisher=Rowman Altamira |author1=Lorber, Judith  |author2=Moore, Lisa Jean | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-7591-0237-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book shows that because gender is embedded in the economy, the family, politics, and the medical and legal systems, it is a major factor in the behavior of patients and health care professionals. She also co-authored ''Gendered Bodies: Feminist Perspectives'' with Lisa Jean Moore. The first edition was published by Roxbury in 2007, and the second edition by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2011. The overall perspective is that of the transformation of the body through gendered social practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gendered bodies: feminist perspectives | publisher=Roxbury Pub.

=== Women physicians ===

Her work on [[women physicians]], which culminated in ''Women Physicians: Careers, Status, and Power'', published in 1984, as well as a series of papers published from 1981 to 1987, was a logical combination of her feminism and [[medical sociology]]. In it, she showed how the difficulties [[women physicians]] encountered in their career advancement when compared to a matched sample of men physicians were the result of the processes of sponsorship and patronage in the informal organization of the medical profession. She thus expanded the analysis of the informal structure of the medical profession, which had been applied only to men physicians, to women, who were, at that point, entering [[medical school]] in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Book Reviews | journal=Sociology of Health &amp; Illness | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=100 | doi=10.1111/1467-9566.ep11346518| year=1986 | last1=Elston | first1=Mary Ann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the physicians that Lorber met in the course of her work on women physicians, Florence Haseltine, set her on the road to her next research project—on patient's experiences with one of the new procreative technologies -- [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF), doctor-assisted conception. The research she conducted with Lakshmi Bandlamudi and Dorothy Greenfeld found that couples shaped their experiences through their behavior with clinic staff and other caretakers and with each other, creating meaning and some sense of control for themselves. Judith Lorber applied a [[feminist analysis]] to the growing use of IVF in male infertility, where the woman is fertile but the man isn’t. This situation sets the stage for marital bargaining, in which the woman seemingly is in a strong position, but which turns out to the man's advantage because of his dominance in the gender politics of the family. The [[feminist]], [[ethical]], and medical implications of this research were explored in papers published in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;for instance: 1991. "Can Women Physicians Ever Be True Equals in the American Medical Profession?" In Current Research in Occupations and Professions, vol. 6, edited by Judith A. Levy.  Greenwich, CT: JAI Press, https://books.google.com/books/about/Current_Research_on_Occupations_and_Prof.html?id=ZnAS_gAACAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist politics ===

Lorber’s feminism (and love of science fiction thinking) appeared in print as early as 1975 in "Beyond Equality of the Sexes: The Question of the Children," followed by "Dismantling Noah's Ark" in 1986. In 1987, she became the Founding Editor of [[Gender &amp; Society]], the official publication of  [[Sociologists for Women in Society]](SWS). As a hands-on editor, Judith Lorber shaped the papers, the linguistic style, and the emerging themes. The journal was (and still is) extremely successful and is the main source of SWS’s current finances. She and Susan Farrell edited the first Gender &amp; Society reader, ''The Social Construction of Gender'', published in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16138663.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpWxAAAAIAAJ|title=The Social construction of gender|first=Judith|last=Lorber|date=1 December 1990|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0-8039-3956-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, Lorber made a significant contribution to [[gender studies]] by writing her own book that has since then become a bible and mandatory reading in women’s studies classes.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2782284|title=Review of Paradoxes of Gender|first=Rosanna|last=Hertz|date=1 January 1995|publisher=|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=100|issue=5|pages=1336–1338|doi=10.1086/230645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/9405277778/gender-question|title=The Gender Question|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paradoxes of Gender'', published by [[Yale]] in 1994, contends that sex, sexuality, and gender are all socially constructed but that gender is the overarching category—a major [[social status]] that organizes almost all areas of social life. Therefore, bodies and sexuality are gendered—biology, physiology, and sexuality do not add up to gender, which is a [[social institution]] that establishes patterns of expectations for individuals, orders the social processes of everyday life, is built into the major social organizations of society, and is also an entity in and of itself. Lorber's theoretical approach to gender is masterful and unusual by  mainstream empirical social science standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3175205|title=Review of Feminist Theory Today: An Introduction to Second-Wave Feminism, ; Modern Feminist Thought: From the Second Wave to "Post-Feminism.", ; Paradoxes of Gender|first=Christine|last=Di Stefano|date=1 January 1998|publisher=|journal=Signs|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1068–1072|doi=10.1086/495303}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paradoxes'' has been translated into Italian and German and has influenced a generation of graduate students in the United States and other countries.

''Gender Inequalities: Feminist Theories and Politics'' was first published in 1998 by Roxbury and is now in its fifth edition, published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2012. It sums up the last 35 years of feminist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socqrl.niu.edu/myers/feminisms.html | title=Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics. | year=1998 | accessdate=November 26, 2012 | author=Lorber, Judith | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401165143/http://www.socqrl.niu.edu/myers/feminisms.html | archivedate=April 1, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revisioning Gender'', which she co-edited with Beth Hess and [[Myra Marx Ferree]], was published by [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] in 1999.

She co-edited the ''Handbook of Gender and Women’s Studies'', published by Sage UK in 2006 with [[Mary Evans]] and [[Kathy Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies | publisher=SAGE |author1=Lorber, Judith |author2=Davis, Kathy |author3=Evans, Mary | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7619-4390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Toward a World Beyond Gender" ===

Lorber’s current work is to go “beyond.” In "Beyond the Binaries: Depolarizing the Categories of Sex, Sexuality, and Gender," published in Sociological Inquiry in 1996, she argued that sociological data would be more accurate if it used more than the two polarized categories of sex, sexuality, and gender. In “Crossing Borders and Erasing Boundaries: Paradoxes of Identity Politics,” published in Sociological Focus in 1999, she pulled apart racial and transgender categories. In fact, Judith Lorber has gone so far as to argue that we should imagine a social world that is not organized by gender. She explored this idea in “Using Gender to Undo Gender: A Feminist Degendering Movement, ” published in Feminist Theory in 2000. ''Breaking the Bowls: Degendering and Social Change'' puts together all the “beyond” ideas and asks us to imagine a world without gender. It was published in 2005 by [[W.W. Norton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csx.sagepub.com/content/35/3/246.full.pdf%20html|title=Breaking the Bowls: Degendering and Feminist Change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book Review: Breaking the Bowls: Degendering and Feminist Change|first=Bandana|last=Purkayastha|date=1 April 2006|publisher=|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=20|issue=2|pages=286–288|doi=10.1177/0891243205285013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 [[American Sociological Association]] Annual Meetings, held in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], the theme was “utopias.” Judith Lorber gave an invited presentation at the opening plenary: “Gender Equality: Utopian and Realistic.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=http://videoarchive.asanet.org/presentations/2012ondemand_opening_plenary_session_equality.html?plist=2012 | title=Video of Lorber's opening lecture at ASA plenary 2012 Denver | publisher=American Sociological Association | people=Crenshaw, Kimberlé  Lorber, Judith  van Parijs, Philippe | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222001648/http://videoarchive.asanet.org/presentations/2012ondemand_opening_plenary_session_equality.html?plist=2012 | archivedate=2013-02-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also presented an invited paper, “Toward a World Beyond Gender: A Utopian Vision,” with [[Barbara J. Risman]] and Jessica Holden Sherwood. Recently, she has written and given presentations about the heroine of the popular [[Stieg Larsson]] trilogy -- “The Gender Ambiguity of [[Lisbeth Salander]]: Third-wave Feminist Hero?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Men Who Hate Women and Women Who Kick Their Asses: Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy in Feminist Perspective | publisher=Vanderbilt University Press | author=King, Donna | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-8265-1849-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Believing Is Seeing: Biology as Ideology" ===

Judith Lorber is published in Chapter 3 of "The Gendered Society Reader," an anthology edited by Michael S. Kimmel; Amy Aronson; and Amy Kaler, with a text titled “Believing Is Seeing: Biology as Ideology.”

In the text, Lorber discusses the social constructs built into our society differentiating the genders. Lorber argues that “bodies differ in many ways physiologically; but they are completely transformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are ‘female’ and ‘male and ‘women’ and ‘men’".&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith (2011). Ch.3 "Seeing Is Believing: Biology as Ideology," pp. 11-18 in ''The Gendered Society Reader'', Ed. Michael S. Kimmel, Amy Aronson, Amy Kaler. Ontario: Oxford University Press, 2011; p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Lorber points out that though the physiological differences of the sexes are there, each individual body does not always fit into its own category and “neither sex nor gender are pure categories”.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber exemplifies this by separating the genders and discussing differences within the separate ‘female’ and ‘male’ categories; she argues some women do not have ovaries and uteri, menopause differentiates menstruating women for those who do not, some men lactate, and some men cannot produce sperm. As she discusses the blurred lines surrounding individual bodies within their gender categories, she continues to exemplify the pre-determined social classifications surrounding gender in our society by using competitive sports.

In Lorber’s section of this Chapter 3 headed ‘What Sports Illustrate,’ she argues that the pre-determined societal beliefs surrounding gender have turned competitive sports into a way for men to legitimize aggression and create their masculine identity. Conversely, Lorber believes that the female sex in competitive sports is made a mockery of and continually takes a “secondary status” to competitive male sports.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber uses the example of basketball to confirm her belief. She correlates the female secondary status to assumptions surrounding women’s physiology. As well Lorber believes this assumption of physiology influences rules in women's sports, rules in sporting competitions, and how women are treated in sporting competitions.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

However, Lorber connects these social barriers that continually separate the sexes in sports, with the economical barriers oppressing the female sex. She compares competitive sports to big businesses and therefore argues that they are no longer just a social construct but an economic, political, and ideological issue developed by those who define and profit from competitive sports.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Lorber (2011), pp. 11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorber continues to describe social boundaries set up by gender using technology; she brings up two examples—computers and cars. When computers first came into use, office jobs involving them were given to women, as it appeared to be a clerical duty. It was not until computers were revealed to be complex and intellectually demanding that they became the domain of men. “By the 1960s programing was split into more and less skilled specialties, and the entry of women into the computer field in the 1970s and 1980s was confined to the lower paid specialties…employers invoked women and men’s purportedly natural capabilities for the jobs for which they were hired”.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; This means women will do the more menial tasks, where men will shape the industry and control it. Lorber also describes how this has influenced young people; for example we see far more young men and boys playing computer games and getting involved in computer clubs. In this way we are furthering women’s supposed natural disadvantage with computers by allowing boys to get more education and comfort with computers than girls.

This pattern of male control over technology continues when it comes to cars. Lorber references the fact that in couples a man will almost always be the more frequent driver, regardless of aptitude. This may seem like an inconsequential example, but Lorber asks us to consider in different contexts what a vehicle can mean. She describes the importance of the mobility, literally and figuratively, given to women by driving. Feminists used driving “to campaign for women’s suffrage in parts of the United States not served by public transportation and they effectively used motorcades and speaking from cars as campaign tactics”.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; Lorber also describes the sense of liberation felt by many women when they first experienced driving, while participating in First World War efforts. This gendering of who a driver can be does limit women’s options in the world more than we consider when we simply see the male in a couple taking the wheel.

Lorber finalizes her arguments discussing the paradoxes of human nature. She confirms, “gendered people do not emerge from physiology or hormones, but from the exigencies of the social order”.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber points out that the diversity of humans could be categorized, regrouped and broken up into different ways of comparison than the traditional sex differentiation that disregards the real issues of who is truly like whom.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; She argues that the problem of basing knowledge on presumptions of gender differences reaffirms the categorization of the ‘male’ versus ‘female’. When relying on the conventional categorization of gender, one is able to find what they are looking for.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber states, “we see what we believe, whether it is that ‘female’ and ‘males’ are essentially different or that ‘women’ and ‘men’ are essentially the same.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

== Selected honors and awards ==

[[File:Sille Agia Eleni Inscription.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|An inscription in Karamanli Turkish on the entrance of the former Greek Orthodox church of Agia Eleni in [[Sille (village)|Sille]], near [[Konya]].]]

'''Karamanlı Turkish''' is both a form of written Turkish, and a dialect of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] spoken by the [[Karamanlides]], a community of Turkish-speaking [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkey. While the official Ottoman Turkish was written in the [[Arabic script]], the Karamanlides used the [[Greek alphabet]] for writing its form of Turkish. Such texts are called '''Karamanlidika''' (Καραμανλήδικα / Καραμανλήδεια γραφή) or '''Karamanli Turkish''' today. Karamanli Turkish had its own literary tradition and produced numerous published works in print in the 19th century, some of them published by Evangelinos Misailidis, by the Anatoli or Misailidis publishing house (Misailidis 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;134).

Karamanli writers and speakers were expelled from Turkey as part of the [[Greek-Turkish population exchange]] of 1923. Some speakers preserved their language in the diaspora. The writing form stopped being used immediately after the Turkish state adopted the Latin alphabet.

A fragment of a Manuscript written in Karamanli was also found in the [[Cairo Geniza]].&lt;ref&gt;Julia Krivoruchko Karamanli – a new language variety in the Genizah: T-S AS 215.255 http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Taylor-Schechter/fotm/july-2012/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kingdom of Ends''' ({{lang-de|Reich der Zwecke}}) is a [[thought experiment]] centered on the moral philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kant introduced the concept in his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'' (4:439).  The thought experiment proposes a world in which all human beings are treated as ends (meaning treated as if they and their well-being are the goal), not as mere [[means to an end]] for other people.

== Overview ==

The Kingdom of Ends is a hypothetical state of existence that is derived from Kant's [[categorical imperative]]. A Kingdom of Ends is composed entirely of rational beings, whom Kant defines as those capable of moral deliberation (though his definition expands in other areas) who must choose to act by laws that imply an absolute necessity. It is from this point of view that they must judge themselves and their actions.

Though the term is usually translated as "Kingdom of Ends", the German word "[[Reich]]" is perhaps more appropriately translated as "[[realm]]". Kant uses it to mean the "systematic union of different rational beings under common laws". These common laws, established by the [[categorical imperative]], are the gauge used to evaluate the worthiness of an individual's actions. When all the kingdom's individuals live by the categorical imperative—particularly Kant's second formulation of it—each one will treat all of his fellowmen as ends in themselves, instead of means to achieving one's own selfish goals. This systematic whole is the Kingdom of Ends.

People can only belong to the Kingdom of Ends when they become subject to these universal laws. Such rational beings must regard themselves simultaneously as sovereign when making laws, and as subject when obeying them. Morality, therefore, is acting out of reverence for all universal laws which make the Kingdom of Ends possible.  In a true Kingdom of Ends, acting virtuously will be rewarded with happiness.

In his writings on religion, Kant interprets the Kingdom of God as a religious symbol for the moral reality of the Kingdom of Ends. As such, it is the ultimate goal of both religious and political organization of human society.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/KGH.html "'The Kingdom of God is at Hand!' (Did Kant really say that?)"], ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' 11:4 (October 1994), pp.421-437.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lingchi''''' ({{zh|t=凌遲}}), translated variously as the '''slow process''', the '''lingering death''', or '''slow slicing''', and also known as '''death by a thousand cuts''', was a form of torture and [[execution]] used in [[China]] from roughly 900 CE until it was banned in 1905. It was also used in [[Vietnam]]. In this form of execution, a knife was used to methodically remove portions of the body over an extended period of time, eventually resulting in death.

''Lingchi'' was reserved for crimes viewed as especially severe, such as treason. Some Westerners were executed in this manner. Even after the practice was outlawed, the concept itself has still appeared across many types of media.

== Etymology ==
The term ''lingchi'' first appeared in a line in Chapter 28 of the classical philosophical text ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]''. The line originally described the difficulty in travelling in a horse-drawn carriage on mountainous terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xun|first1=Kuang|authorlink1=Xun Kuang|title=Xunzi|date=3rd century BCE|location=China|chapter=28|quote=三尺之岸而虛車不能登也，百仞之山任負車登焉，何則？陵遲故也。|url=http://ctext.org/xunzi/you-zuo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, it was used to describe the prolonging of a person's agony when the person is being killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shen|first1=Jiaben|title=历代刑法考 [Research on Judicial Punishments over the Dynasties]|date=2006|publisher=[[Zhonghua Book Company]]|location=China|isbn=9787101014631|url=https://book.douban.com/subject/1944166/|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The process involved tying the condemned prisoner to a wooden frame, usually in a public place. The flesh was then cut from the body in multiple slices in a process that was not specified in detail in Chinese law, and therefore most likely varied. The punishment worked on three levels: as a form of public humiliation, as a slow and lingering death, and as a punishment after death.

According to the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] principle of [[filial piety]], to alter one's body or to cut the body are considered unfilial practices. ''Lingchi'' therefore contravenes the demands of filial piety. In addition, to be cut to pieces meant that the body of the victim would not be "whole" in spiritual life after death. This method of execution became a fixture in the image of China among some Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Morrison|first=JM|title=Twentieth Century: The History of the World, 1901 to 2000|year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lingchi'' could be used for the torture and execution of a living person, or applied as an act of humiliation after death. It was meted out for major offences such as [[high treason]], [[mass murder]], [[patricide]]/[[matricide]] or the murder of one's master or employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:清李毓昌命案 于保业|trans-title=The Qing Dynasty Case of Li Yuchang|url=http://www.jimo.gov.cn/jmwenhuaju/inc/list.asp?id=16991&amp;webid=171|language=Chinese|date=2006|location=[[Jimo]]|publisher=Jimo Cultural Network|accessdate=25 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805150939/http://www.jimo.gov.cn/jmwenhuaju/inc/list.asp?id=16991&amp;webid=171|archivedate=5 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperors used it to threaten people and sometimes ordered it for minor offences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hongwu Emperor]].

While it is difficult to obtain accurate details of how the executions took place, they generally consisted of cuts to the arms, legs, and chest leading to amputation of limbs, followed by decapitation or a stab to the heart. If the crime was less serious or the executioner merciful, the first cut would be to the throat causing death; subsequent cuts served solely to dismember the corpse.

Art historian [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]] argues that extant photos of the execution clearly show that the "death by division" (as it was termed by German criminologist {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Heindl|de}}) involved some degree of [[dismemberment]] while the subject was living.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James, ''The Object Stares Back: On the Nature of Seeing'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Elkins also argues that, contrary to the apocryphal version of "death by a thousand cuts", the actual process could not have lasted long. The condemned individual is not likely to have remained conscious and aware (if even alive) after one or two severe wounds, so the entire process could not have included more than a "few dozen" wounds.

In the [[Yuan dynasty]], 100 cuts were inflicted&lt;ref&gt;[[Guan Hanqing|Guan, Hanqing]]. ''[[The Injustice to Dou E]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but by the [[Ming dynasty]] there were records of 3,000 incisions.&lt;ref&gt;Deng, Zhicheng (鄧之誠). ''Gu Dong Xu Ji'' (骨董續記), vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Yu Qiao Hua Zheng Ben Mo'' (漁樵話鄭本末)&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as a fast process lasting no longer than 15 to 20 minutes.&lt;ref name=Bourgon2004ID248CF2Fa2&gt;{{cite web|editor-last=Bourgon|editor-first=Jérôme |last1=Bourgon|first1=Jérôme|last2=Detrie|first2=Muriel|last3=Poulet|first3=Regis|title=Execution in Canton|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Textual.php?ID=248&amp;CF=2&amp;Fa=2|date=2004|website=Chinese Torture - Supplices Chinois|publisher=IAO: Institut d'Asie Orientale|language=English, French|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available photographic records&lt;ref name=Bourgon2004ID1&gt;{{cite web|editor-last=Bourgon|editor-first=Jérôme|title=Execution of Fu-zhu-li|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Event.php?ID=1|date=2004|website=Chinese Torture - Supplices Chinois|publisher=IAO: Institut d'Asie Orientale|language=English, French|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bourgon2004ID8/&gt; seem to prove the speed of the event as the crowd remains consistent across the series of photographs.

==Western perceptions==
The Western perception of ''lingchi'' has often differed considerably from the actual practice, and some misconceptions persist to the present. The distinction between the sensationalised Western myth and the Chinese reality was noted by Westerners as early as 1895. That year, Australian traveller [[George Ernest Morrison]], who claimed to have witnessed an execution by slicing, wrote that "''lingchi'' [was] commonly, and quite wrongly, translated as 'death by slicing into 10,000 pieces' — a truly awful description of a punishment whose cruelty has been extraordinarily misrepresented... The mutilation is ghastly and excites our horror as an example of barbarian cruelty; but it is not cruel, and need not excite our horror, since the mutilation is done, not before death, but after."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor1-first=Jerome|editor1-last=Bourgon|editor2-first=Muriel|editor2-last=Detrie|editor3-first=Regis|editor3-last=Poulet|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Textual.php?ID=167&amp;CF=2&amp;Fa=2|last=Morrison|first=George Ernest|publisher=CNRS|location=Lyon, FR|title=Turandot|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to apocryphal lore, ''lingchi'' began when the torturer, wielding an extremely sharp knife, began by putting out the eyes, rendering the condemned incapable of seeing the remainder of the torture and, presumably, adding considerably to the psychological terror of the procedure. Successive rather minor cuts chopped off ears, nose, tongue, fingers, toes and genitals before proceeding to cuts that removed large portions of flesh from more sizable parts, e.g., thighs and shoulders.

The entire process was said to last three days, and to total 3,600 cuts. The heavily carved bodies of the deceased were then put on a parade for a show in the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|title=Death by a Thousand Cuts at Chinese Arts Centre 18th January to 23rd March|publisher=Manchester events guide|accessdate=2009-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418031632/http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|archive-date=18 April 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some victims were reportedly given doses of [[opium]] to alleviate suffering.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[John Roberts (historian)|John Morris Roberts]], in ''Twentieth Century: The History of the World, 1901 to 2000'' (2000), writes "the traditional punishment of death by slicing... became part of the western image of Chinese backwardness as the 'death of a thousand cuts.'" Roberts then notes that slicing "was ordered, in fact, for [[Kang Youwei|K'ang Yu-Wei]], a man termed the '[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] of China', and a major advocate of intellectual and government reform in the 1890s."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.&amp;nbsp;60, footnote 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although officially outlawed by the government of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=181371|title=Abolishing 'Cruel Punishments': A Reappraisal of the Chinese Roots and Long-term Efficiency of the Xinzheng Legal Reforms|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=37|issue=4|pages=851–862|date=8 October 2003|accessdate=30 July 2009|doi=10.1017/S0026749X03004050|last1=Bourgon|first1=Jérôme}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''lingchi'' became a widespread Western symbol of the Chinese penal system from the 1910s on, and in [[Zhao Erfeng]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.phayl.com/news/article.aspx?id=24749|title=From Darkness to Dawn|first=Jamyang|last=Norbu|author-link=Jamyang Norbu|publisher=Phayl}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three sets of photographs shot by French soldiers in 1904–05 were the basis for later mythification. The abolition was immediately enforced, and definite: no official sentences of ''lingchi'' were performed in China after April 1905.

Regarding the use of opium, as related in the introduction to Morrison's book, [[Meyrick Hewlett]] insisted that "most Chinese people sentenced to death were given large quantities of opium before execution, and Morrison avers that a charitable person would be permitted to push opium into the mouth of someone dying in agony, thus hastening the moment of decease." At the very least, such tales were deemed credible to British officials in China and other Western observers.

==History==
[[File:Martyrdom of Joseph Marchand.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|Execution of [[Joseph Marchand]] in Vietnam, 1835.]]

''Lingchi'' existed under the earliest emperors,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} although similar but less cruel tortures were often prescribed instead. Under the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], the second emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], multiple tortures were used to punish officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sima|first1=Qian|authorlink1=Sima Qian|title=Records of the Grand Historian|date=91 BCE|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=87|title-link=Records of the Grand Historian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ban|first1=Gu|authorlink1=Ban Gu|title=Book of Han|date=82 CE|language=Chinese|chapter=23|title-link=Book of Han}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2015|reason=can't determine if this amounted to lesser torture or worse}} The arbitrary, cruel, and short-lived [[Liu Ziye]] was apt to kill innocent officials by ''lingchi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shen|first1=Yue|authorlink1=Shen Yue|title=Book of Song|date=488 CE|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=9|title-link=Book of Song}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi|Gao Yang]] killed only six people by this method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Baiyao|authorlink1=Li Baiyao|title=Book of Northern Qi|date=636 CE|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=3|title-link=Book of Northern Qi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[An Lushan]] killed only one man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ouyang|first1=Xiu|authorlink1=Ouyang Xiu|title=New Book of Tang|date=1060 CE|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=215|title-link=New Book of Tang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=中國歷史上幾次最著名的凌遲之刑|trans-title=Several of the Most Famous Lingchi Cases in Chinese History|url=http://books.sina.com/artbook/exposure/2008-07-03/ba14878.shtml|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801021147/http://books.sina.com/artbook/exposure/2008-07-03/ba14878.shtml|archive-date=1 August 2009 |website=[[Sina Corp|Sina]]|language=Chinese|access-date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lingchi'' was known in the [[Five Dynasties]] period (907–960 CE); but, in one of the earliest such acts, [[Shi Jingtang]] abolished it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xue|first1=Juzheng|authorlink1=Xue Juzheng|title=Old History of the Five Dynasties|date=974 CE|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=147|title-link=Old History of the Five Dynasties}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other rulers continued to use it.

The method was prescribed in the [[Liao dynasty]] law codes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Toqto'a|authorlink1=Toqto'a (Yuan dynasty)|title=History of Liao|date=1344|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=61|title-link=History of Liao}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Toqto'a|authorlink1=Toqto'a (Yuan dynasty)|title=History of Liao|date=1344|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=112-114|title-link=History of Liao}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperor Tianzuo of Liao|Emperor Tianzuo]] often executed people in this way during his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Toqto'a|authorlink1=Toqto'a (Yuan dynasty)|title=History of Liao|date=1344|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=62|title-link=History of Liao}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became more widely used in the [[Song dynasty]] under [[Emperor Renzong of Song|Emperor Renzong]] and [[Emperor Shenzong of Song|Emperor Shenzong]].

Another early proposal for abolishing ''lingchi'' was submitted by [[Lu You]] (1125–1210) in a memorandum to the imperial court of the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song dynasty]]. Lu You's elaborate argument against ''lingchi'' was piously copied and transmitted by generations of scholars, among them influential jurists of all dynasties, until the late Qing dynasty reformist [[Shen Jiaben]] (1840–1913) included it in his 1905 memorandum that obtained the abolition. This anti-''lingchi'' trend coincided with a more general attitude opposed to "cruel and unusual" punishments (such as the exposure of the head) that the Tang dynasty had not included in the canonic table of the [[Five Punishments]], which defined the legal ways of punishing crime. Hence the abolitionist trend is deeply ingrained in the Chinese legal tradition, rather than being purely derived from Western influences.

Under later emperors, ''lingchi'' was reserved for only the most heinous acts, such as treason,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zhang, Tingyu|authorlink1=Zhang Tingyu|title=History of Ming|date=1739|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=54|title-link=History of Ming}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacehall.com/cgi-bin/news/gb_display/print_version.cgi?art=/gb/pubvp/2006/03&amp;link=200603030452.shtml 清华大学教授刘书林——中国第一汉奸曾国藩]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813154736/http://www.peacehall.com/cgi-bin/news/gb_display/print_version.cgi?art=%2Fgb%2Fpubvp%2F2006%2F03&amp;link=200603030452.shtml |date=13 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a charge often dubious or false, as exemplified by the deaths of [[Liu Jin]], a [[Ming dynasty]] eunuch, and [[Yuan Chonghuan]], a Ming dynasty general. In 1542, ''lingchi'' was inflicted on a group of palace women who had [[Renyin palace rebellion|attempted to assassinate]] the [[Jiajing Emperor]], along with his favourite concubine, [[Consort Duan (Cao)|Consort Duan]]. The bodies of the women were then displayed in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1=History Office | title=明實錄：明世宗實錄| language=Chinese | trans-title=Veritable Records of the Ming: Veritable Records of Shizong of Ming | url=http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&amp;res=309093 | publisher=Ctext | date=1620s | volume=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports from Qing dynasty jurists such as Shen Jiaben show that executioners' customs varied, as the regular way to perform this penalty was not specified in detail in the penal code.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

''Lingchi'' was also known in Vietnam, notably being used as the method of execution of the French missionary [[Joseph Marchand]], in 1835, as part of the repression following the unsuccessful [[Lê Văn Khôi revolt]].

An 1858 account by ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' claimed the martyr [[Auguste Chapdelaine]] was killed by ''lingchi''; in reality he was beaten to death.

As Western countries moved to abolish similar punishments, some Westerners began to focus attention on the methods of execution used in China. As early as 1866, the time when Britain itself moved to abolish its own cruel method of [[hanging, drawing, and quartering]], [[Thomas Francis Wade]], then serving with the British diplomatic mission in China, unsuccessfully urged the abolition of ''lingchi''.

''Lingchi'' remained in the [[Qing dynasty]]'s code of laws for persons convicted of high treason and other serious crimes, but the punishment was abolished as a result of the 1905 revision of the Chinese penal code by Shen Jiaben.&lt;ref&gt;Shen, Jiaben.

==Published accounts==
* [[Sir Henry Norman, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Norman]], ''The People and Politics of the Far East'' (1895). Norman was a widely travelled writer and photographer whose collection is now owned by the [[University of Cambridge]]. Norman gives an eyewitness account of various physical punishments and tortures inflicted in a magistrate's court (''[[yamen]]'') and of the execution by beheading of 15 men. He gives the following graphic account of a ''lingchi'' execution but does not claim to have witnessed such an execution himself. "[The executioner] grasping handfuls from the fleshy parts of the body such as the thighs and breasts slices them away... the limbs are cut off piecemeal at the wrists and ankles, the elbows and knees, shoulders and hips. Finally the condemned is stabbed to the heart and the head is cut off."&lt;ref&gt;[http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Textual.php?ID=3&amp;CF=2&amp;Fa=5 Turandot: Chinese Torture/Supplice chinois]. CNRS. Retrieved 20 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Ernest Morrison]], ''An Australian in China'' (1895) differs from some other reports in stating that most ''lingchi'' mutilations are in fact made [[post-mortem]]. Morrison wrote his description based on an account related by a claimed eyewitness: "The prisoner is tied to a rude cross: he is invariably deeply under the influence of [[opium]]. The executioner, standing before him, with a sharp sword makes two quick incisions above the eyebrows, and draws down the portion of skin over each eye, then he makes two more quick incisions across the breast, and in the next moment he pierces the heart, and death is instantaneous. Then he cuts the body in pieces; and the degradation consists in the fragmentary shape in which the prisoner has to appear in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pratyeka.org/books/australian-in-china/|title=An Australian in China|publisher=Pratyeka|date=25 August 2002|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tienstin ([[Tianjin]]), ''The China Year Book'' (1927), p.&amp;nbsp;1401, contains contemporary reports from fighting in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton) between the [[Nationalist government|Nanjing government]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] forces. Stories of various atrocities are related, including accounts of ''lingchi''. There is no mention of opium, and these cases appear to be government propaganda.
* ''[[The Times]]'', (9 December 1927), a journalist reported from the city of Guangzhou (Canton) that the Communists were targeting Christian priests and that "It was announced that Father Wong was to be publicly executed by the slicing process."
* [[George Roerich]], "Trails to Inmost Asia" (1931), p . 119, relates the story of the assassination of Yang Tseng-hsin, Governor of [[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]] in July 1928, by the bodyguard of his foreign minister Fan Yao-han. Fan was seized, and he and his daughter were both executed by ''lingchi'', the minister made to watch his daughter's execution first. Roerich was not an eyewitness to this event, having already returned to India by the date of the execution.
* [[George Ryley Scott]], ''History of Torture'' (1940) claims that many were executed this way by the Chinese Communist insurgents; he cites claims made by the Nanking government in 1927. It is perhaps uncertain whether these claims were anti-communist propaganda. Scott also uses the term "the slicing process" and differentiates between the different types of execution in different parts of the country. There is no mention of opium. Riley's book contains a picture of a sliced corpse (with no mark to the heart) that was killed in Guangzhou (Canton) in 1927. It gives no indication of whether the slicing was done post-mortem. Scott claims it was common for the relatives of the condemned to bribe the executioner to kill the condemned before the slicing procedure began.

===Photographs===
The first Western photographs of ''lingchi'' were taken in 1890 by William Arthur Curtis of Kentucky in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jerome|last1=Bourgon|first2=Muriel|last2=Detrie|first3=Regis|last3=Poulet|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Essay.php?ID=3|title=Turandot: Chinese Torture/Supplice chinois|publisher=CNRS|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French soldiers stationed in [[Beijing]] had the opportunity to photograph three different ''lingchi'' executions in 1905:
* Wang Weiqin (王維勤), a former official who killed two families, executed on 31 October 1904.&lt;ref name=Bourgon2004ID8&gt;{{cite web|editor-last=Bourgon|editor-first=Jérôme|title=Exécution de Wang Weiqin|trans-title=Execution of Wan Weiqin|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Event.php?ID=8|date=2004|website=Chinese Torture - Supplices Chinois|publisher=IAO: Institut d'Asie Orientale|language=English, French|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Essay|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Essay.php?ID=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unknown, reason unknown, possibly a young deranged boy who killed his mother, and was executed in January 1905. Photographs were published in various volumes of Georges Dumas' ''Nouveau traité de psychologie'', 8 vols., Paris, 1930–43&lt;!-- (but not in Dumas' 1923 Traité de psychologie!) --&gt;, and again nominally by Bataille (in fact by Lo Duca), who mistakenly appended abstracts of Fou-tchou-li's executions as related by Carpeaux (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The complete set|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Event.php?ID=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even related to the correct set of photos, Carpeaux's narrative is highly dubious; for instance, an examination of the Chinese judicial archives show that Carpeaux bluntly invented the execution decree. The proclamation is reported to state: "The Mongolian princes demand that the aforesaid Fou-Tchou-Le, guilty of the murder of Prince Ao-Han-Ouan, be burned alive, but the Emperor finds this torture too cruel and condemns Fou-Tchou-Li to slow death by ''leng-tch-e'' (different spelling of ''lingchi'', cutting into pieces)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.com.au/parallel/x1/journal/lmw/coup.html|title=Journal: coup de grâce (#1)|first=Linda Marie|last=Walker|publisher=VA|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=August 2017}}
Accounts of ''lingchi'' or the extant photographs have inspired or referenced in numerous artistic, literary, and cinematic media. Some works have attempted to put the process in a historical context; others, possibly due to the scarcity of detailed historical information, have attempted to extrapolate the details or present innovations of method that may be products of an author's creative license. Some of these descriptions may have influenced modern public perceptions of the historic practice.

===Non-fiction===
[[Susan Sontag]] mentions the 1905 case in ''Regarding the Pain of Others'' (2003). One reviewer wrote that though Sontag includes no photographs in her book – a volume about photography – "she does tantalisingly describe a photograph that obsessed the philosopher [[Georges Bataille]], in which a Chinese criminal, while being chopped up and slowly [[flaying|flayed]] by executioners, rolls his eyes heavenwards in [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] bliss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/politicsphilosophyandsociety/0%2C6121%2C1011239%2C00.html|title=Observer review: Regarding the Pain of Others by Susan Sontag|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2003|accessdate=30 July 2009|location=London|first=Peter|last=Conrad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Georges Bataille]] wrote about ''lingchi'' in ''L'expérience intérieure'' (1943) and in ''Le coupable'' (1944). He included five pictures in his ''The Tears of Eros'' (1961; translated into English and published by [[City Lights Bookstore|City Lights]] in 1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.jcrt.org/archives/04.3/york.pdf|first=David|last=York|title=Flesh And Consciousness: George Bataille and the Dionysian|journal=JCRT|date=August 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians [[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]], Jérome Bourgon and Gregory Blue, criticised Bataille for his language, mistakes and dubious content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jerome|last1=Bourgon|first2=Muriel|last2=Detrie|first3=Regis|last3=Poulet|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Essay.php?ID=27|title=Turandot: Chinese Torture/Supplice chinois|publisher=CNRS|accessdate=30 July 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter=6.

===Literature===
The "death by a thousand cuts" with reference to China is also mentioned in [[Malcolm Bosse]]'s novel ''The Examination'', [[Amy Tan]]'s novel ''[[The Joy Luck Club (novel)|The Joy Luck Club]]'', and [[Robert van Gulik]]'s ''[[Judge Dee]]'' novels. The 1905 photos are mentioned in [[Thomas Harris]]' novel ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://hannibal.hannotations.com/hannibal1.html|title=Hannibal|chapter=Section I|publisher=Hannotations|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Julio Cortázar]]'s novel ''[[Hopscotch (Cortázar novel)|Hopscotch]]''.

===Film===
Inspired by the 1905 photos, Chinese artist Chen Chien-jen created a 25-minute film called ''Lingchi'', which has generated some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icwirral.icnetwork.co.uk/entertainment/newsandreviews/tm_objectid=15700731&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50061&amp;headline=could-you-look-away-from-the-death-of-a-thousand-cuts--name_page.html |title=WirralNews |publisher=IC network |accessdate=30 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317122730/http://icwirral.icnetwork.co.uk/entertainment/newsandreviews/tm_objectid%3D15700731%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50061%26headline%3Dcould-you-look-away-from-the-death-of-a-thousand-cuts--name_page.html |archive-date=17 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scene of Lingchi also appeared on the film [[The Sand Pebbles (film)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7143">A '''mathematical object''' is an [[abstract object]] arising in [[mathematics]]. The concept is studied in [[philosophy of mathematics]].

In mathematical practice, an ''object'' is anything that has been (or could be) formally defined, and with which one may do [[deductive reasoning]] and [[mathematical proof]]s. Commonly encountered mathematical objects include [[number]]s, [[permutation]]s, [[Partition of a set|partitions]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], [[set (mathematics)|sets]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], and [[relation (mathematics)|relations]].  [[Geometry]] as a branch of mathematics has such objects as [[hexagon]]s, [[point (geometry)|points]], [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[triangle]]s, [[circle]]s, [[sphere]]s, [[polyhedron|polyhedra]], [[topological space]]s and [[manifold]]s.  Another branch&amp;mdash;[[algebra]]&amp;mdash;has [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[lattice (group)|group-theoretic lattices]], and [[lattice (order)|order-theoretic lattices]].  [[Category (mathematics)|Categories]] are simultaneously homes to mathematical objects and mathematical objects in their own right. In [[proof theory]], proofs and [[theorem]]s are also mathematical objects.

The [[Ontology|ontological status]] of mathematical objects has been the subject of much investigation and debate by philosophers of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P. Burgess|Burgess, John]], and Rosen, Gideon, 1997. ''A Subject with No Object: Strategies for Nominalistic Reconstrual of Mathematics''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{isbn|0198236158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cantorian framework==
One view that emerged around the turn of the 20th century with the work of [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] is that all mathematical objects can be defined as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  The set {0,1} is a relatively clear-cut example.  On the face of it the [[group (mathematics)|group]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of integers mod 2 is also a set with two elements.  However, it cannot simply be the set {0,1}, because this does not mention the additional structure imputed to '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s of [[addition]] and [[additive inverse|negation]] mod 2: how are we to tell which of 0 or 1 is the [[additive identity]], for example?  To organize this group as a set it can first be coded as the [[Tuple|quadruple]] ({0,1},+,&amp;minus;,0), which in turn can be coded using one of several conventions as a set representing that quadruple, which in turn entails encoding the operations + and &amp;minus; and the constant 0 as sets.

Sets may include ordered denotation of the particular identities and operations that apply to them, indicating a group, abelian group, ring, field, or other mathematical object. These types of mathematical objects are commonly studied in [[abstract algebra]].

==Foundational paradoxes==
If, however, the goal of mathematical ontology is taken to be the internal consistency of mathematics, it is more important that mathematical objects be definable in some uniform way (for example, as sets) regardless of actual practice, in order to lay bare the [[essence]] of its [[paradox]]es.  This has been the viewpoint taken by [[foundations of mathematics]], which has traditionally accorded the management of paradox higher priority than the faithful reflection of the details of mathematical practice as a justification for defining mathematical objects to be sets.

Much of the tension created by this foundational identification of mathematical objects with sets can be relieved without unduly compromising the goals of foundations by allowing two kinds of objects into the mathematical universe, sets and [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s, without requiring that either be considered merely an instance of the other.  These form the basis of [[model theory]] as the [[domain of discourse]] of [[predicate logic]].  From this viewpoint, mathematical objects are entities satisfying the [[axiom]]s of a formal theory expressed in the language of predicate logic.

==Category theory==
A variant of this approach replaces relations with [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], the basis of [[universal algebra]].  In this variant the axioms often take the form of [[equation]]s, or implications between equations.

A more abstract variant is [[category theory]], which abstracts sets as objects and the operations thereon as [[morphism]]s between those objects.  At this level of abstraction mathematical objects reduce to mere [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] whose [[edge (geometry)|edge]]s as the morphisms abstract the ways in which those objects can transform and whose structure is encoded in the [[Function composition|composition law]] for morphisms. [[Category (mathematics)|Categories]] may arise as the models of some axiomatic theory and the [[homomorphism]]s between them (in which case they are usually [[concrete category|concrete]], meaning equipped with a [[Full and faithful functors|faithful]] [[forgetful functor]] to the category '''[[category of sets|Set]]''' or more generally to a suitable [[topos]]), or they may be constructed from other more primitive categories, or they may be studied as abstract objects in their own right without regard for their [[provenance]].

'''Media transparency'''(or '''transparent media'''), sometimes also referred to as '''media opacity,'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaisance|first=Patrick Lee|date=2007-06-18|title=Transparency: An Assessment of the Kantian Roots of a Key Element in Media Ethics Practice|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08900520701315855|journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics|language=en|volume=22|issue=2-3|pages=187–207|doi=10.1080/08900520701315855|issn=0890-0523}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept that ponders on how and why [[Information subsidy|information subsidies]] are being produced, distributed and handled by media professionals, including journalists, editors, public relations practitioners, public affairs specialists, and spokespeople. In short, media transparency reflects the relationship between journalists and news sources. 

==Overview==
Media transparency deals with the openness and accountability of the media and can be defined as a transparent exchange of information subsidies based on the ideas of newsworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global journalism: Survey of international communication.|last=Merrill|first=John|publisher=Longman|year=1995|isbn=0801305128|location=White Plains, NY|pages=77-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;Media transparency is one of the biggest challenges of contemporary everyday media practices around the world as media outlets and journalists constantly experience pressures from advertisers, information sources, publishers, and other influential groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://instituteforpr.org/bribery-news-coverage-2003/|title=International Index of Bribery for News Coverage 2003 {{!}} Institute for Public Relations|date=2011-01-10|work=Institute for Public Relations|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News sources may influence what information is published or not published. Sometimes, published information can also be paid for by news sources, but the end media product (an article, a program, a blog post) does not clearly indicate that the message has been paid or influenced in any way. Such media opacity, or media non-transparency, ruins the trust and transparency between the media and the public and have implications for transparency of new forms of advertising and public relations (such as native advertising and brand journalism).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transparency, Public Relations and the Mass Media:

Media transparency is a normative concept and is achieved when: 1) there are many competing sources of information; 2) the method of information delivery is known; and 3) funding of media production is disclosed and publicly available&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Academics at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Warwick Business School]], conducting empirical research on the operation and effects of transparent forms of clinical regulation in practice, describe a form of 'spectacular transparency'. They suggest that government policy tends to react to high-profile media 'spectacles', leading to regulatory policy decisions that appear to respond to problems exposed in the media have new perverse effects in practice, which are unseen by regulators or the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D|title=Medical regulation, spectacular transparency and the blame business|journal=Journal of Health, Organization and Management|year=2010|volume=24|issue=6|pages=597–610|pmid=21155435|doi=10.1108/14777261011088683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D.|title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which state agents work to influence [[video production]] contradicts the use of those images by news organizations as indexical, objective representations. Because people tend to strongly equate seeing with knowing, video cultivates an inaccurate impression that they are getting the "full picture". It has been said that "what is on the news depends on what can be shown". The case studies for this project demonstrate that what can be shown is often decided in concern with political agents. Essentially, the way the media presents its information creates an illusion of transparency.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Angela Block, [http://hij.sagepub.com/content/14/2/257.full.pdf+html "Who's Minding the Gate? : Pool Feeds, Video Subsidies, and Political Images"], "The International Journal of Press and Politics", April 2009.

The name "melancholia" comes from the old medical belief of the four [[humourism|humours]]: disease or ailment being caused by an imbalance in one or more of the four basic bodily liquids, or humours. Personality types were similarly determined by the dominant humor in a particular person. According to [[Hippocrates]] and subsequent tradition, melancholia was caused by an excess of black bile,&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0251%3Atext%3DAer.%3Asection%3D10 ''De aere aquis et locis'', 10.103], on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; hence the name, which means "black bile", from [[Ancient Greek]] μέλας (''melas''), "dark, black",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dme%2Flas μέλας],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and χολή (''kholé''), "bile";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxolh%2F χολή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; a person whose constitution tended to have a preponderance of black bile had a ''melancholic'' disposition.  In the complex elaboration of humorist theory, it was associated with the earth from the [[Four Elements]], the season of autumn, the [[spleen]] as the originating organ and cold and dry as related qualities.  In [[astrology]] it showed the influence of [[Saturn]], hence the related adjective ''saturnine''.

Melancholia was described as a distinct [[History of depression|disease]] with particular mental and physical symptoms in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Hippocrates, in his ''Aphorisms'', characterized all "fears and despondencies, if they last a long time" as being symptomatic of melancholia.&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates, ''Aphorisms'', Section 6.23&lt;/ref&gt; When a patient could not be cured of the disease it was thought that the melancholia was a result of [[demonic possession]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://loki.stockton.edu/~kinsellt/projects/pom/storyReader$7.html 18th-Century Theories of Melancholy &amp; Hypochondria]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Hugh. [https://archive.org/stream/essayondemonia00farm#page/56/mode/2up An essay on demoniacs of the New Testament] 56 (1818)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of French and Burgundian courtly culture, [[Johan Huizinga]]&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga, "Pessimism and the ideal of the sublime life", ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', 1924:22ff.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that "at the close of the Middle Ages, a sombre melancholy weighs on people's souls." In chronicles, poems, sermons, even in legal documents, an immense sadness, a note of despair and a fashionable sense of suffering and deliquescence at the approaching end of times, suffuses court poets and chroniclers alike: Huizinga quotes instances in the ballads of [[Eustache Deschamps]], "monotonous and gloomy variations of the same dismal theme", and in [[Georges Chastellain]]'s prologue to his Burgundian chronicle,&lt;ref&gt;"I, man of sadness, born in an eclipse of darkness, and thick fogs of lamentation".&lt;/ref&gt; and in the late fifteenth-century poetry of [[Jean Meschinot]]. Ideas of reflection and the workings of imagination are blended in the term ''merencolie'', embodying for contemporaries "a tendency", observes Huizinga, "to identify all serious occupation of the mind with sadness".&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Painters were considered by [[Vasari]] and other writers to be especially prone to melancholy by the nature of their work, sometimes with good effects for their art in increased sensitivity and use of fantasy.  Among those of his contemporaries so characterised by Vasari were [[Pontormo]] and [[Parmigianino]], but he does not use the term of [[Michelangelo]], who used it, perhaps not very seriously, of himself.&lt;ref&gt;Britton, Piers, ''"Mio malinchonico, o vero... mio pazzo": Michelangelo, Vasari, and the Problem of Artists' Melancholy in Sixteenth-Century Italy'', ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'', Vol. 34, No. 3 (Fall, 2003), pp. 653-675, Article DOI: 10.2307/20061528, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20061528 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  A famous [[allegory|allegorical]] [[engraving]] by [[Albrecht Dürer]] is entitled ''[[Melencolia I]]''. This engraving has been interpreted as portraying melancholia as the state of waiting for inspiration to strike, and not necessarily as a depressive affliction.  Amongst other allegorical symbols, the picture includes a [[magic square]] and a truncated [[rhombohedron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DuerersSolid.html Mathworld.wolfram.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The image in turn inspired a passage in ''[[The City of Dreadful Night]]'' by [[James Thomson (B.V.)]], and, a few years later, a sonnet by [[Edward Dowden]].

The most extended treatment of melancholia comes from [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], whose ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' (1621) treats the subject from both a literary and a medical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. Burton wrote in the 17th century that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness, especially melancholia.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'', subsection 3, on and after line 3480, "Music a Remedy":&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|But to leave all declamatory speeches in praise of divine music, I will confine myself to my proper subject: besides that excellent power it hath to expel many other diseases, it is a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy, and will drive away the devil himself. Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, in Philostratus, when Apollonius was inquisitive to know what he could do with his pipe, told him, "That he would make a melancholy man merry, and him that was merry much merrier than before, a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout." Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now they do those, saith Bodine, that are troubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10800/10800-8.txt Gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.mun.ca/munmed/84/crellin.htm "Humanities are the Hormones: A Tarantella Comes to Newfoundland.

in 10th century [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[Abu Bakr Rabee Ibn Ahmad Al-Akhawyni Bokhari|Al-Akhawayni]] describes Melancholia as a [[Chronic condition|chronic]] illness and relates it to [[brain]], which is one of the main aspects of his view on Melancholia.&lt;ref name=My4&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delfaridi|first1=Behnam|title=Melancholia in Medieval Persian Literature: The View of Hidayat of Al-Akhawayni.|journal=World Journal of Psychiatry|date=2014|pages=37–41|doi=10.5498/wjp.v4.i2.37|volume=4|pmc=4087154|pmid=25019055}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes Melancholia’s initial [[clinical manifestations]] as "suffering from an unexplained fear, inability to answer questions or providing false answers, self-laughing and self-crying and speaking meaninglessly, yet with no [[fever]]"&lt;ref name="Jala"&gt;{{cite book |last=Matini |first=Jalal|title=  Hedayat al-Motaallemin fi Tebb |publisher= University Press, Mashhad  |year=  1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Encyclopédie]] of [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]], the causes of melancholia are stated to be similar to those that cause [[Mania]]: "grief, pains of the spirit, passions, as well as all the love and sexual appetites that go unsatisfied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors= Denis Diderot  |title=Melancholia

During the later 16th and early 17th centuries, a curious cultural and literary cult of melancholia arose in England. In an influential&lt;ref name="Goldring"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldring |first=Elizabeth |title='So lively a portrait of his miseries': Melancholy, mourning, and the Elizabethan malady|journal=British Art Journal|volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=12–22 |jstor=41614620 |date=August 2005}} - via {{w|JSTOR}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ribeiro1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ribeiro | first = Aileen | title = Fashion and fiction: Dress in art and literature in Stuart England | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven Conn.

Small wonder that eventually the attitudes of melancholy soon became an indispensable adjunct to all those with artistic or intellectual pretentions.&lt;ref name="Malady"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strong|first=Roy|year=1964|title=The Elizabethan Malady: Melancholy in Elizabeth and Jacobean portraiture|journal=Apollo|volume=LXXIX}}, reprinted in {{cite book | last = Strong | first = Roy | title = The English Icon: Elizabethan and Jacobean Portraiture | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul | location = London | year = 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Anatomy of Melancholy'' (''The Anatomy of Melancholy, What it is: With all the Kinds, Causes, Symptomes, Prognostickes, and Several Cures of it... Philosophically, Medicinally, Historically, Opened and Cut Up'') by Burton, was first published in 1621 and remains a defining literary monument to the fashion. Another major English author who made extensive expression upon being of an melancholic disposition is Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in  his [[Religio Medici]] (1643).

''[[Night-Thoughts]]'' (''The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life, Death, &amp;&lt;!-- do not change to "and" --&gt; Immortality''), a long poem in blank verse by [[Edward Young]] was published in nine parts (or "nights") between 1742 and 1745, and hugely popular in several languages. It had a considerable influence on early [[Romanticism|Romantics]] in England, France and Germany. [[William Blake]] was commissioned to illustrate a later edition.

In the visual arts, this fashionable intellectual melancholy occurs frequently in portraiture of the era, with sitters posed in the form of "the lover, with his crossed arms and floppy hat over his eyes, and the scholar, sitting with his head resting on his hand"&lt;ref name="Malady" /&gt;—descriptions drawn from the frontispiece to the 1638 edition of Burton's ''Anatomy'', which shows just such by-then stock characters. These portraits were often set out of doors where Nature provides "the most suitable background for spiritual contemplation"&lt;ref name="Ribeiro2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ribeiro | first = Aileen | title = Fashion and fiction: Dress in art and literature in Stuart England | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven Conn. London | year = 2005 | isbn = 0300109997|p=54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in a gloomy interior.

In music, the post-Elizabethan cult of melancholia is associated with [[John Dowland]], whose motto was ''Semper Dowland, semper dolens'' ("Always Dowland, always mourning"). The melancholy man, known to contemporaries as a "malcontent", is epitomized by Shakespeare's [[Hamlet|Prince Hamlet]], the "Melancholy Dane".

A similar phenomenon, though not under the same name, occurred during the German [[Sturm und Drang]] movement, with such works as ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] or in [[Romanticism]] with works such as ''[[Ode on Melancholy]]'' by [[John Keats]] or in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] with works such as ''[[Isle of the Dead (painting)|Isle of the Dead]]'' by [[Arnold Böcklin]]. In the 20th century, much of the counterculture of [[modernism]] was fueled by comparable [[Social alienation|alienation]] and a sense of purposelessness called "[[anomie]]"; earlier artistic preoccupation with death has gone under the rubric of [[memento mori]]. The medieval condition of [[acedia]] (''acedie'' in English) and the Romantic [[Weltschmerz]] were similar concepts, most likely to affect the intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Núria Perpinyà|PERPINYÀ]], Núria.

*Melancholia is a specific form of mental illness characterized by depressed mood, abnormal motor functions, and abnormal vegetative signs. It has been identified in medical writings from antiquity and was best characterized in the 19th Century. In the 20th Century, with the interest in psychoanalytic writing, "major depression" became the principal class in psychiatric classifications. [See Taylor MA, Fink M: Melancholia for details of history.]
*In 1996, Gordon Parker and Dusan Hadzi-Pavlovic described Melancholia as a specific disorder of movement and mood. [Melancholia" A Disorder of Movement and Mood, Cambridge UK: Cambridge University Press, 1996]. More recently, MA Taylor and M Fink crystallized the present image of melancholia as a systemic disorder that is identifiable by depressive mood rating scales, verified by the present of abnormal cortisol metabolism (abnormal dexamethasone suppression test), and validated by rapid and effective remission with ECT or tricyclic antidepressant agents. It has many forms, including [[retarded depression]], [[psychotic depression]] and [[postpartum depression]].

New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an experience that, on most occasions, significantly resembles the experience of perceiving some object, event, or scene, but occurs when the relevant object, event, or scene is not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;McKellar, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finke, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  There are sometimes episodes, particularly on falling asleep ([[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic imagery]]) and waking up ([[hypnopompic]]), when the mental imagery, being of a rapid, phantasmagoric and involuntary character, defies perception, presenting a kaleidoscopic field, in which no distinct object can be discerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Edmond |year=1983 |title=Inspecting images |journal=Philosophy |volume=58 |issue=223 |pages=57–72 (see pp. 68–72) |doi=10.1017/s0031819100056266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental imagery can sometimes produce the same effects as would be produced by the behavior or experience imagined.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kappes|first=Heather Barry|last2=Morewedge|first2=Carey K.|date=2016-07-01|title=Mental Simulation as Substitute for Experience|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=10|issue=7|pages=405–420|doi=10.1111/spc3.12257|issn=1751-9004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of these experiences, what makes them possible, and their function (if any) have long been subjects of research and controversy{{Elucidate|date=April 2014}} in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], and, more recently, [[neuroscience]]. As contemporary researchers{{whom2|date=April 2014}} use the expression, mental images or imagery can comprise information from any source of sensory input; one may experience auditory images,&lt;ref&gt;Reisberg, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; olfactory images,&lt;ref&gt;Bensafi et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and so forth. However, the majority of philosophical and scientific investigations of the topic focus upon ''visual'' mental imagery. It has sometimes been assumed{{By whom|date=April 2014}} that, like humans, some types of animals are capable of experiencing mental images.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]]: ''[[On the Soul]]'' III.3 428a&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fundamentally introspective nature of the phenomenon, there is little to no evidence either for or against this view.

Philosophers such as [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], and early experimental psychologists such as [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[William James]], understood [[idea]]s in general to be mental images. Today it is very widely believed{{By whom|date=April 2014}} that much imagery functions as mental representations (or [[mental model]]s), playing an important role in memory and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Paivio|Pavio]], 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kieran Egan (educationist)|Egan]], 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence W. Barsalou|Barsalou]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; William Brant (2013, p.&amp;nbsp;12) traces the scientific use of the phrase "mental images" back to [[John Tyndall]]'s 1870 speech called the "Scientific Use of the Imagination". Some have gone so far as to suggest that images are best understood to be, by definition, a form of inner, mental or neural representation;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ned Block|Block]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Kosslyn|Kosslyn]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of hypnagogic and hypnapompic imagery, it is not representational at all.  Others reject the view that the image experience may be identical with (or directly caused by) any such representation in the mind or the brain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sartre]], 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Ryle|Ryle]], 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]], 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomeo, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett &amp; Hacker, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; but do not take account of the non-representational forms of imagery.

In 2010, [[IBM]] applied for a patent on a method to extract mental images of human faces from the human brain. It uses a feedback loop based on brain measurements of the [[fusiform face area]] in the brain that activates proportionate with degree of facial recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20100049076.pdf IBM Patent Application: Retrieving mental images of faces from the human brain]&lt;/ref&gt; It was issued in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-traders.com/INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS-MA-4828/news/Business-Machines--Patent-Issued-for-Retrieving-Mental-Images-of-Faces-from-the-Human-Brain-20127314/ Business Machines : Patent Issued for Retrieving Mental Images of Faces from the Human Brain]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The mind's eye==
The notion of a "mind's eye" goes back at least to [[Cicero]]'s reference to '''''mentis oculi''''' during his discussion of the orator's appropriate use of [[simile]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XCU9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA535#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Liber III: XLI: 163.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to "the [[Gulf of Gabès|Syrtis]] of his patrimony" and "the [[Charybdis]] of his possessions" involved similes that were "too far-fetched"; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of "the rock" and "the gulf" (respectively)—on the grounds that "the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ciceroonoratorya00ciceuoft#page/239/mode/1upWatson, J.S. (trans. and ed.), ''Cicero on Oratory and Orators'', Harper &amp; Brothers, (New York), 1875:  Book III, C.XLI, p.239.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "the mind's eye" first appeared in English in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] (c. 1387) [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Tale]] in his ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with "the eyes of his mind"; namely, those eyes "with which all men see after they have become blind".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyprol00chauuoft#page/78/mode/1up ''The Man of Laws Tale'', lines 550-553.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical basis ==
The biological foundation of the mind's eye is not fully understood. Studies using [[fMRI]]  have shown that the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex .28V1.29|V1 area]] of the [[visual cortex]] are activated during mental imagery tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~alumit/ishai_neuroimage2002.pdf Imagery of famous faces: effects of memory and attention revealed by fMRI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821220736/http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~alumit/ishai_neuroimage2002.pdf |date=2006-08-21 }}, A. Ishai, J. V. Haxby and L. G. Ungerleider, ''NeuroImage'' '''17''' (2002), pp. 1729-1741.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Ratey|Ratey]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[visual pathway]] is not a one-way street. Higher areas of the [[human brain|brain]] can also send visual input back to [[neuron]]s in lower areas of the visual cortex. [...] As humans, we have the ability to see with the mind's eye – to have a perceptual experience in the absence of visual input. For example, [[PET scan]]s have shown that when subjects, seated in a room, imagine they are at their front door starting to walk either to the left or right, activation begins in the [[visual association cortex]], the [[parietal cortex]], and the [[prefrontal cortex]] - all higher [[Information processing theory#Cognitive processes|cognitive processing center]]s of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;''A User's Guide to the Brain'', John J. Ratey, {{ISBN|0-375-70107-9}}, at p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rudiments of a biological basis for the mind's eye is found in the deeper portions of the brain below the [[neocortex]], or where the center of perception exists.  The [[thalamus]] has been found to be discrete to other components in that it processes all forms of perceptional data relayed from both lower and higher components of the brain.  Damage to this component can produce permanent perceptual damage, however when damage is inflicted upon the [[cerebral cortex]], the brain adapts to [[neuroplasticity]] to amend any occlusions for perception.  It can be thought that the neocortex is a sophisticated memory storage warehouse in which data received as an input from sensory systems are compartmentalized via the cerebral cortex.  This would essentially allow for shapes to be identified, although given the lack of filtering input produced internally, one may as a consequence, hallucinate - essentially seeing something that isn't received as an input externally but rather internal (i.e. an error in the filtering of segmented sensory data from the cerebral cortex may result in one seeing, feeling, hearing or experiencing something that is inconsistent with reality).

Not all people have the same internal perceptual ability. For many, when the eyes are closed, the perception of darkness prevails. However, some people are able to perceive colorful, dynamic imagery. The use of [[hallucinogen]]ic drugs increases the subject's ability to consciously access visual (and auditory, and other sense) percepts.

Furthermore, the [[pineal gland]] is a hypothetical candidate for producing a mind's eye; [[Rick Strassman]] and others have postulated that during [[near-death experiences]] (NDEs) and [[dream]]ing, the gland might secrete a hallucinogenic chemical [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|''N'',''N''-Dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT) to produce internal visuals when external sensory data is occluded.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Strassman, DMT: The Spirit Molecule: A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences, 320 pages, Park Street Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-89281-927-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis has yet to be fully supported with [[neurochemical]] evidence and plausible mechanism for DMT production.

The hypothesized condition where a person lacks a mind's eye is called [[aphantasia]]. The term was first suggested in a 2015 study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2015.05.019| pmid = 26115582| issn = 0010-9452| last1 = Zeman| first1 = Adam| last2 = Dewar| first2 = Michaela| last3 = Della Sala| first3 = Sergio| title = Lives without imagery – Congenital aphantasia| journal = Cortex| accessdate = 2015-06-24| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945215001781| volume=73| pages=378–380| year = 2015| hdl = 10871/17613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common examples of mental images include [[daydreaming]] and the mental visualization that occurs while reading a book. Another is of the pictures summoned by athletes during training or before a competition, outlining each step they will take to accomplish their goal.&lt;ref&gt;Plessinger, Annie. ''The Effects of Mental Imagery on Athletic Performance''. The Mental Edge. 12/20/13. Web. http://www.vanderbilt.edu&lt;/ref&gt; When a musician hears a song, he or she can sometimes "see" the song notes in their head, as well as hear them with all their tonal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia:  Tales of Music and the Brain |place=London |publisher=Picador |pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is considered different from an after-effect, such as an after-image.  Calling up an image in our minds can be a voluntary act, so it can be characterized as being under various degrees of conscious control.

According to psychologist and cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1999). ''How the Mind Works''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; our experiences of the world are represented in our minds as mental images. These mental images can then be associated and compared with others, and can be used to synthesize completely new images. In this view, mental images allow us to form useful theories of how the world works by formulating likely sequences of mental images in our heads without having to directly experience that outcome. Whether [[animal cognition|other creatures have this capability]] is debatable.

There are several theories as to how mental images are formed in the mind. These include the [[dual coding theory|dual-code theory]], the propositional theory, and the functional-equivalency hypothesis. The dual-code theory, created by [[Allan Paivio]] in 1971, is the theory that we use two separate codes to represent information in our brains: image codes and verbal codes. Image codes are things like thinking of a picture of a dog when you are thinking of a dog, whereas a verbal code would be to think of the word "dog".&lt;ref&gt;Paivio, Allan. 1941. ''Dual Coding Theory. Theories of Learning in Educational Psychology''. (2013). Web. {{cite web |url=http://www.lifecircles-inc.com/Learningtheories/IP/paivio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221091503/http://www.lifecircles-inc.com/Learningtheories/IP/paivio.html |archivedate=2011-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the difference between thinking of abstract words such as ''justice'' or ''love'' and thinking of concrete words like ''elephant'' or ''chair.'' When abstract words are thought of, it is easier to think of them in terms of verbal codes—finding words that define them or describe them. With concrete words, it is often easier to use image codes and bring up a picture of a ''human'' or ''chair'' in your mind rather than words associated or descriptive of them.

The propositional theory involves storing images in the form of a generic propositional code that stores the meaning of the concept not the image itself. The propositional codes can either be descriptive of the image or symbolic. They are then transferred back into verbal and visual code to form the mental image.&lt;ref&gt;Mental Imaging Theories. 2013. Web. http://faculty.mercer.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional-equivalency hypothesis is that mental images are "internal representations" that work in the same way as the actual perception of physical objects.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M. W. (2012). ''Fundamentals of Cognition'', 2nd ed. New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the picture of a dog brought to mind when the word ''dog'' is read is interpreted in the same way as if the person looking at an actual dog before them.

Research has occurred to designate a specific neural correlate of imagery; however, studies show a multitude of results. Most studies published before 2001 suggest neural correlates of visual imagery occur in brodmann area 17.&lt;ref name="Kobayashi e21736"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobayashi|first=Masayuki|last2=Sasabe|first2=Tetsuya|last3=Shigihara|first3=Yoshihito|last4=Tanaka|first4=Masaaki|last5=Watanabe|first5=Yasuyoshi|date=2011-07-08|title=Gustatory Imagery Reveals Functional Connectivity from the Prefrontal to Insular Cortices Traced with Magnetoencephalography|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e21736|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021736|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3132751|pmid=21760903|bibcode=2011PLoSO...621736K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory performance imagery have been observed in the premotor areas, precunes, and medial brodmann area 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meister|first=I.

==Neural substrates of visual imagery==
'''Visual imagery''' is the ability to create [[Mental image|mental representations]] of things, people, and places that are absent from an individual’s visual field. This ability is crucial to problem-solving tasks, memory, and spatial reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, N., Bosch, S. E., &amp; van Gerven, M. A. J. [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/5/1367.abstract “Vividness of Visual Imagery Depends on the Neural Overlap with Perception in Visual Areas”], The Journal of Neuroscience, 37(5), 1367 LP-1373. (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroscientist|Neuroscientists]] have found that imagery and [[Perception|perception]] share many of the same [[Neural substrate|neural substrates]], or areas of the [[Brain|brain]] that function similarly during both imagery and perception, such as the [[Visual cortex|visual cortex]] and higher visual areas. Kosslyn and colleagues (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Pascual-Leone, A., Felician, O., Camposano, S., Keenan, J. P., L., W., … Alpert. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/284/5411/167.abstract “The Role of Area 17 in Visual Imagery: Convergent Evidence from PET and rTMS”], Science, 284(5411), 167 LP-170, (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the early visual cortex, Area 17 and Area 18/19, is activated during visual imagery. They found that inhibition of these areas through repetitive [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (rTMS) resulted in impaired visual perception and imagery. Furthermore, research conducted with lesioned patients has revealed that visual imagery and visual perception have the same representational organization. This has been concluded from patients in which impaired perception also experience visual imagery deficits at the same level of the mental representation.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, M. (1988). "Is Visual Imagery Really Visual? Overlooked Evidence From Neuropsychology". Psychological review. 95. 307-17. 10.1037/0033-295X.95.3.307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Behrmann and colleagues (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Behrmann, M., Winocur, G., &amp; Moscovitch, M. [https://doi.org/10.1038/359636a0 “Dissociation between mental imagery and object recognition in a brain-damaged patient”]. Nature, 359, 636. (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; describe a patient C.K., who provided evidence challenging the view that visual imagery and visual perception rely on the same representational system. C.K. was a 33-year old man with [[Visual agnosia|visual object agnosia]] acquired after a vehicular accident. This deficit prevented him from being able to recognize objects and copy objects fluidly. Surprisingly, his ability to draw accurate objects from memory indicated his visual imagery was intact and normal. Furthermore, C.K. successfully performed other tasks requiring visual imagery for judgment of size, shape, color, and composition. These findings conflict with previous research as they suggest there is a partial dissociation between visual imagery and visual perception. C.K. exhibited a perceptual deficit that was not associated with a corresponding deficit in visual imagery, indicating that these two processes have systems for mental representations that may not be mediated entirely by the same neural substrates. 

Schlegel and colleagues (2013)&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, A., Kohler, P. J., Fogelson, S. V, Alexander, P., Konuthula, D., &amp; Tse, P. U. [http://www.pnas.org/content/110/40/16277.abstract “Network structure and dynamics of the mental workspace”], Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(40), 16277 LP-16282. (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] analysis of regions activated during manipulation of visual imagery. They identified 11 bilateral [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and subcortical regions that exhibited increased activation when manipulating a visual image compared to when the visual image was just maintained. These regions included the [[Occipital lobe|occipital lobe]] and [[Two-streams hypothesis|ventral stream]] areas, two [[Parietal lobe|parietal lobe]] regions, the [[Posterior parietal cortex|posterior parietal cortex]] and the [[Precuneus|precuneus]] lobule, and three [[Frontal lobe|frontal lobe]] regions, the [[Frontal eye fields|frontal eye fields]], [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], and the [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal cortex]]. Due to their suspected involvement in [[Working memory|working memory]] and [[Attention|attention]], the authors propose that these parietal and prefrontal regions, and occipital regions, are part of a network involved in mediating the manipulation of visual imagery. These results suggest a top-down activation of visual areas in visual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, B., &amp; Whishaw, I. Q. (2015). Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology. New York. Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Dynamic causal modelling|Dynamic Causal Modeling]] (DCM) to determine the connectivity of cortical networks, Ishai et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Ishai, A. “Seeing faces and objects with the "mind's eye”", Archives Italiennes de Biologie, 148(1):1-9. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that activation of the network mediating visual imagery is initiated by prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex activity. Generation of objects from memory resulted in initial activation of the prefrontal and the posterior parietal areas, which then activate earlier visual areas through backward connectivity. Activation of the prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex has also been found to be involved in retrieval of object representations from [[Long-term memory|long-term memory]], their maintenance in working memory, and attention during visual imagery. Thus, Ishai et al. suggest that the network mediating visual imagery is composed of attentional mechanisms arising from the posterior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex.

Vividness of visual imagery is a crucial component of an individual’s ability to perform cognitive tasks requiring imagery. Vividness of visual imagery varies not only between individuals but also within individuals. Dijkstra and colleagues (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, N., Bosch, S. E., &amp; van Gerven, M. A. J. [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/5/1367.abstract “Vividness of Visual Imagery Depends on the Neural Overlap with Perception in Visual Areas”], The Journal of Neuroscience, 37(5), 1367 LP-1373. (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; found that the variation in vividness of visual imagery is dependent on the degree to which the neural substrates of visual imagery overlap with those of visual perception. They found that overlap between imagery and perception in the entire visual cortex, the parietal precuneus lobule, the right parietal cortex, and the medial frontal cortex predicted the vividness of a mental representation. The activated regions beyond the visual areas are believed to drive the imagery-specific processes rather than the visual processes shared with perception. It has been suggested that the precuneus contributes to vividness by selecting important details for imagery. The medial frontal cortex is suspected to be involved in the retrieval and integration of information from the parietal and visual areas during working memory and visual imagery. The right parietal cortex appears to be important in attention, visual inspection, and stabilization of mental representations. Thus, the neural substrates of visual imagery and perception overlap in areas beyond the visual cortex and the degree of this overlap in these areas correlates with the vividness of mental representations during imagery.

==Philosophical ideas==
{{Main|Mental representation}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Mental images are an important topic in classical and modern philosophy, as they are central to the study of [[knowledge]].  In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', Book VII, [[Plato]] has [[Socrates]] present the [[Allegory of the Cave]]: a prisoner, bound and unable to move, sits with his back to a fire watching the shadows cast on the cave wall in front of him by people carrying objects behind his back. These people and the objects they carry are representations of real things in the world. Unenlightened man is like the prisoner, explains  Socrates, a human being making mental images from the sense data that he experiences.

The eighteenth-century philosopher Bishop [[George Berkeley]] proposed similar ideas in his theory of [[idealism]].  Berkeley stated that reality is equivalent to mental images&amp;mdash;our mental images are not a copy of another material reality but that reality itself. Berkeley, however, sharply distinguished between the images that he considered to constitute the external world, and the images of individual imagination. According to Berkeley, only the latter are considered "mental imagery" in the contemporary sense of the term.

The eighteenth century British writer Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]] criticized idealism.  When asked what he thought about idealism, he is alleged to have replied "I refute it thus!"{{Cite quote|date=February 2017}} as he kicked a large rock and his leg rebounded.  His point was that the idea that the rock is just another mental image and has no material existence of its own is a poor explanation of the painful sense data he had just experienced.

David Deutsch addresses Johnson's objection to idealism in ''The Fabric of Reality'' when he states that, if we judge the value of our mental images of the world by the quality and quantity of the sense data that they can explain, then the most valuable mental image&amp;mdash;or theory&amp;mdash;that we currently have is that the world has a real independent existence and that humans have successfully evolved by building up and adapting patterns of mental images to explain it.  This is an important idea in [[Philosophy of science|scientific thought]].{{Why|date=May 2010}}

Critics of [[scientific realism]] ask how the inner perception of mental images actually occurs. This is sometimes called the "[[homunculus]] problem" (see also the [[mind's eye]]). The problem is similar to asking how the images you see on a computer screen exist in the memory of the computer. To scientific [[materialism]], mental images and the perception of them must be brain-states. According to critics,{{Who|date=May 2010}} scientific realists cannot explain where the images and their perceiver exist in the brain. To use the analogy of the computer screen, these critics argue that [[cognitive science]] and [[psychology]] have been unsuccessful in identifying either the component in the brain (i.e., "hardware") or the mental processes that store these images (i.e. "software").

==In experimental psychology==

[[cognitive psychology|Cognitive psychologists]] and (later) [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscientists]] have empirically tested some of the philosophical questions related to whether and how the human brain uses mental imagery in cognition.

[[Image:MR TMR.jpg|right]]One theory of the mind that was examined in these experiments was the "brain as serial computer" philosophical metaphor of the 1970s. Psychologist [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] theorized that the human mind processes mental images by decomposing them into an underlying mathematical proposition. [[Roger Shepard]] and Jacqueline Metzler challenged that view by presenting subjects with 2D line drawings of groups of 3D block "objects" and asking them to determine whether that "object" is the same as a second figure, some of which rotations of the first "object".&lt;ref&gt;Shepard and Metzler 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Shepard and Metzler proposed that if we decomposed and then mentally re-imaged the objects into basic mathematical propositions, as the then-dominant view of cognition "as a serial digital computer"&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 1987&lt;/ref&gt; assumed, then it would be expected that the time it took to determine whether the object is the same or not would be independent of how much the object had been rotated.  Shepard and Metzler found the opposite: a linear relationship between the degree of rotation in the mental imagery task and the time it took participants to reach their answer.

This [[mental rotation]] finding implied that the human mind—and the human brain—maintains and manipulates mental images as topographic and topological wholes, an implication that was quickly put to test by psychologists.  [[Stephen Kosslyn]] and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn 1995; see also 1994&lt;/ref&gt; showed in a series of neuroimaging experiments that the mental image of objects like the letter "F" are mapped, maintained and rotated as an image-like whole in areas of the human visual cortex.  Moreover, Kosslyn's work showed that there are considerable similarities between the neural mappings for imagined stimuli and perceived stimuli.  The authors of these studies concluded that, while the neural processes they studied rely on mathematical and computational underpinnings, the brain also seems optimized to handle the sort of mathematics that constantly computes a series of topologically-based images rather than calculating a mathematical model of an object.

Recent studies in neurology and neuropsychology on mental imagery have further questioned the "mind as serial computer" theory, arguing instead that human mental imagery manifests [[motor imagery|both visually and kinesthetically]].  For example, several studies have provided evidence that people are slower at rotating line drawings of objects such as hands in directions incompatible with the joints of the human body,&lt;ref&gt;Parsons 1987; 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and that patients with painful, injured arms are slower at mentally rotating line drawings of the hand from the side of the injured arm.&lt;ref&gt;Schwoebel et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists, including Kosslyn, have argued that such results occur because of interference in the brain between distinct systems in the brain that process the visual and motor mental imagery.  Subsequent [[neuroimaging]] studies&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the interference between the motor and visual imagery system could be induced by having participants physically handle actual 3D blocks glued together to form objects similar to those depicted in the line-drawings.  Amorim et al. have shown that, when a cylindrical "head" was added to Shepard and Metzler's line drawings of 3D block figures, participants were quicker and more accurate at solving mental rotation problems.&lt;ref&gt;Amorim et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that motoric embodiment is not just "interference" that inhibits visual mental imagery but is capable of facilitating mental imagery.

As cognitive neuroscience approaches to mental imagery continued, research expanded beyond questions of serial versus parallel or topographic processing to questions of the relationship between mental images and perceptual representations. Both brain imaging (fMRI and ERP) and studies of neuropsychological patients have been used to test the hypothesis that a mental image is the reactivation, from memory, of brain representations normally activated during the perception of an external stimulus. In other words, if perceiving an apple activates contour and location and shape and color representations in the brain’s visual system, then imagining an apple activates some or all of these same representations using information stored in memory. Early evidence for this idea came from neuropsychology. Patients with brain damage that impairs perception in specific ways, for example by damaging shape or color representations, seem to generally to have impaired mental imagery in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Martha J.|title=Is visual imagery really visual? Overlooked evidence from neuropsychology|journal=Psychological Review|date=Sep 30, 1987|volume=95|issue=3|pages=307–317|doi=10.1037/0033.295X.95.3.307|pmid=3043530|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/95/3/307/|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of brain function in normal human brains support this same conclusion, showing activity in the brain’s visual areas while subjects imagined visual objects and scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cichy|first1=Radoslaw M.|last2=Heinzle|first2=Jakob|last3=Haynes|first3=John-Dylan|title=Imagery and Perception Share Cortical Representations of Content and Location|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=June 10, 2011|volume=22|issue=2|pages=372–380|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr106|url=http://psych.wisc.edu/postlab/readings/Cereb.%20Cortex-2012-Cichy-372-80.pdf|pmid=21666128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previously mentioned and numerous related studies have led to a relative consensus within [[cognitive science]], psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy on the neural status of mental images.  In general, researchers agree that, while there is no [[homunculus]] inside the head viewing these mental images, our brains do form and maintain mental images as image-like wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Rohrer 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem of exactly how these images are stored and manipulated within the human brain, in particular within language and communication, remains a fertile area of study.

One of the longest-running research topics on the mental image has basis on the fact that people report large individual differences in the vividness of their images.  Special questionnaires have been developed to assess such differences, including the [[Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ)]] developed by [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]]. Laboratory studies have suggested that the subjectively reported variations in imagery vividness are associated with different neural states within the brain and also different cognitive competences such as the ability to accurately recall information presented in pictures&lt;ref&gt;Marks, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Rodway, Gillies and Schepman used a novel long-term change detection task to determine whether participants with low and high vividness scores on the VVIQ2 showed any performance differences.&lt;ref&gt;Rodway, Gillies and Schepman 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Rodway et al. found that high vividness participants were significantly more accurate at detecting salient changes to pictures compared to low-vividness participants.&lt;ref&gt;Rodway et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This replicated an earlier study.&lt;ref&gt;Gur and Hilgard 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have found that individual differences in VVIQ scores can be used to predict changes in a person's brain while visualizing different activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cui et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) was used to study the association between early visual cortex activity relative to the whole brain while participants visualized themselves or another person bench pressing or stair climbing. Reported image vividness correlates significantly with the relative fMRI signal in the visual cortex. Thus, individual differences in the vividness of visual imagery can be measured objectively.

Logie, Pernet, Buonocore and Della Sala (2011) used behavioural and fMRI data for mental rotation from individuals reporting vivid and poor imagery on the VVIQ. Groups differed in brain activation patterns suggesting that the groups performed the same tasks in different ways. These findings help to explain the lack of association previously reported between VVIQ scores and mental rotation performance.

==Training and learning styles==

Some [[Learning theory (education)|educational theorists]]{{Who|date=May 2010}} have drawn from the idea of mental imagery in their studies of [[learning styles]]. Proponents of these theories state that people often have learning processes that emphasize visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems of experience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} According to these theorists, teaching in multiple overlapping sensory systems benefits learning, and they encourage teachers to use content and media that integrates well with the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems whenever possible.

Educational researchers have examined whether the experience of mental imagery affects the degree of learning. For example, imagining playing a 5-finger piano exercise (mental practice) resulted in a significant improvement in performance over no mental practice—though not as significant as that produced by physical practice.  The authors of the study stated that "mental practice alone seems to be sufficient to promote the modulation of neural circuits involved in the early stages of motor skill learning".&lt;ref&gt;Pascual-Leone et al. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualization and the Himalayan traditions==
In general, [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Bön]], and [[Tantra]] utilize sophisticated visualization or ''imaginal'' (in the language of [[Jean Houston]] of [[Transpersonal Psychology]]) processes in the [[thoughtform]] construction of the [[yidam]] [[sadhana]], [[kye-rim]], and [[dzog-rim]] modes of [[meditation]] and in the [[yantra]], [[thangka]], and [[mandala]] traditions, where holding the fully realized form in the mind is a prerequisite prior to creating an 'authentic' new art work that will provide a sacred support or foundation for deity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Dalai-Lama-at-MIT/dp/0674023196 The Dalai Lama at MIT] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/erosch2007-2.pdf Mental Imagery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229110116/http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/erosch2007-2.pdf |date=2008-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Substitution effects ==
Mental imagery can act as a [[Substitute good|substitute]] for the imagined experience: Imagining an experience can evoke similar cognitive, physiological, and/or behavioral consequences as having the corresponding experience in reality. At least four classes of such effects have been documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Imagined experiences are attributed evidentiary value like physical evidence. 
# [[Mental practice of action|Mental practice]] can instantiate the same performance benefits as physical practice. 
# Imagined consumption of a food can reduce its actual consumption. 
# Imagined goal achievement  can reduce motivation for actual goal achievement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4353">'''Moral authority''' is authority premised on principles, or fundamental truths, which are independent of written, or positive, laws. As such, moral authority necessitates the existence of and adherence to truth. Because truth does not change, the principles of moral authority are immutable or unchangeable, although as applied to individual circumstances the dictates of moral authority for action may vary due to the exigencies of human life. These principles, which can be of metaphysical or religious nature, are considered normative for behavior, whether they are or are not also embodied in written laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/moral-authority/ Legal Definitions: Moral Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; and even if the community is ignoring or violating them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oqYtU5iObYYC&amp;pg=PA86 Richard Norris, Timothy F. Sedgwick, ''The Business of All Believers: Reflections on Leadership'' (Church Publishing, Inc. 2009 ISBN 978-1-59627119-7), p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the authoritativeness or force of moral authority is applied to the [[conscience]] of each individual, who is free to act according to or against its dictates.

Moral authority has thus also been defined as the "fundamental assumptions that guide our perceptions of the world".&lt;ref&gt; James Davison Hunter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KTiTxl-rY9AC&amp;pg=PA119 ''Culture Wars''] (Basic Books 1992 {{ISBN|978-0-46501534-4}}), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

An individual or a body of people who are seen as communicators of such principles but which does not have the physical power to enforce them on the unwilling are spoken of as having or being a moral authority. An example is the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor_en.html Full text of Veritas Splendor], English Translation. John Paul II. August 6, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, moral authority has been defined as "the capacity to convince others how the world should be", as opposed to epistemic authority, "the capacity to convince others of how the world is".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missouriwestern.edu/orgs/polanyi/TAD%20WEB%20ARCHIVE/TAD36-3/TAD36-3-fnl-pg17-30-pdf.pdf Jay A. Labinger, "Individual or Institutional Authority in Science?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changing focuses==

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], traditional sources of moral authority such as church or state have been viewed with increasing suspicion in Western culture:&lt;ref&gt;S. Sims ed., ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'' (2012) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps indeed all claims to moral authority.&lt;ref&gt;Niamh Stephenson, ''Theoretical Psychology'' (2003) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of guides, entertainers; in place of ideals, stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Mosley, ''Dumbing Down'' (2000) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Expertise, or alternatively what [[Emmanuel Levinas]] called the tyranny of opinion,&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; or else an appeal to science,&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Brown, ''Imperfect Oracle'' (2009) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; may be looked to for alternative sources of moral authority; or there may be a [[postmodern]] revulsion from all [[grand narrative]]s which might ground such narratives &lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of [[moral relativism]].

Where a figure still wields some degree of moral authority, this may be attributed in large part to his modernist reticence, lack of dogma, and capacity for self-doubt&lt;ref&gt;Bernard O'Donoghue ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney'' (2009) p. 11 and p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– as opposed for example to the unchallenged moral authority for centuries attributed to [[Virgil]] as a ''norma vivendi''.{{Translation needed inline}}&lt;ref&gt;M. Tudeau-Clayton, ''Jonson, Shakespeare and Early Modern Virgil'' (1998) p. 26 and p. 72-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the erosion of sources of moral authority, [[Late Modernity]] has also seen the appearance of various forms of [[fundamentalism]], from a range of religious types to [[market fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24337">'''Neural adaptation''' or '''sensory adaptation''' is a change over time in the responsiveness of the [[sensory system]] to a constant [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. It is usually [[perception|experienced]] as a change in the stimulus. For example, if a hand is rested on a table, the table's surface is immediately felt on the skin. After a little while though this is no longer felt. The sensory neurons that initially respond are no longer stimulated to respond; this is an example of neural adaptation.

All sensory and neural systems have a form of adaptation to constantly detect changes in the environment. Neural receptor cells that process and receive stimulation go through constant changes for mammals and other living organisms to sense vital changes in their environment. Some key players in several neural systems include Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;ions (see [[Calcium in biology]]) that send negative feedback in second messenger pathways that allow the neural receptor cells to close or open channels in response to the changes of ion flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16027364|pmc=1180786|year=2005|author1=Dougherty|first1=D. P.|title=Computational model of the cAMP-mediated sensory response and calcium-dependent adaptation in vertebrate olfactory receptor neurons|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=102|issue=30|pages=10415–20|last2=Wright|first2=G. A.|last3=Yew|first3=A. C.|doi=10.1073/pnas.0504099102}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also mechanoreception systems that use calcium inflow to physically affect certain proteins and move them to close or open channels.

Functionally, it is highly possible that adaptation may enhance the limited response range of neurons to encode sensory signals with much larger dynamic ranges by shifting the range of stimulus amplitudes.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11988174|year=2002|author1=Chung|first1=S|title=Short-term depression at thalamocortical synapses contributes to rapid adaptation of cortical sensory responses in vivo|journal=Neuron|volume=34|issue=3|pages=437–46|last2=Li|first2=X|last3=Nelson|first3=S. B.|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00659-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in neural adaptation there is a sense of returning to baseline from a stimulated response.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3501690|year=1987|author1=Matikainen|first1=M|title=Endoscopic flushing electrocoagulation for upper gastrointestinal bleeding--an alternative to surgery|journal=Annales chirurgiae et gynaecologiae|volume=76|issue=4|pages=212–4|last2=Airo|first2=I}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work suggests that these baseline states are actually determined by long-term adaptation to the environment.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Varying rates or speed of adaptation is an important indicator for tracking different rates of change in the environment or the organism itself.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Current research shows that although adaptation occurs at multiple stages of each sensory pathway, it is often stronger and more stimulus specific at “cortical” level rather than “subcortical stages.” &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In short, neural adaptation is thought to happen at a more central level at the [[Cerebral Cortex|cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Michael|title=Evolving concepts of sensory adaptation|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|date=1 November 2012|volume=4|pages=21|doi=10.3410/B4-21|pmid=23189092|pmc=3501690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fast and slow adaptation ==
There is fast adaptation and slow adaptation. Fast adaptation occurs immediately after a stimulus is presented i.e., within hundreds of milliseconds. Slow adaptive processes can take minutes, hours or even days. The two classes of neural adaptation may rely on very different physiological mechanisms.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The time scale over which adaptation builds up and recovers depends on the time course of stimulation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Brief stimulation produces adaptation which occurs and recovers while more prolonged stimulation can produce slower and more lasting forms of adaptation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Also, repeated sensory stimulation appears to temporarily decrease the gain of thalamocortical synaptic transmission. Adaptation of cortical responses was stronger and recovered more slowly.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== History ==
In the late 1800s, [[Hermann Helmholtz]], a German physician and physicist, extensively researched conscious sensations and different types of perception . He defined sensations as the "raw elements" of conscious experience that required no learning, and perceptions as the meaningful interpretations derived from the senses. He studied the physical properties of the eye and vision, as well as acoustic sensation. In one of his classic experiments regarding how space perception could be altered by experience, participants wore glasses that distorted the [[visual field]] by several degrees to the right. Participants were asked to look at an object, close their eyes, and try to reach out and touch it. At first, the subjects reached for the object too far to the left, but after a few trials were able to correct themselves.

Helmholtz theorized that perceptual adaptation might result from a process he referred to as [[unconscious inference]], where the mind unconsciously adopts certain rules in order to make sense of what is perceived of the world. An example of this phenomenon is when a ball appears to be getting smaller and smaller, the mind will then infer that the ball is moving away from them.

In the 1890s, psychologist [[George M. Stratton]] conducted experiments in which he tested the theory of perceptual adaptation. In one experiment, he wore a reversing glasses for 21½ hours over three days. After removing the glasses, "normal vision was restored instantaneously and without any disturbance in the natural appearance or position of objects."&lt;ref name="Stratton1896"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1896|title=Some preliminary experiments on vision without inversion of the retinal image|url=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~nava/courses/psych_and_brain/pdfs/Stratton_1896.pdf|journal=Psychological Review|volume=3|issue=6|pages=611–7|doi=10.1037/h0072918|last1=Stratton|first1=George M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stratton glasses experiment (modern version).jpg|thumb|right|Modern version of inverting mirrors with harness.]]

On a later experiment, Stratton wore the glasses for eight whole days. By day four, the images seen through the instrument were still upside down. However, on day five, images appeared upright until he concentrated on them; then they became inverted again. By having to concentrate on his vision to turn it upside down again, especially when he knew images were hitting his [[retina]]s in the opposite orientation as normal, Stratton deduced his brain had adapted to the changes in vision.

Stratton also conducted experiments where he wore glasses that altered his [[visual field]] by 45°. His brain was able to adapt to the change and perceive the world as normal. Also, the field can be altered making the subject see the world upside down. But, as the brain adjusts to the change, the world appears "normal."&lt;ref name=Myers2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cullari1997&gt;{{cite web |last=Cullari |first=Salvatore |title=Re: Upside Down Glasses?  |publisher= [[MadSci Network]] |date=21 Mar 1997 |url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/mar97/858984531.Ns.r.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some extreme experiments, psychologists have tested to see if a pilot can fly a plane with altered vision. All of the pilots that were fitted with the goggles that altered their vision were able to safely navigate the aircraft with ease.&lt;ref name=Myers2008&gt;{{cite book |last=Myers |first=David G. |title=Exploring Psychology in Modules |edition=7th |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4292-0589-4}}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visual ==
Adaptation is considered to be the cause of perceptual phenomena like [[afterimage]]s and the motion aftereffect. In the absence of fixational eye movements, visual perception may fade out or disappear due to neural adaptation. (See [[Adaptation (eye)]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinez-Conde|first1=S|last2=Macknik|first2=SL|last3=Hubel|first3=DH|title=The role of fixational eye movements in visual perception.|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=March 2004|volume=5|issue=3|pages=229–40|pmid=14976522|url=http://neuralcorrelate.com/martinez-conde_et_al_nrn_2004.pdf|doi=10.1038/nrn1348|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716213332/http://neuralcorrelate.com/martinez-conde_et_al_nrn_2004.pdf|archivedate=2006-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an observer's visual stream adapts to a single direction of real motion, imagined motion can be perceived at various speeds. If the imagined motion is in the same direction as that experienced during adaptation, imagined speed is slowed; when imagined motion is in the opposite direction, its speed is increased; when adaptation and imagined motions are orthogonal, imagined speed is unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilden|first1=D|last2=Blake|first2=R|last3=Hurst|first3=G|title=Neural adaptation of imaginary visual motion.|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=February 1995|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1006/cogp.1995.1001|pmid=7895467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) have demonstrated that subjects exposed to a repeated visual stimulus at brief intervals become attenuated to the stimulus in comparison to the initial stimulus. The results revealed that visual responses to the repeated compared with novel stimulus showed a significant reduction in both activation strength and peak latency but not in the duration of neural processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noguchi|first1=Y|last2=Inui|first2=K|last3=Kakigi|first3=R|title=Temporal dynamics of neural adaptation effect in the human visual ventral stream.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=14 July 2004|volume=24|issue=28|pages=6283–90|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0655-04.2004|pmid=15254083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although motion and images are extremely important regarding adaptation, the most important adaptation is adjusting to brightness levels. On entering a dark room or a very brightly lit room it takes a little while to adjust to the different levels. Adjusting to brightness levels allows mammals to detect changes in their surrounding. This is called [[Adaptation (eye)#Dark adaptation|dark adaptation]].

== Auditory ==
Auditory adaptation, as perceptual adaptation with other senses, is the process by which individuals adapt to sounds and noises. As research has shown, as time progresses, individuals tend to adapt to sounds and tend to distinguish them less frequently after a while. Sensory adaptation tends to blend sounds into one, variable sound, rather than having several separate sounds as a series. Moreover, after repeated perception, individuals tend to adapt to sounds to the point where they no longer consciously perceive it, or rather, "block it out". An individual that lives close to the train tracks, will eventually stop noticing the sounds of passing trains. Similarly, individuals living in larger cities no longer notice traffic sounds after a while. Moving to a completely different area, such as a quiet countryside, that individual would then be aware of the silence, crickets, etc.&lt;ref name="Anstis1985"&gt;{{cite web |last=Anstis |first=Stuart |title=Re: Adaptation to auditory streaming of frequency-modulated tones  |publisher= [[PsycNET]] |date=3 June 1985 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xhp/11/3/257/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanoreception of sound requires a specific set of receptor cells called [[hair cell]]s that allow for gradient signals to pass onto spatial ganglia where the signal will be sent to the brain to be processed. Since this is mechanoreception, different from chemoreception, adaptation of sound from surroundings highly depends on the physical movement of opening and closing of cation channels on the hair cell stereocilia. Mechanoelectric transduction (MET) channels, located at the tops of stereocilia, are poised to detect tension induced by hair bundle deflection. Hair bundle deflection generates a force by pulling on [[tip link]] proteins connecting adjacent stereocilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26961949|pmc=4783497|year=2016|author1=Peng|first1=A. W.|title=Adaptation Independent Modulation of Auditory Hair Cell Mechanotransduction Channel Open Probability Implicates a Role for the Lipid Bilayer|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=36|issue=10|pages=2945–56|last2=Gnanasambandam|first2=R|last3=Sachs|first3=F|last4=Ricci|first4=A. J.|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3011-15.2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Olfactory ==
{{Main|Olfactory fatigue}}Perceptual adaptation is a phenomenon that occurs for all of the senses, including smell and touch. An individual can adapt to a certain smell with time. Smokers, or individuals living with smokers, tend to stop noticing the smell of cigarettes after some time, whereas people not exposed to smoke on a regular basis will notice the smell instantly. The same phenomenon can be observed with other types of smell, such as perfume, flowers, etc. The human brain can distinguish smells that are unfamiliar to the individual, while adapting to those it is used to and no longer require to be consciously recognized.

Olfactory neurons utilize a feedback system from the levels of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;ions to activate its adaptation to prolonged smells. Due to the fact that the olfactory signal transduction uses a second messenger transduction system, the [[Olfactory fatigue#mechanism|mechanism]] of adaptation includes several factors that mostly include CaMK or [[calmodulin]] bound to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;ions.

== Somatosensory ==
This phenomenon also applies to the sense of touch. An unfamiliar piece of clothing that was just put on will be noticed instantly; however, once it has been worn for a while, the mind will adapt to its texture and ignore the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Re: Sensory Adaptation: Definition, Examples &amp; Quiz  |publisher= [[Education Portal]] |url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/sensory-adaptation-definition-examples-quiz.html#lesson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pain ===
While large mechanosensory neurons such as type I/group Aß display adaptation, smaller type IV/group C nociceptive neurons do not. As a result, pain does not usually subside rapidly but persists for long periods of time; in contrast, other sensory information is quickly adapted to, if surroundings remain constant.

=== Weight training ===
Studies have shown that there is neural adaptation after as little as one weight training session. Strength gains are experienced by subjects without any increased muscle size. Muscle surface recordings using [[electromyography#Surface EMG versus intramuscular|electromyographic (SEMG)]] techniques have found that early strength gains throughout training are associated with increased amplitude in SEMG activity. These findings along with various other theories explain increases in strength without increases in muscle mass. Other theories for increases in strength relating to neural adaptation include: [[anatomical terms of muscle#Agonists and antagonists|agonist-antagonist]] muscle decreased co-activation, [[motor unit]] synchronization, and motor unit increased [[motor unit recruitment#Rate coding of muscle force|firing rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Kamen|first2=G|last3=Frost|first3=G|date=2006|title=Neural adaptations to resistive exercise: mechanisms and recommendations for training practices.|journal=Sports Medicine|volume=36|issue=2|pages=133–49|doi=10.2165/00007256-200636020-00004|pmid=16464122|last1=Gabriel|first1=DA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural adaptations contribute to changes in V-waves and [[Hoffmann's reflex]]. H-reflex can be used to assess the excitability of spinal [[alpha motor neuron|α-motoneurons]], whereas V-wave measures the magnitude of motor output from α-motoneurons. Studies showed that after a 14-week resistance training regime, subjects expressed V-wave amplitude increases of ~50% and H-reflex amplitude increases of ~20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Simonsen|first2=EB|last3=Andersen|first3=JL|last4=Magnusson|first4=P|last5=Dyhre-Poulsen|first5=P|date=June 2002|title=Neural adaptation to resistance training: changes in evoked V-wave and H-reflex responses.|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=92|issue=6|pages=2309–18|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01185.2001|pmid=12015341|last1=Aagaard|first1=P}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed that neural adaptation accounts for changes to functional properties of the spinal cord circuitry in humans without affecting organization of the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Riek|first2=S|last3=Carson|first3=RG|date=15 October 2002|title=The sites of neural adaptation induced by resistance training in humans.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=544|issue=Pt 2|pages=641–52|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2002.024463|pmc=2290590|pmid=12381833|last1=Carroll|first1=TJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Habituation vs adaptation ==
The terms neural adaptation and [[habituation]] are often confused for one another. Habituation is a behavioral phenomenon while neural adaptation is a physiological phenomenon, although the two are not entirely separate. During habituation, one has some conscious control over whether one notices something to which one is becoming habituated. However, when it comes to neural adaptation, one has no conscious control over it. For example, if one has adapted to something (like an odor or perfume), one can not consciously force himself to smell that thing. Neural adaptation is tied very closely to stimulus intensity; as the intensity of a light increases, one's senses will adapt more strongly to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert|title=Cognitive psychology|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning/Wadsworth|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|pages=137–138|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, habituation can vary depending on the stimulus. With a weak stimulus habituation can occur almost immediately but with a strong stimulus the animal may not habituate at all&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rakitin|first1=A|last2=Tomsic|first2=D|last3=Maldonado|first3=H|title=Habituation and sensitization to an electrical shock in the crab Chasmagnathus. Effect of background illumination.|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=September 1991|volume=50|issue=3|pages=477–87|pmid=1800998|doi=10.1016/0031-9384(91)90533-t}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. a cool breeze versus a fire alarm. Habituation also has a set of characteristics that must be met to be termed a habituation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=RF|last2=Spencer|first2=WA|title=Habituation: a model phenomenon for the study of neuronal substrates of behavior.|journal=Psychological Review|date=January 1966|volume=73|issue=1|pages=16–43|pmid=5324565|url=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/courses/perceptionGrad/Readings/ThompsonSpencer-PsychRev1966.pdf|doi=10.1037/h0022681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhythmic behaviors ==

=== Short-term adaptations ===
Short term neural adaptations occur in the body during [[rhythmic]] activities. One of the most common activities when these neural adaptations are constantly happening is walking.&lt;ref name="pmid10845109"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearson|first1=KG|title=Neural adaptation in the generation of rhythmic behavior.|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|date=2000|volume=62|pages=723–53|doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.62.1.723|pmid=10845109}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a person walks, the body constantly gathers information about the environment and the surroundings of the feet, and slightly adjusts the muscles in use according to the [[terrain]]. For example, walking uphill requires different muscles than walking on flat pavement. When the brain recognizes that the body is walking uphill, it makes neural adaptations that send more activity to muscles required for uphill walking.
The rate of neural adaptation is affected by the area of the brain and by the similarity between sizes and shapes of previous stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhoef|first1=BE|last2=Kayaert|first2=G|last3=Franko|first3=E|last4=Vangeneugden|first4=J|last5=Vogels|first5=R|title=Stimulus similarity-contingent neural adaptation can be time and cortical area dependent.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=15 October 2008|volume=28|issue=42|pages=10631–40|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3333-08.2008|pmid=18923039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations in the [[inferior temporal gyrus]] are very dependent on previous stimuli being of similar size, and somewhat dependent on previous stimuli being of a similar shape. Adaptations in the [[Prefrontal Cortex]] are less dependent on previous stimuli being of similar size and shape.

=== Long-term adaptations ===
Some rhythmic movements, such as respiratory movements, are essential for survival. Because these movements must be used over the course of the entire lifetime, it is important for them to function optimally. Neural adaptation has been observed in these movements in response to training or altered external conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid10845109" /&gt; Animals have been shown to have reduced breathing rates in response to better fitness levels. Since breathing rates were not conscious changes made by the animal, it is presumed that neural adaptations occur for the body to maintain a slower breathing rate.

== Transcranial magnetic stimulation ==
[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) is an important technique in modern [[cognitive neuropsychology]] that is used to investigate the perceptual and behavioral effects of temporary interference of neural processing. Studies have shown that when a subject’s visual cortex is disrupted by TMS, the subject views colorless flashes of light, or [[phosphenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvanto|first=Juha|author2=Muggleton, Neil G. |author3=Cowey, Alan |author4=Walsh, Vincent |title=Neural adaptation reveals state-dependent effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation|journal=Eur. J. Neurosci.|year=2007|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1874–1881|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05440.x|pmid=17408427}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a subjects’ vision was subjected to the constant stimulus of a single color, neural adaptations occurred that made the subjects used to the color. Once this adaptation had occurred, TMS was used to disrupt the subjects’ visual cortex again, and the flashes of light viewed by the subject were the same color as the constant stimulus before the disruption.

== Drug induced ==
Neural adaptation can occur for other than natural means. Antidepressant drugs, such as those that cause down regulation of β-[[adrenergic receptors]], can cause rapid neural adaptations in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duncan|first1=GE|last2=Paul|first2=IA|last3=Harden|first3=TK|last4=Mueller|first4=RA|last5=Stumpf|first5=WE|last6=Breese|first6=GR|title=Rapid down regulation of beta adrenergic receptors by combining antidepressant drugs with forced swim: a model of antidepressant-induced neural adaptation.|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=August 1985|volume=234|issue=2|pages=402–8|pmid=2991500}}&lt;/ref&gt; By creating a quick adaptation in the regulation of these receptors, it is possible for drugs to reduce the effects of stress on those taking the medication.

== Post-injury ==
Studies in children with early childhood brain injuries have shown that neural adaptations slowly occur after the injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stiles|first1=J|last2=Reilly|first2=J|last3=Paul|first3=B|last4=Moses|first4=P|title=Cognitive development following early brain injury: evidence for neural adaptation.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=March 2005|volume=9|issue=3|pages=136–43|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.01.002|pmid=15737822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with early injuries to the [[linguistics]], spatial cognition and [[affective]] development areas of the brain showed deficits in those areas as compared to those without injury. Due to neural adaptations, however, by early school-age, considerable development to those areas was observed.

{{Jainism}}
'''''Pratikramana''''' ({{lang-sa|प्रतिक्रमण}}; also spelled ''Pratikraman'') (lit. "introspection"), is a ritual during which [[Jainism|Jains]] repent (''prayaschit'') for their sins and non-meritorious activities committed knowingly or inadvertently during their daily life through thought, speech or action. 

Pratikramana also refers to a combition of six ''avashyaks'' (essential rituals), being ''[[Samayik]]'' (state of total equanimity), ''Chauvisantho'' (honoring the 24 [[Tirthankar]]s), ''Vandana'' – (offering salutations to [[Jain monks|''sadhus'' (monks) and ''sadhvis'' (nuns)]]), ''Pratikramana'' (introspection and repentance), ''[[Kayotsarga]]'' (meditation of the soul) and ''Pratyakhyan'' (renunciation).

Although frequency of repenting varies, devout Jains often practice Pratikraman at least twice a day. It is one of the 28 primary attributes (''mūla guņa'') of both [[Śvētāmbara]] and [[Digambara]] monks.

== Etymology ==
''Pratikramana'' is the combination of two words, ''Pra'' meaning "return" and
''atikramana'' meaning "violation". Literally, it means "returning from
violations".&lt;ref&gt;http://umich.edu/~umjains/jainismsimplified/chapter18.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of ''Pratikramana''==
There are five types of ''Pratikramana'':
#Devasi
#Rayi
#Pakhi
#Chaumasi
#[[Samvatsari]]

===''Devasi Pratikramana'' ===
''Devasi Pratikramana''' is performed daily in the evening.

=== ''Rayi Pratikramana'' ===
''Rayi Pratikramana'' is performed in the early morning.

===''Pakhi Pratikramana''===
''Pakhi Pratikramana'' is done once every fifteen days. 

===''Chaumasi Pratikramana''===
''Chaumasi Pratikramana'' is done once in four months on the [[Purnima (day)|Purnima]] (full moon) of the [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]], [[Falgun]] and [[Asharh|Aṣaṛh]] months of the [[Vira Nirvana Samvat]] calendrical year for the sins committed during that period.

=== ''Samvatsari Pratikramana''===
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}
[[Samvatsari]] Pratikraman is done once per year on the last day of [[Paryushana]] mahaparv for the [[sin]]s committed during the whole year.

Samvatsari Pratikraman includes all six things a ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]]'' (householders) must do:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~umjains/jainismsimplified/chapter18.html |title=Jainism Simplified Chapter 18 – Pratikraman |publisher=Umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Jainism considers the soul, in its pure form, to have infinite perception, knowledge, and vigor, and to be non-attached. These attributes are not seen in a worldly soul because it is soiled with karmas. By following religious principles principals and activities, Jains believe they overcome karmas and promote liberation of the soul. There are various rituals, of which Pratikraman is the most important. During pratikraman, Jains repent for non-meritorious activities on a daily basis.

''Pratikraman'' must be performed twice every day, or at least once every day after sunset. If that is not possible, at least on every Pakkhi (24 times in a year).

== Sāmāyika ==
{{Main|Samayik}}
''Pratikramana'' is also done while performing the ''sāmāyika'' (periodic concentration). In performing ''sāmāyika'', the ''śrāvaka'' has to stand facing north or east and bow to the ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]''.&lt;ref name=Householder/&gt; He then sit down and recites the [[Namokara mantra]] a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation. This consists in:&lt;ref name=Householder&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLAlAQAAIAAJ | title=The Householder's Dharma: English Translation of The Ratna Karanda Sravakachara | publisher=The Central Jaina Publishing House | date=1917 | author=Jain, Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|p=44–45, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''pratikramana'', recounting the sins committed and repenting for them,
#''pratyākhyanā'', resolving to avoid particular sins in future,
#''sāmāyika karma'', renunciation of personal attachments, and the cultivation of a feeling of regarding every body and thing alike,
#''stuti'', praising the four and twenty Tīrthankaras,
#''vandanā'', devotion to a particular Tīrthankaras, and
#''kāyotsarga'', withdrawal of attention from the body (physical personality) and becoming absorbed in the contemplation of the spiritual Self.

==Chauvisantho==
Chauvisantho, also called Chaturvinshatistava, means adoration of the twenty-four [[Tirthankara]]s. While reciting it, Jains show their respect for the Tirthankaras and are reminded of how victorious these [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jina]]s were, who overcame inner enemies like anger, ego, greed, deceit, etc. Chauvisantho encourages Jains to emulate [[Tirthankar]]s and strive to be like them.

==Pratyakhyan==
This is a formal renunciation of certain activities, which stops or reduces the inflow of karmas to a great extent. This activity helps us to learn to control our desires and prepares us for a much bigger renunciation.

In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of humanity''' states that when interpreting another speaker we must assume that his or her beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in The Intentional Stance, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of humanity was named by [[Richard Grandy]] (then an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]]) who first expressed it in 1973.

The '''quinarian system''' was a method of [[Taxonomy (biology)|zoological classification]] which was popular in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the [[Entomology|entomologist]] [[William Sharp Macleay]] in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|volume= 1|last=Macleay |first=W. S.|date=1819
|publisher=S. Bagster|place=London
|url=https://archive.org/details/horaeentomologic112macl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was further promoted in the works of [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]], [[William John Swainson]] and [[Johann Jakob Kaup]]. Swainson's work on [[ornithology]] gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), which paved the way for [[evolution]]ary trees.&lt;ref name=ohara&gt;{{cite book

==Classification approach==

[[Image:SwainsonQuinarian.jpg|thumb|Swainson's Quinarian structure of birds]]

Quinarianism gets its name from the emphasis on the number five: it proposed that all taxa are divisible into five subgroups, and if fewer than five subgroups were known, quinarians believed that a missing subgroup remained to be found.&lt;ref name=ohara/&gt;

[[Image:VigorsQuinarian.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]]'s Quinarian classification of birds. The missing entries represented groups that he expected remained to be discovered.]]

Presumably this arose as a chance observation of some accidental analogies between different groups, but it was erected into a guiding principle by the quinarians. It became increasingly elaborate, proposing that each group of five classes could be arranged in a circle, with those closer together having greater affinities. Typically they were depicted with relatively advanced groups at the top, and supposedly degenerate forms towards the bottom.

{{Rape}}
In 2004, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police in [[Belgium]] was 28.4 per 100,000 people, according to data by [[UNODC]]; in 2008 it was 29.5 per 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="unodc1"&gt;http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium has been reported as being one of the countries with the highest rate of [[rape]].&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"&gt;{{cite web|author=March 17, 2014 10:35 GMT |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/belgium-sexual-harassment-punished-imprisonment-under-new-law-1440582 |title=Belgium: Sexual Harassment Punished With Imprisonment Under New Law |publisher=Ibtimes.co.uk |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

Rape in Belgium is defined by Article 375 of the Penal Code as "any act of sexual penetration, of whatever sort and by whatever means, committed on a non-consenting person".&lt;ref name="unwomen1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10080&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=213 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318212005/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10080&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=213 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-18 |title=The Secretary Generals database on violence against women |publisher=Sgdatabase.unwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/loi_a1.pl?DETAIL=1867060801%2FF&amp;caller=list&amp;row_id=1&amp;numero=2&amp;rech=4&amp;cn=1867060801&amp;table_name=LOI&amp;nm=1867060850&amp;la=F&amp;dt=CODE+PENAL&amp;language=fr&amp;fr=f&amp;choix1=ET&amp;choix2=ET&amp;fromtab=loi_all&amp;trier=promulgation&amp;chercher=t&amp;sql=dt+contains++%27CODE%27%26+%27PENAL%27and+actif+%3D+%27Y%27&amp;tri=dd+AS+RANK+&amp;imgcn.x=41&amp;imgcn.y=12 |title=Loi - Wet |publisher=Ejustice.just.fgov.be |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marital rape is also illegal under this law.&lt;ref name="unwomen1"/&gt;

Apart from criminal proceedings, committing marital rape has also consequences in a [[divorce]] case. The new amendments to the Civil Code regulating marriage and divorce, that came into effect in September 2007, state that any of the spouses, following a divorce, may receive [[alimony]] if they need the money, but a spouse who has committed rape or other violent crimes against the other spouse cannot receive alimony. Article 301 reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;The court may refuse to grant the application for a alimony if the defendant proves that the applicant has committed a serious offense that rendered it impossible to continue living together. Under no circumstances will alimony be given to a spouse who was found guilty of an act referred to in '''Articles 375''', 398-400, 402, 403 or 405 of the Penal Code, committed against the person of the defendant, or an attempt to commit an act referred to in '''Articles 375''', 393, 394 or 397 of the Code against the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Text in French: "Le tribunal peut refuser de faire droit à la demande de pension si le défendeur prouve que le demandeur a commis une faute grave ayant rendu impossible la poursuite de la vie commune. En aucun cas, la pension alimentaire n'est accordée au conjoint reconnu coupable d'un fait visé aux articles 375, 398 à 400, 402, 403 ou 405 du Code pénal, commis contre la personne du défendeur, ou d'une tentative de commettre un fait visé aux articles 375, 393, 394 ou 397 du même Code contre cette même personne."[http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/loi_a1.pl?DETAIL=1804032130%2FF&amp;caller=list&amp;row_id=1&amp;numero=11&amp;rech=14&amp;cn=1804032130&amp;table_name=LOI&amp;nm=1804032150&amp;la=F&amp;dt=CODE+CIVIL&amp;language=fr&amp;fr=f&amp;choix1=ET&amp;choix2=ET&amp;fromtab=loi_all&amp;trier=promulgation&amp;chercher=t&amp;sql=dt+contains++%27CODE%27%26+%27CIVIL%27and+actif+%3D+%27Y%27&amp;tri=dd+AS+RANK+&amp;imgcn.x=34&amp;imgcn.y=10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Prevalence==

In 2011, Belgian Institute for the Equality of Women and Men published a report on "Women and men in Belgium", which noted that in 2008, according to police report, 87% of victims of rape (89% for collective rape) were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womenlobby.org/spip.php?action=acceder_document&amp;arg=3144&amp;cle=008f9546f38740223b896ddf3b19887af14efb64&amp;file=pdf%2F2714_belgium_lr.pdf |format=PDF |title=NATIONAL ANALYSIS Belgium |publisher=womenlobby.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey, carried out by Belgian Institute and titled ''Experience of men and women in gender based violence'', included the following figures;

{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Relation || Women || Men || Total
|-
|Partner||30.8%||5.7%||17.5%
|-
|Family||27.4%||16.2%||21.5%
|-
|Acquaintance||11.3%||15.8%||13.6%
|-
|Work||17.2%||21.9%||19.7%
|-
|Unknown||13.3%||40.4%||27.7%
|}

According to ''[[De Morgen]]'', from 2009 and 2011 the number of reported rape cases increased from 3,360 to 4,038, an increase of more than 20 percent.&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"/&gt;

According to a report by ''[[De Standaard]]'', the sentences for rape is considerably lower than it is usually expected. For example, a person who had raped his 13-year-old stepdaughter was sentenced to 2.5 years. In another case, the criminal was sentenced to two years for repeated rape of two girls younger than 15; one of the victims was pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Practical Ethics |url=http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2011/05/belgium-where-rapists-and-muffin-thieves-are-treated-alike/ |title=Belgium: where rapists and muffin thieves are treated alike &amp;#124; Practical Ethics |publisher=Blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk |date=2011-05-13 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SCAMPER''' is an acronym that provides a structured way of assisting students to [[Thinking outside the box|think out of the box]] and enhance their [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Michalko2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael |last=Michalko|title=Thinkertoys: A Handbook of Creative-Thinking Techniques|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=y7O_6v1c52wC}}|date=1 December 2010|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|isbn=978-0-307-75790-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought to protect students' [[creativity]] as they mature.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Elberle, Developing Imagination Through Scamper&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

SCAMPER was proposed by [[Alex Faickney Osborn]] in 1953, and was further developed by Bob Eberle in 1971 in his book; ''SCAMPER:  Games for Imagination Development''.&lt;ref name="Eberle1996"&gt;{{cite book|first=Bob |last=Eberle|title=Scamper: Games for Imagination Development|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0Gmx_jr64RMC}}|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Prufrock Press Inc.|isbn=978-1-882664-24-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

SCAMPER is an activity based thinking process that can be performed by [[Cooperative learning]]. Here the [[teacher]] assists the students in choosing a particular topic and helps them to develop it through a structured process. After choosing an idea, the students are given a tale where they perform the activity in steps corresponding to the letters in the name.

* ''Substitute'' comes up with another topic that is equivalent to the present topic. 
* ''Combine'' adds information to the original topic. 
* ''Adjust'' identifies ways to construct the topic in a more flexible and adjusted material. 
* ''Modify'' creatively changes the topic. 
* ''Put to other uses'' identifies the possible scenarios and situations where this topic can be used. 
* ''Eliminate'' removes ideas or elements from the topic that are not valuable. 
* ''Reverse, rearrange'' evolves a new concept from the original concept.

Hence, SCAMPER as a teaching strategy helps the students to analyse the knowledge in its creative form and helps the teacher to make teaching creative and interesting.

SCAMPER also provides a ‘hip-pocket’ tool; i.e., an unplanned method of developing questions on an impromptu basis designed to challenge meeting participants' [[creativity]] and to make their thinking visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mgrush.com/blog/2013/05/02/scamper/#!/home|title=SCAMPER is a Mnemonic Prompt for Excellent Impromptu Questions Dashboard|date=2 May 2013|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BookDurrowChiRoPage.jpg|thumb|A page from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] from the [[Book of Durrow]], 7th century]]

'''Salt and light''' are images used by [[Jesus]] in the [[Sermon on the Mount]], one of the main teachings of Jesus on morality and discipleship.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation'' by Carl G. Vaught, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-918954-76-3}}, pages xi–xiv&lt;/ref&gt; These images in [[Matthew 5:13]], [[Matthew_5:14|14]], [[Matthew_5:16|15 and 16]] immediately follow the [[Beatitudes]] and are often interpreted as referring to Jesus' expectations of his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]].&lt;ref name=Talbert75 &gt;''Matthew'' by Charles H. Talbert, 2010, {{ISBN|0-8010-3192-3}}, pages 75–79&lt;/ref&gt; 

The general theme of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:13|Matthew 5:13–16]] is promises and expectations, and these expectations follow the promises of the first part.&lt;ref name=Talbert75 /&gt;

The first verse of this passage introduces the phrase "salt of the earth":
&lt;blockquote&gt;You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The later verses refer to not hiding a [[lamp under a bushel]], which also occurs in {{bibleverse||Luke|8:16–18|NKJV}} and the phrase "[[Light of the World]]", which also appears in {{bibleverse|John|8:12|NKJV}}.
&lt;blockquote&gt;You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Émile Durkheim]], who wrote about the importance of studying patterns of relationships that connect social actors. Social scientists have used the concept of "[[social networks]]" since early in the 20th century to connote complex sets of relationships between members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. In the 1930s [[Jacob Moreno]] and [[Helen Hall Jennings|Helen Jennings]] introduced basic analytical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Freeman, L. C. |year=2004 |title= The development of social network analysis: a study in the sociology of science |publicationplace=Vancouver, B. C. |publisher=Empirical Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, [[John Arundel Barnes]] started using the term systematically to denote patterns of ties, encompassing concepts traditionally used by the public and those used by social scientists: bounded [[Group (sociology)|groups]] (e.g., tribes, families) and social [[Categorization|categories]] (e.g., gender, ethnicity). Scholars such as [[Ronald Burt]], [[Kathleen Carley]], [[Mark Granovetter]], [[David Krackhardt]], [[Edward Laumann]], [[Anatol Rapoport#Social network analysis|Anatol Rapoport]], [[Barry Wellman]], [[Douglas R. White]], and [[Harrison White]] expanded the use of systematic social network analysis.&lt;ref name="development"/&gt; Even in the study of literature, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anheier | first1 = H.K. | last2 = Gerhards | first2 = J. | last3 = Romo | first3 = F.P. | year = 1995 | title = Forms of capital and social structure of fields: examining Bourdieu's social topography | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 859–903 | doi=10.1086/230603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wouter De Nooy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Nooy | first1 = W | year = 2003 | title = Fields and networks: Correspondence analysis and social network analysis in the framework of Field Theory | url = | journal = Poetics | volume = 31 | issue = 5–6| pages = 305–27 | doi=10.1016/s0304-422x(03)00035-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Burgert Senekal.&lt;ref&gt;Senekal, B.

==Metrics==
[[File:Graph betweenness.svg|right|thumb|Hue (from red=0 to blue=max) indicates each node's [[betweenness centrality]].]]

===Connections===
[[Homophily]]: The extent to which actors form ties with similar versus dissimilar others. Similarity can be defined by gender, race, age, occupation, educational achievement, status, values or any other salient characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McPherson, N.|author2=Smith-Lovin, L.|author3=Cook, J.M. |year=2001 |title=Birds of a feather: Homophily in social networks |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=27 |pages=415–444 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homophily is also referred to as [[assortativity]].

Multiplexity: The number of content-forms contained in a tie.&lt;ref name = "Podo97"/&gt; For example, two people who are friends and also work together would have a multiplexity of 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kilduff, M.|author2=Tsai, W. |year=2003 |title= Social networks and organisations |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiplexity has been associated with relationship strength.

Mutuality/Reciprocity: The extent to which two actors reciprocate each other's friendship or other interaction.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt;

[[Triadic closure|Network Closure]]: A measure of the completeness of relational triads. An individual's assumption of network closure (i.e. that their friends are also friends) is called transitivity. Transitivity is an outcome of the individual or situational trait of [[Closure (psychology)|Need for Cognitive Closure]].&lt;ref name="Flyn10"/&gt;

[[Propinquity]]: The tendency for actors to have more ties with geographically close others.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt;

===Distributions===
[[Bridge (graph theory)|Bridge]]: An individual whose weak ties fill a [[Structural holes|structural hole]], providing the only link between two individuals or clusters. It also includes the shortest route when a longer one is unfeasible due to a high risk of message distortion or delivery failure.&lt;ref name="Granovetter, M. 1973 1360–1380"&gt;{{cite book | author=Granovetter, M. |year=1973 |title= The strength of weak ties |journal= American Journal of Sociology |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages= 1360–1380 |doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Centrality]]: Centrality refers to a group of metrics that aim to quantify the "importance" or "influence" (in a variety of senses) of a particular node (or group) within a network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hansen, Derek|title=Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|year=2010|isbn=978-0-12-382229-1|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbxPm93PRY8C&amp;pg=PA32|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liu, Bing|title=Web Data Mining: Exploring Hyperlinks, Contents, and Usage Data|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-3-642-19459-7|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnCi0Cq1YVkC&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanneman, Robert A.|author2=Riddle, Mark|lastauthoramp=y|chapter=Concepts and Measures for Basic Network Analysis|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|pages=364–367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tsvetovat, Maksim |author2=Kouznetsov, Alexander|lastauthoramp=y|title=Social Network Analysis for Startups: Finding Connections on the Social Web|publisher=O'Reilly|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4493-1762-1|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVOxjkoLSiEC&amp;pg=PA45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of common methods of measuring "centrality" include [[betweenness centrality]],&lt;ref name="comprehensive"/&gt; [[closeness centrality]], [[eigenvector centrality]], [[alpha centrality]], and [[degree centrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Opsahl | first1 = Tore | last2 = Agneessens | first2 = Filip | last3 = Skvoretz | first3 = John | title = Node centrality in weighted networks: Generalizing degree and shortest paths | doi = 10.1016/j.socnet.2010.03.006 | year = 2010 | pages = 245–251 | volume = 32 | journal = Social Networks | url=http://toreopsahl.com/2010/04/21/article-node-centrality-in-weighted-networks-generalizing-degree-and-shortest-paths/ | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dense graph|Density]]: The proportion of direct ties in a network relative to the total number possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Social Network Analysis|title=Field Manual 3-24: Counterinsurgency|publisher=Headquarters, [[Department of the Army]]|pages=B–11 – B–12|url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Xu, Guandong |title=Web Mining and Social Networking: Techniques and Applications|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4419-7734-2|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXo9zKeYa6cC&amp;pg=PA25|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance: The minimum number of ties required to connect two particular actors, as popularized by [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[small world experiment]] and the idea of 'six degrees of separation'.

Structural holes: The absence of ties between two parts of a network.  Finding and exploiting a structural hole can give an [[entrepreneur]] a competitive advantage.  This concept was developed by sociologist [[Ronald Stuart Burt|Ronald Burt]], and is sometimes referred to as an alternate conception of social capital.

Tie Strength: Defined by the linear combination of time, emotional intensity, intimacy and reciprocity (i.e. mutuality).&lt;ref name="Granovetter, M. 1973 1360–1380"/&gt; Strong ties are associated with homophily, propinquity and transitivity, while weak ties are associated with bridges.

===Segmentation===
Groups are identified as '[[clique]]s' if every individual is directly tied to every other individual, '[[social circle]]s' if there is less stringency of direct contact, which is imprecise, or as [[Structural cohesion|structurally cohesive]] blocks if precision is wanted.&lt;ref name="uci"/&gt;

[[Clustering coefficient]]: A measure of the likelihood that two associates of a node are associates. A higher clustering coefficient indicates a greater 'cliquishness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanneman, Robert A.|author2=Riddle, Mark|lastauthoramp=y|chapter=Concepts and Measures for Basic Network Analysis|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|pages=346–347|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohesion: The degree to which actors are connected directly to each other by [[Social cohesion|cohesive bonds]]. [[Structural cohesion]] refers to the minimum number of members who, if removed from a group, would disconnect the group.&lt;ref name="asanet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pattillo, Jeffrey|chapter=Clique relaxation models in social network analysis|editor1=Thai, My T.|editor2=Pardalos, Panos M.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Handbook of Optimization in Complex Networks: Communication and Social Networks|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4614-0856-7|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdRdcHxQQLQC&amp;pg=PA149|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modelling and visualization of networks==
Visual representation of social networks is important to understand the network data and convey the result of the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume1/Freeman.html|author=Linton C. Freeman|title=Visualizing Social Networks|journal=Journal of Social Structure|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous methods of visualization for data produced by social network analysis have been presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamdaqa|first=Mohammad |author2=Tahvildari, Ladan |author3=LaChapelle, Neil |author4=Campbell, Brian|title=Cultural Scene Detection Using Reverse Louvain Optimization|journal=Science of Computer Programming|date=2014|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642314000124|doi=10.1016/j.scico.2014.01.006|volume=95|pages=44–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Bacher, R.|year=1995|title=Graphical Interaction and Visualization for the Analysis and Interpretation of Contingency Analysis Result|conference=Proceedings of the 1995 Power Industry Computer Applications|pages=128–134|location=Salt Lake City, USA|publisher=IEEE Power Engineering Society|doi=10.1109/PICA.1995.515175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caschera | first1 = M.

Exploration of the data is done through displaying nodes and ties in various layouts, and attributing colors, size and other advanced properties to nodes. Visual representations of networks may be a powerful method for conveying complex information, but care should be taken in interpreting node and graph properties from visual displays alone, as they may misrepresent structural properties better captured through quantitative analyses.&lt;ref name="interpreting"/&gt;

[[Signed graph]]s can be used to illustrate good and bad relationships between humans. A positive edge between two nodes denotes a positive relationship (friendship, alliance, dating) and a negative edge between two nodes denotes a negative relationship (hatred, anger). Signed social network graphs can be used to predict the future evolution of the graph. In signed social networks, there is the concept of "balanced" and "unbalanced" cycles. A balanced cycle is defined as a [[Cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] where the product of all the signs are positive. According to [[balance theory]], balanced graphs represent a group of people who are unlikely to change their opinions of the other people in the group. Unbalanced graphs represent a group of people who are very likely to change their opinions of the people in their group. For example, a group of 3 people (A, B, and C) where A and B have a positive relationship, B and C have a positive relationship, but C and A have a negative relationship is an unbalanced cycle. This group is very likely to morph into a balanced cycle, such as one where B only has a good relationship with A, and both A and B have a negative relationship with C. By using the concept of balanced and unbalanced cycles, the evolution of signed [[social network graph]]s can be predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cartwright, D. |author2=[[Frank Harary]]|year=1956|url=http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/cartwright56balance.pdf|title=Structural balance: a generalization of Heider's theory|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=63|issue=5|pages=277–293|doi=10.1037/h0046049}} Link from [[Stanford University]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially when using social network analysis as a tool for facilitating change, different approaches of participatory network mapping have proven useful. Here participants / interviewers provide network data by actually mapping out the network (with pen and paper or digitally) during the data collection session. An example of a pen-and-paper network mapping approach, which also includes the collection of some actor attributes (perceived influence and goals of actors) is the * [[Net-map toolbox]]. One benefit of this approach is that it allows researchers to collect qualitative data and ask clarifying questions while the network data is collected.&lt;ref name="visualizing"/&gt;

===Social networking potential===
{{Cleanup|section|reason=More careful cleanup after merge required|date=December 2015}}
Social networking potential (SNP) is a numeric [[coefficient]], derived through [[algorithm]]s&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Anger, I., &amp; Kittl, C. (2011, September). Measuring influence on Twitter. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Knowledge Technologies (p. 31). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riquelme, F., &amp; González-Cantergiani, P. (2016). Measuring user influence on Twitter: A survey. Information Processing &amp; Management. 52, p. 949-975.&lt;/ref&gt; to represent both the size of an individual's [[social network]] and their ability to influence that network. A close synonym is the [[Social marketing intelligence#Alpha users|Alpha User]], a person with a high SNP.

SNP coefficients have two primary functions:
#the [[categorization|classification]] of individuals based on their social networking potential, and
#the weighting of [[wikt:respondent|respondents]] in quantitative [[marketing research]] studies.

By calculating the SNP of respondents and by [[Behavioral targeting|targeting]] High SNP respondents, the [[Persuasion|strength]] and [[relevance]] of quantitative marketing research used to drive [[viral marketing]] strategies is enhanced.

[[Variable (research)|Variables]] used to calculate an individual's SNP include but are not limited to: participation in Social Networking activities, group memberships, leadership roles, recognition, publication/editing/contributing to non-electronic media, publication/editing/contributing to electronic media (websites, blogs), and frequency of past distribution of information within their network. The acronym "SNP" and some of the first algorithms developed to quantify an individual's social networking potential were described in the white paper "Advertising Research is Changing" (Gerstley, 2003) See [[Viral Marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(Hrsg.)|first1=Sara Rosengren|title=The Changing Roles of Advertising|date=2013|publisher=Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783658023645|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783658023645|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book&lt;ref&gt;Ahonen, T. T., Kasper, T., &amp; Melkko, S. (2005). 3G marketing: communities and strategic partnerships. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss the commercial use of Alpha Users among mobile telecoms audiences was 3G Marketing by Ahonen, Kasper and Melkko in 2004. The first book to discuss Alpha Users more generally in the context of [[social marketing intelligence]] was Communities Dominate Brands by Ahonen &amp; Moore in 2005. In 2012, Nicola Greco ([[University College London|UCL]]) presents at [[TEDx]] the Social Networking Potential as a parallelism to the [[potential energy]] that users generate and companies should use, stating that "SNP is the new asset that every company should aim to have".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxMilano-Nicola-Greco-on-math;search%3Atag%3A"technology"|title=Watch "TEDxMilano - Nicola Greco - on math and social network" Video at TEDxTalks|work=TEDxTalks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical applications==
{{see also|Social network analysis (criminology)}}
Social network analysis is used extensively in a wide range of applications and disciplines.  Some common network analysis applications include data aggregation and [[data mining|mining]], network propagation modeling, network modeling and sampling, user attribute and behavior analysis, community-maintained resource support, location-based interaction analysis, [[social sharing]] and filtering, [[recommender system]]s development, and [[link prediction]] and entity resolution.&lt;ref name="Golbeck" /&gt; In the private sector, businesses use social network analysis to support activities such as customer interaction and analysis, [[information system]] development analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aram|first1=Michael|last2=Neumann|first2=Gustaf|title=Multilayered analysis of co-development of business information systems|journal=Journal of Internet Services and Applications|date=2015-07-01|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13174-015-0030-8|url=http://www.jisajournal.com/content/pdf/s13174-015-0030-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketing, and [[business intelligence]] needs (see [[social media analytics]]).  Some public sector uses include development of leader engagement strategies, analysis of individual and group engagement and [[media use]], and [[Collaborative problem-solving group|community-based problem solving]].

=== Security applications ===
Social network analysis is also used in intelligence, [[counter-intelligence]] and [[law enforcement]] activities. This technique allows the analysts to map a clandestine or covert organization such as a [[espionage]] ring, an organized crime family or a street gang. The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) uses its [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] [[mass surveillance|mass]] [[computer surveillance|electronic surveillance]] programs to generate the data needed to perform this type of analysis on terrorist cells and other networks deemed relevant to national security. The NSA looks up to three nodes deep during this network analysis.&lt;ref name="nsa_degrees"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/17/nsa-surveillance-house-hearing|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=19 July 2013|title=NSA warned to rein in surveillance as agency reveals even greater scope}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial mapping of the social network is complete, analysis is performed to determine the structure of the network and determine, for example, the leaders within the network.&lt;ref name="nsa_how"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltonto.com/2013/how-the-nsa-uses-social-network-analysis-to-map-terrorist-networks/|date=12 June 2013|accessdate=19 Jul 2013|title=How The NSA Uses Social Network Analysis To Map Terrorist Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows military or law enforcement assets to launch capture-or-kill [[decapitation attack]]s on the [[high-value targets]] in leadership positions to disrupt the functioning of the network.
The NSA has been performing social network analysis on [[call detail record]]s (CDRs), also known as [[metadata]], since shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="NSA_SNA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/05/70888|title=NSA Using Social Network Analysis|date=12 May 2006|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsa_usa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/05/how_the_nsa_does_social_network_analysis.html|date=11 May 2006|accessdate=19 July 2013|title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textual analysis applications ===
Large textual corpora can be turned into networks and then analysed with the method of social network analysis. In these networks, the nodes are Social Actors, and the links are Actions. The extraction of these networks can be automated, by using parsers. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sudhahar S, De Fazio G, Franzosi R, Cristianini N|year=2013|title=Network analysis of narrative content in large corpora|journal=Natural Language Engineering|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–32|doi=10.1017/S1351324913000247}}&lt;/ref&gt; This automates the approach introduced by Quantitative Narrative Analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Quantitative Narrative Analysis; Roberto Franzosi; Emory University © 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== Internet applications ===
Social network analysis has also been applied to understanding online behavior by individuals, organizations, and between websites. [[Hyperlink]] analysis can be used to analyze the connections between [[website]]s or [[Web page|webpages]] to examine how information flows as individuals navigate the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OSTERBUR|first=MEGAN|last2=KIEL|first2=CHRISTINA|date=2016-05-02|title=A hegemon fighting for equal rights: the dominant role of COC Nederland in the LGBT transnational advocacy network|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/glob.12126|journal=Global Networks|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=234–254|doi=10.1111/glob.12126|issn=1470-2266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between organizations has been analyzed via hyperlink analysis to examine which organizations within an issue community.&lt;ref&gt;Osterbur, Megan E. and Christina Kiel.

==== Social Media Internet Applications ====
Social network analysis has been applied to social media as a tool to understand behavior between individuals or organizations through their linkages on social media websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwak|first=Haewoon|last2=Lee|first2=Changhyun|last3=Park|first3=Hosung|last4=Moon|first4=Sue|date=2010-04-26|title=What is Twitter, a social network or a news media?|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1772690.1772751|publisher=ACM|pages=591–600|doi=10.1145/1772690.1772751|isbn=9781605587998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer-supported collaborative learning===
One of the most current methods of the application of SNA is to the study of [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL). When applied to CSCL, SNA is used to help understand how learners collaborate in terms of amount, frequency, and length, as well as the quality, topic, and strategies of communication.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laat|first=Maarten de|last2=Lally|first2=Vic|last3=Lipponen|first3=Lasse|last4=Simons|first4=Robert-Jan|date=2007-03-08|title=Investigating patterns of interaction in networked learning and computer-supported collaborative learning: A role for Social Network Analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11412-007-9006-4|journal=International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=87–103|doi=10.1007/s11412-007-9006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, SNA can focus on specific aspects of the network connection, or the entire network as a whole. It uses graphical representations, written representations, and data representations to help examine the connections within a CSCL network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When applying SNA to a CSCL environment the interactions of the participants are treated as a social network. The focus of the analysis is on the "connections" made among the participants – how they interact and communicate – as opposed to how each participant behaved on his or her own.

====Key terms====
There are several key terms associated with social network analysis research in computer-supported collaborative learning such as: '''density''', '''centrality''', '''indegree''', '''outdegree''', and '''sociogram'''.

* '''Density''' refers to the "connections" between participants.  Density is defined as the number of connections a participant has, divided by the total possible connections a participant could have.  For example, if there are 20 people participating, each person could potentially connect to 19 other people. A density of 100% (19/19) is the greatest density in the system.  A density of 5% indicates there is only 1 of 19 possible connections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Centrality''' focuses on the behavior of individual participants within a network.  It measures the extent to which an individual interacts with other individuals in the network.  The more an individual connects to others in a network, the greater their centrality in the network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In-degree and out-degree variables are related to centrality.

* '''In-degree''' centrality concentrates on a specific individual as the point of focus; centrality of all other individuals is based on their relation to the focal point of the "in-degree" individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Out-degree''' is a measure of centrality that still focuses on a single individual, but the analytic is concerned with the out-going interactions of the individual; the measure of out-degree centrality is how many times the focus point individual interacts with others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* A '''sociogram''' is a visualization with defined boundaries of connections in the network. For example, a sociogram which shows out-degree centrality points for Participant A would illustrate all outgoing connections Participant A made in the studied network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Unique capabilities====
Researchers employ social network analysis in the study of computer-supported collaborative learning in part due to the unique capabilities it offers. This particular method allows the study of interaction patterns within a [[Networked learning|networked learning community]] and can help illustrate the extent of the participants' interactions with the other members of the group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The graphics created using SNA tools provide visualizations of the connections among participants and the strategies used to communicate within the group. Some authors also suggest that SNA provides a method of easily analyzing changes in participatory patterns of members over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Palonen, T.|author2= Hakkarainen, K. B.|lastauthoramp=y|editor1=Fishman|editor2=S. O'Connor-Divelbiss|title=Patterns of Interaction in Computer-Supported Learning: A Social Network Analysis|conference=Fourth International Conference of the Learning Sciences|location=Mahwah, NJ|publisher=Erlbaum|pp=334–339|url=http://www.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Palonen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of research studies have applied SNA to CSCL across a variety of contexts. The findings include the correlation between a network's density and the teacher's presence,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a greater regard for the recommendations of "central" participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martı́nez|first=A.|last2=Dimitriadis|first2=Y.|last3=Rubia|first3=B.|last4=Gómez|first4=E.|last5=de la Fuente|first5=P.|date=2003-12-01|title=Combining qualitative evaluation and social network analysis for the study of classroom social interactions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131503000824|journal=Computers &amp; Education|series=Documenting Collaborative Interactions: Issues and Approaches|volume=41|issue=4|pages=353–368|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2003.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; infrequency of cross-gender interaction in a network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Cho, H.|author2=Stefanone, M.|author3=Gay, G|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|title=Social information sharing in a CSCL community|conference=Computer support for collaborative learning: Foundations for a CSCL community|location=Hillsdale, NJ|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|pages=43–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relatively small role played by an instructor in an [[asynchronous learning]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Aviv, R.|author2=Erlich, Z.|author3=Ravid, G.|author4=Geva, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Network analysis of knowledge construction in asynchronous learning networks|journal=Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks|volume=7|issue=3|pp=1–23|citeseerx=10.1.1.2.9044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other methods used alongside SNA====
Although many studies have demonstrated the value of social network analysis within the computer-supported collaborative learning field,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; researchers have suggested that SNA by itself is not enough for achieving a full understanding of CSCL. The complexity of the interaction processes and the myriad sources of data make it difficult for SNA to provide an in-depth analysis of CSCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30112-7_25|title=Groupware: Design, Implementation, and Use|last=Daradoumis|first=Thanasis|last2=Martínez-Monés|first2=Alejandra|last3=Xhafa|first3=Fatos|date=2004-09-05|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540230168|editor-last=Vreede|editor-first=Gert-Jan de|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=289–304|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-30112-7_25|editor-last2=Guerrero|editor-first2=Luis A.|editor-last3=Raventós|editor-first3=Gabriela Marín}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers indicate that SNA needs to be complemented with other methods of analysis to form a more accurate picture of collaborative learning experiences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

A number of research studies have combined other types of analysis with SNA in the study of CSCL. This can be referred to as a multi-method approach or data [[Triangulation (social science)|triangulation]], which will lead to an increase of evaluation [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] in CSCL studies.

* Qualitative method – The principles of qualitative case study research constitute a solid framework for the integration of SNA methods in the study of CSCL experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Karen E.|date=1996-01-01|title=Review of The Art of Case Study Research|jstor=329758|journal=The Modern Language Journal|volume=80|issue=4|pages=556–557|doi=10.2307/329758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''state diagram''' is a type of [[diagram]] used in [[computer science]] and related fields to describe the behavior of systems. State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of [[state (computer science)|state]]s; sometimes, this is indeed the case, while at other times this is a reasonable [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]]. Many forms of state diagrams exist, which differ slightly and have different [[Semantics#Computer science|semantics]].

== Overview ==
State diagrams are used to give an abstract description of the [[behavior]] of a [[system]]. This behavior is analyzed and represented as a series of events that can occur in one or more possible states. Hereby "each diagram usually represents objects of a single class and track the different states of its objects through the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://atlas.kennesaw.edu/~dbraun/csis4650/A&amp;D/UML_tutorial/state.htm |date=* }}&lt;/ref&gt;

State diagrams can be used to graphically represent [[finite state machine]]s. This was introduced by [[C.E. Shannon]] and [[W. Weaver]] in their 1949 book "The Mathematical Theory of Communication". Another source is [[Taylor Booth]] in his 1967 book "Sequential Machines and Automata Theory". Another possible representation is the [[State transition table]].

== Directed graph ==

[[Image:Directed.svg|125px|thumb|A [[directed graph]]]]

A classic form of state diagram for a [[finite state machine]] or [[finite automaton]] (FA) is a [[directed graph]] with the following elements (Q,Σ,Z,δ,q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,F):&lt;ref name=Boo67&gt;[[Taylor Booth]] (1967) ''Sequential Machines and Automata Theory'', John Wiley and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HoU79&gt;[[John Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] (1979) ''[[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]]'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading Mass, {{ISBN|0-201-02988-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Vertices Q''': a finite set of states, normally represented by circles and labeled with unique designator symbols or words written inside them
*'''Input symbols Σ''': a finite collection of input symbols or designators
*'''Output symbols Z''': a finite collection of output symbols or designators

The output function ω represents the mapping of ordered pairs of input symbols and states onto output symbols, denoted mathematically as '''ω''' : '''Σ''' × '''Q'''→ '''Z'''.

*'''Edges δ''': represent transitions from one state to another as caused by the input (identified by their symbols drawn on the edges). An edge is usually drawn as an arrow directed from the present state to the next state. This mapping describes the state transition that is to occur on input of a particular symbol. This is written mathematically as '''δ''' : '''Q''' × '''Σ''' →   '''Q''', so δ (the transition function) in the definition of the FA is given by both the pair of vertices connected by an edge and the symbol on an edge in a diagram representing this FA. Item '''δ(q,a)= p''' in the definition of the FA means that from the state named '''q'''  under input symbol '''a''', the transition to the state '''p''' occurs in this machine. In the diagram representing this FA, this is represented by an edge labeled by '''a''' pointing from the vertex labeled by '''q''' to the vertex labeled by '''p'''.
*'''Start state q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''': (not shown in the examples below). The start state q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ Q is usually represented by an arrow with no origin pointing to the state. In older texts,&lt;ref name=Boo67/&gt;&lt;ref name=McC65&gt;[[Edward J. McClusky]], Introduction to the Theory of Switching Circuits, McGraw-Hill, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; the start state is not shown and must be inferred from the text.
*'''Accepting state(s) F''': If used, for example for accepting automata, F ∈ Q is the [[accept state|accepting state]]. It is usually drawn as a double circle. Sometimes the accept state(s) function as "'''F'''inal" (halt, trapped) states.&lt;ref name=HoU79/&gt;

For a [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA), [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA), [[generalized nondeterministic finite automaton]] (GNFA), or [[Moore machine]], the input is denoted on each edge. For a [[Mealy machine]], input and output are signified on each edge, separated with a slash "/": "1/0" denotes the state change upon encountering the symbol "1" causing the symbol "0" to be output. For a [[Moore machine]] the state's output is usually written inside the state's circle, also separated from the state's designator with a slash "/". There are also variants that combine these two notations.

For example, if a state has a number of outputs (e.g. "a= motor counter-clockwise=1, b= caution light inactive=0") the diagram should reflect this : e.g. "q5/1,0" designates state q5 with outputs a=1, b=0. This designator will be written inside the state's circle.

=== Example: DFA, NFA, GNFA, or [[Moore machine]] ===
''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are states and ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an '''accepting state''' or a '''final state'''.  Each edge is labeled with the input. This example shows an acceptor for strings over {0,1} that contain an even number of zeros.
:[[Image:DFAexample.svg|200px|DFAexample.svg]]

=== Example: [[Mealy machine]] ===
''S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are states.  Each edge is labeled with "''j'' / ''k''" where ''j'' is the input and ''k'' is the output.

[[David Harel|Harel]] [[statechart]]s&lt;ref name=Har87&gt;[[David Harel]], [http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Statecharts.pdf  Statecharts: A visual formalism for complex systems. Science of Computer Programming], 8(3):231–274, June 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; are gaining widespread usage since a variant has  become part of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML).{{primary inline|date=March 2018}} The diagram type allows the modeling of [[UML state machine#Hierarchically nested states|superstates]], [[UML state machine#Orthogonal regions|orthogonal regions]], and activities as part of a state.

Classic state diagrams require the creation of distinct nodes for every valid combination of parameters that define the state.  This can lead to a very large number of nodes and transitions between nodes for all but the simplest of systems ([[UML state machine#UML extensions to the traditional FSM formalism|state and transition explosion]]). This complexity reduces the readability of the state diagram. With Harel statecharts it is possible to model multiple cross-functional state diagrams within the statechart.  Each of these cross-functional state machines can transition internally without affecting the other state machines in the statechart.  The current state of each cross-functional state machine in the statechart defines the state of the system.  The Harel statechart is equivalent to a state diagram but it improves the readability of the resulting diagram.

==Alternative semantics==
There are other sets of semantics available to represent state diagrams.  For example, there are tools for modeling and designing logic for embedded controllers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csl.sri.com/users/tiwari/papers/stateflow.pdf Tiwari, A. (2002). Formal Semantics and Analysis Methods for Simulink Stateflow.]&lt;/ref&gt; These diagrams, like Harel's original state machines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/asist/harel01.pdf Harel, D. (1987). A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems. Science of Computer Programming , 231–274.]&lt;/ref&gt; support hierarchically nested states, orthogonal regions, state actions, and transition actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~kanade/publications/symbolic_analysis_for_improving_simulation_coverage_of_simulink_stateflow_models.pdf Alur, R., Kanade, A., Ramesh, S., &amp; Shashidhar, K. C. (2008). Symbolic analysis for improving simulation coverage of Simulink/Stateflow models. International Conference on Embedded Software (pp. 89–98). Atlanta, GA: ACM.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== State diagrams versus flowcharts ==
Newcomers to the state machine formalism often confuse '''[[UML state machine#Basic UML state diagrams|state diagrams]]''' with '''[[flowchart]]s'''.  The figure below shows a comparison of a [[UML state machine#Basic UML state diagrams|state diagram]] with a flowchart. A state machine (panel (a)) performs actions in response to explicit events. In contrast, the flowchart (panel (b)) does not need explicit events but rather transitions from node to node in its graph automatically upon completion of activities.&lt;ref name="Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition: Event-Driven Programming for Embedded Systems"&gt;{{cite book

:[[Image:statechart vs flowchart.png|State diagram (a) and flowchart (b)]]

Nodes of flowcharts are edges in the induced graph of states.
The reason is that each node in a flowchart represents a program command.
A program command is an action to be executed.
So it is not a state, but when applied to the program's state, it results in a transition to another state.

In more detail, the source code listing represents a program graph.
Executing the program graph (parsing and interpreting) results in a state graph.
So each program graph induces a state graph.
Conversion of the program graph to its associated state graph is called "unfolding" of the program graph.

The program graph is a sequence of commands.
If no variables exist, then the state consists only of the program counter, which keeps track of where in the program we are during execution (what is the next command to be applied).

In this case before executing a command the program counter is at some position (state before the command is executed).
Executing the command moves the program counter to the next command.
Since the program counter is the whole state, it follows that executing the command changed the state.
So the command itself corresponds to a transition between the two states.

Now consider the full case, when variables exist and are affected by the program commands being executed.
Then between different program counter locations, not only does the program counter change, but variables might also change values, due to the commands executed.
Consequently, even if we revisit some program command (e.g. in a loop), this doesn't imply the program is in the same state.

In the previous case, the program would be in the same state, because the whole state is just the program counter, so if the program counter points to the same position (next command) it suffices to specify that we are in the same state.
However, if the state includes variables, then if those change value, we can be at the same program location with different variable values, meaning in a different state in the program's state space.
The term "unfolding" originates from this multiplication of locations when producing the state graph from the program graph.

A representative example is a do loop incrementing some counter until it overflows and becomes 0 again.
Although the do loop executes the same increment command iteratively, so the program graph executes a cycle, in its state space is not a cycle, but a line.
This results from the state being the program location (here cycling) combined with the counter value, which is strictly increasing (until the overflow), so different states are visited in sequence, until the overflow.
After the overflow the counter becomes 0 again, so the initial state is revisited in the state space, closing a cycle in the state space (assuming the counter was initialized to 0).

The figure above attempts to show that reversal of roles by aligning the arcs of the state diagrams with the processing stages of the flowchart.

You can compare a flowchart to an assembly line in manufacturing because the flowchart describes the progression of some task from beginning to end (e.g., transforming source code input into object code output by a compiler). A state machine generally has no notion of such a progression. The door state machine shown at the top of this article, for example, is not in a more advanced stage when it is in the "closed" state, compared to being in the "opened" state; it simply reacts differently to the open/close events. A state in a state machine is an efficient way of specifying a particular behavior, rather than a stage of processing.

== Other extensions ==
An interesting extension is to allow arcs to flow from any number of states to any number of states.  This only makes sense if the system is allowed to be in multiple states at once, which implies that an individual state only describes a condition or other partial aspect of the overall, global state.  The resulting formalism is known as a [[Petri net]].

Another extension allows the integration of flowcharts within Harel statecharts. This extension supports the development of software that is both event driven and workflow driven.

::A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys and they both look under the streetlight together.

The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where the light is".&lt;ref name=wrong/&gt;

She characterized it as a "radically disembedded and extractive variant of information capitalism" based on the [[commodification]] of "reality" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.3152525|title=A Digital Declaration: Big Data as Surveillance Capitalism|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|date=15 September 2014|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-08-28|language=de|issn=0174-4909|id=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshan-zuboff-on-big-data-as-surveillance-capitalism-13152525.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powles|first1=Julia|title=Google and Microsoft have made a pact to protect surveillance capitalism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/02/google-microsoft-pact-antitrust-surveillance-capitalism|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sterling|first1=Bruce|title=Shoshanna Zuboff condemning Google "surveillance capitalism"|url=https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2016/03/shoshanna-zuboff-condemning-google-surveillance-capitalism/|publisher=WIRED|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/magazine/facebook-google-privacy-data.html|title=The Unlikely Activists Who Took On Silicon Valley — and Won|last=|first=|date=14 August 2018|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent 2015 scholarly article, Zuboff analyzed the societal implications of this [[Creative destruction|mutation]] of capitalism. She differentiated "surveillance assets", "surveillance capital", and "surveillance capitalism" and their dependence on a global architecture of computer mediation that she calls "Big Other", a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power which constitutes hidden mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that threatens core values such as [[Free will|freedom]], [[democracy|democracy,]] and [[privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|date=4 April 2015|title=Big other: surveillance capitalism and the prospects of an information civilization|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754|journal=Journal of Information Technology|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=75–89|doi=10.1057/jit.2015.5|issn=0268-3962|id=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754|via=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theconversation1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/the-price-of-connection-surveillance-capitalism-64124|title=The price of connection: 'surveillance capitalism'|last1=Couldry|first1=Nick|date=23 September 2016|publisher=The Conversation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zuboff, surveillance capitalism was pioneered at [[Google]] and later [[Facebook]], in much the same way that [[mass-production]] and managerial capitalism were pioneered at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]] a century earlier, and has now become the dominant form of information capitalism.&lt;ref name="faz1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616.html?printPagedArticle=true|title=Google as a Fortune Teller: The Secrets of Surveillance Capitalism|last1=Zuboff|first1=Shoshana|date=5 March 2016|website=|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|id=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616.html?printPagedArticle=true|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her Oxford University lecture published in 2016, Zuboff identified surveillance capitalism's mechanisms and practices, including the manufacture of "prediction products" for sale in new "behavioral futures markets". She introduced the concept "dispossession by [[surveillance]]" and argued that it challenges the psychological and political bases of [[Self-determination theory|self-determination]] as it concentrates rights in the surveillance regime. This is described as a "coup from above".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.4103616|title=Google as a Fortune Teller: The Secrets of Surveillance Capitalism|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|date=5 March 2016|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-08-28|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Economic pressures of capitalism are driving the intensification of connection and monitoring online with spaces of social life becoming open to saturation by corporate actors, directed at the making of profit and/or the regulation of action.&lt;ref name=theconversation1/&gt; Relevantly, Turow writes that "centrality of [[corporate capitalism|corporate power]] is a direct reality at the very heart of the [[digital age]]". &lt;ref name="theconversation1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turow|first1=Joseph|title=The Daily You: How the New Advertising Industry Is Defining Your Identity and Your Worth|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300165013|date= 10 January 2012|pages=256|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=m9_DyhPGhEMC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} [[Capitalism]] has become focused on expanding the proportion of social life that is open to [[data collection]] and data processing.&lt;ref name=theconversation1/&gt; This may come with significant implications for vulnerability and control of society as well as for privacy. However, increased data collection may also have various advantages for individuals and society such as self-optimization ([[Quantified Self]]),&lt;ref name=theconversation1/&gt; societal optimizations (such as by [[smart cities]]) and new or optimized services (such as various Google applications). Still, collecting and processing data in the context of capitalism's core [[profit motive|profit-making motive]] might present an inherent danger.

Zuboff contrasts [[mass production]] of [[industrial capitalism]] with surveillance capitalism with the former being interdependent with its populations who were its consumers and employees and the latter preying on dependent populations who are neither its consumers nor its employees and largely ignorant of its procedures.&lt;ref name=faz1/&gt;

She notes that surveillance capitalism reaches beyond the conventional institutional terrain of the private firm and accumulates not only surveillance assets and capital, but also rights and operates without meaningful mechanisms of consent.&lt;ref name=faz1/&gt; Surveillance has been changing power structures in the information economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galič|first1=Maša|last2=Timan|first2=Tjerk|last3=Koops|first3=Bert-Jaap|title=Bentham, Deleuze and Beyond: An Overview of Surveillance Theories from the Panopticon to Participation|journal=Philosophy &amp; Technology|date=13 May 2016|doi=10.1007/s13347-016-0219-1|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This might present a further power shift beyond the nation-state and towards a form of [[corporatocracy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

[[Oliver Stone]], creator of the film ''[[Snowden (film)|Snowden]]'' pointed to the [[location-based game]] ''[[Pokémon Go]]'' as the "latest sign of the emerging phenomenon of surveillance capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic-Con 2016: Marvel turns focus away from the Avengers, 'Game of Thrones' cosplay proposals, and more|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-hc-comic-con-updates-oliver-stone-calls-pokemon-go-1469130980-htmlstory.html|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Stone Calls Pokémon Go "Totalitarian"|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/23/oliver-stone-calls-pokemon-go-totalitarian/|publisher=Fortune|date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Surveillance capitalism, robot totalitarianism’: Oliver Stone lashes out at Pokemon Go|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/352782-pokemon-snowden-oliver-stone/|publisher=RT International|date=22 July 2016|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Vincent Mosco referred to the marketing of information about customers and subscribers to advertisers ''surveillance capitalism'' and makes note of the [[surveillance state]] alongside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mosco|first1=Vincent|title=To the Cloud: Big Data in a Turbulent World|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317250388|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=YwbvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Fuchs found that the surveillance state fuses with surveillance capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuchs|first1=Christian|title=Social Media: A Critical Introduction|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781473987494|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=m3oEDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Zuboff informs that the issue is further complicated by highly invisible collaborative arrangements with state security apparatuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shoshana Zuboff / Keynote: Reality is the Next Big Thing - Elevate Festival 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QwPHinDdOc?t=12m30s|website=YouTube|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Trebor Scholz, companies recruit people as informants for this type of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scholz|first1=Trebor|title=Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781509508181|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LiDNDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "surveillance capitalism" has also been used by [[Political economy|political economists]] [[John Bellamy Foster]] and [[Robert W. McChesney]], though with a different meaning. In an article published in ''[[Monthly Review]]'' in 2014, they apply it to describe the manifestation of the "insatiable need for data" of [[financialization]], which they explain is "the long-term growth speculation on financial assets relative to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]" introduced in the United States by industry and government in the 1980s that evolved out of the [[Military–industrial complex|military-industrial complex]] and the [[advertising]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/|title=Surveillance Capitalism {{!}} John Bellamy Foster {{!}} Monthly Review|date=2014-07-01|work=Monthly Review|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key features==

==Countermeasures and solutions==
Numerous organizations have been struggling for [[free speech]] and [[privacy rights]] in the new surveillance capitalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|last2=McChesney|first2=Robert W.|title=Surveillance Capitalism by John Bellamy Foster|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/|publisher=Monthly Review|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various national governments have enacted [[privacy law]]s. It is also conceivable that new capabilities and uses for mass-surveillance require structural changes towards a new system to prevent misuse.

Zuboff compares demanding privacy from surveillance capitalists or lobbying for an end to commercial surveillance on the Internet to asking [[Henry Ford]] to make each [[Ford Model T|Model T]] by hand and states that such demands are existential threats that violate the basic mechanisms of the entity's survival.&lt;ref name=faz1/&gt;

Zuboff warns that principles of self-determination might forfeit due to "ignorance, learned helplessness, inattention, inconvenience, habituation, or drift" and states that "we tend to rely on mental models, vocabularies, and tools distilled from past catastrophes", referring to the twentieth century's [[totalitarian]] nightmares or the [[monopolistic]] predations of [[Gilded Age]] capitalism with countermeasures that have been developed to fight those earlier threats not being sufficient or even appropriate for the novel challenges.&lt;ref name=faz1/&gt;

She also poses the question: "will we be the masters of information, or will we be its slaves?" and states that "if the digital future is to be our home, then it is we who must make it so".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zuboff|first1=Shoshana|title=Shoshana Zuboff: A Digital Declaration|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshan-zuboff-on-big-data-as-surveillance-capitalism-13152525.html|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wachstafel.jpg|thumb|Roman ''tabula'' or [[wax tablet]] with [[stylus]].]]

'''''Tabula rasa''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|æ|b|j|ə|l|ə|_|ˈ|r|ɑː|s|ə|,_|-|z|ə|,_|ˈ|r|eɪ|-}}) refers to the [[epistemology|epistemological]] idea that individuals are born without built-in [[mental content]] and that therefore all knowledge comes from [[experience]] or [[perception]]. Proponents of tabula rasa generally disagree with the doctrine of [[innatism]] which holds that the mind is born already in possession of certain knowledge. Generally, proponents of the ''tabula rasa'' theory also favour the "nurture" side of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate when it comes to aspects of one's personality, social and emotional behaviour, knowledge and [[Wisdom#Sapience|sapience]].

==History==
''Tabula rasa'' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase often translated as "'''blank slate'''" in [[English language|English]] and originates from the Roman ''tabula'' used for notes, which was blanked by heating the wax and then smoothing it.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5PwrAAAAYAAJ |title=A Concise Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |publisher=Spottiswoode and Co. |author=Smith, Sir William |year=1898 |location=London |pages=608–9 |editor=Cornish, F. Warre}}&lt;/ref&gt; This roughly equates to the English term "blank slate" (or, more literally, "erased slate") which refers to the emptiness of a [[Slate (writing)|slate]] prior to it being written on with chalk. Both may be renewed repeatedly, by melting the wax of the tablet or by erasing the chalk on the slate.

==Philosophy==
{{See also|Empiricism}}
In [[Western philosophy]], the concept of ''tabula rasa'' can be traced back to the writings of [[Aristotle]] who writes in his treatise "Περί Ψυχῆς" (''[[De Anima]]'' or ''On the Soul'') of the "unscribed tablet." In one of the more well-known passages of this treatise he writes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Haven't we already disposed of the difficulty about interaction involving a common element, when we said that mind is in a sense potentially whatever is thinkable, though actually it is nothing until it has thought? What it thinks must be in it just as characters may be said to be on a writing-tablet on which as yet nothing stands written: this is exactly what happens with mind.{{sfn|Aristotle, ''De Anima''|loc=429b29–430a1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
This idea was further developed in Ancient Greek philosophy by the [[stoicism|Stoic]] school. Stoic epistemology emphasizes that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bardzell |first=Jeffrey |title=Speculative Grammar and Stoic Language Theory in Medieval Allegorical Narrative: From Prudentius to Alan of Lille |date=June 11, 2014 |publisher=Routledge |pages=18–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doxographer [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] summarizes this view as "When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz 4.11 translated by {{cite book |last1=Long |first1=A.A. |last2=Sedley |first2=D.N. |title=The Hellenistic Philosophers: Vol. 1 |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge |location=Cambridge, Ma |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes Laërtius]] attributes a similar belief to the Stoic [[Zeno of Citium]] when he writes in [[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]] that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perception, again, is an impression produced on the mind, its name being appropriately borrowed from impressions on wax made by a seal; and perception they divide into, comprehensible and incomprehensible: Comprehensible, which they call the criterion of facts, and which is produced by a real object, and is, therefore, at the same time conformable to that object; Incomprehensible, which has no relation to any real object, or else, if it has any such relation, does not correspond to it, being but a vague and indistinct representation.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 43-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the eleventh century, the theory of ''tabula rasa'' was developed more clearly by the [[Persian people|Persian]] philosopher [[Avicenna]]  (Ibn Sina in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]). He argued that the "...human intellect at birth resembled a ''tabula rasa'', a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know," and that knowledge is attained through "...[[empirical]] familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts," which develops through a "...[[Syllogism|syllogistic]] method of [[reasoning]]; observations lead to propositional statements, which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts." He further argued that the intellect itself "...possesses levels of development from the static/material intellect (''al-‘aql al-hayulani''), that potentiality can acquire knowledge to the active intellect (''al-‘aql al-fa‘il''), the state of the human intellect at conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm Avicenna/Ibn Sina (CA. 980–1037)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twelfth century, the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]]-[[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] and novelist, [[Ibn Tufail]], known as "Abubacer" or "Ebn Tophail" in the West, demonstrated the theory of ''tabula rasa'' as a [[thought experiment]] through his [[Arabic literature|Arabic philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqzan]]'', in which he depicted the development of the mind of a [[feral child]] "from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on a [[desert island]], through [[experience]] alone. The [[Latin]] translation of his [[philosophical novel]], entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', published by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671, had an influence on [[John Locke]]'s formulation of ''tabula rasa'' in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), The Impact of the Philosophus autodidactus: Pocockes, John Locke and the Society of Friends, in: G. A. Russell (ed.), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224–262, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09459-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Velazquez Sibyl Meadows Museum.jpg|thumb|''[[Female Figure (Velázquez)|Female Figure (Sibyl with Tabula Rasa)]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]], c. 1648]]
In the thirteenth century, [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] brought the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] notions to the forefront of [[Christian philosophy|Christian thought]]. These notions sharply contrasted with the previously held [[Platonism|Platonic]] notions of the human mind as an entity that preexisted somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body here on Earth (see Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''Apology'', as well as others). [[St. Bonaventure]] (also thirteenth century) was one of the fiercest intellectual opponents of Aquinas, offering some of the strongest arguments toward the Platonic idea of the mind.

The writings of Avicenna, Ibn Tufail, and Aquinas on the ''tabula rasa'' theory stood unprogressed and untested for several centuries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} For example, the [[late medieval]] English jurist [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]], in his work ''[[In Praise of the Laws of England]]'' (Chapter VI), takes for granted the notion of ''tabula rasa'', stressing it as the basis of the need for the education of the young in general, and of young princes specifically. "Therefore, Prince, whilst you are young and your mind is as it were a clean slate, impress on it these things, lest in future it be impressed more pleasurably with images of lesser worth." (''His igitur, Princeps, dum Adolescens es, et Anima tua velut'' '''Tabula rasa''', ''depinge eam, ne in futurum ipsa Figuris minoris Frugi delectabilius depingatur''.)

The modern idea of the theory, however, is attributed mostly to [[John Locke]]'s expression of the idea in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (he uses the term "white paper" in Book II, Chap. I, 2). In Locke's philosophy, ''tabula rasa'' was the theory that at birth the (human) mind is a "blank slate" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's [[sense|sensory]] experiences. The notion is central to Lockean empiricism; it serves as the starting point for Locke's subsequent explication (in Book II) of simple ideas and complex ideas. As understood by Locke, ''tabula rasa'' meant that the mind of the individual was born blank, and it also emphasized the freedom of individuals to author their own [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. Individuals are free to define the content of their character—but basic identity as a member of the human species cannot be altered. This presumption of a free, self-authored mind combined with an immutable human nature leads to the Lockean doctrine of "natural" rights. Locke's idea of ''tabula rasa'' is frequently compared with [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s viewpoint of human nature, in which humans are endowed with inherent mental content—particularly with selfishness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The eighteenth-century Swiss philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] used ''tabula rasa'' to support his argument that warfare is an advent of society and agriculture, rather than something that occurs from the human state of nature. Since ''tabula rasa'' states that humans are born with a "blank-slate", Rousseau uses this to suggest that humans must learn warfare.

''Tabula rasa'' also features in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]]. Freud depicted personality traits as being formed by family dynamics (see [[Oedipus complex]]). Freud's theories imply that humans lack free will, but also that genetic influences on human personality are minimal. In Freudian psychoanalysis, one is largely determined by one's upbringing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The ''tabula rasa'' concept became popular in social sciences during the twentieth century. Early ideas of [[eugenics]] posited that human intelligence correlated strongly with social class, but these ideas were rejected, and the idea that genes (or simply "blood") determined a person's character became regarded as racist. By the 1970s, scientists such as [[John Money]] had come to see [[gender identity]] as socially constructed, rather than rooted in genetics.

===Psychology and neurobiology===
{{main|Nature versus nurture}}
Psychologists and neurobiologists have shown evidence that initially, the entire [[cerebral cortex]] is programmed and organized to process sensory input, control motor actions, regulate emotion, and respond reflexively (under predetermined conditions).&lt;ref name="tabula rasa0"&gt;{{cite journal
|doi=10.1126/science.3291116
|author=Rakic P. |title=Specification of cerebral cortical areas |journal=Science |volume=241 |issue=4862 |pages=170–6 |date=July 1988 |pmid=3291116 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3291116|bibcode=1988Sci...241..170R}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These programmed mechanisms in the brain subsequently act to learn and refine the ability of the organism.&lt;ref name="tabula rasa1"&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Kalisman N, Silberberg G, Markram H |title=The neocortical microcircuit as a tabula rasa |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tabula rasa2"&gt;{{cite journal

For example, psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] showed that—in contrast to written language—the brain is "programmed" to pick up spoken language spontaneously.&lt;ref name="Pinker 2002"/&gt;

There have been claims by a minority in psychology and neurobiology, however, that the brain is ''tabula rasa'' only for certain behaviours. For instance, with respect to one's ability to acquire both general and special types of knowledge or skills, [[Michael Howe (psychologist)|Howe]] argued against the existence of innate talent.&lt;ref name=howe1998&gt;M. J. Howe, [[J. W. Davidson]] and J. A. Sloboda. (1998). [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=29991 Innate talents: reality or myth?] ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences|Behav. Brain. Sci.]]'', '''21''', 399–407; discussion 407–42.&lt;/ref&gt; There also have been neurological investigations into specific learning and memory functions, such as [[Karl Lashley]]'s study on [[Mass Action Principle (neuroscience)|mass action]] and serial interaction mechanisms.

Important evidence against the ''tabula rasa'' model of the mind comes from [[behavioural genetics]], especially [[twin studies|twin]] and [[adoption]] studies (see below). These indicate strong genetic influences on personal characteristics such as [[IQ]], [[alcoholism]], [[gender identity]], and other traits.&lt;ref name="Pinker 2002"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Critically, multivariate studies show that the distinct faculties of the mind, such as memory and reason, fractionate along genetic boundaries. Cultural universals such as [[emotion]] and the relative resilience of psychological adaptation to accidental biological changes (for instance the [[David Reimer]] case of gender reassignment following an accident) also support basic biological mechanisms in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|date=1997-03-01|title=Sex Reassignment at Birth|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/518304|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|language=en|volume=151|issue=3|pages=298|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social pre-wiring====
Twin studies have resulted in important evidence against the ''tabula rasa'' model of the mind, specifically, of [[social behaviour]].

'''The social pre-wiring hypothesis''' refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951360/ Umberto Castiello, et al: National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behaviour. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behaviour cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behaviour]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]]&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;.

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behaviour|social behaviours]] that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin fetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten fetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin fetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;.

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin fetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behaviour]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin fetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions."&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;.

===Computer science===
In [[computer science]], ''tabula rasa'' refers to the development of autonomous agents with a mechanism to reason and plan toward their goal, but no "built-in" knowledge-base of their environment. Thus they truly are a blank slate.

In reality autonomous agents possess an initial data-set or knowledge-base, but this cannot be immutable or it would hamper autonomy and heuristic ability.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Even if the data-set is empty, it usually may be argued that there is a built-in [[bias]] in the reasoning and planning mechanisms.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Either intentionally or unintentionally placed there by the human designer, it thus negates the true spirit of ''tabula rasa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/koans.html The Jargon Files: "Sussman attains enlightenment"], also see the article section [[Hacker koan#Uncarved block|Hacker koan: Uncarved block]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A synthetic (programming) language parser ([[LR(1)]], [[LALR(1)]] or [[SLR(1)]], for example) could be considered a special case of a ''tabula rasa'', as it is designed to accept ''any'' of a possibly infinite set of source language programs, within a ''single'' programming language, and to output either a good parse of the program, or a good machine language translation of the program, either of which represents a ''success'', or, alternately, a ''failure'', and nothing else. The "initial data-set" is a set of tables which are generally produced mechanically by a parser table generator, usually from a [[Backus–Naur form|BNF]] representation of the source language, and represents a "table representation" of that ''single'' programming language.

It graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an [[equilateral]] [[triangle]]. It is used in [[physical chemistry]], [[petrology]], [[mineralogy]], [[metallurgy]], and other physical sciences to show the compositions of systems composed of three species. In [[population genetics]], it is often called a [[de Finetti diagram]]. In [[game theory]], it is often called a ''[[simplex]] plot''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Tuyls, "An evolutionary game-theoretic analysis of poker strategies", ''Entertainment Computing'' January 2009 {{doi|10.1016/j.entcom.2009.09.002}}, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ternary plot, the proportions of the three variables {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} must sum to some constant, {{mvar|K}}. Usually, this constant is represented as 1.0 or 100%. Because {{math|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' {{=}} ''K''}} for all substances being graphed, any one variable is not independent of the others, so only two variables must be known to find a sample's point on the graph: for instance, {{mvar|c}} must be equal to {{math|''K'' − ''a'' − ''b''}}. Because the three proportions cannot vary independently—there are only two [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]]—it is possible to graph the combinations of all three variables in only two dimensions.

==Reading values on the ternary plot==
The advantage of using a ternary plot for depicting [[chemical composition]]s is that three variables can be conveniently plotted in a two-dimensional graph. Ternary plots can also be used to create [[phase diagram]]s by outlining the composition regions on the plot where different phases exist.

Every point on a ternary plot represents a different composition of the three components.

A parallel to a side of the triangle is the locus of points representing systems with constant [[chemical composition]] in the component situated in the vertex opposed to the side.

There are three common methods used to determine the ratios of the three species in the composition. 

The first method is an estimation based upon the phase diagram grid. The concentration of each species is 100% (pure phase) in each corner of the triangle and 0% at the line opposite it. The percentage of a specific species decreases linearly with increasing distance from this corner, as seen in figures&amp;nbsp;3–8. By drawing parallel lines at regular intervals between the zero line and the corner (as seen in the images), fine divisions can be established for easy estimation of the content of a species. For a given point, the [[mass fraction (chemistry)|fraction]] of each of the three materials in the composition can be determined by the first.

For phase diagrams that do not possess grid lines, the easiest way to determine the composition is to set the altitude of the triangle to 100% and determine the shortest distances from the point of interest to each of the three sides. By [[Viviani's theorem]], the distances (the ratios of the distances to the total height of 100%) give the content of each of the species, as shown in figure&amp;nbsp;1.

The third method is based upon a larger number of measurements, but does not require the drawing of perpendicular lines. Straight lines are drawn from each corner, through the point of interest, to the opposite side of the triangle. The lengths of these lines, as well as the lengths of the segments between the point and the corresponding sides, are measured individually. Ratios can then be determined by dividing these segments by the entire corresponding line as shown in the figure&amp;nbsp;2. (The sum of the ratios should add to 1).

==Derivation from Cartesian coordinates==
:[[File:ternary plot visualisation.svg|none|thumb|700px|Derivation of a ternary plot from Cartesian coordinates]]
Figure (1) shows an [[oblique projection]] of point {{math|P(''a'',''b'',''c'')}} in a 3-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] with axes {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|c}}, respectively.

If {{math|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' {{=}} ''K''}} (a positive constant), {{math|P}} is restricted to a plane containing {{math|A(''K'',0,0)}}, {{math|B(0,''K'',0)}} and {{math|C(0,0,''K'')}}. If {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|c}} each cannot be negative, {{math|P}} is restricted to the triangle bounded by {{math|A}}, {{math|B}} and {{math|C}}, as in (2).

In (3), the axes are rotated to give an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] view. The triangle, viewed face-on, appears [[equilateral]].

In (4), the distances of {{math|P}} from lines {{math|BC}}, {{math|AC}} and {{math|AB}} are denoted by {{math|''a''′}}, {{math|''b''′}} and {{math|''c''′}}, respectively.

For any line {{math|'''l''' {{=}} '''s''' + ''t'' '''n&amp;#770;'''}} in vector form ({{math|'''n&amp;#770;'''}} is a unit vector) and a point {{math|'''p'''}}, the [[distance from a point to a line|perpendicular distance]] from {{math|'''p'''}} to {{math|'''l'''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\| (\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{p}) - \bigl((\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{p}) \cdot  \mathbf{\hat n}\bigr)\mathbf{\hat n} \right\| \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, point {{math|P}} is at
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \begin{pmatrix}a\\b\\c\end{pmatrix} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Line {{math|BC}} has
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\K\\0\end{pmatrix} \quad\text{and}\quad
\mathbf{\hat{n}} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix}0\\K\\0\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\K\end{pmatrix}}{\left\|\begin{pmatrix}0\\K\\0\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\K\end{pmatrix}\right\|} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix}0\\K\\-K\end{pmatrix}}{\sqrt{0^2+K^2+{(-K)}^2}} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\end{pmatrix} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the perpendicular distance formula,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a' &amp; = \left\| \begin{pmatrix}-a\\K-b\\-c\end{pmatrix} - \left( \begin{pmatrix}-a\\K-b\\-c\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}0\\\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\end{pmatrix} \right) \begin{pmatrix}0\\\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\end{pmatrix} \right\| \\[10px]
&amp; = \left\| \begin{pmatrix}-a\\K-b\\-c\end{pmatrix} - \left( 0 + \frac{K-b}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \begin{pmatrix}0\\\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\end{pmatrix} \right\| \\[10px]
&amp; = \left\| \begin{pmatrix}-a\\K-b-\frac{K-b+c}{2}\\-c+\frac{K-b+c}{2}\end{pmatrix} \right\| = \left\| \begin{pmatrix}-a\\\frac{K-b-c}{2}\\\frac{K-b-c}{2}\end{pmatrix} \right\| \\[10px]
&amp; = \sqrt{{(-a)}^2 + {\left(\frac{K-b-c}{2}\right)}^2 + {\left(\frac{K-b-c}{2}\right)}^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + \frac{{(K-b-c)}^2}{2}} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting {{math|''K'' {{=}} ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c''}},

:&lt;math&gt;a' = \sqrt{a^2 + \frac{{(a+b+c-b-c)}^2}{2}} = \sqrt{a^2 + \frac{a^2}{2}} = a\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar calculation on lines {{math|AC}} and {{math|AB}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;b' = b\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \quad\text{and}\quad c' = c\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that the distance of the point from the respective lines is linearly proportional to the original values {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|c}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Vaughan |first=Will |title=Ternary plots |url=http://wvaughan.org/ternaryplots.html |date=September 5, 2010 |accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plotting a ternary plot==
[[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] are useful for plotting points in the triangle. Consider an equilateral ternary plot where {{math|''a'' {{=}} 100%}} is placed at {{math|(''x'',''y'') {{=}} (0,0)}} and {{math|''b'' {{=}} 100%}} at {{math|(1,0)}}. Then {{math|''c'' {{=}} 100%}} is {{math|({{sfrac|1|2}},{{sfrac|{{sqrt|3}}|2}})}}, and the triple {{math|(''a'',''b'',''c'')}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2b+c}{a+b+c},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\cdot\frac{c}{a+b+c}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
This example shows how this works for a hypothetical set of three soil samples:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
!width="10%"|Sample number||width="10%"|Organic matter||width="10%"|Clay||width="10%"|Sand||Notes
|-
|Sample 1||80%||10%||10%||align="left"|Because organic matter and clay make up 90% of this sample, the proportion of sand must be 10%.
|-
|Sample 2||50%||40%||10%||align="left"|The proportion of sand is 10% in this sample too, but the proportions of organic matter and clay are different.
|-
|Sample 3||10%||40%||50%||align="left"|This sample has the same proportion of clay as in Sample 2 does, but because it has a smaller proportion of organic matter, the proportion of sand must be larger, because all samples' proportions must sum to 100%.

'''Violence against prostitutes''' has been reported worldwide, both on a physical and psychological level. The victims are predominantly women, including in extreme cases murder both inside and outside the workplace.

== Prevalence ==
Women working in prostitution experience more levels of violence against them than women working in other fields.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Rodríguez Martínez, Pilar. "An Intersectional Analysis of Intimate Partner Violence and Workplace Violence among Women Working in Prostitution."''Revista Española De Investigaciones Sociologicas'' no. 151 (July 2015): 123-138. ''SocINDEX with Full Text'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed November 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the [[homicide]] rate for female sex workers  in the United States was estimated to be 204 per 100,000, although this figure mixes illegal work with legal work.{{sfn|Potterat|Brewer|Muth|Rothenberg|2004}} This figure is considerably higher than that for the next riskiest occupations in the United States during a similar period (4 per 100,000 for female liquor store workers and 29 per 100,000 for male taxicab drivers).{{sfn|Castillo|Jenkins|1994}}  The prevalence of violence against prostitutes varies by location.  A study of female prostitutes in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada over the age of 14 who used illicit drugs other than marijuana found that 57% of prostitutes experienced some form of gender-based violence over an 18-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prevalence and structural correlates of gender based violence among a prospective cohort of female sex workers|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b2939|journal = BMJ|date = 2009-08-11|issn = 0959-8138|pmc = 2725271|pmid = 19671935|pages = b2939|volume = 339|doi = 10.1136/bmj.b2939|first = Kate|last = Shannon|first2 = T.|last2 = Kerr|first3 = S.

W.|last6 = Tyndall}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a study of 1,000 female (both cisgender and transgender) sex-workers in [[Phnom Penh|Phnom Penh, Cambodia]] found 93% of women surveyed had been the victim of rape in the past year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/BSP/GENDER/PDF/HIVGBVbackgroundreport.pdf|title = Addressing the links between gender-based violence and HIV in the Great Lakes region|date = |accessdate = October 29, 2015|website = UNESCO|publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of violence ==

=== Physical ===
[[Violence|Physical violence]] is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} World report on violence and health|url = http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/|website = www.who.int|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical violence is more commonly experienced by outdoor sex-workers with 47% of prostitutes working outdoors reporting being kicked, punched, or slapped in one study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In a study of prostitutes working in San Francisco, 82% of participants reported having experienced some type of physical violence since entering prostitution, with 55% of these assaults being committed by a client.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prostitution, Violence, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1300/J013v27n03_03|journal = Women &amp; Health|pages = 37–49|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1300/j013v27n03_03|first = Melissa|last = Farley|first2 = Howard|last2 = Barkan|pmid=9698636|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study found a slightly rate lower with 74% of sex-workers reported experiencing some form of physical abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = History of Abuse and Psychological Distress Symptoms among Female Sex Workers in Two Mexico-U.S. Border Cities|journal = Violence and victims|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 0886-6708|pmc = 2777761|pmid = 19634364|pages = 399–413|volume = 24|issue = 3|first = Monica|last = Ulibarri|first2 = Shirley J.|last2 = Semple|first3 = Swati|last3 = Rao|first4 = Steffanie A.|last4 = Strathdee|first5 = Miguel A.|last5 = Fraga-Vallejo|first6 = Jesus|last6 = Bucardo|first7 = Adela|last7 = De la Torre|first8 = Juan|last8 = Salazar-Reyna|first9 = Prisci|last9 = Orozovich|doi=10.1891/0886-6708.24.3.399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, the general consensus among most studies regarding violence against prostitutes is that rates of physical violence against prostitutes is extremely high, particularly among female sex workers (transgender inclusive) who experience higher rates of physical violence than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Psychological ===
[[Psychological abuse]], also referred to as mental abuse or emotional abuse is  characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another to behavior that may result in psychological trauma, including [[anxiety]], [[chronic depression]], or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutton | first1 = D.

E.|last = Thompson|first2 = C. A.|last2 = Kaplan|doi=10.1192/bjp.168.2.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says that this type of violence "includes, but is not limited to, being insulted (e.g. called derogatory names) or made to feel bad about oneself; being humiliated or belittled in front of other people; being threatened with loss of custody of one's children; being confined or [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolated]] from family or friends; being threatened with harm to oneself or someone one cares about; repeated shouting, inducing fear through [[intimidating]] words or gestures; [[controlling behavior]]; and the destruction of possessions."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are certain types of psychological or emotional abuse that sex workers are more prone to such as denial of basic needs, forced drug or alcohol consumption, and being arrested for carrying condoms to name a few.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Women working in prostitution are especially vulnerable to psychological abuse, particularly [[verbal abuse]], because many customers and other members of society view them as "whores" or as generally undesirable women. Often verbal abuse will occur either while the service is being given, or after it has been given and the customer is not satisfied. In both these cases, verbal abuse can be a precursor to sexual violence from the client.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In one study, 78% of sex-workers reported having experienced emotional or psychological abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Sexual ===
[[Sexual violence]] is any sexual act or attempt to obtain a sexual act by violence or coercion, unwanted sexual comments or advances, acts to traffic a person or acts directed against a person's sexuality, regardless of the relationship to the victim.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization., World report on violence and health (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2002), Chapter 6, pp. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(g)-6 Crimes against humanity of sexual violence, elements 1.

(1998). ''Contemporary forms of slavery: systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflict''.  Final report submitted by Ms. Jay J. McDougall, Special Rapporteur,&lt;/ref&gt;  The risks of sexual abuse are overall lower than the risks of physical abuse. with the exception of indoor prostitutes who report a higher rate of rape or attempted rape than any one type of physical violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In one study, 44% of sex-workers reported having experienced sexual abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Rates of sexual assault and rape are higher among women (including transgender women) than among men, though the overall rate is high with one study finding that 68% of respondents had been raped since entering prostitution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  These high levels of sexual violence suffered by sex workers have very traumatic effects on the men and women working as prostitutes. High levels of rape other forms of sexual violence while working as a prostitute have been linked to higher levels of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Contributing factors ==
Studies have shown that younger sex-workers tend to experience more client violence than their older colleagues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Furthermore, cisgender and transgender female sex workers are also more likely to experience violence committed by a client than their male sex worker counterparts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Legal vs illegal sex work ===
Laws prohibiting prostitution can make it difficult for the men and women engaging in prostitution to report any violence they may experience while on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=hwlj|title = For Their Own Good: The Results of the Prostitution Laws as Enforced by Cops, Politician and Judges|last = Almodovar|first = Norma Jean|date = January 1, 1999|journal = Hastings Women's Law Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often transactions or arrangements to meet up with clients must be made in secret in places where prostitution is illegal.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Barnard, Marina A.

Sex work was always legal in New Zealand but decriminalization removed laws that increased danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/parl-support/research-papers/00PLSocRP12051/prostitution-law-reform-in-new-zealand|title=New Zealand Parliament - Prostitution Law Reform in New Zealand|work=Parliament.nz|accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetrators ==

===Violent clients, pimps and police officers===
Perpetrators may include violent clients and [[pimps]]. Clients oftentimes attempt to maintain a power balance that favors them over the prostitutes.  This is often done through different methods of violence such as sexual, emotional, and physical.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Though pimps may be perpetrators of violence against sex workers with 53% of sex workers in one study reporting that violence at the hands of pimps is a major problem, 33% of subjects interviewed in that same study reported that the main benefit to having a pimp is the protection from potential assault.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ca066bbe-c370-4f90-a033-f2ed967c0e92%2540sessionmgr112&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=120|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the illegality of sex work in many parts of the world, sex workers often have to service clients in discreet and isolated spaces where they are less likely to get caught by the police. Because of this isolation, sex workers are made more vulnerable to attacks by their clients. According to a study conducted on one hundred and thirty people working in [[San Francisco]] as street sex workers, 82% had been physically assaulted, 83% had been threatened with a weapon and 68% had been raped while working as prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/prostitution_research/000021.html |title=Prostitution Research &amp; Education Website |publisher=Prostitutionresearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918115439/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/prostitution_research/000021.html |archive-date=2012-09-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries such as the United States sex work is illegal, and so sex workers are not able to report violence done against them in fear of being arrested themselves. In certain states anti-prostitution mandates carry a minimum sentence and can increase to felony charge after multiple arrests, which leads to difficulty finding housing and employment, and disqualification for welfare benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Melissa Gira. "The War on Sex Workers." ''Reason.com''. N.p., 21 Jan. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally sex workers may be registered as sex offenders, or face deportation if they have precarious migratory or citizenship status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wahab | first1 = Stéphanie | last2 = Panichelli | first2 = Meg | year = 2013 | title = Ethical and Human Rights Issues in Coercive Interventions With Sex Workers | url = | journal = Journal of Women and Social Work | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 344–49 | doi=10.1177/0886109913505043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the stigma that exists around sex work, police are less likely to investigate attacks on sex workers.{{sfn|Wong|Holroyd|Bingham|2011}}  As one sex worker in South Africa reports "to gather evidence of a crime against a sex worker, they have to first take it seriously,”. “If we go to the police to report abuse, we’re made fun of, we’re told ‘you deserve it.’ They chase you away,” notes another sex worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2011/12/15/ending-police-abuse-sex-workers/|title=Police Abuse of Sex Workers: A Global Reality, Widely Ignored|last=Mgbako|first=Chi|date=December 15, 2011|website=Rewire|publisher=|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police officers themselves are common perpetrators of violence against prostitutes. A study of sex-workers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia found that half of the women had been beaten by police and about a third had been gang-raped by police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "In South Africa, where sex work has been illegal since the former apartheid regime criminalized it in 1957, police officers often fine sex workers inordinate sums of money and pocket the cash, resulting in a pattern of economic extortion of sex workers by state agents."&lt;ref&gt;Mgbako, Chi. "Police Abuse of Sex Workers: A Global Reality, Widely Ignored." ''Rewire''. Rewire, 15 Dec. 2011. Web. 04 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serial killers===
[[File:Jack the ripper.jpg|thumb|Jack the Ripper attacks a woman]]
Sex workers (particularly those engaging in [[street prostitution]]) are also sometimes targeted by [[serial killer]]s, who may consider them easy targets and less likely to be missed, or who use the religious and social stigma associated with sex workers as justification for their murder.

The unidentified serial killer known as [[Jack the Ripper]] killed at least five sex workers in [[London]] in 1888. Due to the frequent murders of prostitutes at that time and place, however, it is difficult to be certain of the number killed by Jack the Ripper. These particular murders are distinguished from other murders of sex workers during the same time period due to the post-mortem mutilations that occurred, and it is for that reason that other murders of prostitutes are not usually attributed to the Ripper, or are disputed.

[[Peter Sutcliffe]] (aka the Yorkshire Ripper) murdered 13 women, some of whom were sex workers, from 1975-1980 in [[Northern England]].

[[Gary Ridgway]] (aka the Green River Killer), confessed to killing 48 sex workers from 1982 to 1998, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/05/green.river.killings/index.html |title=Green River Killer avoids death in plea deal - November 6, 2003 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hansen]] murdered between 15 and 21 sex workers, near [[Anchorage, Alaska]], between 1980 and 1983.

[[Joel Rifkin]] confessed to killing 17 sex workers in the New York area between 1989 and 1993, without there having been a missing persons report filed on any of the women during that time.

[[Robert Pickton]], a Canadian who lived near [[Vancouver]], made headlines after the remains of numerous missing sex workers were found on his family farm. He has now been convicted of the murders of 6 women who went missing from Vancouver's [[Downtown Eastside]], and is suspected by police of killing at least twenty more (though no charges have been filed in relation to their deaths).  In December 2007 he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years.

In December 2006, [[Steve Wright (serial killer)|Steve Wright]] murdered five sex workers in [[Ipswich]], [[England]] (see [[Ipswich serial murders]]).

== Efforts to combat ==
Most efforts to advocate for prostitutes have focused on prevention of the spread of AIDS/HIV+ among the general population rather than focusing on how certain policies would benefit the prostitutes themselves.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This focus has neglected many of the issues of violence facing sex workers.  Recently, however, there has been an effort to eradicate violence against prostitutes from a wider perspective.  The United Nations Population Fund, in conjunction with several other organizations, recommends community empowerment, led by sex workers, as a way to combat violence against sex-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Implementing comprehensive HIV/STI programmes with sex workers: Practical approaches from collaborative interventions|url = http://www.unfpa.org/publications/implementing-comprehensive-hivsti-programmes-sex-workers-practical-approaches|website = UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   UNPF also advocates for changing perceptions to view sex work as work, rather than an illegal activity.  One issue facing efforts to prevent violence against prostitutes is that there is a low level of reporting violence among prostitutes.  A study of female sex-workers in India found that 54% of female sex-workers do not report violence committed against them, and only 36% shared their experience with NGOs or a peer or family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Non-Disclosure of Violence among Female Sex Workers: Evidence from a Large Scale Cross-Sectional Survey in India|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098321|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-05-20|pmc = 4028275|pmid = 24846145|pages = e98321|volume = 9|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0098321|first = Bidhubhusan|last = Mahapatra|first2 = Madhusudana|last2 = Battala|first3 = Akash|last3 = Porwal|first4 = Niranjan|last4 = Saggurti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By sex workers ===
Because of the increased risk of violence associated with working in sex work, many sex workers have begun adopting their own personal policies to reduce the likelihood of becoming the victims of violence.  A study by Maureen A. Norton-Hawk found that "40% percent of sex workers have a policy of refusing to provide services in an alley, 54% refuse to provide services in a drug house, and 68% refuse to provide services in an abandoned building."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Often sex workers must rely on themselves or each other for support in ending violence as many campaigns to end violence against women ignore the needs of sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = Michelle S | year = 1999 | title = Prostitutes, Drug Users, and Thieves: The Invisible Women in the Campaign to End Violence Against Women | url = | journal = Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 459–475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government policy ===
[[File:Sex Worker Rights - London SlutWalk 2011.jpg|thumb|Sex Workers' Rights demonstration at London SlutWalk 2011]]
[[UN Women]] supports the decriminalization of sex work in order to protect sex-workers from violence and abuse and encourages the criminalization of forms of violence, coercion and exploitation in sex work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;UN Women. "Notes on Sex Work, Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking." NSWP (2013).  Accessed September 23, 2015. http://www.nswp.org/resource/un-womens-note-sex-work-sexual-exploitation-and-trafficking&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, however, the United States of America requires that all countries it gives aid to for AIDS/HIV+ prevention and relief agree to an "[[anti-prostitution pledge]]" that dictates that the country receiving aid must adopt policy that treats sex work and prostitution the same as sex trafficking.  This policy has resulted in inadequate attention being paid to the health needs of prostitutes and limits the ability of the government to address the specific needs that sex workers have.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Lerum, Kari."Reducing Violence against Sex Workers: What are the policy options?." Human Rights for All (2011). Accessed September 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in the United States, many states have mandatory minimum sentencing laws that require judges to give anyone convicted of prostitution a mandatory minimum prison sentence.  This can, in turn, make it less likely that prostitutes take legal action against the perpetrators of violence against them because doing so could be risking jail time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  One possible policy option that the Netherlands has done would be to designate specific places for sex workers and clients to meet up and arrange and engage in sexual activities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This would provide a safe and secure place for sexual services to be sold without having to remain in private which can be a risk factor for violence against prostitutes.  Some organizations have even suggested forming support groups composed of sex workers in the area as a way to give sex workers the support they often lack.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''''What Darwin Got Wrong''''' is a 2010 book by philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]] and cognitive scientist [[Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]], in which the authors criticize [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]]. It is an extension of an argument first presented as "Why Pigs Don't Have Wings" in the ''[[London Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref name=LRB&gt;Fodor J (2007) [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n20/jerry-fodor/why-pigs-dont-have-wings Why Pigs Don't Have Wings]. ''London Review of Books'' '''29'''(20): 19-22. Letters, '''29'''(21), '''29'''(22), '''29'''(23), '''30'''(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Fodor published an article, entitled "Why Pigs Don't Have Wings", in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' in October 2007.&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt; It stated that "In fact, an appreciable number of perfectly reasonable biologists are coming to think that the theory of [[natural selection]] can no longer be taken for granted."

In support of this proposed disestablishment of [[natural selection]], the article stated two arguments:
* Conceptually, it argued that the theory of natural selection contains an equivocation, as to whether selection acts upon individuals or on traits, and that to juxtapose both "depends on whether [[adaptationism]] is able to provide the required notion of ‘selection for’", and that adaptionism fails to meet this burden. Fodor credits the work of [[Stephen J. Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] on [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrels]] as being the first to notice this problem. Fodor concludes that:
{{quotation|The crucial test is whether one’s pet theory can distinguish between selection for trait A and selection for trait B when A and B are coextensive: were polar bears selected for being white or for matching their environment? Search me; and search any kind of adaptationism I’ve heard of. Nor am I holding my breath till one comes along.}}
* Fodor suggested that there is also an "''empirical issue''" involving [[phenotype|phenotypic]] "free-riders" (the evolutionary byproducts that Gould and Lewontin developed the 'spandrel' metaphor for).&lt;!-- This last sentence is rather vague, but the article is so elliptical on this point that I am unsure what the exact "empirical issue" is --&gt; Fodor suggests that "serious alternatives to adaptationism have begun to emerge", and offers [[evolutionary development]]al theory ('evo-devo') as one such alternative.

The ''London Review of Books'' published eleven letters (including two from Fodor himself) over the following three months. They included negative responses from [[Simon Blackburn]], [[Tim Lewens]], [[Jerry Coyne]] and [[Philip Kitcher]], and [[Daniel Dennett]] and a mixed response from [[Steven Rose]].&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;

Coyne and Kitcher dispute Fodor's "striking claim that evolutionary biologists are abandoning natural selection as the principal, or even an important, cause of evolutionary change" and state that "[t]his is news to us, and, we believe, will be news to most knowledgeable people as well." They go on to criticise his conceptual and empirical issues, and state that "[t]he rival mechanisms Fodor cites are supplements to natural selection, not replacements", and that "Evo-devo is not an alternative to adaptation; rather, it is a way to explain how the genes mechanistically produce adaptations."&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt; Evolutionary developmental biologist [[PZ Myers]] has expressed a similar criticism of this characterisation of evolutionary developmental biology.&lt;ref&gt;"As bad as building an argument on the faulty premise of ignorance might be, there's another approach that Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini take that is increasingly common, and personally annoying: the use of a growing synthesis of evolutionary ideas with developmental biology to claim that evolution is dead. This is rather like noting that the replacement of carburettors with electronic fuel injection systems means that internal combustion engines are about to be extinct — evo-devo is a ''refinement'' of certain aspects of biology that has, we think, significant implications for evolution, especially of multicellular organisms. It is not a new engine. People who claim it is understand neither development nor evolution." [http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/02/fodor_and_piattelli-palmarini.php Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini get everything wrong], [[PZ Myers]], [[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]], 23 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennett states that Fodor's discussion of Gould and Lewontin’s spandrel argument misrepresents that argument, stating "that far from suggesting an alternative to adaptationism, the very concept of a spandrel depends on there being adaptations".&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;

Blackburn writes that "His problem is fortunately quite easily solved [...] Two traits may be found together in nature, but one can play a causal role in producing a reproductive advantage, when the other does not." We can thus know that the trait that gives the advantage is the one being selected. Fodor replies that the problem is not merely about our knowledge of what is being selected, but the process of selection itself: "how can the operation of selection distinguish traits that are coextensive in a creature's ecology?" Blackburn writes back that Fodor's question is irrelevant to the process of natural selection as actually formulated by biologists, ''viz.'' organisms with genes that enhance reproductive success are more likely to pass on genes to the next generation, and so the frequency of those genes increases. "Is this incoherent? Nothing Fodor says bears on that question."&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;

==Summary==

The book is divided into two parts. Part One is a review of "new facts and new non-selectional mechanisms that have been discovered in biology".&lt;ref&gt;Preface, page xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Part Two is a discussion of "the logical and conceptual bases of the theory of natural selection".&lt;ref&gt;Preface, page xx.&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset, the authors state their [[atheism]] and commitment to [[metaphysical naturalism|naturalistic]] explanations,&lt;ref&gt;Preface, page xv.&lt;/ref&gt; and add that they accept [[evolution]] and [[common descent]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but doubt that evolution proceeds by natural selection.

===The problem of "selection-for"===

The authors' central argument against the concept of natural selection is what they call "the problem of selection-for".&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6: Many are called but few are chosen: the problem of 'selection-for'.&lt;/ref&gt; An extension of [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]]'s concept of [[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]], the authors note that certain traits of organisms always come together. The authors give examples:

# A heart both ''pumps blood'' and ''makes heart-like noises'' &lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, page 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A frog both ''snaps at flies'' and ''snaps at ambient black nuisances'' &lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A polar bear is both ''white'' and ''camouflaged against its environment'' &lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, page 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these traits come together, they are both correlated with [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Therefore, Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini argue that the theory of natural selection "cannot predict/explain what traits the creatures in a population are selected-for",&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; and so "the claim that selection is the mechanism of evolution cannot be true".&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way the authors put the same point is as follows: If the mechanism of natural selection (as it is currently formulated) is correct, then it is a paradigm example of intensional causation. Intensional causation requires either (1) there be a mind involved in the causal process, or (2) the causal mechanism has access to nomological laws. Since there is neither (1) nor (2) at the biological level, the theory of natural selection cannot be correct. 

In a response, published by the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' in November 2007, to "Why Pigs Don't Have Wings", [[Tim Lewens]] states that [[Elliott Sober]] gave the following solution to this problem in 1984:&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;
{{quote|“Selection of” pertains to the effects of a selection process, whereas “selection for” describes its causes. To say there is selection for a given property means that having the property causes success in survival and reproduction.}}
Lewens continues:
{{quote|If a property doesn’t cause success in survival and reproduction, but is linked to one that does, then there is no selection for that property. This is precisely why Fodor thinks that although there is selection of curly tails, there is no selection for curly tails.}}

== Reception ==
Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini published a short summary of their book in ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527466.100-survival-of-the-fittest-theory-darwinisms-limits.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] wrote that ''What Darwin Got Wrong'' "strikes an outsider as an overdue and valuable onslaught on neo-Darwinist simplicities".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The journalist [[Oliver Burkeman]] wrote an article entitled "Why everything you've been told about evolution is wrong" in ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/mar/19/evolution-darwin-natural-selection-genes-wrong&lt;/ref&gt; but concludes "It would be jawdroppingly surprising, to say the least, were Fodor to be right. A safer, if mealy-mouthed, conclusion to draw is that his work acts as an important warning to those of us who think we understand natural selection".

The book also received a positive review from [[intelligent design|intelligent-design]] proponent [[William Dembski]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/what-darwin-got-wrong/&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigliucci criticises the first part of the book for claiming that 'Darwinism' "put[s] far too much emphasis on external causes of biological change, namely natural selection, and has ignored internal mechanisms", whilst failing to acknowledge that biology has long addressed such internal mechanisms, with Darwin himself "explicitly referring his readers to ‘the laws of correlation of growth’ – that is, to the fact that the internal structure of living organisms imposes limits and direction to evolution". He criticises the second part of the book for raising correlated traits as a new issue when "Biologists have long known about the problem" and have dealt with it:&lt;ref name=Pigliucci/&gt;
{{quotation|This is why hypotheses about natural selection are usually tested by means of functional analyses rooted in physiology, genetics and developmental biology, and why observations of selection in the field are whenever possible coupled with manipulative experiments that make it possible to distinguish between, say, flies and 'dark spots moving in front of your tongue' kinds of objects.}}

Ruse makes the following suggestion for the motivation for the book:
{{quotation|At the beginning of their book, they proudly claim to be atheists. Perhaps so. But my suspicion is that, like those scorned Christians, Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini just cannot stomach the idea that humans might just be organisms, no better than the rest of the living world. We have to be special, superior to other denizens of Planet Earth. Christians are open in their beliefs that humans are special and explaining them lies beyond the scope of science. I just wish that our authors were a little more open that this is their view too.&lt;ref name=RuseBoston/&gt;}}

The [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Jerry Coyne]] describes this book as "a profoundly misguided critique of natural selection"&lt;ref&gt;[http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/19/worst-science-journalism-of-the-year-darwin-completely-wrong-again/ Worst science journalism of the year: Darwin completely wrong (again)]&lt;/ref&gt; and "as biologically uninformed as it is strident".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/improbability-pump The Improbability Pump], [[Jerry Coyne]], [[The Nation]], 10 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' [[Douglas J. Futuyma]] concluded:
{{quotation|Because they are prominent in their own fields, some readers may suppose that they are authorities on evolution who have written a profound and important book.  They aren't, and it isn't.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas J. Futuyma, [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/692.1.citation Two Critics Without a Clue], ''Science'' 7 May 2010:692-69&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Adam Rutherford]],  writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', also reviewed the book negatively.&lt;ref&gt;
