The '''agricultural machinery industry''' or '''agricultural engineering industry''' is the part of the [[industry]], that produces and maintain [[tractor]]s, [[agricultural machinery]] and agricultural implements. This branch is considered to be part of the [[machinery industry]].

== History ==
:''See also history of [[Agricultural machinery#History|Agricultural machinery]] and [[Mechanised agriculture#History|Mechanised agriculture]]''

=== 19th century ===
The agricultural machinery industry emerged in Britain and the United States in the 19th century. Until then the common tools of farming were the [[plough]] and the sickle.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"&gt;R.C. Gifford. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6JkSfrmbF8C&amp;pg=PA7 Agricultural Engineering in Development: Concepts and principles].'' 1992. p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; These iron agricultural implements were often made by [[blacksmiths]] in the local village, who regularly also acted as [[farrier]]. In the first part of the 19th century some of the early agricultural machine manufacturers arose from these blacksmith workshops,&lt;ref name="JHM94"&gt;Jan H. Maas (1994) ''De Nederlandse agrosector: geografie en dynamiek'' p.177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 9) even stated that "nearly all farm machinery manufacturers today can be trace their beginnings to a blacksmith."&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[John Deere]] who started up with the production of ploughs in series in the 1840s. 
[[File:Great Exhibition, Agricutlural Implements 2, HF Talbot, 1851.jpg|thumb|Agricultural Implements, 1851.]]
Other companies arose from the introduction of horse drawn [[reaper|reaping]], which replaced the type of [[Scythe|hand reaper]] in use since biblical times.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt; A company as the [[International Harvester|McCormick]] started up with building these kind of harvesting machines around the 1840s. And another origin of agricultural industry was the introduction of combined harvesting, threshing and cleaning in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt; The [[Case Corporation]] for example started building those in 1842 as the Racine Threshing Machine Works. Until early 20th century most of those machinery were powered by horses.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt;

Mid 19th century the portable steam-powered [[ploughing engine|plowing engine]]s were introduced. They were used in pairs, placed on either side of a field to haul a plow back and forth between them using a wire cable. These [[portable engine]]s were also used to power threshing machines, mills and pumps.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt; The portable steam engines were produced by specific agricultural machinery maker, such as [[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies]] who had started as brass and iron-founder making casting ploughshares late 18th century.

Late 19th century in Britain more companies such as [[Richard Garrett &amp; Sons]] and [[Mann’s Patent Steam Cart and Wagon Company]] developed [[steam tractor]]s for direct ploughing, but the heavy, wet soil of England meant that these designs were less economical than a team of horses. In the United States, where soil conditions permitted, steam tractors were used to direct-haul plows. Steam-powered agricultural engines remained in use well into the 20th century until reliable internal combustion engines had been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/machines_04.html|title=Tractors in the 1930s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins (1987) recalled that the impact of the agricultural machinery industry in the 19th century was still limited. He stated : "prior the third quarter of the nineteenth century the impact of machinery in agriculture was slight compared with that in manufacturing industry. Some operations such as barn work and hay and corn harvesting had been largely mechanized by 1880 but, up to the Second World War, many were still performed by hand labour and large numbers of workers were still required for seasonal tasks such as hop- and fruit-picking and vegetable cultivations."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Edward JT. "[http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/35n1a4.pdf The rationality of'surplus' agricultural labour: mechanization in English agriculture in the nineteenth century]." The Agricultural History Review (1987): 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
In the beginning of the 20th century in the UK the Agricultural machinery industry "although composed of many hundreds of firms, was dominated by a few large ones, chiefly in the eastern counties of England. The total output of the industry was estimated to be worth 6.5 million pounds in 1913, or about 5 percent of the total value of the output of the mechanical engineering industry at the first Census of Production in 1907."&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Peter. "The British Agricultural Machinery Industry, 1914-1939: Boom, Crisis, and Response." ''Agricultural History'' (1995): 298-313.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006016 027 IFA-Traktor mit Anbauwechselpflug.jpg|thumb|Agricultural exhibitions, 1951]]
In the first decennia the [[internal combustion engine]]; first the [[petrol engine]], and later [[diesel engine]]s; became the main source of [[power (physics)|power]] for the next generation of tractors. Early companies expanded into the tractor business, such as [[John Deere]] which bought the [[Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company]] in 1918, which manufactured the popular [[Waterloo Boy]] tractor. In the 1930s new technologies as rubber ties and hydrologics were introduced in tractors and other farm machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; The diesel engines also contributed to the development of the self-propelled, combined harvester and thresher, or [[combine harvester]] (also shortened to 'combine'). Instead of cutting the grain stalks and transporting them to a stationary threshing machine, these combines cut, threshed, and separated the grain while moving continuously through the field.

In the second part of the 20th century the production of agricultural machinery in development countries rose rapidly. In the 1960s a country as the UK exported more than 60% of its production to Western Europe, Australia, USA, Canada and South Africa, and main manufacturers started production plants abroad. Another trend was the increased concentration among manufacturers. In the 1970s in the UK six companies supplied 75% of the total output.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Cowling, David Metcalf, A. J. Rayner. (1973) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cKjYBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128 Resource Structure of Agriculture: An Economic Analysis],'' p. 127-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: World bank (1954) ''[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1954/06/1554374/western-europe-tractor-agricultural-machinery-industry Western Europe - Tractor and agricultural machinery industry].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The further mechanization of agriculture in the 20th century made possible by the agricultural machinery industry had a huge impact of the economic structure of society. In the developed countries the total labour force engaged in agriculture dropped from about 75% in 1800 to less than 5% late 20th century.&lt;ref name="G 92 p.9"&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries, in late 20th century still 75% of all land "was farmed with only hand-tools and draught-animal technology."&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey still 48% and in India 66.5% of the labor were working in agriculture, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] Production Yearbook 1990.&lt;ref name="G 92 p.9"/&gt;

=== 21st century ===
A 2013 report by the [[VDMA]] gave the following preview of the current developments in the agricultural machinery industry:
:"''The general trends in society, agriculture and technology allow conclusions about the future requirements profile for agricultural machinery... The depicted dominating topics for the agricultural sector are
:* ''Precision &amp; automation''
:* ''Efficiency &amp; user friendliness''
:* ''Communication &amp; networking''
:''These topics are today already central components of the specifications for new developments...''"&lt;ref&gt;[[VDMA]].  ''[http://www.vdma.org/documents/105903/842491/VDMA%20Market%20Perspectives%202014.pdf/9a9a7bef-4bb5-4d11-891e-934998177005 Agricultural Machinery November 2013 : Market Perspectives 2014]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},'' 2013-14. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agricultural machinery ==
{{Main|Agricultural machinery|List of agricultural machinery}}
The agricultural machinery industry produces [[agricultural machinery]], machinery used in the operation of agricultural areas and farms. Main types are:&lt;ref name="AA 2012"&gt;Ade Asefeso (2012). ''CEO Guide to Doing Business in Australia,'' p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tractor]]s and power.
* Machinery for  [[tillage]] or soil cultivation.
* Machinery for [[planting]], [[sowing|seeding]], [[fertilizing]], [[pest control]], [[irrigation]].
* Machinery for [[harvesting]], [[haymaking]], and post-harvest, such as produce sorters, and machinery for loading
* Machinery for milking
* Other agricultural machinery, for example grinder mixers, wool presses and [[windmill]]s.&lt;ref name="AA 2012"/&gt;
In developed countries overall the largest segment of agricultural equipment sales is tractors.&lt;ref name="AA 2012"/&gt;

== Agricultural machinery manufacturers ==
Agricultural machinery manufacturers exist in sizes from small and medium business to multinationals. James &amp; Akrasanee (1988) stipulated that those forms have different production management, and can be classified into three groups:
:* ''The first group consists of those workshops with limited and simple equipment. Despite their flexibility, the production management system is very rare in this case.''
:* ''The second group includes those with certain degrees of division of labour within the plant. They do organize some plant layout, but not in a fully systematic manner.''
:* ''The last group constitutes those with clear production lines and division of labour.''&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth James, Narongchai Akrasanee. ''Small and Medium Business Improvement in the ASEAN Region: Production Management.'' Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1 dec. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The two largest agricultural machinery manufacturers worldwide based on revenue (in 2012):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/257347/leading-machinery-manufacturers-worldwide/ The leading machinery manufacturers worldwide in 2012, based on revenue]. Accessed 25.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[John Deere]] : $37.79 billion revenues and employing 67,000 people worldwide in 2013. Its workforce has increased significantly in the past decennia from 43.000 in 2002 to 67.000 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/278010/john-deere-number-of-employees-since-2002/ Number of employees of John Deere (Deere &amp; Company) from 2002 to 2013]. Accessed 25.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CNH Global]] : $19.4 billion revenues and employing 33.800 people worldwide in 2013.

In the United States the revenue of tractor &amp; agricultural machinery manufacturing sector increased from about 35 billion U.S. dollars in 2009 to 42 billion U.S. dollars in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/291882/revenue-of-tractor-and-agricultural-machinery-manufacturing-in-the-us/ Revenue of tractor &amp; agricultural machinery manufacturing (NAICS 33311) in the United States from 2009 to 2014 (in billion U.S. dollars)]. Accessed 25.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agricultural machinery associations ==
Some of the more important agricultural machinery associations are:

* Agricultural Engineers Association (AEA): British trade association which represents manufacturers and importers of agricultural machinery and outdoor equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aea.uk.com/about-the-aea About the AEA. Accessed 27.11.2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Agrievolution: global network of agricultural machinery associations. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agrievolution.com/ Agrevolution website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810063122/http://www.agrievolution.com/ |date=August 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM): American association which represents manufacturers of agricultural machinery. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aem.org/ AEM website]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* CEMA: European association representing the agricultural machinery industry in Europe. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cema-agri.org/ CEMA website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* VDMA Agricultural Machinery Association: German manufacturers' association which represents manufacturers of agricultural machinery. &lt;ref&gt;[http://lt.vdma.org/en/home VDMA website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ANSEMAT Association of agricultural machinery manufacturers in Spain. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansemat.org/ ANSEMAT website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global agricultural machinery industry ==
According to the [[CEMA (European agricultural machinery)|CEMA]], the European association representing the European agricultural machinery industry, Europe was the largest producer of agricultural machinery globally in 2013:&lt;ref name="CEMA 2014"&gt;[[CEMA (European agricultural machinery)|CEMA]]. ''[http://cema-agri.org/publication/2013-another-strong-year-european-agricultural-machinery-industry 2013 another strong year for the European agricultural machinery industry].'' February 2014. Accessed 26.11.2014&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Europe produced 31% of the global production
* North America produced 26.5% of the global production, 
* China produced 26.5% of the global production, and
* The remaining 16% is produced elsewhere. 
In total, the production of agricultural machinery worldwide in 2013 generated about 95 billion euros,&lt;ref name="CEMA 2014"/&gt; based on a report ''Agricultural Machinery November 2013 : Market Perspectives 2014''&lt;ref&gt;VDMA. ''[http://www.vdma.org/documents/105903/842491/VDMA%20Market%20Perspectives%202014.pdf/9a9a7bef-4bb5-4d11-891e-934998177005 Agricultural Machinery November 2013 : Market Perspectives 2014]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},'' 2013-14. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[VDMA]], a German engineering association. Another recent statistic mentioned, that the agricultural machinery industry in 2010 generated worldwide about $56 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reportlinker.com/ci02002/Agricultural-Machinery.html Agricultural Machinery Industry Market Research &amp; Statistics]. Accessed 25.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agricultural machinery industry in Asia ===
Yuan'en (2007) stated, that the "Chinese government has attached great importance to agriculture, rural areas and farmers, made a series of policies that favorite to the farmers, added the financial subsidy to the agriculture, especially constituted the subsidy policies for the farmers on their agricultural machinery purchasing."&lt;ref&gt;Yuan’en, Gao, and Machinery Manufacturers. "Agricultural Machinery Industry in China." ''Chinese Association of Manufacturers of Agricultural Machinery'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013-2014 report acknowledged that "China's agricultural machinery industry has achieved rapid development, the gross output value of agricultural machinery exceeded RMB 300 billion, total power of agricultural machinery surpassed 1 billion kilowatts, and the integrated mechanization level of agricultural crops exceeded 50%, demonstrating that China has entered into a mechanized production-oriented period.... Tractors and harvesting machinery are the most important agricultural machinery products in China, with annual output of 2.25 million units and 1.114 million units in 2012 separately...'' &lt;ref&gt;Global and Chinese Agricultural Machinery Industry Report, 2013-2014,'' December 2013. Summary ( [http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/sqdz96/global_and online). Accessed 25.11.2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyanendra (2006) recalled, that "the early agricultural mechanization in [[India]] was greatly influenced by the technological development in England. Irrigation pumps, tillage equipment, chaff cutters, tractors and threshers were gradually introduced for farm mechanization. The high yielding varieties with assured irrigation and higher rate of application of fertilizers gave higher returns that enabled farmers to adopt mechanization inputs, especially after Green revolution in 1960s."&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Gyanendra. "[http://agricoop.nic.in/Farm%20Mech.%20PDF/05024-09.pdf Agricultural Machinery Industry in India (Manufacturing, marketing and mechanization promotion)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318191654/http://agricoop.nic.in/Farm%20Mech.%20PDF/05024-09.pdf |date=March 18, 2013 }}."

(2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish Ministry of Economy (2011) explained that "Turkey is one of the few countries of the world which is self-sufficient in food. At present Turkey is the largest producer and exporter of agricultural products in the Near East and North Africa... The agricultural machinery industry is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} about 1000 manufacturers countrywide.... Companies manufacturing agricultural machinery and equipment except tractors are mostly small and medium size companies. The sector employs about 15,000 workers... The value of agricultural machinery and spare parts and agricultural tractors and trailers exports was US$ 313 million in 2009."&lt;ref&gt;Turkish Ministry of Economy (2011), "[http://blog.tcp.gov.tr/index.php/2011/06/agricultural-machinery-industry-in-turkey-2/ Agricultural Machinery Industry in Turkey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205083750/http://blog.tcp.gov.tr/index.php/2011/06/agricultural-machinery-industry-in-turkey-2/ |date=December 5, 2014 }}" at ''blog.tcp.gov.tr,'' 01.06.2011.

=== Agricultural machinery industry in Europe ===
With a volume of 28 billion euros (2014) agricultural machinery production in the European Union (EU) represented 28 per cent of world total according to VDMA. Out of the EU total, the share of Germany is 27 per cent, followed by Italy (17 per cent) and France (14 per cent). All leading international manufacturers have several production sites on the European continent, and their products from these factories in general are destined for the high end customers who yield for efficiency and accuracy on the fields. 

The EU production of tractors was 187,000 units, correspondent to a value of 9.4 billion euros (2014). Outside the EU, a major production site for tractors is the Minsk Tractor Works (Belarus) with a high market share in the neighbouring countries, especially within the Commonwealth of Independent States. The leading countries for tractor production in the EU are Germany and Italy (with John Deere, Case New Holland, AGCO and Same Deutz-Fahr being the major brands). Germany is also the major place for the manufacturing of harvesting, spraying, fertilizing and seeding equipment. Italy and France have a primary position for soil working machines and transportation vehicles. The majority of the agricultural machinery companies are small and medium-sized and family owned. 

One third of the EU production is destined to markets outside the union, mainly to the Eastern European markets, but also to North America and, increasingly, to Asia.  

After a peak in 2003 and 29 billion euros of turnover, the sector experienced an economic downturn in 2014/2015. The strategy of the European industry is to keep its leading technological position and to diversify its market presence into the high potential regions (e.g. Asia).                 

=== Agricultural machinery industry in North America ===
The AEM (2014) stated that "U.S. domestic sales of agricultural machinery and equipment rose from about $20 billion in 1999 to $38 billion in 2012. Since 1998 and through 2012, U.S. exports of agricultural equipment have grown relatively quickly, more than doubling from about $4 billion to $8.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;AEM (2014) ''[http://www.aem.org/MarketInfo/MarketIntel/WhitePapers/EconomicFootprint-AgriculturalEquipmentIndustry/Files/AEM_Economic_Whitepaper.pdf The Economic Footprint of the Agricultural Equipment Industry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205044016/http://www.aem.org/MarketInfo/MarketIntel/WhitePapers/EconomicFootprint-AgriculturalEquipmentIndustry/Files/AEM_Economic_Whitepaper.pdf |date=December 5, 2014 }}.'' Whitepaper.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agricultural machinery industry in South America ===
Graciela summarized (2008) that "the agricultural machinery industry in [[Argentina]] depends for growth on higher exports and further progress towards internationalization, which are strategic goals for the largest firms. Given the dynamism of global demand for this type of machinery, the conclusion is that the sector can increase its sales in export markets, where some of its products are competing well."&lt;ref&gt;García, Graciela.

The elders of Amir Hossein Jahanshahi’s family belong to the [[Kara Koyunlu]] clan which has a 500 year history of governing a number of key provinces in Iran. Based in Tabriz, the ‘Gharghoyonlou’ ruled over significant sectors of contemporary Iran, including Azerbaijan, Khuzestan, Kerman, Fars and Heart as well as parts of present day Iraq. The last ‘Gharghoyonlou’ ruler was [[Jahan Shah]].

A number of personalities from this clan were religious figures [‘Mojtahid’], who were considered as noble and notable figures in Azerbaijan after the 8th century.

Following the establishment of ‘Adliehe Azam’ (Supreme Court) by Nasserdin Shah in the 19th century, these notables became leading members of the state judiciary. Prominent amongst these figures were ‘Mirza Mohammad Taghi Sadr Jahanshahi’ (the uncle of MirzaShafi Jahanshahi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasekhoon.net/mashahir/print-119183.aspx/|title=MirzaShafi Jahanshahi}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who headed the judiciary in Azarbaijan.

In 1946, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi’s grand father, Mirza Shafi Jahanshahi was appointed as the Head of Iran’s Supreme Court by Prime Minister ََ[[Ahmad Ghavam]] (‘Ghavomol-Saltaneh’).  In the course of the elections to the 15th Majles (1947), Mirza Shafi was also the Head of the Supervisory Group for the elections in Teheran. His father, [[Gholam Hossein Jahanshahi]] was elected to the 19th (1956) and 20th Majles (1960), as Deputy from Teheran and pursuant to that, in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Asadollah Alam]] in 1962, he was appointed as Minister of Trade. For a while, he also served as Deputy Head of the Pahlavi Foundation ([[Persian language|Persian]]:[[Wiktionary:fa:بنیاد پهلوی|بنیاد پهلوی]]).

His Maternal Grand Father was [[Khaz'al al-Ka'bi]] who was the governor of [[Khuzestan Province]] in the early 1920s.

== Business career ==

Amir Hossein Jahanshahi completed his education in France where he obtained degrees in Economics at the [[Panthéon-Assas University]]. Subsequent to completing his studies, he worked as a financial advisor and as a real estate developer in Paris, Madrid and Barcelona, before becoming a major stakeholder in large public companies such as [[Bouygues]], [[Havas]] and [[Vivendi]].

== Political career ==

Concerned adamantly about the rapid rise of radical fundamentalism in Iran and the Middle East, which he believes places the prospects of its future generations in serious jeopardy, his first book entitled, “Defeating the Third Totalitarianism” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vaincre-IIIe-totalitarisme-Amir-Jahanchahi/dp/2841143546/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403498280&amp;sr=1-2/|title=Defeating the Third Totalitarianism}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in December 2001 in the aftermath of ‘9/11’ attack on the World Trade Center in New York. The publication of his first book was followed by a series of articles published in major French newspapers and leading to the publication of his second book in September 2009, entitled “The Iranian Hitler – Putting anEnd to Ahmadinejad’s Dictatorship” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/LHitler-iranien-finir-dictature-dAhmadinejad/dp/2350131874/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403498280&amp;sr=1-1/|title=The Iranian Hitler – Putting anEnd to Ahmadinejad’s Dictatorship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A message published by the French newspaper, Le Figaro &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/editos/2009/10/06/01031-20091006ARTFIG00001-pour-la-deuxieme-republique-d-iran-.php/|title=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2009, calling on all Iranian opposition groups - inside and outside the country as well as those within the governing regime – to be prepared to work with one another in a united effort to overthrow the ‘Ahmadinejad regime’, marked the official entrance of Jahanshahi into the political fray.

In March 2010, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi launched Green Wave with a new political agenda committed to serving the Iranian nation and preventing regional war and instability.

== Iranian TV Documentaries Concerning Jahanshahi and Green Wave ==

Jahanshahi and Green Wave soon became the main targets of the Iranian state’s propaganda machine in the administration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Worried about activities pursued by Jahanshahi’s innovative outlook, commitment and dedication for achieving his objectives, in an unprecedented move not seen before, the Iranian State Television in 2011-2013 produced a total of three separate documentaries (‘Almase Farib’ I &amp; II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE3HnkXR_y/|title=Almase Farib}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011 and 2012) and (‘Triangle’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwb7GoBPtkk/|title=Triangle}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013) to directly damage and derail the activities of Green Wave in order to foil its activities aimed at promoting popular change in Iran and ending the scourge of radical fundamentalism in the region and beyond.

== The Launch of ‘Raha TV’==

In September 2012, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi launched the first major opposition TV channel in London. ‘Raha’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rahatv.tv//|title=Raha TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; (‘to free’) is dedicated to ‘change’ and is run by Iranian journalists who have recently left Iran as well as some working inside the country.

At Raha’s official launch in October 2012, Jahanshahi stated that “At this critical juncture in the history of Iran and the region people will want to watch in order to get news and analysis that they can trust as unbiased”. However, because ‘Raha TV’ poses a major challenge to policies carried out by hardliners and extremists within the ruling establishment, some of its transmissions have been subject to blockage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kalame.co/faqs/15-1389-08-21-19-49-27/20871-%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%B2%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%8C-%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B4-%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85.html/|title=kalame.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; though these activities have at no time deterred ‘Raha’ from overcoming these obstacles and getting its message to the Iranian people.

== National Reconciliation and Economic Reconstruction ==

In line with his consistent concern that political change should never be sought at a cost of either subjecting the country to the threat of a destructive external military conflict or a situation of internal mayhem and civil war, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi supported the candidacy of Hassan Rouhani in the presidential election of June 2013, using all his various resources both inside and outside Iran. Later, on 26 September 2013, following the publication of a ‘Full Page Message’ printed in the International Herald Tribune &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://organization.greenwavenews.com/journal/1405/|title=Herald Tribune|access-date=2014-10-15|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140518055302/http://organization.greenwavenews.com/journal/1405/|archive-date=2014-05-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (coinciding with the presence of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the General Assembly of the UN), he advanced a new initiative aimed at promoting ‘national reconciliation’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/mon-figaro/2014/02/07/10001-20140207ARTFIG00353-amir-jahanchahi-mon-plaidoyer-pour-la-reconciliation-nationale-en-iran.php/|title=lefigaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst contending factions that wish to retain centuries old traditions and the youth who are seeking a modern and progressive Iran.

Committed to the future rise of the Iranian people and aspiring to attain for Iran its rightful place in the community of nations consistent with its past history and great civilization, Jahanshahi has stressed the importance of [[economic reconstruction]] as a catalyst for future prosperity as well as the best guarantor for the establishment of a just and democratic order in Iran. 

Placing ‘economic reconstruction’ at the top of all priorities, Jahanshahi has sought the cooperation of those anxious to retain the status quo and those committed to the construction of a different Iran, to come together with the explicit eventual aim of establishing reconciliation between civil society and government for the sake of restoring Iran’s damaged economic and social structures, thus allowing it to attain its rightful place amongst the top ten economies of the world within a single decade. 

=== Inviting ‘Real Madrid’ to Iran ===

In the aftermath of his call for ‘National Reconciliation’, at his behest on the birthday of the ‘Prophet of Islam’ (in 2014), his close friend, the president of the ‘Real Madrid’ football club, in what was widely covered &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isna.ir/fa/news/92110402085/%D8%B1%D8%A6%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%B0%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D9%BE%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%BE%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D9%88-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D9%BE%D8%B1%D8%B3/|title=isna.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Iranian media, accepted his proposal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=646140635431907&amp;set=a.463272353718737.107926.453766961335943&amp;type=1&amp;theater/|title=Perspolis vs Real Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to enter into direct into negotiations with the appropriate Iranian authorities, so that the European Club Champions may visit Iran and play a friendly match against the popular Iranian side [[Persepolis F.C.]] for the benefit of the Iranian people.

=== Return to Iran ===

In order to implement the much need reconstruction of the Iranian economy, as well as securing some of the country’s most immediate vital requirements for the promotion of such a mission, in an interview with the French daily, Le Figaro on 7 February  2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/mon-figaro/2014/02/07/10001-20140207ARTFIG00353-amir-jahanchahi-mon-plaidoyer-pour-la-reconciliation-nationale-en-iran.php/|title=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Hossein Jahanshahi announced that he was willing to return to Iran without any precondition so that this important ‘national mission could be pursued with the Iranian people. He said that Iran belonged to all Iranians and relieving the hardships placed on the lives of all citizens while securing the country’s immediate needs was a critical requirement. According to Jahanshahi, preventing the kind of violence and social and economic catastrophes witnessed in countries like Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Egypt was a key priority and, as such, it was the duty for all Iranians who wanted to see their country restore its pride, dignity and former greatness.

=== ‘BAAM’, an umbrella for supporting economic reconstruction and national reconciliation in Iran ===

In the course of a press conference held in Paris on 20th November 2014, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi announced &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://organization.greenwavenews.com/en/journal/655|title=Green Wave|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141211195947/http://organization.greenwavenews.com/en/journal/655|archive-date=2014-12-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he would be ending his 35 years of exile and returning to Iran no later than Spring 2015. He said, In line with my natural obligations given these new circumstances, it is my intention that all my activities should be conducted in a framework that is in compliance with the laws of our country”.In a subsequent statement released in the aftermath of the Press Conference held on 20 November, on 8 December 2014, he announced  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://organization.greenwavenews.com/en/journal/689|title=Green Wave}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in light of these developments, Dr. Mehrdad Khonsari, the Secretary General of ‘Green Wave’, had, therefore suggested the dissolution of Green Wave, which he had accepted. Amir Hossein Jahanshahi, having at the same time announced the creation of the newly established Organization for ‘Economic Reconstruction and National Reconciliation’ (‘BAAM”), said that he had invited Dr. [[Mehrdad Khonsari]] to become the Secretary General of the new organization. This organization is to serve as an umbrella for providing support for economic reconstruction and national reconciliation in a framework that is in compliance with the laws of the country.

=== Broadcasts by Raha TV to Iran will come to an end ===

In a statement released by his office on 19 December 2014, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi announced &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvraha.com/index.php/component/k2/item/1153-2014-12-20-07-01-07/|title=Raha TV|access-date=2015-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131102349/http://www.tvraha.com/index.php/component/k2/item/1153-2014-12-20-07-01-07|archive-date=2015-01-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in conjunction with his decision for returning to Iran and conducting his activities in compliance with the laws of the country, the activities of Raha TV will cease at the end of 2014. Having said that three years before, Raha TV had been established as a fully independent and free Iranian media channel in the field of 'news and analysis', Jahanshahi expressed the hope that conclusion at this point will spark the start of a new beginning so that this television station may resume its activities at a time of economic development and prosperity and in compliance with the laws of Iran.

==Biography==
Ashkan Pouya was ten years old when he left [[Iran]] and moved to Hallstahammar in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&amp;news_item=5419{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ashkan Pouya has a degree in Economics from Uppsala University.  He has been doing further studies in innovation and management at Queens University in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;'http://www.organoclick.com/index.php/management-board.42.html&lt;/ref&gt; and also at WHU-Otto Besheim School of Management in Germany.

=="Phantom Innovation" and the "Creative Dance"==
In 2008, Ashkan Pouya published together with his colleague [[Saeid Esmaeilzadeh]] the paper “Phantom innovation-  a launching pad for innovation processes”  that explores the non-linearity of innovation processes. In the context of the publication they coined the term "Phantom Innovation" suggesting that an initial idea or a technical solution in their native form often differ from what eventually will be the innovation that provides real economic value to the community and the company. Their conclusion suggests that the initial innovation often changes during the path of commercialization ("the creative dance") and is introduced to a different market or fulfilling a different need than initially intended. Therefore, Ashkan chose to name the initial idea or solution for “Phantom Innovations” since they were thought of as innovations but did in retrospect contribute other values to the process. 

In 2008 the duo received first prize "Best Student Paper" for their publication "Phantom Innovations-a launching pad for innovation processes" at the ISPIM Conference (The International Society for Professional Innovation Management) Innovations symposium in Singapore.

==Serendipity Group==

==Biography==
Björgólfur (see [[Icelandic name]] customs) comes from [[Grenivík]] in the north of Iceland, close to [[Akureyri]]. He graduated with a degree in [[Business Administration]] from the [[University of Iceland]] in 1983 and became a [[Chartered Accountant]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="icelandairgroup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icelandairgroup.com/our-company/management/group-management/|title=Group Management &amp;#124; Icelandairgroup.is|publisher=icelandairgroup.com|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980 to 1992 he worked for accountancy firms in Akureyri.

In 1992 Björgólfur became [[Chief Financial Officer]] of the fisheries company Útgerðarfélag Akureyringa hf, but in 1996 moved to the powerful [[Samherji]] fisheries company, also based in Akureyri, where he became Director of Innovation and Development.&lt;ref name="samherji"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samherji.is/|title=Samherji hf.|publisher=samherji.is|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Björgólfur became Chief Executive Officer of yet another fisheries company, Síldarvinnslan. Then in 2006 he was chosen as the new CEO of Icelandic Group, a global sales and marketing company for frozen fish products.&lt;ref name="icelandicgroup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icelandicgroup.com/|title=icelandicgroup.com|publisher=icelandicgroup.com|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2003 to 2008 Björgólfur was also the President of The Federation of Icelandic Fishing Vessel Owners (LIU), a very powerful position in Iceland.&lt;ref name="LiuEnglish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liu.is/english/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027230119/http://www.liu.is/english/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-10-27|title=General information - Landssamband íslenskra útvegsmanna|publisher=liu.is|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 he became CEO of [[Icelandair Group]].&lt;ref name="icelandairgroup2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icelandairgroup.com/|title=Icelandair Group|publisher=icelandairgroup.com|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis]] proved a great challenge for Björgólfur&lt;ref name="vb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vb.is/frett/58883/|title=Viðskiptablaðið - Björgólfur Jóhannsson: Icelandair Group í stakk búið til að mæta samkeppni|publisher=vb.is|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his staff but after a financial reconstruction of the company, completed in 2011, he insisted the future looks bright, as the rise in [[tourism in Iceland]] bodes well for the company.&lt;ref name="eyjan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vefir.eyjan.is/vidtalid/2011/05/13/bjorgolfur-johannsson-forstjori-icelandair-group/|title=Björgólfur Jóhannsson forstjóri Icelandair Group: "Ferðamennskan verður okkar mikilvægasta atvinnugrein" &amp;laquo;  Laugardagsviðtalið með Birni Inga|publisher=vefir.eyjan.is|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2013 Björgólfur was elected the Chairman of the Board of the SA, the Confederation of Icelandic Employers,&lt;ref name="WwwEnglish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sa.is/english/|title=SA-Confederation of Icelandic Employers - Samtök atvinnulífsins|publisher=sa.is|accessdate=2014-01-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110140123/http://www.sa.is/english/|archivedate=2014-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a very influential position in Iceland. He received 98,5 percent of the votes.&lt;ref name="ruv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/bjorgolfur-kjorinn-formadur-sa|title=Björgólfur kjörinn formaður SA &amp;#124; RÚV|publisher=ruv.is|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Www5777"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sa.is/frettir/almennar/nr/5777/|title=Formaður SA: Baráttan gegn verðbólgu stærsta hagsmunamálið - Fréttir - Samtök atvinnulífsins|publisher=sa.is|accessdate=2014-01-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110140307/http://www.sa.is/frettir/almennar/nr/5777/|archivedate=2014-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 April 2014 Björgólfur was re-elected.&lt;ref name="vb3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vb.is/frettir/103804/|title=Björgólfur endurkjörinn formaður SA - Viðskiptablaðið|website=vb.is|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As chairman of the SA, Björgólfur took an active part in negotiations with the ASÍ, the [[Icelandic Federation of Labour]], in December 2013, resulting in attempts to maintain the fragile economic stability of [[Icelandic financial crisis|post-crash Iceland]].&lt;ref name="visir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visir.is/segir-samninginn-marka-nytt-upphaf-i-kjarabarattunni/article/2013131229793|title=Segir samninginn marka n&amp;#xFD;tt upphaf &amp;#xED; kjarabar&amp;#xE1;ttunni|website=Visir|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014 both SA and ASÍ joined forces with other important players in the Icelandic economic arena in presenting a comprehensive report of the Icelandic Institute of International Affairs about the state of [[Accession of Iceland to the European Union|Iceland's accession negotiations]] with the [[European Union|EU]], a hugely controversial issue in Iceland.&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IIA_EU_Iceland_Report_Executive-Summary.pdf|title=Iceland's Accession Negotiations|publisher=Institute of International Affairs, University of Iceland|author=Jón Gunnar Ólafsson|date=2014-04-10 |accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SAGE Commission submitted a final report with recommendations on October 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.bm/uploadedFiles/Content/Home/SAGE%20Commission%20Final%20Report.pdf/|website=Parliament.bm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances}}
'''Capital allowances''' is the practice of allowing a company to get tax relief on tangible capital expenditure by allowing it to be expensed against its annual pre-tax income.  Generally, the capital allowances will exist for only specified items of tangible capital expenditure, and the expensing is usually spread over a fixed period of years. The term is used in the UK and in Ireland. 

Unusually, the Irish corporate tax system has a [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances for intangible assets]] scheme which allows [[intangible assets]] to be expensed against Irish pre-tax income.  It is a key Irish [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) tool that U.S. multinationals use to achieve Irish corporate [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rates]] of &lt;3%, and was used by Apple in Ireland in 2015 ([[leprechaun economics]]).  

Capital allowances are in contrast with depreciation, which is not allowed as a deduction for tax purposes, and must be added back to net profit for tax purposes. If capital expenditure does not qualify for a capital allowance, then it means that the business gets no tax relief on such expenditure.

Capital allowances were introduced in the UK in 1946 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual/ca10040|title = HMRC Capital Allowances Manual|date = |accessdate = November 27, 2018 |website = |publisher = HMRC |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be claimed for:

Historically, there have also been capital allowances for industrial and agricultural buildings. These have now been phased out, though an allowance may now be claimed for features integral to a building &lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant and machinery ==
Of these, by far the most important category is plant and machinery.

Neither term is defined in legislation, though guidance is given by HMRC &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual|title = HMRC Capital Allowances Manual|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This defined machinery as anything that has a moving part. It does not have to be mechanically powered, so a hand operated device qualifies.

The term "plant" is defined in the court case ''Yarmouth v France'' &lt;ref&gt;CA 1887, 19 QBD 647&lt;/ref&gt; which was not a tax case. This held that plant "includes whatever apparatus is used by a businessman for carrying on his business - not his stock in trade, which he buys or makes for sale; but all goods and chattels, fixede or dead, which he keeps for permanent employment in his business". In that case, it was held that his employer's horse was plant.

The scope of exactly what comes within the scope has been the subject of many cases. Among the more important cases, the following have been held to be plant: 
* a shoe maker's knife that lasted for two years, but not one that lasted for less than two years &lt;ref&gt;Hinton v Maden &amp; Ireland. HL [1959] 38 TC 391.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a large dry dock, which was held to be equipment rather than premises &lt;ref&gt;CIR v Barclay Curle &amp; Co Ltd. HL [1969] 45 TC 221&lt;/ref&gt; 
* swimming pools at a caravan park &lt;ref&gt;Cooke v Beach Station Caravans Ltd. Ch D [1974] 49 TC 514&lt;/ref&gt; 
* artificial football pitch, held not to be part of the premises &lt;ref&gt;CIR v Anchor International Ltd. CS [2004] 77 TC 38&lt;/ref&gt; 
* grain silos &lt;ref&gt;Schofield v R &amp; H Hall Ltd. CA(NI) [1974] 49 TC 538&lt;/ref&gt; 
* law books owned by a barrister &lt;ref&gt;Munby v Furlong. CA. [1977] 50 TC 491&lt;/ref&gt; 
* gazebo for smokers in the garden of a pub &lt;ref&gt;Mrs C A Andrews v HMRC. FTT [2010] TC 799&lt;/ref&gt; 
* decorative screens in the window of building society branches.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds Permanent Building Society v Proctor. Ch D [1982] 56 TC 293&lt;/ref&gt; 
Where a capital allowances claim has been made on a property a new purchaser can only make another claim valuing the plant and machinery at the same rate as claimed previously. Further claims can be made on a property where it is extended or re-developed but only on those new elements of plant and machinery introduced to the building.

The amount of the allowance depends on what is claimed for. In some cases, the rates are different in the year a business entity made the purchase from those in subsequent years.

A business operator cannot claim capital allowances for things bought or sold: these are claimed as business expenses. If a business asset is bought on a [[hire purchase]] basis, the original cost of the item can be claimed as a capital allowance, but the interest and other charges count as business expenses.

== Types of allowance ==
The main types of capital allowance are:
* annual investment allowance (AIA) introduced from 1 April 2008 &lt;ref&gt;Capital Allowances Act 2001 s38A&lt;/ref&gt;
* first year allowance (FYA)
* writing down allowance (WDA).
* balancing allowance (BA).
AIA is claimed for plant and machinery, with some exceptions such as for cars. It is fixed amount regardless of the size of the business and so is worth proportionately more for smaller businesses. The amount has varied many times since its introduction. In the 2015 summer Budget it was announced that it would be fixed at £200,000 until 2020.

FYA may be claimed in the tax year in which the asset was acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Capital Allowances Act 2001 s52&lt;/ref&gt; It has largely been replaced by AIA. It may still be claimed for certain energy-saving products.

WDA applies to such amounts of allowable expenditure that are not relieved by either AIA or FYA. Broadly it requires all assets to be put into either a general pool, a special pool or a single-asset pool. Assets in the general pool are written down at 18% while those in the special pool are written down at 8%. An asset in a single-asset pool is written down at either 8% or 18% depending on its nature. The advantage is that, on disposal, the whole of the written down value may be offset against taxable profits. The whole balance of a pool may be written off if it falls below £1,000.

BA applies when a business ceases.

==Technical considerations==

Capital allowance reliefs can be set against the client’s taxable profits reducing the amount payable. Companies pay [[Corporation Tax]] at 19% (2018 figure&lt;ref&gt;HMRC website https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-corporation-tax/rates-and-allowances-corporation-tax&lt;/ref&gt;), whilst individuals pay tax at 20%, 40% or 45%. Please note as it is an allowance against taxable profit, you have to be a tax payer to benefit, therefore this does not normally apply to property owned in SIPPS or by charities and trusts. 
Allowances are generated when a business client builds or acquires commercial property. The amount of plant contained within the building or acquired property is the key to maximising the relief.

The claim should be considered as an effective discount and cash contribution to the construction cost or purchase price. The claim provides a tax saving that accrues over time. It is possible to claim allowances on investment properties but plant let in a "dwelling house" is excluded. Blocks of flats, halls of residence etc. will therefore qualify.

For property that is being acquired, the specialist can apportion the purchase price under a recognised HMRC formula, and this is where the inherent property skill can maximise the claim with optimal costing of the plant contained within the property

A '''company mortgage''' (Företagshypotek) is a particular Swedish collateral right, which replaced the company [[Personal property|chattel]] pledge (Företagsinteckning) : on January 1, 2009.

A company or a (natural or legal) person that intends to run a business can pledge a company mortgage by registering a specific amount in the corporate mortgage register. The pledge is not tied to a particular property at a particular point in time. Instead the property can change over time. The idea behind this is the entrepreneur's personal property can be used as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] for credit without him or her having to give up having the assets at his or her disposal.

The register is kept by the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Bolagsverket), which issues proof of the registered pledge, called a mortgage letter (Inteckningsbrev). This proof can be either written or electronic. A written mortgage letter is pledged when the businessman hands it over as collateral to a creditor. An electronic mortgage letter is deemed to be pledged when the creditor has been registered as the bearer (holder) of the mortgage letter.

The company mortgage gives special priority rights on a businessman’s personal property that belongs to the business other than cash or bank funds, stock or other publicly traded [[financial instrument]]s, property that cannot be seized or be included in a bankruptcy, or property that can be pledged in other ways, such as aircraft and ships during both the seizure of assets and bankruptcy under §5 of the Priority Rights Act (Förmånsrättslagen). A company mortgage pledged before another company mortgage has priority. Company mortgages pledged on the same day have equal rights. At the request of the bearer of a company mortgage letter, the holding can be registered in the corporate mortgage register.

A decision by the registration authority may be appealed to District Court ([[Tingsrätt]]). In the appeal the Act on Court Cases (Lagen om Domstolsärenden) is applied. Anyone wishing to appeal a decision of the registration authority should do so in writing. The letter must be submitted to the registration authority.

The provisions relating to the company mortgage imply a return to the rules on company mortgages that applied before 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8870">'''Constant elasticity of substitution''' ('''CES'''), in [[economics]], is a property of some [[production function]]s and [[utility function]]s.

Specifically, it arises in a particular type of aggregator function which combines two or more types of consumption goods, or two or more types of production inputs into an aggregate quantity. This aggregator function exhibits constant [[elasticity of substitution]].

==CES production function==
The CES [[production function]] is a [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical production function]] that displays constant [[elasticity of substitution]]. In other words, the production technology has a constant percentage change in factor (e.g. [[Manual labour|labour]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]) proportions due to a percentage change in [[marginal rate of technical substitution]]. The two factor (capital, labor) CES production function introduced by [[Robert Solow|Solow]],&lt;ref name="Solow1956"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Solow|first=R.M |year=1956 |title=A contribution to the theory of economic growth |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=70 |pages=65–94 |doi=10.2307/1884513}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later made popular by [[Kenneth Arrow|Arrow]], [[Hollis B. Chenery|Chenery]], [[Bagicha Singh Minhas|Minhas]], and [[Robert Solow|Solow]] is:&lt;ref name="Arrow1961"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arrow |first=K. J. |authorlink= |author2=Chenery, H. B. |author3=Minhas, B. S. |author4= Solow, R. M.  |year=1961 |title=Capital-labor substitution and economic efficiency |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=225–250  |jstor=1927286|doi=10.2307/1927286 |publisher=The MIT Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jorgensen2000"&gt;{{cite book |title=Econometrics, vol. 1: Econometric Modelling of Producer Behavior |last=Jorgensen |first=Dale W. |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-262-10082-7 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klump"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klump |first=R |authorlink= |author2=McAdam, P |author3=Willman, A.  |year=2007 |title=Factor Substitution and Factor Augmenting Technical Progress in the US: A Normalized Supply-Side System Approach |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=183–192|publisher=The MIT Press |doi=10.1162/rest.89.1.183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Q =  F\cdot \left(a \cdot K^r+(1-a) \cdot L^r\right)^{\frac{1}{r}} &lt;/math&gt;

where

*      &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; = Quantity of output
*      &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; = [[Total_factor_productivity|Factor productivity]]
*      &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; = Share parameter
*      &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = Quantities of primary production factors (Capital and Labor)
*      &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{\frac{(s-1)}{s}}&lt;/math&gt;
*      &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{\frac{1}{(1-r)}}&lt;/math&gt; = Elasticity of substitution.

As its name suggests, the CES production function exhibits constant elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. Leontief, linear and Cobb–Douglas functions are special cases of the CES production function.  That is, 
* If &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt; we have a [[linear utility|linear]] or perfect substitutes function; 
* If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; approaches zero in the limit, we get the [[Cobb–Douglas production function|Cobb–Douglas]] production function;
* If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; approaches negative infinity we get the [[Leontief production function|Leontief]] or perfect complements production function.

The general form of the CES production function, with ''n'' inputs, is:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/GraduateTheoryUCSB/elasticity%20of%20substitutionrevised.tex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Q =  F \cdot \left[\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i}X_{i}^{r}\ \right]^{\frac{1}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

*      &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; = Quantity of output
*      &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; = Factor productivity
*      &lt;math&gt;a_{i}&lt;/math&gt; = Share parameter of input i, &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n a_{i} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
*      &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; = Quantities of factors of production (i = 1,2...n)
*      &lt;math&gt;s=\frac{1}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt; = Elasticity of substitution.

Extending the CES (Solow) functional form to accommodate multiple factors of production creates some problems. However, there is no completely general way to do this. [[Hirofumi Uzawa|Uzawa]] showed the only possible n-factor production functions (n&gt;2) with constant partial elasticities of substitution require either that all elasticities between pairs of factors be identical, or if any differ, these all must equal each other and all remaining elasticities must be unity.&lt;ref name="Uzawa1962"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uzawa|first=H|year=1962 |title=Production functions with constant elasticities of substitution |journal=Review of Economic Studies|volume=29 |pages=291–299 | doi = 10.2307/2296305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is true for any production function.  This means the use of the CES functional form for more than 2 factors will generally mean that there is not constant elasticity of substitution among all factors.

Nested CES functions are commonly found in [[partial equilibrium]]  and [[general equilibrium]] models. Different nests (levels) allow for the introduction of the appropriate elasticity of substitution.

==CES utility function==
The same CES functional form arises as a utility function in [[consumer theory]]. For example, if there exist &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; types of consumption goods &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, then aggregate consumption &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; could be defined using the CES aggregator:

:&lt;math&gt; X = \left[\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i}^{\frac{1}{s}}x_{i}^{\frac{s-1}{s}}\ \right]^{\frac{s}{s-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here again, the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are share parameters, and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the elasticity of substitution. Therefore, the consumption goods &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are perfect substitutes when &lt;math&gt;s &lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity and perfect complements when &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; approaches zero. The CES aggregator is also sometimes called the ''Armington aggregator'', which was discussed by [[Paul Armington|Armington]] (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Armington |first=P. S. |authorlink= |year=1969 |title=A theory of demand for products distinguished by place of production |journal=IMF Staff Papers |volume=16 |issue= |pages=159–178  |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.2307/3866403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CES utility functions are a special case of [[homothetic preferences]].

The following is an example of a CES utility function for two goods, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;,  with equal shares:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Varian Microeconomic Analysis 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|112}}
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,y) =(x^r + y^r)^{1/r}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[expenditure function]] in this case is:
:&lt;math&gt;e(p_x,p_y,u) =(p_x^r + p_y^r)^{1/r} \cdot u,\quad r=\frac{s}{s-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[indirect utility function]] is its inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;v(p_x,p_y,I) =(p_x^r + p_y^r)^{-1/r} \cdot I,\quad r=\frac{s}{s-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[demand function]]s are:
:&lt;math&gt;x(p_x,p_y,I) = \frac{p_x^{1/(r-1)}}{p_x^{r/(r-1)} + p_y^{r/(r-1)}}\cdot I,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(p_x,p_y,I) = \frac{p_y^{1/(r-1)}}{p_x^{r/(r-1)} + p_y^{r/(r-1)}}\cdot I.&lt;/math&gt;

A CES utility function is one of the cases considered by [[Avinash Dixit|Dixit]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz|Stiglitz]] (1977) in their study of optimal product diversity in a context of [[monopolistic competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dixit |first=Avinash |last2=Stiglitz |first2=Joseph |year=1977 |title=Monopolistic Competition and Optimum Product Diversity |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=297–308 |jstor=1831401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note the difference between CES utility and [[isoelastic utility]]: the CES utility function is an [[ordinal utility]] function that represents preferences on sure consumption commodity bundles, while the isoelastic utility function is a [[cardinal utility]] function that represents preferences on lotteries. A CES indirect (dual) utility function has been used to derive utility-consistent brand demand systems where category demands are determined endogenously by a multi-category, CES indirect (dual) utility function. It has also been shown that CES preferences are self-dual and that both primal and dual CES preferences yield systems of indifference curves that may exhibit any degree of convexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baltas | first1 = George | year = 2001 | title = Utility-Consistent Brand Demand Systems with Endogenous Category Consumption: Principles and Marketing Applications | url = | journal = Decision Sciences | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 399–421 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-5915.2001.tb00965.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  [[accounting]], the '''convention of conservatism''', also known as the '''doctrine of prudence''', is a policy of anticipating possible future losses but not future gains. This policy tends to understate rather than overstate net assets and net income, and therefore lead companies to . When given a choice between several outcomes where the probabilities of occurrence are equally likely, you should recognize that transaction resulting in the lower amount of profit, or at least the deferral of a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/14/the-conservatism-principle}}&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref name="Ahmed2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naseem Ahmed|title=Financial Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmiXKF8dRcIC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=2008|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0993-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In accounting, it states that when choosing between two solutions, the one that will be least likely to overstate assets and income should be selected. Essentially, "expected losses are losses but expected gains are not gains".

The conservatism principle is the foundation for the lower of cost or market rule, which states that you should record inventory at the lower of either its acquisition cost or its current market value.

Conservatism plays an important role in a number of accounting rules, including the allowance for [[doubtful debt]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Scott B.|last2=Liu|first2=Xiaotao (kelvin)|date=2010-06-01|title=The Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, Conservatism, and Earnings Management|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00364.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Accounting Research|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=565–601|doi=10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00364.x|issn=1475-679X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[lower of cost or market]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accountingcoach.com/lower-of-cost-or-market/explanation|title=Lower of Cost or Market (LCM) {{!}} Explanation {{!}} AccountingCoach|website=AccountingCoach.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corporate group''' or '''group of companies''' is a collection of parent and subsidiary [[corporations]] that function as a single economic entity through a common source of control. The concept of a group is frequently used in [[tax law]], [[accounting]] and (less frequently) company law to attribute the rights and duties of one member of the group to another or the whole. If the corporations are engaged in entirely different businesses, the group is called a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. The forming of corporate groups usually involves [[consolidation (business)|consolidation]] via [[mergers and acquisitions]], although the group concept focuses on the instances in which the merged and acquired corporate entities remain in existence rather than the instances in which they are dissolved by the parent. The group may be owned by a [[holding company]] which may have no actual operations.

In Germany, where a sophisticated law of the "[[Concern (business)|concern]]" has been developed, the [[law]] of corporate groups is a fundamental aspect of its [[corporate law]]. Many other European jurisdictions also have a similar approach, while [[Commonwealth]] countries and the [[United States]] adhere to a formalistic doctrine that refuses to "[[pierce the corporate veil]]": corporations are treated outside tax and accounting as wholly separate legal entities.

==Legal independence==
{{Main|Separate legal personality|Piercing the corporate veil}}
A corporate group is composed of companies. The general rule is that a company is a separate legal entity from its shareholders, that is the shareholder's liability for the subsidiary's debts is limited to the value of the shares,&lt;ref name="Salomon"&gt;[[Salomon v Salomon]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the shareholders cannot be required to perform the company's obligations.

However, some jurisdictions create exceptions to this rule. For example, Germany has created [[Concern (business)|affiliated enterprise law]] which provides situations in which one company is liable for the debts of another company. In New Zealand, the Companies Act provides that the assets of related companies may be pooled to pay the creditors if one of the companies is liquidated. However, the circumstances in which this power will be exercised are very narrow.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Holdings Ltd vs Steel &amp; Tube Holdings Ltd [2014] NZHC 3311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Leff&lt;ref&gt;Leff 1978:663&lt;/ref&gt; defines '''business group''' as a group of companies that does business in different markets under common administrative or financial control whose members are linked by relations of interpersonal trust on the basis of similar personal ethnic or commercial background. One method of defining a group is as a cluster of legally distinct firms with a managerial relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesrmaclean.com/archives/archive_business_groups.html Business Groups: Between Market and Firm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319084048/http://www.jamesrmaclean.com/archives/archive_business_groups.html |date=2006-03-19 }} by James R.

Abstract accessed May 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the firms in a group may be formal or informal.&lt;ref name=Granovetter&gt;Granovetter, M.

Encarnation&lt;ref&gt;Encarnation 1989:45&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Indian business houses, emphasizing multiple forms of ties among group members. Powell and Smith-Doerr&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Doerr 1994:388&lt;/ref&gt; state that a business group is a network of firms that regularly collaborate over a long time period. Granovetter&lt;ref name=Granovetter/&gt; argues that business groups refers to an intermediate level of binding, excluding on the one hand a set of firms bound merely by short-term alliances and on the other a set of firms legally consolidated into a single unit. Williamson&lt;ref&gt;Williamson 1975, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; claims that business groups lie between markets and hierarchies; this is further worked out by [[Sytse Douma|Douma]] &amp; Schreuder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sytse Douma]] &amp; [[Hein Schreuder]] (2013) "Economic Approaches to Organizations", 5th edition, London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page&lt;/ref&gt; Khanna and Rivkin&lt;ref&gt;Khanna and Rivkin 1999&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that business groups are typically not legal constructs though some regulatory bodies have attempted to codify a definition. In the [[United Arab Emirates]], a business group can also be known as a [[trade association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abudhabichamber.ae/User/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsId=863 Abudhabichamber.ae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112034343/http://www.abudhabichamber.ae/User/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsId=863 |date=2008-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples are [[Adidas|Adidas Group]] or [[Icelandair Group]].

A commercial [[company]] may choose to list its [[share (finance)|share]]s in a [[stock exchange]] of a country other than that in which the company is based. This practice is known as "cross-border listing" or "cross-listing". Firms may adopt cross-border listing to obtain advantages that include lower cost of capital, expanded global shareholder base, greater liquidity in the trading of shares, prestige and publicity. Decision makers also need to be satisfied that the benefits exceed possible costs, such as listing costs, exposure to legal liabilities, taxes and various trading frictions, and reconciliation of financial statements with varying national standards.&lt;ref name=karolyi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karolyi|title=The world of cross-listing and cross-listing of the world: Challenging conventional wisdom’|journal=Review of Finance|year=2006|volume= 10|pages=99–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Karolyi A., 2006,)

==Financial gains ==
Existing regulation in local capital market like [[taxes]], information asymmetry and foreign ownership restrictions usually act as barriers and prevent foreign investors entering those markets. In addition, local investors in segmented domestic capital markets in order to undertake the risk tighten to the local market usually require a risk premium. In order to counter these problem domestic firms can adopt policies such as listing in a foreign exchange in order to offset the negative effects of market segmentation and offer several other straightforward advantages that stem from lower transaction costs (Khurana et al., 2005). Further more, cross border listing serves as a mean for foreign investors to save any transaction costs associated with dealing in a foreign currency as well as to effectively bend any existing foreign exchange regulations since they are allowed to trade share in their own [[currency]]. Taken into account that cross-listing serves to lower barriers to foreign investment cross-border listing serves effectively in reducing the firms costs related to market segmentation and therefore lowers the cost of external financing  (Alexander et al. cited in Khurana et al., 2005).

==Bonding ==
The ability to prevent shareholders or managers to acquire private benefits from their firms is an important aspect of corporate governance since it represents an important source of potential conflict with public shareholders.  After all the rationale of raising external capital must be towards that it must be raised only after management's commitment to return this capital to investors and not to extract it for the controlling shareholders' personal use (Karolyi, 2006). Stulz (1999) as cited in Karolyi (2006), placed emphasis on the potential agency conflicts and information asymmetry problems that corporate managers or controlling shareholders would face with public shareholders in their effort to raise external capital. Agency conflicts could arise in the case where the set of actions of corporate managers or controlling shareholders are not aligned with the interests of public shareholders. On the other hand, information problems may arise if the management of the company, although having good information about future cash flows, is unable to credibly convince investors about the accuracy of these cash flows (Karolyi, 2006). Managers can alter those problems if they choose to bond themselves in a better governance regime by cross-listing in order to commit not to engage in illegal activities and as a result they can increase the firms’ value since they are able to raise external capital. Consequently, cross border listing effectively improves a company’s corporate governance regime and this particularly true for such companies that come from countries with inadequate supervision and disclosure standards (Karolyi, 2006; Witmer, 2006,Pagano et al., 2002). In addition, firms that decide to list their shares on a more demanding exchange in terms of disclosure and corporate governance standards enjoy a better post listing profitability than those that cross list in other exchanges. Karolyi (1998) as cited in Pagano et al. (1999), after surveying several number of studies showed that the price reaction is significant for foreign listings in the US which is the country with the highest disclosure standards, whereas it is insignificant otherwise.

==Awareness and investor recognition==
Merton (1987) as cited in Khurana et al. (2005) tries to explain the rationale behind a firm’s decision to cross-list its shares by the [[investor]] recognition hypothesis. According to this hypothesis stock trading behaviour of investors is affected from the lack of information. Consequently, this behaviour affects the related share price since investors with incomplete information are reluctant to include those shares in their investment portfolios, requiring a risk premium in order to include those shares in their portfolios. Through cross listing firms can increase investor awareness and expand its potential investor base on their securities more easily than if it traded on a single market. Cross border listing enhances the credibility of a firm by providing information to the local capital market therefore the continue flow of information allow the capital market to make faster and more accurate decisions (Licht, 2004). Further more, listing a company’s shares in a major and prestigious stock exchange like NYSE or LSE is accompanied with increased coverage and local media attention which in turn enhances visibility (Pagano et al., 2002). Supporting this argument, Baker et al., (1998) as cited in Witmer (2006), in their study looked how foreign firms’ visibility is affected after cross listing either on [[NYSE]] or LSE using two proxies for visibility: the firm’s analyst following and media coverage. According to their findings an average of six more analysts follow the firm after a listing on NYSE and an average of three analysts following the firm after a LSE listing. In addition, they found an average increase in home media coverage by 37 and 11percent after NYSE and LSE cross-listing respectively.

==Liquidity==
In order for a market to be liquid transactions must be executed rapidly and with little impact on prices.  Firms pursue cross border listings since it reduces transaction costs via an improvement in market liquidity following the foreign listing. The relationship between liquidity and cross listing lies upon the global competition for order flow (trading volume). Consequently, exchanges are forced to continuously look for ways to improve their trading processes in order to enhance market quality and maintain or attract order flow.  The benefits that companies seek to gain through cross border listing come as a reduction in the firm’s bid ask price resulting in an increase in firm’s valuation, therefore this improved liquidity is more likely to attract more institutional investors. Low liquidity is perceived as a barrier for institutional investors that prevent them from holding the firms stock due to the high trading costs associated in holding this security (Witmer, 2006; Chouinard &amp; D’Souza, 2003). Further more, the proportion of total trading volume that the new market captures along with the trading restrictions imposed on foreigners prior to listing are factors that affect the extent to which liquidity is enhanced. In addition, another factor favouring the enhancement of liquidity, especially for listing firms that come from emerging markets, is the existence of informational links between markets. If informational links for example were poor for listing firms that come from emerging markets cross-listing would actually reduce liquidity and increase volatility on the domestic market as informative trades were directed to other markets (Domowitz et al. 1998 cited in Chouinard &amp; D’Souza, 2003).

==Capital raising==
Another benefit that cross border listing provides to foreign companies is the improved terms by which they can raise external capital either because credit constraints are relaxed, or because of the existence of the bonding effect due to which investor protection is increased. The benefits of cross listing are further increased in the case that either the firm or its shareholders due to financial constraints present in the home market  serve as barriers to capital raising (Witmer, 2006; Pagano et al., 2002). In addition, evidence found in prior research of Reese and Weisbach (2002) as cited in Witmer (2006) demonstrated an increase in the capital raising as a result of the bonding hypothesis in that a firm’s ability to raise capital in its own market is enhanced through cross listing. More over, firms perceive cross border listings as a mean to raise capital needed to finance future investment projects. Fast growing firms are the ones that are more likely to experience the benefits of the increased funding (Pagano et al., 2002).&lt;ref name=karolyi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khurana I., Martin X. and Periera R., 2007, ‘Cross-listing and Firm Growth’, Working Paper, University of Missouri &amp;ndash; Columbia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honours ==

The City of Toronto, on February 28, 2017, the final day of Black History Month, announced the naming of a street in a new Scarborough sub-division in honour of Mr. Denham Jolly, a Black pioneer in Canada’s radio broadcasting industry.
"Jolly Way" will commemorate  the exceptional contributions to Canada of Denham Jolly.
Jolly Way is located near the southwest corner of Midland Avenue and Ellesmere Avenue, in a residential neighbourhood under development  by the Goldman Group.
"It is most appropriate that approval to name a street after Mr. Jolly has come through today, the last day of Black History Month 2017," said Councillor Michael Thompson, Chair of Toronto’s Economic Development Committee.
"Mr. Jolly has been instrumental in giving voice to the culture, achievements, challenges and aspirations of Toronto’s Black and Caribbean communities when few channels for such messages were available," Thompson added.

The company was established in [[Västerås]], Sweden, in 1947 by Erling Persson, though at the time it only sold women's clothing and was called Hennes, Swedish for "hers." In 1968, Persson acquired the premises and inventory of a Stockholm hunting equipment store named Mauritz Widforss.
In 1982, Erling Persson's son, [[Stefan Persson (fashion magnate)|Stefan Persson]] took over the position as the Managing Director, and today he is the Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; The Persson family owns about 33% of the company and has a 69% voting right.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The '''FTSE 250 Index''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ʊ|t|s|iː}} {{respell|FUUT|see}}) is a [[capitalization-weighted index|capitalisation-weighted index]] consisting of the 101st to the 350th largest companies listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. Promotions and demotions to and from the index occur quarterly in March, June, September, and December. The Index is calculated in [[Real-time computing|real-time]] and published every minute.

Related indices are the [[FTSE 100 Index]] (which lists the largest 100 companies), the [[FTSE 350 Index]] (which combines the FTSE 100 and 250), the [[FTSE SmallCap Index]] and the [[FTSE All-Share Index]] (an aggregation of the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE SmallCap Index).

A large number of companies within the index are [[investment trust]]s. {{As of|2008|September|30}}, the net market capitalisation of the FTSE 250 Index was £161&amp;nbsp;billion (or 13 per cent of the FTSE 100 Index).&lt;ref&gt;

'''Fault tree analysis''' ('''FTA''') is a top-down, [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] failure analysis in which an undesired state of a system is analyzed using [[Boolean logic]] to combine a series of lower-level events. This analysis method is mainly used in the fields of [[safety engineering]] and [[reliability engineering]] to understand how systems can fail, to identify the best ways to reduce risk or to determine (or get a feeling for) event rates of a safety accident or a particular system level (functional) failure. FTA is used in the [[aerospace]],&lt;ref name="NASA SE Toolbox"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldberg|first1=B.

In aerospace, the more general term "system failure condition" is used for the "undesired state" / top event of the fault tree. These conditions are classified by the severity of their effects. The most severe conditions require the most extensive fault tree analysis. These system failure conditions and their classification are often previously determined in the functional [[hazard analysis]].

== Usage ==
Fault tree analysis can be used to:

* understand the logic leading to the top event / undesired state.
* show compliance with the (input) system safety / reliability requirements.
* prioritize the contributors leading to the top event- creating the critical equipment/parts/events lists for different importance measures
* monitor and control the safety performance of the [[complex system]] (e.g., is a particular aircraft safe to fly when fuel valve ''x'' malfunctions? For how long is it allowed to fly with the valve malfunction?).
* minimize and optimize resources.
* assist in designing a system. The FTA can be used as a design tool that helps to create (output / lower level) requirements.
* function as a diagnostic tool to identify and correct causes of the top event. It can help with the creation of diagnostic manuals / processes.

==History==
Fault tree analysis (FTA) was originally developed in 1962 at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]] by H.A. Watson, under a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[526th ICBM Systems Group|Ballistics Systems Division]] contract to evaluate the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman I]] [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]] (ICBM) Launch Control System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1970, the [[FAA|U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) published a change to 14 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 25.1309 [[airworthiness]] regulations for [[transport category]] [[aircraft]] in the [[Federal Register]] at 35 FR 5665 (1970-04-08). This change adopted failure probability criteria for [[aircraft systems]] and equipment and led to widespread use of FTA in civil aviation. In 1998, the FAA published Order 8040.4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ASY-300|title=Safety Risk Management|date=June 26, 1998|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/directives/ND/ND8040-4.pdf|id=8040.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing risk management policy including hazard analysis in a range of critical activities beyond aircraft certification, including [[air traffic control]] and modernization of the U.S. [[National Airspace System]]. This led to the publication of the FAA System Safety Handbook, which describes the use of FTA in various types of formal hazard analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=FAA|title=System Safety Handbook|date=December 30, 2000|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/risk_management/ss_handbook/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the Apollo project the question was asked about the probability of successfully sending astronauts to the moon and returning them safely to Earth. A risk, or reliability, calculation of some sort was performed and the result was a mission success probability that was unacceptably low. This result discouraged NASA from further quantitative risk or reliability analysis until after the ''Challenger'' accident in 1986. Instead, NASA decided to rely on the use of [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)]] and other qualitative methods for system safety assessments. After the ''Challenger'' accident, the importance of [[probabilistic risk assessment]] (PRA) and FTA in systems risk and reliability analysis was realized and its use at NASA has begun to grow and now FTA is considered as one of the most important system reliability and safety analysis techniques.&lt;ref name=fthbaa&gt;{{cite book

Following process industry disasters such as the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] and 1988 [[Piper Alpha]] explosion, in 1992 the [[United States Department of Labor]] [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) published in the Federal Register at 57 FR 6356 (1992-02-24) its [[Process Safety Management]] (PSM) standard in 19 CFR 1910.119.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSHA PSM recognizes FTA as an acceptable method for [[process hazard analysis]] (PHA).

Today FTA is widely used in [[system safety]] and [[reliability engineering]], and in all major fields of engineering.

==Methodology==
FTA methodology is described in several industry and government standards, including NRC NUREG&amp;ndash;0492 for the nuclear power industry, an aerospace-oriented revision to NUREG&amp;ndash;0492 for use by [[NASA]],&lt;ref name=fthbaa&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] [[ARP4761]] for civil aerospace, MIL&amp;ndash;HDBK&amp;ndash;338 for military systems, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard IEC&amp;nbsp;61025&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Any sufficiently complex system is subject to failure as a result of one or more subsystems failing.  The likelihood of failure, however, can often be reduced through improved system design. Fault tree analysis maps the relationship between faults, subsystems, and redundant safety design elements by creating a logic diagram of the overall system.

The undesired outcome is taken as the root ('top event') of a tree of logic. For instance the undesired outcome of a metal stamping press operation is a human appendage being stamped.  Working backward from this top event we might determine there are two ways this could happen:  during normal operation or during maintenance operation. This condition is a logical OR.  Considering the branch of occurring during normal operation perhaps we determine there are two ways this could happen: the press cycles and harms the operator or the press cycles and harms another person. This is another logical OR.  We can make a design improvement by requiring the operator to press two buttons to cycle the machine—this is a safety feature in the form of a logical AND.  The button may have an intrinsic failure rate—this becomes a fault stimulus we can analyze.  When fault trees are labeled with actual numbers for failure probabilities, [[computer programs]] can calculate failure probabilities from fault trees. 
When a specific event is found to have more than one effect event, i.e. it has impact on several subsystems, it is called a common cause or common mode. Graphically speaking, it means this event will appear at several locations in the tree. Common causes introduce dependency relations between events. The probability computations of a tree which contains some common causes are much more complicated than regular trees where all events are considered as independent. Not all software tools available on the market provide such capability.

The tree is usually written out using conventional [[logic gate]] symbols. A cut set is a combination of events, typically component failures, causing the top event. If no event can be removed from a cut set without causing the top event, then it is called a minimal cut set.

Some industries use both fault trees and [[event tree]]s (see [[Probabilistic Risk Assessment]]). An event tree starts from an undesired initiator (loss of critical supply, component failure etc.) and follows possible further system events through to a series of final consequences. As each new event is considered, a new node on the tree is added with a split of probabilities of taking either branch. The probabilities of a range of 'top events' arising from the initial event can then be seen.

Classic programs include the [[Electric Power Research Institute]]'s (EPRI) CAFTA software, which is used by many of the US nuclear power plants and by a majority of US and international aerospace manufacturers, and the [[Idaho National Laboratory]]'s [[SAPHIRE]], which is used by the U.S. Government to evaluate the safety and [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of [[nuclear reactor]]s, the [[Space Shuttle]], and the [[International Space Station]]. Outside the US, the software RiskSpectrum is a popular tool for fault tree and event tree analysis, and is licensed for use at almost half of the world's nuclear power plants for probabilistic safety assessment. Professional-grade [[free software]] is also widely available; SCRAM&lt;ref&gt;[https://scram-pra.org SCRAM]&lt;/ref&gt; is an open-source tool that implements the Open-PSA Model Exchange Format&lt;ref&gt;[https://open-psa.github.io/mef Open-PSA Model Exchange Format]&lt;/ref&gt; open standard for probabilistic safety assessment applications.

==Graphic symbols==
The basic symbols used in FTA are grouped as events, gates, and transfer symbols. Minor variations may be used in FTA software.

===Event symbols===
Event symbols are used for ''primary events'' and ''intermediate events''. Primary events are not further developed on the fault tree. Intermediate events are found at the output of a gate. The event symbols are shown below:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:FTA_basic_event.jpg|Basic event
File:FTA_initiating_event.jpg|External event
File:FTA_undeveloped_event.jpg|Undeveloped event
File:FTA_conditioning_event.jpg|Conditioning event
File:FTA_intermediate_event.jpg|Intermediate event
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The primary event symbols are typically used as follows:
* '''Basic event''' - failure or error in a system component or element (example: switch stuck in open position)
* '''External event''' - normally expected to occur (not of itself a fault)
* '''Undeveloped event''' - an event about which insufficient information is available, or which is of no consequence
* '''Conditioning event''' - conditions that restrict or affect logic gates (example: mode of operation in effect)
An intermediate event gate can be used immediately above a primary event to provide more room to type the event description.

FTA is a top-to-bottom approach.

===Gate symbols===
Gate symbols describe the relationship between input and output events. The symbols are derived from Boolean logic symbols:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:FTA_OR_gate.jpg|OR gate
File:FTA_AND_gate.jpg|AND gate
File:FTA_XOR_gate.jpg|Exclusive OR gate
File:FTA_priority_AND_gate.jpg|Priority AND gate
File:FTA_inhibit_gate.jpg|Inhibit gate
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The gates work as follows:
* '''OR gate''' - the output occurs if any input occurs.
* '''AND gate''' - the output occurs only if all inputs occur (inputs are independent).
* '''Exclusive OR gate''' - the output occurs if exactly one input occurs.
* '''Priority AND gate''' - the output occurs if the inputs occur in a specific sequence specified by a conditioning event.
* '''Inhibit gate''' - the output occurs if the input occurs under an enabling condition specified by a conditioning event.

===Transfer symbols===
Transfer symbols are used to connect the inputs and outputs of related fault trees, such as the fault tree of a subsystem to its system. NASA prepared a complete document about FTA through practical incidents.&lt;ref name=fthbaa&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:FTA_transfer_in.jpg|Transfer in
File:FTA_transfer_out.jpg|Transfer out
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Basic mathematical foundation==
Events in a fault tree are associated with [[Statistics|statistical]] [[probability theory|probabilities]]. For example, component failures may typically occur at some constant [[failure rate]] λ (a constant hazard function). In this simplest case, failure probability depends on the rate λ and the exposure time t:
:P = 1 - exp(-λt)
:P ≈ λt, λt &lt; 0.1

A fault tree is often normalized to a given time interval, such as a flight hour or an average mission time. Event probabilities depend on the relationship of the event hazard function to this interval.

Unlike conventional [[logic gate]] diagrams in which inputs and outputs hold the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] values of TRUE (1) or FALSE (0), the gates in a fault tree output probabilities related to the [[Algebra of sets|set operations]] of [[Boolean logic]]. The probability of a gate's output event depends on the input event probabilities.

An AND gate represents a combination of [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] events. That is, the probability of any input event to an AND gate is unaffected by any other input event to the same gate. In [[set theory|set theoretic]] terms, this is equivalent to the intersection of the input event sets, and the probability of the AND gate output is given by:
:P (A and B) = P (A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B)

An OR gate, on the other hand, corresponds to set union:
:P (A or B) = P (A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P (A ∩ B)

Since failure probabilities on fault trees tend to be small (less than .01), P (A ∩ B) usually becomes a very small error term, and the output of an OR gate may be conservatively approximated by using an assumption that the inputs are [[mutually exclusive events]]:
:P (A or B) ≈ P(A) + P(B), P (A ∩ B) ≈ 0

An exclusive OR gate with two inputs represents the probability that one or the other input, but not both, occurs:
:P (A xor B) = P(A) + P(B) - 2P (A ∩ B)

Again, since P (A ∩ B) usually becomes a very small error term, the exclusive OR gate has limited value in a fault tree.

==Analysis==
Many different approaches can be used to model a FTA, but the most common and popular way can be summarized in a few steps. A single fault tree is used to analyze one and only one undesired event or top event, which may be subsequently fed into another fault tree as a basic event. Though the nature of the undesired event may vary dramatically, a FTA follows the same procedure for any undesired event; be it a delay of 0.25&amp;nbsp;ms for the generation of electrical power, an undetected cargo bay fire, or the random, unintended launch of an [[ICBM]]. Due to labor cost, FTA is normally only performed for more serious undesired events.

FTA analysis involves five steps:
# Define the undesired event to study.
#* Definition of the undesired event can be very hard to catch, although some of the events are very easy and obvious to observe. An engineer with a wide knowledge of the design of the system or a system analyst with an engineering background is the best person who can help define and number the undesired events. Undesired events are used then to make the FTA, one event for one FTA; no two events will be used to make one FTA.
# Obtain an understanding of the system.
#* Once the undesired event is selected, all causes with probabilities of affecting the undesired event of 0 or more are studied and analyzed. Getting exact numbers for the probabilities leading to the event is usually impossible for the reason that it may be very costly and time consuming to do so. Computer software is used to study probabilities; this may lead to less costly system analysis.&lt;br /&gt; System analysts can help with understanding the overall system. System designers have full knowledge of the system and this knowledge is very important for not missing any cause affecting the undesired event. For the selected event all causes are then numbered and sequenced in the order of occurrence and then are used for the next step which is drawing or constructing the fault tree. &lt;!-- These two paragraphs could do with some copyediting to trim them down. --&gt;
# Construct the fault tree.
#* After selecting the undesired event and having analyzed the system so that we know all the causing effects (and if possible their probabilities) we can now construct the fault tree. Fault tree is based on AND and OR gates which define the major characteristics of the fault tree.
# Evaluate the fault tree.
#* After the fault tree has been assembled for a specific undesired event, it is evaluated and analyzed for any possible improvement or in other words study the risk management and find ways for system improvement. A wide range of qualitative and quantitative analysis methods can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

# Control the hazards identified.
#* This step is very specific and differs largely from one system to another, but the main point will always be that after identifying the hazards all possible methods are pursued to decrease the probability of occurrence.

==Comparison with other analytical methods==
FTA is a [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], top-down method aimed at analyzing the effects of initiating faults and events on a complex system. This contrasts with [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), which is an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], bottom-up analysis method aimed at analyzing the effects of single component or function failures on equipment or subsystems. FTA is very good at showing how resistant a system is to single or multiple initiating faults. It is not good at finding all possible initiating faults. FMEA is good at exhaustively cataloging initiating faults, and identifying their local effects. It is not good at examining multiple failures or their effects at a system level. FTA considers external events, FMEA does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; In civil aerospace the usual practice is to perform both FTA and FMEA, with a [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure mode effects summary]] (FMES) as the interface between FMEA and FTA.

Alternatives to FTA include [[Reliability block diagram|dependence diagram]] (DD), also known as [[reliability block diagram]] (RBD) and [[Markov analysis]]. A dependence diagram is equivalent to a success tree analysis (STA), the logical inverse of an FTA, and depicts the system using paths instead of gates. DD and STA produce probability of success (i.e., avoiding a top event) rather than probability of a top event.

'''Financial law''' is the law and regulation of the insurance, derivatives, commercial banking, capital markets and investment management sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin 'Financial Law' (2007) OUP&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding Financial law is crucial to appreciating the creation and formation of [[banking regulation|banking]] and [[financial regulation|financial]] regulation, as well as the legal framework for [[finance]] generally. Financial law forms a substantial portion of [[commercial law]], and notably a substantial proportion of the global economy, and legal billables are dependent on sound and clear legal policy pertaining to financial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.legalservicesboard.org.uk/analysis/supply/market-financials/turnover-and-profitability/ Legal Services Board ''Turnover and Profitability'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK Legal Services 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Services 2015|url=http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Legal-Services-and-Dispute-Resolution-Group-notes/UK-Legal-Services-2015-Report.pdf|publisher=TheCityUK|accessdate=11 March 2015|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Law Society''Economic value of the legal sector services'' (March 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the legal implications of transactions and structures such as an [[indemnity]], or [[overdraft]] is crucial to appreciating their effect in financial transactions. This is the core of Financial law. Thus, Financial law draws a narrower distinction than commercial or corporate law by focusing primarily on financial transactions, the financial market, and its participants; for example, the sale of [[goods]] may be part of commercial law but is not financial law. Financial law may be understood as being formed of three overarching methods, or ''pillars'' of law formation and categorised into five ''transaction silos'' which form the various financial positions prevalent in finance.

For the regulation of the financial markets, see [[Financial regulation]] which is distinguished from financial law in that regulation sets out the guidelines, framework and participatory rules of the financial markets, their stability and protection of consumers; whereas financial law describes the law pertaining to all aspects of finance, including the law which controls party behaviour in which financial regulation forms an aspect of that law.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, See the extensive discussion outlined by Goode and Payne in ''Corporate Finance Law'' (Second Ed, Hart Publishing, 2015) which highlights the broader role of law, particularly market practice and case law, on the financial markets.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
As previously outlined, Financial law is understood as consisting of three pillars of law formation, these serve as the operating mechanisms on which the law interacts with the financial system and financial transactions generally. These three components, being market practices, case law, and regulation; work collectively to set a framework upon which financial markets operate. Whilst regulation has seen a historical resurgence following the [[2008 economic crisis]], the role of case law and market practices cannot be understated. Further, whilst regulation is often formulated through legislative practices; market norms and case law serve as primary architects to the current financial system and provide the pillars upon which the markets depend. It is crucial for strong markets to be capable of utilising both self-regulation and conventions as well as commercially-mined case law. This must be in addition to regulation. An improper balance of the three pillars is likely to result in instability and rigidity within the market contributing to [[illiquidity]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Benjamin ''Financial Law''(2007 OUP) 6&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''soft law'' of the ''Potts QC Opinion'' in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mayerbrown.com/files/Publication/9bc23406-673b-4d5a-a911-a9ed98d9fc49/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/1845d4ff-ce0f-4f68-b677-46a4083a3990/art_structuredfinance_8oct08.PDF |title=Structured finance update |date=October 8, 2008 |website=www.mayerbrown.com|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; reshaped the derivatives market and helped expand the prevalence of derivatives. 
These three pillars are underpinned by several legal concepts upon which financial law depends, notably, [[legal personality]], [[Set-off (law)|set-off]], and [[payment]] which allows legal scholars to categorise financial instruments and financial market structures into five legal [[Position (finance)|silos]]; those being (1) simple positions, (2) funded positions, (3) asset-backed positions, (4) net positions, and (5) combined positions. These are used by academic Joanna Benjamin to highlight the distinctions between various groupings of transaction structures based on common underpinnings of treatment under the law.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The five position types are used as a framework to understand the legal treatment and corresponding constraints of instruments used in finance (such as, for example, a [[guarantee]] or [[Asset-backed security]].)

==Three Pillars of Financial Law Formation==
Three different (and indeed inconsistent) regulatory projects exist which form the law within financial law. These are based on three different views of the proper nature of financial market relationships.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Market Practices===
The market practices of [[financial market participants|participants]] constitutes a core aspect of the source of law of the financial markets, primarily within [[England &amp; Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin v Robarts (1875) LR 10 Exch 337, 346&lt;/ref&gt; The actions and norms of parties in creating standard practices creates a fundamental aspect of how those parties self-regulate. These market practices create internal norms which parties abide by, correspondingly influencing legal rules which result when the market norms are either broken or are disputed through formal, court, judgments.&lt;ref&gt;GOOD ON COMMERCIAL LAW (5TH ED 2016, EWAN MCKENDRICK CH 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle role is to form ''soft-law''; as a source of rules of conduct which in principle have no legally binding force but have practical effects.&lt;ref&gt;(SNYDER ‘EFFECTIVENESS OF EC LAW')&lt;/ref&gt;  This has created standard form of contracts for various financial trade associations such as [[Loan Market Association]], which seeks to set guidance, codes of practice, and legal opinions. It is these norms, particularly those provided by Financial Market Law Committees, and City of London Law Societies which the financial market operates and therefore the courts are often quick to uphold their validity. Often times "soft law" defines the nature and incidents of the relationships that participants of particular types of transactions expect.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick Legal Risk in Financial Markets (Oxford University Press 2006), 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation and value of ''soft law'' within the system, is particularly notable in its relationship with globalisation, consumer rights, and regulation. The [[Financial Conduct Authority|FCA]] plays a central role in regulating the [[financial markets]] but soft law, voluntary or practice created legal schemes play a vital role. Soft law can fill market uncertainties what are produced by common law schemes. Obvious risk that that participants become lulled into believing statements of soft law is the law. However, the perception that an opinion constitutes ''ipso facto'' a clear and widely held opinion is wrong&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin (18.56)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the consumer relationship in the case of Office of ''Fair Trading v Abbey National'' [2009] UKSC 6 where the bank was fined by the FSA for failing to handle complaints set out in ''soft law'' principle practices on broadly worded business principles which state that the bank must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt; Often times the self-regulation of ''soft law'' can be problematic for consumer protection policies.

Another example of the expansiveness of soft law in the financial market is the explosion of [[Credit Derivatives]] in London, which has flourished on the back of the characteristically robust opinion of Potts for [[Allen &amp; Overy]] regarding the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]] Master Agreement in 1990 which helped the industry separate itself from current market restrictions. A the time, it was unclear whether Credit Derivatives were to be categorised as insurance contracts under English legislation of the Insurance Companies Act 1982. ISDA was firm in rejecting a statutory definition of insurance, stating that 
{{Cquote|In practice market participants have had few concerns as to the impacts of boundary issues between CD's and contracts of insurance.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bvca.co.uk/Policy/Tax-Legal-and-Regulatory/Industry-guidance-standardised-documents/Other/Potts-opinion|title=Potts opinion|website=www.bvca.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was crucial as Insurance companies were restricted from participating in other financial market activities and a licence needed to be granted to participate in the financial market. As a result of the Potts Opinion, credit derivatives were categorised as outside of insurance contracts, which allowed them to expand without the limitations set in place by insurance legislation.

Soft law'' has practical effects in that it is liable in many cases to be turned into "hard law", but with verified and experienced practice evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin v Robarts (1875) LR 10 Exch 337&lt;/ref&gt; In the case ''Vanheath  Turner (1622)'' the court remarked that custom of merchants is part of the common law of the United Kingdom. This highlights a long history of incorporating and accounting for the [[lex mercatoria]] into the English law in order to facilitate financial markets. Law merchant had been so absorbed by the 18th century that the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 could provide common law rules and merchant law in tandem. We might consider ''Tidal Energy Ltd v Bank of Scotland'', where Lord dyson held that "a many who employee a banker is bound by the usages of bankers"&lt;ref&gt;Hare v Hently [1861] EngR 575, (1861) 10 CB NS 65, (1861) 142 ER 374&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that if a sort code and account number was correct, it did not matter if the name did not match.

There are risks on over-reliance on soft law sources, however.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick ''Legal Risk in the Financial Market'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; English law makes it difficult to create a type of security and reliance on rules may result in established views which reinforce errors. This could result in unacceptable security even if legally valid.

===Case Law===
{{see|case law}}
The second category which financial law draws most of its pragmatism with regard to the standards of the markets originates in litigation. Often, courts seek to reverse engineer matters to make commercially beneficial outcomes and so case law operates in a similar manner to market practice in producing efficient results.&lt;ref&gt;Cf Petrofina (UK) Ltd v Magnaload Ltd [1984] AC 127&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two exceptions, attempting to limit the expectations to reasonable commercial men and uphold the freedom of contract. Autonomy is at the heart of commercial law and there is the strong case for autonomy in complex financial instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Belmont Park Investments pty ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services 2011 UKSC 38 per Lord Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8)]] highlights the striking effect a commercially beneficial practice can have on financial law. Lord Hoffman upheld the validity of a [[Equitable charge|security charge]] over a ''[[chose in action]]'' the bank held which it owed to a client. Despite the formidable conceptual problems in allowing a bank to place a charge over a debt the bank itself owed to another party, the courts have been driven to facilitate market practices as best as possible. Thus, they are careful to declare practices as conceptually impossible. In ''BCCI'', the court held that a charge was no more than labels to self-consistent rules of law, an opinion shared Lord Goff in ''Clough Mill v Martin'' where he wrote {{Cquote|concepts such as bailment and fiduciary duty must not be allowed to be our masters, but tools of the trade fashioning to aspects of life| title=Clough Mill v Martin [1985] 1 WLR 111, Lord Goff}}

Unfortunately, case coverage is unsystematic. Wholesale and international finance is patchy as a result of a preference to settle disputes through arbitration rather than through the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc (no 3) [1995] 1 WLR 978&lt;/ref&gt; This has the potential to be detrimental to advancing the law regulating finance. Market participants generally prefer to settle disputes than litigate, this places a greater level of importance onto the "soft law" of market practices.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Financial Law, 1.06, p5&lt;/ref&gt; However, in face of disaster, litigation is essential, especially surrounding major insolvencies, market collapse, wars, and frauds.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] provides a good example, with 50 judgments from the [[English Court of Appeal]] and 5 from the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]. Despite these problems, there is a new breed of litigious lenders, primarily [[hedge funds]], which has helped propel the pragmatic nature of financial case law past the 2008 crisis.&lt;ref&gt;M Hughes, Legal Principles in Banking and Structured Finance, 2nd Ed, (Haywards Heath, Tottel, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation and Legislation===
{{Main Article|Financial Regulation}}
{{see|Bank regulation}}
The third category of law formation within the financial markets are those deriving from national and international regulatory and legislative regimes, which operate to regulate the practice of financial services. Three regulatory lenses ought to be highlighted namely arm's length, fiduciary, and consumerist approaches to financial relationships.

In the EU these might be exampled by MiFiD II, payment services directive, Securities settlement regulations and others which have resulted from the financial crisis or regulate financial trade.&lt;ref&gt;Lamfalussy Report, 22&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory control by the Financial Conduct Authority and Office of Fair trading set out clear rules replacing extra-statutory codes of conduct and has seen recent resurgence following the [[2008 financial crisis]]. The regulatory policies have not all been rectified in regard to how they the new rules will be coherent with current market practices. We may consider ''In Re Lehman Brothers'' [2012] EWHC(Extended liens case) where Briggs J struggled to determine the legislative intent of the Financial Collateral Directive.

====Financial Collateral Regulations====
In addition to national and cross-national regulations on finance, additional rules are put into place in order to stabilise the financial markets by reinforcing the utility of [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. In Europe, two regimes of collateral carve-outs exist; the Financial Collateral Directive, and the Financial Collateral Arrangement (No 2) Regulations 2003. The [[EU]]'s development of the Financial Collateral Directive is curious if we view it through the lens of ''only'' a regulatory matter. It is clear that the law here developed through market practice ''and'' private law statutory reform. The EU has played a substantial role in this field to induce and encourage the ease of transfer &amp; realisation of assets and liquidity within markets. The provisions are well adapted to short term transactions such as repos or derivatives.

Further harmonisation rules pertaining to commercial [[conflict of laws]] matters were clarified. The additional [[Geneva Securities Convention]] set by [[UNIDROIT]] provides a basic framework for minimum harmonised provisions governing rights conferred by the credit of securities to an account with an intermediary. However, this international project has as of late been ineffective with only Bangladesh signing.

==Legal concepts prevalent in Financial Law==
{{Main|Credit risk}}
{{see|Financial risk}}
Several legal concepts underpin the law of finance. Of these, perhaps the most central concept is that of [[legal personality]], the idea that the law can create non-natural persons is one of the most important common myths and among the most ingenious inventions for financial practice because it facilitates the ability to limit risk by creating legal persons which are separate. Other legal concepts, such as set-off and payment are crucial to preventing systemic risk by lessening the level of gross exposure of [[credit risk]] a financial participant might be exposed to on any given transaction. This is often mitigated through the use of [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. If financial law is centrally concerned with the law pertaining to financial instruments or transactions, then it can be said that the legal effect of those transactions is to allocate [[financial risk|risk]].

===Limited liability and legal personality===
{{Main|legal personality}}
{{see|Limited liability}}
A limited liability company is an artificial creation of [[legislature]] which operates to limit the level of credit risk and exposure a financial [[market participant]] will participate within. [[Lord Sumption]] summarised the position by stating {{Quote|Subject to very limited exceptions, most of which are statutory, a company is a legal entity distinct from its shareholders.  It has rights and liabilities of its own which are distinct from those of its shareholders. Its property is its own, and not that of its shareholders [...] [T]hese principles appl[y] as much to a company that  [i]s wholly owned and controlled by one man as to any other company&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Prest v Prest [2013] UKSC 34, [2013] 2 AC 415 at 476, at [8] per Lord Sumption JSC.&lt;/ref&gt;}} For financial markets, the allocation of [[financial risk]] through separate [[legal personality]] allows for parties to participate in financial contracts and transfer [[credit risk]] between parties. The ambition of measuring the likelihood of future loss, that is of identifying [[risk]], is a central part of the role legal liability plays in [[economics]]. Risk is a crucial part of financial market sectors:
{{Quote|[I]t is not just legally but economically fundamental, since limited companies have been the principal unit of commercial life for more than a century. Their separate personality and property are the basis on which third parties are entitled to deal with them and commonly do deal with them&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;}}

===Financial Collateral===
Financial markets have developed particular methods for taking security in relation to transactions, this is because collateral operates as a central method for parties to mitigate the [[credit risk]] of transacting with others. Derivatives frequently utilise collateral to secure transactions. Large notional exposures can be reduced to smaller, single net amounts.  Often, these are designed to mitigate the credit risk one party is exposed to. Two forms of financial collateralization have been developed from the ''Lex Mercatoria'';
# [[Title (property)|Title transfer]]; or
# By granting a [[security interest]]
A security interest may be granted with a right of use, conferring disposal powers. There is an increasing reliance on collateral in financial markets, and in particular, this is driven by regulatory margin requirements set out for derivatives transactions and financial institution borrowing from the [[European Central Bank]]. The higher the collateral requirements, the greater demand for quality exists. For lending, it is generally regarded that there are three criteria for determining high-quality collateral. Those being assets which are or can be:
*Liquid; and 
*Easily priced; and
*Of Low credit risk
There are several benefits to having financial collateral provisions. Namely, financial reduces credit risk, meaning the cost of credit and the cost of transacting will be lowered. The reduced [[Bankruptcy law|insolvency risk]] of the counter-party, combined with more credit being available to the collateral taker will mean the collateral taker can take additional risk without having to rely on a counter-party.&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;Lousie Gullifer ''What should we do about Financial Collateral? (2012) Current Legal Problems Vol 65.1, 377,410&lt;/ref&gt; Systemic risk will be reduced by increased liquidity,&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; This produces "knock-on effects" by increasing the number of transactions a collateral taker can safely enter, freeing up capital for other uses.&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; However, there is a need for balance; the removal of limitations on insolvency rules and security registration requirements, as observed in the FCARs, is dangerous as it degrades powers and protections which have been conferred deliberately by the law.&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt;

====Financial Collateral Regulations====
The primary objective of the Financial Collateral Directive was to reduce systemic risk, harmonise transactions and reduce [[legal certainty|legal uncertainty]]. It achieved this by exempting qualified "Financial collateral arrangements" from the performance of formal legal requirements; notably [[land registration|registration]] and notification. Second, the collateral taker is provided effective right of use and said arrangements are exempted from being re-characterised as different security arrangements. Perhaps most significantly, traditional insolvency rules which may invalidate a financial collateral arrangement; such as [[United Kingdom insolvency law|freezing assets]] upon entering into [[insolvency]], are suspended. This allows a collateral taker to act without the limitation which may arise from a collateral provider entering bankruptcy. The FCARs&lt;ref&gt;Financial Collateral Arrangement No 2 Regulations 2003 and 2010 Financial Markets and Insolvency Amendment Regulation&lt;/ref&gt; focus on outlining when a financial collateral arrangement will be exempted from national insolvency and registration rules. In England, the requirements that a financial collateral arrangements only applies between non-natural persons with one being a financial institution, central bank, or public body; the FCAR has been "gold-platted"&lt;ref&gt;USA v Nolan [2016] UKSC 63&lt;/ref&gt; by allowing any non-natural person to benefit. Thus, to qualify as a "financial collateral arrangement" under the FCARs, a transaction must be in writing and regard "relevant financial obligations".&lt;ref&gt;FCARs Regulation 3&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria for a "relevant financial obligations" is set out in Part I Paragraph 3
{{Quote frame|Security financial collateral arrangement mean[s] any agreement or arrangement, evidenced in writing, where - 
*(a) the purpose of the agreement or arrangement is to secure the relevant financial obligations&lt;ref&gt;"The obligation which are secured or otherwise covered by the FCA and such obligations may consist of or include 
# present or future, actual or contingent or prospective obligations
# obligations owed to the CT by a person other than the CP 
# obligations of a specified class or kind arising from time to time"&lt;/ref&gt; vowed to the collateral-taker, 
*(b) Collateral Provider creates or there arises a "security interest in financial collateral"&lt;ref&gt;Several types of security interests are set out to be entrapped by the FCAR regime. This means any legal or equitable interest or any right in security, other than a title transfer financial collateral arrangement, created or otherwise arising by way of security including:
* pledge
* mortgage
* lien 
* fixed charge
* charge created as a floating charge where the FC charged is delivered, transferred, held, registered or otherwise designated so as to be in possession and under the control of the collateral taker. Where there is a right to withdrawal etc.&lt;/ref&gt; to secure those obligations; 
*(c) FC is delivered, transferred, held, registered, or otherwise designated so as to be in the possession or under the control&lt;ref&gt;''In the matter of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (In administration)'' [2012] EWHC 2997 (CH) [74] - [160]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Collateral Taker; any right of the Collateral Provider to substitute equivalent financial collateral or withdraw excess,&lt;ref&gt;Private Equity Insurance Group Sia v Swedbank AS (C-156/15)&lt;/ref&gt; financial collateral shall not prevent the financial collateral being in the possession or under the control of the Collateral Taker; and

The purpose of the provision is to increase the efficiency of markets and lower the transaction costs. The disapplied formal and perfection requirements accelerates the effectiveness of security through FCAR Reg 4(1),(2),(3) and 4(4). Two things might be said of this. Firstly, academics&lt;ref&gt;R Mokal, ''Liquidity, Systemic Risk, and the Bankruptcy Treatment of Financial Contracts'' 10 Brooklyn Journal of Corporate, Financial, and Commercial Law (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; have highlighted the risk of dappling statute of frauds and other requirements. It runs real risk of repealing substantial protections which were developed, at least in English common law, because of  real risks of exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Gullifer, Jennifer Payne ''Corporate Finance: Principles and Policy'' (2015) Hart Publishing, 310&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of protection which has been repealed includes the ability to allow parties to implement Appropriation if expressly agreed is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;FCAR Regulation 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive litigation has resulted from the determination of the FCAR regulations, specifically the meaning of "''possession or control''" as set out in paragraph 3.&lt;ref&gt;The definition in para 3 is rather unhelpful: Possession: of financial collateral in the form of cash or financial instruments includes the case where financial collateral has been credited to an account in the name of the CT provided that any rights the collateral provider may have in relation to the FC are limited to the right to substitute FC of the same or greater value or withdraw excess FC.&lt;/ref&gt; Recital 10 states that possession or control is for the safety of third parties, however, the type of mischief this is seeking to remove is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;cf Youngna Choi ''Ostensible Financial Stability Caused by Wealth Inequality'' (March 23, 2018). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3147465 or https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3147465&lt;/ref&gt; In ''C-156/15 Swedbank'', the [[CJEU]] enforced the requirement that practical control was that of legal negative control. {{Quote|second sentence of Article 2(2) provides that any right of substation or to withdraw excess financial collateral in favour of the collateral provider must not prejudice the FC having been provided to the collateral taker. That right would lack any force if the taker of collateral consisting in monies deposited in a bank account were also to be regarded as having acquired ''"possession or control" of the monies where the account holder may freely dispose of them […] it follows that the taker of collateral in the form of money lodged in an ordinary bank account may be regarded as having acquired ‘possession or control' of the monies only if the collateral provider is prevented from disposing of them}} What is clear is that (1) possession is more than merely [[custodial]] and [[Possession (law)|dispossession]] is mandatory. Some legal control is also crucial, meaning practical or administrative control is insufficient.

=====Possession=====
Requirement that collateral must be in possession is unclear. Is it one, two things? Does possession apply to intangibles? We do know that you cant. Is the requirement of control the same as the test for fixed charges. The scope of the regime is not clear. There are several unanswered questions. Only the collateral providers can have is right of substitution and right to withdraw surplus. Possession applies to intigble if it is credited to an account. Gullifer suggests that this is a redundant definition. The directive drafted with English and Irish laws not being centrally in mind. It was about disposition. To some extent, ownership discourages transactions for the risk of ostensible wealth.

It was held that the phrase was to be construed in a manner consistent with meaning and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''In the matter of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (In administration)'' [2012] EWHC 2997 (CH), [76] Briggs J&lt;/ref&gt; This is not merely a matter of English law,&lt;ref&gt;In the matter of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (In administration) [2012] EWHC 2997 (CH) [105]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;Gray v GTP Group Limited [2010] EWHC 1772 Ch, Los J&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Briggs' judgment in Client Money [2009] EWHC 3228 held that to interpret the meaning of the directive a court ought to 1. Interpret the directive. We can look at different language texts and cases if any. 2. Interpret domestic legislation in light of the directive (as interpreted through stage 1)  This is not restricted by conventional rules. Meaning that the court can and will depart from literal meaning and may imply words as necessary however, one cannot go against domestic legislation, nor require the court to make decisions it is not prepared to make. Repercussions must be and are considered by the court.

=====Control=====
{{see|Cukurova Finance International Ltd v Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd}}
By contrast, Control has been shown to not be that of practical (Administrative) control.&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt; It is clear that FCARs require a standard of negative legal control. Practical control, is the Collateral Taker's exclusive ability to dispose and it is suggested this will additionally be required if the parties are to avoid fraud. It is established by the rights and prohibitions in the security agreement but there is limited case-law on the matter&lt;ref&gt;Limited to ''Gray v GTP Group Limited'' [2010] EWHC 1772 Ch, Los J and ''[[Cukurova Finance International Ltd v Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd]]'' [2009] UKPC 19&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref&gt;Louise Gullifer ^&lt;/ref&gt; identify two forms of control:  
* positive
* negative (Collateral Provider has no rights in relation to dealing with or disposal of collateral)
Positive and Negative control differ where one either has the right to dispose without reference to the collateral provider, or where collateral provider is able to do so without collateral taker. What is undeniable however, is that dispossession is central to both possession and control. Rights of the Collateral taker must be beyond merely custodial; he must be able to refuse to hand collateral back.

There are a handful of risks to these arrangements - as previously outlined - the ill definition of what constitutes the activation of the FCAR arrangements creates a danger. However, within the context of appropriation, a provider only has a personal right against a taker for the surplus. There is no proprietary right. Should a taker (like Lehman) become [[Bankruptcy|insolvent]], a provider may well be at a loss for the excess. It encourages the party to reclaim excess value whenever possible/reasonably practical. This is not always possible due to the variation of the markets. Further, the risk of appropriation is that these can be used for ulterior purposes. Which as created the Cukurova problem;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cukurova Finance International Ltd v Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd]] [2009] UKPC 19&lt;/ref&gt; there parties had constructed a scheme to capture shares with a clause preventing the collateral taker from selling large securities at once and spooking the market, but valuation is not linear which made it difficult, if not impossible to determine what a commercially reasonable price for securities would be in an illiquid market.

===Set off===
{{Main|Set-off (law)}}
Other concepts, crucial to financial markets include [[Contingent]] obligations, the fact that bank debts operate as money; and [[Set-off (law)|Set-off]] designed to mitigate the net exposure of transactions. Set-off as a legal concept is crucial part of reducing credit risk and reducing the knock-on effects of insolvency.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Goode and Gullifer on ''Legal Problems of Credit and Security'' (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th ed 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;P Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 189&lt;/ref&gt; 
Collectively, these concepts operate to underpin financial transactions by further dividing risk. Various combinations of these legal methods are used to produce various allocations of risk.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Benjamin, ''Financial Law'' (2007 Oxford University Press), 13&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]] 2002 master agreement utilises contingent obligations, set-off, and legal personality to reduce the liabilities of non-defaulting parties in the event of default.&lt;ref&gt;ISDA Master Agreement Clause 2(a)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of Clause 2(a)(iii) of the [[ISDA Master Agreement|ISDA agreement]] is to suspend the payment obligations of parties until the [[event of default]] has been cured. Such a cure may not ever occur. There is substantial academic caution&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;''[[Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc]]'' [2012] EWCA Civ 419&lt;/ref&gt; that such a suspension acts to circumvent insolvency [[pari passu]] objectives.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; However, there is equal evidence that the clause provides substantial market stability as a result of the standardisation and universality that the [[ISDA Master Agreement]] has within the derivatives market.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; It further provides the involved parties to suspend the swap (and any other transactions within the master agreement), providing them the time to understand the overall effect the event of default has had on the agreement and the market.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; In other words, it provides a breather.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

===Payment===
{{Main|Payment}}
Payment operates as another core legal concept which underpins financial law. It is crucial because it determines the point at which a party discharges their obligation to another party. In finance, particularly relating to [[set-off (law)|set-off]], [[guarantee]]s, or other simple and funded positions; the definition of payment is ''crucial'' to determining the legal exposure of parties. Several of the cases derive predominately from English and U.S. law, pertaining to the [[Lex mercatoria]], and was developed when finical law historically focused on [[maritime trade]].

In English and U.S. law, payment is consensual, requiring acceptance from both payee and payer.&lt;ref&gt;Gloster J in ''Canmer International v UK Mutual Steamship "The Rays"''&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Goode suggests that Payment is a; {{Quote|consensual act and thus requires the accord of both creditor and debtor|author=Roy Goode|title=Goode on ''Legal Problems of Credit and Security'' (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th ed 2013}}. Payment as a legal concept is underpinned by the [[law of contract]]. In most common law jurisdictions, a valid contract requires sufficient [[consideration]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Foakes v Beer]]'' [1884] UKHL 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chappell &amp; Co Ltd v Nestlé Co Ltd]]'' [1960] AC 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Payment plays a crucial role in financial law because it determines when parties are able to discharge duties. In ''[[Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc]]'' [2012] EWCA Civ 419, the issue concerned when a debtor was able to discharge the duty to pay under the ISDA Master Agreement (1992). The requirement for payment arises in English law from a duty in performance of a money obligation. Whilst normally described and fulfilled in monetary terms, payment need only satisfy the creditor and does not necessarily involve the delivery of money,&lt;ref&gt;Charter Reinsurance Co v Fagan&lt;/ref&gt; but it cannot constitute payment unless money is involved, even if performance is fulfilled by some other act.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; {{Quote|a gift or loan of money or any act offered and accepted in performance of a money obligation.|Author=Brindle and Cox|tile=''Law of Bank Payments'' (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th ed, 2010), [1-001]}} Obligation to pay or [[Legal tender|tender]] the [[debt]] is balanced by the obligation on the part of the seller not to refuse the whole or part of the debt. This is underpinned by limitations on [[payment|part-payment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lord Steyn ‘Contract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men' (1997) 113 Law Quarterly Review 433, 437&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1990] 2 WLR 1153; [1989] EWCA Civ 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams v Williams [1957] 1 WLR 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MWB Business Exchange Centers Ltd v Rock Advertising Ltd [2016] EWCA Civ 553 (Kitchin LJ);&lt;/ref&gt; This traditionally operates in order to proffering money to fulfil obligations within a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Brudner ‘Reconstructing Contracts' (1993) 43:1 University of Toronto Law Journal, 1&lt;/ref&gt; In taking it, it is an affirmation of said contract and the debtor is discharged of his obligation to the creditor.&lt;ref&gt;Chen-Wishart A Bird in the Hand: Consideration and One-Sided Contract modifications' in Contract Formation and Parties (AS Burrows, ed and E Peel, ed Oxford University Press 2010) 109&lt;/ref&gt; This is crucial. In contracts where A (‘the debtor') owes money to B (‘the creditor'), payment operates as the terminus for A's obligation to B. It was crucially held in ''Societe des Hotel Le Touquet Paris-Plage v Cummings''&lt;ref&gt;(1922) 1 KB 451&lt;/ref&gt; that the bilateral contractual process did not require "accord and satisfaction" to achieve discharge of a debt by payment. The operation of payment therefore requires mutual [[acceptance|compliance}} from "both creditor and debtor".&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

====Two conceptual points of mutual consent====
Mutual consent must thus occur at two points, ''ex ante'' and ''ex post'' of the contract between parties and at what we might call "point Z" for situations where an obligation to pay does not result from contractual duties. (such as a debt owed to a non-adjusting creditor, cf Bebchuk and Fried). At both points, mutual consent required from both parties.
First, ''ex ante'' consent occurs at the time where parties agree on the obligation. If a party has specified a method for discharging an obligation through a specific means, then the parties must have contemplated the sufficiency of the tender to discharge the debt and therefore consensually agreed to payment of a specified way.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Mindy Chen-Wishart ''In defence of consideration''(2013) Oxford Commonwealth Law Journal, Vol 13.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; This will likely provide specification on when tender may be rejected. Chen-Wishart's discussion of the importance of consideration within the bargain theory of contracts enunciates the emphasis the English law has placed on benefit and deliberateness when contracting.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson Cumberbatch ‘On Bargains, Gifts and Extortion: An Essay on the Function of Consideration in the Law of Contract' (1990) 19:3 Anglo-American Law Review 239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Fried Contract as Promise: A theory of contractual obligation (Harvard University Press 1981) 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.S. Atiyah ‘Consideration in Contract: A fundamental Restatement (1971); ‘Consideration: A Restatement' in Essays on Contract (Oxford: Claredon Press 1986) 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Contracting parties must have contemplated, negotiated, and reached mutual agreement in regard to how the obligation would be discharged. This does not, however, prevent or impede the occurrence of "point Z". Parties may duly agree on payment in principle prior to the execution of the contract and subsequently still fail to effect payment.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;''[[The Brimnes]]'' ''Tenax Steamship Co v Owners of the Motor Vessel Brimnes'' [1974] EWCA Civ 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;''Mardorf Peach &amp; Co v Attica Sea Carriers Corp of Liberia (The Laconia)'' [1977] AC 850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;''The Chikuma'' [1981] 1 All ER 652&lt;/ref&gt; Functionally agreement results in questioning whether or not payment has been made by the debtor. The debtor must commit a certain level of formality to proffering the obligation. This formality may take the form of complying with a contract. Failure to comply, is not payment.

Second, ''ex post'', regardless of whether parties have [[Offer and acceptance|mutually agreed]] and specified a method, or a money of payment, the parties (notably the creditor) must consent to the debtor's tender in order to crystallise payment and sever the demand for payment.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; Discharge of a debt is automatic. In other words, a payment of a contractual obligation requires mutual consent of payment at both the stage of formation and at the conclusion/distribution to be recognised as ‘payment', but upon acceptance of payment the debt is discharged. In ''Colley v Overseas Exporters''&lt;ref&gt;[1921] 3 KB 302&lt;/ref&gt; it was shown that even where tender complies with the contract, it is not payment until the creditor (or Payer) accepts. This is regardless of whether the creditor's rejection frustrates the contract and is a breach of their duty. The law does not allow the debtor to coerce the creditor into accepting a tender.&lt;ref&gt;Mann on the Legal Aspect of Money (OUP, 7th ed 2012 by Charles Proctor) Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case, even when the debtor has forwarded [[Legal tender|valid tender]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf Hobhouse J in ''TSB Bank of Scotland plc v Welwyn Hatfield District Council'' [1993] Bank LR 267&lt;/ref&gt; It is the subsequent acceptance or non-acceptance of the tender from the creditor which crystallises payment and effects discharge.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Mere receipt will not suffice. However, mutual consent is of a lower standard than that in contractual formation. In ''TSB Bank of Scotland plc v Welwyn Hatfield District Council'' [1993] Bank LR 267, Hobhouse J held that acceptance of payment need not be communicated and his judgment provides a clear, two-stage test for determining whether payment has been made. If A;
*places the money unconditionally at the disposal of his creditor; and 
*the conduct of the creditor, viewed objectively, amounts to acceptance, then payment has passed. 
Thus, in ''Libyan Arab Bank v Bankers Trust Co''&lt;ref&gt;[1989] QB 728&lt;/ref&gt; the court held that when the collecting bank decided unconditionally to credit the creditor's account, the payment is completed. Presentation and subsequent rejection of payment provides an absolute defence for to an action brought by the creditor, but without the action (and opportunity to pay into the court) and with exceptions,&lt;ref&gt;''Sale of Goods Act 1979'' c.54 Section 38 which states; "Unpaid seller defined. 
(1)The seller of goods is an unpaid seller within the meaning of this Act—
(a)when the whole of the price has not been paid or tendered;
(b)when a bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument has been received as conditional payment, and the condition on which it was received has not been fulfilled by reason of the dishonour of the instrument or otherwise.
(2)In this Part of this Act “seller” includes any person who is in the position of a seller, as, for instance, an agent of the seller to whom the bill of lading has been indorsed, or a consignor or agent who has himself paid (or is directly responsible for) the price."&lt;/ref&gt; the debtor's [[tendering|proffering]] of payment does not discharge the money obligation nor does it constitute as payment. In the case of ''The Laconia'', the English [[House of Lords]] set out clear conditions on timing of payment in relation to the debtor proffering payment. The charterers had procured a vessel for 3 months, 15 days with a payment due on April 12, a Sunday. The charterers delivered payment on Monday. The vessel owners rejected the payment, which was sent back the following day.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; Primarily, ''The Laconia'' regards the requirement for a tender to be congruent with the conditions in order to amount to a tendering of payment. However, the case might also be used to highlight the necessity for the creditor to accept such tendering. Had the vessel owners merely taken receipt of the payment and not instructed their bank to return the money, then it seems likely that payment was accepted.
The consensual nature of payment thus derives from the requirement that both debtor must offer, and creditor must accept, the medium of payment; and secondly from the fact that creditor rejection of procurement, even if his agent is in receipt of the payment, results in a failure to effect payment.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; Goode discusses two forms where receipt does not take effect as acceptance that fall into the second aforementioned stage of mutual consent; 
#Conditional acceptance. Where a cheque is accepted it is conditional on such a cheque being met. Here, letters of Credit come to mind in that their conditional nature is dependent on the bank effecting payment. In ''The Chikuma'' and ''The Brimnes'' the court examined whether payment was fulfilled on the side of the payer. From that perspective, it was necessary for the court to analyse whether the payer had fulfilled the conditions in order to effect discharge.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt;
#Receipt by creditor's agent. ''The Laconia'' falls within this category. This is primarily because it is not always clear whether the agent lacked the authority to accept the payment.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland v Muslim Commercial Bank [1981] 2 Lloyd's Rep 646&lt;/ref&gt;
The fact that rejection of tender is sufficient to prevent ‘payment' derives from the fact that payment is the conferral of property to fulfil the obligation. Property and obligation aspects of the transaction cannot be separated without the transaction ceasing to be "payment".&lt;ref&gt;See ''Algoa Milling Co Ltd v Arkell and Douglas 1918 AD 145 at 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial law transactional categories==
As well as being fragmented, financial law is often muddled. Historical segregation of the industry into sectors has meant each has been regulated and conducted by different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Financial Law (Oxford University Press), 9&lt;/ref&gt; The approach to financial law is unique depending on the structure of the financial instrument. The historical development of various financial instruments explains the legal protections which differ between, say, [[guarantees]] and [[indemnity|indemnities]]. Due to the limited cross-sectoral legal awareness, innovations in finance have been associated with varying levels of risk. Several different legal "wrappers" provide different structured products, each with differing levels of risk allocation, for example, funded positions consist of bank [[loans]], [[capital market]] [[securities]], and [[managed funds]].

The primary purpose of financial law is to allocate risk from one person to another and change the nature of risk being run by the protection buyer into the 'credit risk' of the risk taker. Five categories of market structures are divided according to how the contract deals with the credit risk of the risk taker.

===Simple financial positions===
[[Guarantees]], [[insurance]], standby [[letters of credit]] and [[performance bond]]s. The terms ''Simple'' can often be misleading, as often the transactions which fall within this category are often complicated. They are termed simple not because of the lack of sophistication but because the transactions do not address the credit exposure of the protection buyer. Rather, ass with a guarantee, the protection buyer simply takes the risk of protection seller. [[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]] often fall within this regulatory category because they transfer risk from one party to another.

====Derivatives law====
{{main|Derivative (finance)}}
The second portion of simple transactions are derivatives, specifically unfunded [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] of which, four basic types exist. At law, the primary risk of a derivative is the risk of a transaction being re-characterised as another legal structure. Thus, the courts have been cautious to make clear definitions of what amounts to a derivative at law. Fundamentally, a derivative is a contract for difference, it utilises [[netting]] to set obligations between parties. Rarely does delivery of the asset occur.&lt;ref&gt;S85 Financial Services and Markets Act 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In English law, the judgment of ''Lomas v JFB Firth Rixon [2012] EWCA Civ, quotes the leading test ''Firth on Derivatives'', characterising a derivative as a {{Quote|transaction under which the future obligations are linked to another asset or index. Delivery of the asset is calculated by reference to said asset. Derives from the value of the underlying asset. This creates another asset out of the first type. It is a chose in action with reference to the value of the underlying asset. They are separate and can be traded accordingly}} 
As legal instruments, derivatives are bilateral contracts which rights and obligations of the parties are derived from, or defined by, reference to a specified asset type, entity, or benchmark and the performance of which is agreed to take place on a date significantly later than the date in which the contract is concluded.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Types
Various [[Derivative (finance)#Types|types]] of derivatives exist with even greater variance of reference assets. English law in particular has been clear to distinguish between two types of basic derivatives: Forwards and Options.&lt;ref&gt;Tullett Prebon Group [2008] EWHC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sunrise Brokers v Rogers [2014] EWCH 2633 (QB) at [7]&lt;/ref&gt; Often parties will place limits on the interest rate differentials when engaging in trades. At law, these are known as “Caps &amp; Collars”, these reduce the cost of the transaction. Regulation has been a key component in making the market more transparent, this has been particularly useful in protecting small and medium sized businesses.&lt;ref&gt;''Dexia Crediop S.p.A. v Commune di Prato'' [2017] EWCA Civ 428 ‘'per'' Paul Walker J&lt;/ref&gt; 
Swaps and Credit derivatives also differ in legal function. A credit derivative describes various contracts designed to assume or distribute credit risk on loans or other financial instruments. Payment obligations of a seller is triggered by specified credit events affective defined assets or entities. In a ''swap'', it was held in ''Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council''&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 2 AC 1, [739]-[740]&lt;/ref&gt; by Woolf LJ that equity swaps were developed under ISDA's guidance and might be defined as {{quote|A transaction in which one party pays periodic amounts of a currency based on a fixed price/rate and the other party pays periodic amounts of the same currency or different currency based on the performance of a share of an issuer, an index or a basket of several issuers.}} These are differentiated from ''credit derivatives'', which reference the credit risk of specified credit event; usually a bankruptcy, failure to make payment, or a breach of a condition such as a debt-to-equity ratio. Payment as a core concept in finance is crucial to the operation of derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;P Ali &amp; de Vires Robbe ''Synthetic, Insurance, and Hedge Fund Securitisation'' (2004 OUP), 11&lt;/ref&gt; Credit derivatives which are "self-referenced", i.e. referencing the parties own credit worthiness have been considered by the courts as capable of involving [[fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;''Money Markets International Stockbrokers Ltd v London Stock Exchange Ltd'' [2001] Ch D 223&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Legal Issues=====

A swap derivative with negative interest rates highlights particularly issues  at law. It is unclear how a party pays a negative number. Does it reverse the obligations? According to the [[ISDA Master Agreement]] variation in 2006, a swap has a "zero floor" which means that if interest rates reverse, the obligations do not reverse. Without the 2006 variation, the negative interest rate is a deduction off what is owed. 
An additional area of relevant derivatives law is shown in the cases of ''Dharmala''&lt;ref&gt;''Bankers Trust International PLC v PT Dharmala Sakti Sejahtera'' [1996] CLC 518&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Peekay'',&lt;ref&gt;''Peekay Intermark Ltd and Another v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd CA'' [2006] EWCA Civ 386&lt;/ref&gt; both of which involved arguments of mis-selling derivative transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Alistar Hudson ''The Uses and Abuses of Derivatives'' (1998) Cambridge Symposium on Economic Crime&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related with the argument that parties, particularly government bodies lack the power to enter into derivative contracts.&lt;ref&gt;''Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council'' [1992] 2 AC 1&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dharmala,'' the claimant argued unsuccessfully that the bank misrepresented the transaction. It was held that they did misrepresent but for the misrepresentation to effect a claim, it was necessary to induce someone to enter into the contract, which was unable to be proven. In ''Peekay'', the Court of Appeal rejected the suit for [[misrepresentation]] when the defendant mis-sold a synthetic [[credit derivative]] to Peekay which had its reference assets in Russian investments. The Peekay director ought to have read the documents rather than relying on the defendant's oral representation. This is a pro-market approach with marked Judaical disinclination to not strike down transactions, substantial problems exist with enforcing a contract against a party which argues it lacks the power to enter into an agreement, it has been likened to ''pulling oneself up by the bootstraps'' as the party cannot warrant that it has the power if it truly doesnt.&lt;ref&gt;''Credit Suisse International v Stichting  Vestia Group'' [2014] EWHC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''UBS AG v KOMMUNALE WASSERWERKE LEIPZIG GMBH'' [2014] EWHC 3615&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentation of derivatives often utilises standard forms to increase liquidity, this is particularly the case in exchange traded, or "over the counter" derivatives which are predominately documented using the [[ISDA Master Agreement]]. These agreements operate to create a singular transaction which lasts the duration of the trading relationship. Confirmation of trades can be codified by oral contracts made over the phone. This is only possible because interpretation of the standard form documentation is done in a manner so that the terms of art used within the documents have their own autonomous meaning separate from the [[Lex fori|law of the forum]]. Flexibility within the contract, and a court appreciation for the commercial objectives of the master agreements is a crucial aspect of the long-term operation of the financial markets which they support.&lt;ref&gt;''Lomas v JFB Firth Rixon'' [2012] EWCA Civ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Chartered Bank v Ceylon Petroleum'' [2011] EWHC 1785 [27] - [36]&lt;/ref&gt;
The ISDA Master Agreement is dependent on market practices, which attach to interpretations of intention within a context of long term relationships. The aim is to differentiate relational contracts from one-off contracts.  The concept of a single agreement is not new. The is an artificial line to sum-off and default netting practices&lt;ref&gt;''BNP Paribas v Wockhardt EU Operations (Swiss) AG'' [2009] EWHC 3116 (Comm)&lt;/ref&gt;  Payment of a derivative contract, particularly those of standardised forms, use [[netting]]. This minimises credit risk.

====Recharacterisation====
In being similar to one another in terms of economic market effects, simple positions are particularly susceptible to being re-characterised. When this happens, substantial legal consequences can result, as each legal instrument has different consequences. Whilst a guarantee and an indemnity have, in substance, the same economic result; the law characterises each differently because it affords an indemnifier less protection than a guarantor. Similarly, a derivative or guarantee must not be recharacterised as an insurance contract, as such contracts are strictly regulated by government regulation. A re-characterisation into a insurance contract would be fatal to the contract, as only licensed parties can issue such terms. The characterisation of financial transactions by the court takes the form of two stages; examining the legal substance, not the form of the agreement. Thus, stating that a contract is a derivative, does not make it a derivative. As held by Lord Millet in ''Agnew v Commissioners of Inland Revenue ([[Re Brumark Investments Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2001] UKPC 28&lt;/ref&gt; characterisation interprets the document and then categorises it within one of the existing legal doctrines. Intention is not relevant, however, there are sensitivities to this matter, primarily concerning the insurance markets. Three key types of recharacterisation can occur to simple positions
#Guarantees or Indemnities: In ''Yeoman Credit Ltd v Latter''&lt;ref&gt;(1961) WLR 828 per Harman LJ&lt;/ref&gt; the court held perhaps the most important distinction. The distinction between the two is that a guarantee is a secondary obligation to pay whilst an indemnity is a primary obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Birkmyr V Darnell. 1704 91 ER 27 1 Salk, 27 &amp; 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stadium Finance Co v Helm&lt;/ref&gt;
#Guarantees or Performance bonds: Performance bonds are similar to a promissory note, this turns again upon the primacy of the obligations. The courts have been extremely hesitant to implement a performance bond onto parties which are not banks.
#Guarantees or Insurance: Both are protecting creditors from loss, however a guarantee is narrower. Romer LJ set out three variables to differentiate the two:&lt;ref&gt;Seaton v Heath [1899] 1 QB 782&lt;/ref&gt; (1) the motives of the parties differ, insurance is a business contract and cover is provided in consideration for a premium. Guarantees are provided without payment. (2) The manner of dealings differ; an insurer usually deals with the insured and not the reference entity. (3) The means of knowledge which is disclosed. The insured ‘'must'' disclose material facts, why a guarantor is left to himself to determine facts. A guarantee thus is traditionally drafted to stand behind the debtor rather than be payable on the occurrence of an event. In England, prior to the ''Gambling Act 2005'', the courts often interpreted contracts as gambling and avoided them. Any contract which exists under the purview of the ''Financial Services and Markets Act 2000'' is not avoided by the ''Gambling Act 1845'' provisions. This is, in part, due to the ''Potts Opinion'' which argued the legal distinctiveness of derivatives from [[gambling]] and [[insurance]] contracts. This was argued by stating that the payment obligation was not conditional on loss and rights were not dependent on an insurable interest.

===Funded Positions===
{{See|Syndicated loan}}

Lending is perhaps the most central aspect of the financial system. As discussed by Benjamin, the law attempts to allocate risk in ways which is acceptable to the parties involved. Bank [[loans]] and [[capital market]] transactions fall within this category. It may be defined as situations where the risk-taker is the provider of capital to another party. If the risk materialise, the exposure is not merely an obligation to pay, but rather the exposure of the risk-taker is the risk of losing its previously committed capital. That is to say, a funded position is the risk of repayment. When a bank makes a loan, it pays money and runs the risk of a lack of repayment.

====Difference between Funded positions and other positions====
{{see|lending}}
One might ask what the difference between an asset-backed security and funded positions. The answer is that funded positions are positions which are acquired without backing of other assets.

The true difference is that of funded positions and simple positions. Simple positions, such as guarantees, insurance, standby credits and derivatives. Funded positions differ from simple positions in that simple positions expose risk as a form of a promise. The risk taker agrees to pay the beneficiary upon certain events. This relies upon exposure to credit risk. Funded positions have the risk exposure has the form of a payment, which is to be restored. The risk exists in that it may not be repaid. It is funding a party with the risk being a lack of repayment. This includes the bank and non-bank lending including [[syndicated loans]].

Two overarching forms of funded positions exist between debt and equity, and there are several ways to raise capital. This might be broken down into Bank loans ([[debt finance|debt financing]]) and equity issuing ([[capital markets]]). Alternatively, a company may retain profits internally. This may be summarised as:
* Equity Shares
* Debt financing
* Retained profits
Few companies can use equity and retained profits entirely. It would not be good business to do so either; debt is a crucial aspect for corporate finance. This relates to the gearing advantages of taking on debt and maximising the value of [[debt-to-equity ratio|debt-to-equity]] to allow equity to gain maximum returns.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Financial Law (2007 OUP) Chapter 8, 149&lt;/ref&gt; Debt is repayable in accordance with the terms; whereas equity instruments, typically includes rights of [[shareholders]], rights to receive reports, accounts, pre-emptions (where the company proposes issuing new shares), and the right to vote on strategic decisions affecting the company.

====Debt Financing====
{{main|debt finance}}
Bank lending may be categorised according to a large number of variables including the type of borrower, the purpose and the form of the loan facility. Where a bank makes a loan it will typically require a business plan and require security where it has credit concerns. A commitment letter may be produced during the negotiations for a loan. In general these are not legally binding.

A loan facility is an agreement where a bank agrees to lend. It is distinct from the loan itself. Using a loan facility it writes to the bank and the bank makes the loan. LMA syndicated single currency term facility distinguishes between 1. commitment to lend to each lender, 2. average of each; and 3. the loan made under the agreement and the draw down. Three important forms of these are:
* [[Overdraft]] facilities&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe Brooks v Blackburn and District Benefit BS (1884)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[term loan]] facilities&lt;ref&gt;LORDSVALE FINANCE V BANK OF ZAMBIA [1996] 3 ALL ER 156&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[revolving credit|revolving]] facilities&lt;ref&gt;Grupo Hotelero Urvasco SA v Carey Value Added [2013] EWHC 1039 (Comm)&lt;/ref&gt;
These may be further categorised into two overarching forms of bank [[loan|lending]], organised based on the term/repayment criteria of the loan. These are:
* on-demand lending (overdraft and other short term) and;&lt;ref&gt;SHEPPARD &amp; COOPER LTD V TSB BANK PLC (NO 2) P1996] BCC 965; [1996] 2 ALL ER 654&lt;/ref&gt;
* committed lending (revolving facility or a term loan)&lt;ref&gt;CARLYLE v RBS [2015] UKSC 13&lt;/ref&gt;
Economist and finance lawyers categories these and further categorise syndication separately but within committed lending. This has been a traditional driver for lending within the debt financing market.

=====On-Demand Lending=====
Where express terms state that it is repayable one demand, it will be so repayable even if both bank and borrower envisaged that it would be last for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyds Bank v Lampert (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This must be an express term. In England &amp; Wales, because of S6 Limitation Act 1980, time for repayment does not start running until the demand is made. This means that the debt, for example an overdraft, is not repayable without demand but will become repayable if requested; even if the parties thought it would not be repayable for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Titford Property Co v Cannon Street Acceptances (1975) distinguished for Lloyds Bank plc v Lampert (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Sheppard &amp; Cooper Ltd v TSB Bank Plc (No 2)'' [1996] BCC 965; [1996] 2 ALL ER 654, the plaintiff granted a fixed and floating charge over its assets. He then covenanted to pay or discharge indebtedness on-demand. At any time after indebtedness should become immediately payable, the debtor was authorised to appoint administrative receivers. Soon after a demand was made by the defendant. The plaintiff said that the best that could be done was repayment of half. The defendant appointed administrative receivers to recover the debt as outlined by the charge. The plaintiff sued and claimed claim the time was insufficient. The court held that; "It is physically impossible in most cases for a person to keep the money required to discharge the debt about his person. Must have had reasonable opportunity of implementing reasonable mechanics of payment he may need to employ to discharge the debt." But a "reasonable time" overarching doctrine was found to be too commercially difficult. The courts have held short timelines as being more than sufficient to satisfy the request of on-demand. Walton J only accepted 45 minutes as being a reasonable period of time and in ''Cripps'' it was 60 minutes. Therefore the timing of repayment depends on circumstances but is, in commercial matters, extremely quick. If the sum demanded is of an amount which the debtor has, the time must be reasonable to enable the debtor to contact his bank and make necessary arrangements. However, if the party, as in ''Sheppard'' admits his inability to pay, Kelly CB believed that seizure was justified immediately stating "If personal service is made and the defendants may have seized immediately afterwards."&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard &amp; Cooper Ltd v TSB Bank Plc (No 2)'' [1996] BCC 965&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties will want to avoid insolvency consequences. A bank will normally freeze a customers account when a winding up petition occurs to avoid dispositions within insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;in the Insolvency Act 1986 s127 limitations on dissipation of assets after winding-up. This was seen within ''Re Grays Inn's Construction Ltd'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; A payment into an overdrawn account is probably a disposition of the company's property in favour of the bank. This is crucial differentiation as the money of an overdrawn account is going directly to a creditor. Payment into an account in credit is not a disposition of the company's property in favour of the bank, however.&lt;ref&gt;Re Barn Crown 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank makes a payment out of the company's account in accordance with a valid payment instruction - there is no disposition in favour of the bank.&lt;ref&gt;HOLLICOURT (CONTRACTS) LTD V BANK OF IRELAND (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, banks traditionally freeze accounts and force insolvent parties to open new accounts.

======Overdraft======
{{main|overdraft}}
An overdraft constitutes a loan, traditionally repayable on demand.&lt;ref&gt;RE HONE (1951) Ch 852 All per Harman J.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[current account|running account]] facility (categorising alongside revolving loans) where its on-demand nature of repayment meant immediately.&lt;ref&gt;LLOYDS BANK v LAMPERT [1999] 1 All ER (Comm) 161&lt;/ref&gt; A bank is only obliged to provide overdraft if the bank has expressly or impliedly agreed to do so&lt;ref&gt;''Cunliffe Brooks v Blackburn and District Benefit BS'' (1884)&lt;/ref&gt; Legally, where a client overdraws his account, the client is not in breach of contract with the bank; if it did constitute a breach, then the fees charged by the bank would be penalties and corresponding not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Parking Eye [2015] UKSC&lt;/ref&gt; If requesting payment when there is no money in the bank account, the customer is merely requesting an overdraft.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyds bank plc v Independent Insurance Co Ltd [1998] EWCA Civ 1853&lt;/ref&gt; This should be noted that this is separate and distinct from credit cards; as credit cards invariably say a client must not go over the credit limit.  With overdraft requests, the bank has the option not to comply with the request, although this is rare, as the banks reputation is built upon a willingness and ability to pay on behalf of clients.&lt;ref&gt;Barclays Bank v WJ Simms (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Often however, the bank complies and then charges a fee to ‘create a loan'.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

''OFT v Abbey National'' held that "if a bank does pay, customer has taken to have agreed to accept the bank's standards," which means that they have asked and the bank has provided a loan.  Banks may charge interest on an overdraft and may compound that interest&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen  HSBC Bank plc (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The point of an overdraft at law is that it is repayable on demand, however, payment instructions within the agreed overdraft limit must be honoured until notice has been given that the facility (the overdraft) is withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse v Bradford Banking Co (1894)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Committed Lending=====
{{main|loan}}
A committed facility is where the bank is committed to lend throughout a certain period.
* Term loan;  all at once or in successive tranches. Can be repayable at once (bullet); or according to a payment scheme(amortising)
* Revolving facility; borrow repay and reborrow.
* swingline facility; Which is a committed facility providing for short term advances
Most committed lending facilities will be documented, either by:
* A facility letter or 
* A loan agreement
These may be more or less complex, depending on the size of the loan.
Oral assurance can give rise to an obligation to lend prior to any documentation being signed. ‘A statement made by a bank employee over the telephone that approval' had been given.&lt;ref&gt;CARLYLE v RBS [2015] UKSC 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Most facility letters and loan agreements will contain contractual provisions designed to protect the lender against the credit risk of the borrower. This requires several aspects. Normally it will require [[conditions precedent]], restrictions on the borrower's activities, information [[covenant (law)|covenant]]s, [[set-off (law)|set-off]] provisions, stipulations for events of default. Lenders will also traditionally take real or personal security. These are designed to protect the lender against:
# Non Payment of both interest and capital; and
# Insolvency 
These two objectives are achieved by providing for events that make non-payment or insolvency unappealing or transfer the risk associated with said events to third party. This highlights the difference between risk as assessed and actual risk.

======Material Adverse Change Clauses======
{{main|material adverse change}}
A common provision relates to material adverse change clauses. The borrow represents/warrants that there has been no material adverse change in its financial condition since the date of the loan agreement. This is a clause which is not often invoked or litigated and therefore the interpretation is uncertain and proof of breach is difficult. Consequences of wrongful invocation by the lender are severe.

Interpretation depends on the terms of the particular clause and is up to lender to prove breach. Cannot be triggered on basis of things lender knew when making the agreement. Normally done by comparing borrower's accounts or other financial information then and now. Other compelling evidence may be enough. Will be material if it significantly affects the borrower's ability to repay the loan in question. We may examine one of the leading authorities on material adverse change clauses in committed lending, Grupo Hotelero Urvasco SA v Carey Value Added [2013] EWHC 1039 (Comm), per Blair J
{{quote frame|[334] The use of material adverse change clauses is common in financial documentation in differing contexts, including takeovers and mergers, and loan agreements, as in the present case. In the latter context, they may relieve a lender of its continuing obligations in the event of a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower which threatens its ability to repay but which is short of an insolvency. However, there is little case law, perhaps reflecting the fact that (unlike an insolvency event which is usually clear cut) the interpretation of such provisions may be uncertain, proof of breach difficult, and the consequences of wrongful invocation by the lender severe, both in terms of reputation, and legal liability to the borrower.
[351] In my opinion, an assessment of the financial condition of the company should normally begin with its financial information at the relevant times, and a lender seeking to demonstrate a MAC should show an adverse change over the period in question by reference to that information. The financial condition of a company during the course of an accounting year will usually be capable of being established from interim financial information and/or management accounts.

[352] I agree with the lender however that the enquiry is not necessarily limited to the company's financial information. There may be compelling evidence to show that an adverse change sufficient to satisfy a MAC clause has occurred, even if an analysis limited to the company's financial information might suggest otherwise.
[357] [...] Unless the adverse change in its financial condition significantly affects the borrower's ability to perform its obligations, and in particular its ability to repay the loan, it is not a material change. [Similarly, it has been said that:] the lender cannot trigger the clause on the basis of circumstances of which it was aware at the date of the contract since it will be assumed that the parties intended to enter into the agreement in spite of those conditions, although it will be possible to invoke the clause where conditions worsen in a way that makes them materially different in nature”&lt;ref&gt;Rawlings, Avoiding the Obligation to Lend, 2012 JBL 89&lt;/ref&gt; In my view, this states the law correctly. 
[363] Finally, I should note one construction point which was not in dispute. ''In order to be material, any change must not merely be temporary.''

[364] In summary, authority supports the following conclusions. The interpretation of a “material adverse change” clause depends on the terms of the clause construed according to well established principles. In the present case, the clause is in simple form, the borrower representing that there has been no material adverse change in its financial condition since the date of the loan agreement. Under such terms, the assessment of the financial condition of the borrower should normally begin with its financial information at the relevant times, and a lender seeking to demonstrate a MAC should show an adverse change over the period in question by reference to that information. However the enquiry is not necessarily limited to the financial information if there is other compelling evidence. The adverse change will be material if it significantly affects the borrower's ability to repay the loan in question. However, a lender cannot trigger such a clause on the basis of circumstances of which it was aware at the time of the agreement [...] Finally, it is up to the lender to prove the breach.}}
Therefore, a change will be material if it significantly affects the borrower's ability to repay the loan in question. Normally this is done by comparing borrower's accounts or other financial information then and now.

===Net Positions===
{{see|Set-off (law)}}
A net position represents a financial position in which a debtor may "off-set" his obligation to the creditor with a mutual obligation which has arisen and is owed from the creditor to the debtor. In financial law, this may often take the form of a simple or funded position such as a securities lending transaction where mutual obligations set-off one another. Three crucial types of netting exists:
*Novation Netting
*Settlement Netting
*Transaction Netting
Each party can use its own claim against the other to discharge. Each party bears credit risk which may be offset. For example, a guarantor who is a depositor with a banking institution can set-off obligations he may owe to the bank under the guarantee against the bank's obligation to repay his deposited assets.

===Asset-backed positions===
{{Main|secured loan}}
{{see|asset-backed security}}

Propriety securities like [[mortgages]], charges, [[liens]], [[pledge (law)|pledge]]s and [[retention of title]] clauses are financial positions which are collateralised using proprietary assets to mitigate the risk exposure of the collateral-taker. The core purpose it to Manage credit risk by identifying certain assets and ear-marking claims to those assets.

===Combined positions===
{{see|structured finance}}
Combined positions use multiple facets of the other four positions, assembling them in various combinations to produce large, often complex, transactional structures. Examples of this category are primarily [[Collateralized debt obligations|CDO]]'s and other [[structured finance|structured products]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For example, a [[synthetic CDO|Synthetic collateralised debt obligations]] will draw upon derivatives, syndicated lending, and asset-backed positions to distinguish the risk of the reference asset from other risks. The law pertaining to CDOs is particularly noteworthy, primarily for its use of legal concepts such as legal personality, and risk transfer to develop new products.
The prevalence and importance of combined positions within the financial markets, has meant that the legal underpinnings of the transactional structures are highly relevant to their enforcement and effectiveness.

==Background==
George Arthur Forrest was born in 1940 in [[Lubumbashi]] in what is now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).&lt;ref name=Forbescustom&gt;{{cite web

 |title=George Forrest: Unconditional Love for DRC
 |work=Forbes Custom
 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was the son of an Irish immigrant.&lt;ref name=GlobCement/&gt;
His father, Malta Forrest, had founded l'Entreprise Générale Malta Forrest (EGMF) in 1922 in Katanga Province in the south of the Belgian Congo. The company started as a transport company, then moved into mining and then into civil engineering. In 1968 it became a limited liability company, with George Forrest and his adoptive brother Victor Eskenazi-Forrest as Managing Directors. In 1986, after his brother died, George  Forrest took full control. He created the George Forrest International Group in 1995.&lt;ref name=selfhistory&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s his company acquired several major cement production facilities, which should benefit from construction demand with the end of the [[Second Congo War]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=GlobCement/&gt;
Forrest's DRC operations grew to include 9,500 direct employees and 15,000 subcontractors.
Forrest is a sponsor of ''Dialogues'', a non-profit association that promotes the visual arts in Lubumbashi and supports the city’s museum. He also owns the Grelka Biano Ranch, with 30,000 head of cattle and 800 local employees.&lt;ref name=Forbescustom/&gt;

==Controversies==

In December 2001 the [[United Nations]] asked a panel of experts to investigate the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The panel's report was issued in October 2002. In it they said George Forrest had long-standing ties to the establishment in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and described him as a member of the elite network of Congolese interests.

The '''gray ceiling''' is a [[social phenomenon|business/societal phenomenon]] where the existing workforce of those born during the [[baby boom]] era prevents the slightly younger [[Generation X]]ers from advancing or being promoted at their jobs.

==General==
The gray ceiling phenomenon is most likely unintentional{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Although it is true that baby boomers are staying on the job longer than previous generations, by sheer number they are also competing within their own generation and their children who are joining the workforce at the turn of the 21st century.

As the children of the baby boomers advance from below, the [[Generation X|Gen-Xers]], usually with middle management jobs, feel threatened and trapped in a job that is going nowhere and might be given away to the next younger candidate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum''' ({{lang-ar|حمدان بن راشد أل مكتوم}}, ''{{transl|ar|Hamdān bin Rāschid Āl Maktūm}}''; born 25 December 1945)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://almaktoumracingclub.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|date=2015-04-13|work=Hamdan Al Maktoum Racing Club|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the Deputy Ruler of [[Dubai]] and the Minister of Finance and Industry of the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). He is the second son of the late ruler [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]] (1912–1990, r. 1958–1990).

Sheikh Hamdan received his early education in the Emirates then attended [[Bell Educational Trust|Bell School of Languages]], [[Cambridge]]. He and his brother, [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Sheikh Mohammed]], control the state-owned [[Dubai Ports World]] along with the [[Dubai Holding|Dubai Holding Co.]] and its many subsidiary companies which have wide-ranging investments in hotels, apartment buildings, banking and finance, and healthcare facilities.  Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum has been the head of the UAE's delegation at the [[International Monetary Fund]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/imf-gulf/imf-says-not-seeking-more-funds-from-gulf-states-idUSL5E7LM09X20111022|title=IMF says not seeking more funds from Gulf states|last=|first=|date=2011-10-13|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-03-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[OPEC|OPEC Fund]].

==Early life and education==
Sheikh Hamdan was born on 25 December 1945. He was the second of four sons of Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], a late ruler of Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/breederscup/2016/owners/shadwell.pdf|title=Shadwell Farms|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Hamdan's formal schooling began in Dubai. He attended Al Madrasah Al-Ahlia, where he studied mathematics, English, basic sciences, Arabic and Islamic studies. He went on to complete his further studies at the Bell School of Languages in Cambridge&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dragonoil.com/about-us/board-of-directors/|title=Board of directors|website=www.dragonoil.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1967 and 1968. In Britain, Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum developed an interest in [[Thoroughbred horse racing|thoroughbred racing]].

The years saw a great deal of development in the [[UAE]]. While Dubai and [[Abu Dhabi]] had begun the process of modernisation, it was far from complete; many areas in the remaining five emirates needed electricity, roads, housing, and clean water supplies. As Minister of Finance and Industry, Sheikh Hamdan oversaw such work, while he was also charged with developing the economy and an industrial base. The UAE's rulers understood that the country could not afford to isolate its efforts in the petroleum sector, despite the fact that in 1971 the majority of federal government revenues were derived from this source.

In Dubai, Sheikh Rashid also placed his second son in charge of an array of key governmental industrial enterprises, including the Dubai Aluminium Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ega.ae/en/media-releases/2016/november/industry-salutes-hh-sheikh-hamdan-bin-rashid-al-maktoum/|title=Industry salutes HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum {{!}} EGA|website=EGA|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubai Gas Company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gpssa.gov.ae/en/pages/chairman.aspx|title=Chairman|website=en|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dubai Cable Company, among others.

==Career==
Sheikh Hamdan was the minister of finance and industry of the United Arab Emirates until his appointment as deputy ruler.&lt;ref name="aps31may"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/UAE+-+Profiles+-+Ministers.-a0117430159|title=UAE - Profiles - Ministers|date=31 May 2004|newspaper=APS Review Downstream Trends|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invited a delegation from the [[Islamic Research Academy]] on April 3, 1999 to discuss the launch of an effort and human investment in preparing an academic team of young scholars as specialists in [[Islamic Jerusalem Studies]]. This resulted in the launch of several scholarships to reward distinguished young scholars, which then lead to the establishment of the [[Al-Maktoum Institute]] in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]] with unique postgraduate programmes with the [[University of Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/6917777/British-universities-seats-of-learning-and-loathing.html|title=British universities: seats of learning – and loathing|last=Edwards|first=Ruth Dudley|date=2010|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaikh Hamdan is also the benefactor and the Patron of the "Shaikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum Award for Medical Excellence", an award instituted to reward excellence in the field of medical sciences with its comprehensive, dynamic and exciting features to benefit competing researchers, scientists and medical institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hmaward.org.ae/page.php?id=776|title=The Establishment -  Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award for Medical Sciences - HMA|website=hmaward.org.ae|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Hamdan has received numerous honours and awards for his achievements. He is working on a project to make horse betting easier and faster through a concept designed by a [[South Africa|South African]] business counterpart. The project was to be launched in mid-2010.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==

Introduced to [[thoroughbred]] [[flat racing]] while a student in the [[United Kingdom]], Sheikh Hamdan established his first racing stable there in 1981. Over the years he has invested heavily in both racing and breeding&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/07/sports/othersports/07racing.html|title=HORSE RACING; Bernardini Is Retired, but Rival Will Race On|last=Finley|first=Bill|date=2006-11-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has acquired major operations in [[England]], [[Ireland]] and the [[United States]].

The Dubai Arabian Horse Championship is held through the patronage of Sheikh Hamdan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diaraces.com/page2|title=Dubai International Arabian Races|website=Dubai International Arabian Races|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds''' ('''IFSWF''') is a nonprofit international group of [[sovereign wealth funds]] managers which was established in 2009. It is based in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="IFSWF001"/&gt;

==History==

In 2009, a group of 23 leading state-owned international investors from around the world established the IFSWF’s precursor, the International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds, following discussions with global groups such as the [[G20]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[U.S. Department of Treasury]] in 2007 and 2008. The Working Group created a set of Generally Accepted Principles and Practices, better known as the "[[Santiago Principles]]", for sovereign wealth funds’ institutional governance and risk-management frameworks. Following the Kuwait Declaration in 2009, the International Working Group became the IFSWF with the mandate of helping members implement the Principles.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.ifswf.org/about-us|website=IFSWF |accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

As of February 2018 IFSWF had 32 members, including some of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, like the [[China Investment Corporation]], [[Kuwait Investment Authority]], and the [[Abu Dhabi Investment Authority]].&lt;ref name="IFSWF003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifswf.org/our-members |title=Our Members  |author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |access-date=9  February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was set up by the funds, so they could come together and create an organisation to promote [[best practice]] within their field. Its focus is "to exchange views on issues of common interest and to facilitate an understanding of sovereign wealth funds' activities and of the [[Santiago Principles]]".&lt;ref name="IFSWF001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifswf.org/about-us |title=About us |author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |access-date=27  September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 24 [[Santiago Principles]] are a voluntary standard of best practice principles and practices endorsed by the IFSWF members for the management of the Sovereign Wealth Funds.&lt;ref name="IFSWF002"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifswf.org/santiago-principles |title=Santiago Principles  |author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its member funds collectively have about $5.5 trillion under management, representing 80% of assets managed by sovereign funds globally.&lt;ref name="HFSB001"/&gt;

When established the IFSWF formalized a limited number of partnerships with world-leading financial and academic partners.&lt;ref name="YF001"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-appointed-international-forum-133300959.html |title=State Street Appointed by the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds as an Official Research Partner |author=Yahoo Finance |access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural meeting of IFSWF was held in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], and it was hosted by the [[State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan]] and the government of [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="SOFRoA001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilfund.az/en_US/about_found/suveren-fondlarin-beynelxalq-forumu.asp |title=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |publisher=State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan |website=oilfund.az |accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the IFSWF and [[Hedge Fund Standards Board|Standards Board for Alternative Investments]] establish a mutual observer relationship to share knowledge and experience with the objective to raise Standards in the financial industry.&lt;ref name="HFSB001"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hedgeweek.com/2016/04/04/238050/international-forum-sovereign-wealth-funds-ifswf-and-hedge-fund-standards-board-hf |title=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) and Hedge Fund Standards Board (HFSB) establish Mutual Observer relationship |author=Hedge Fund Standards Board |access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at the most recently published accounts at [[Companies House]], IFSWF Limited made a [[Net profit]] of £176,758 [[Pound sterling|GBP]] as of December 31, 2015. This included a nonrefundable capital transfer form the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] in relation to accumulated membership fees of £884,194 GBP. The accounts are generated in accordance with the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].&lt;ref name="2015Accounts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09060589/filing-history |title=IFSWF Limited |website=companieshouse.gov.uk |publisher=Companies House - UK Government |date=3 Oct 2016 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8016">The '''International Underwriting Association''' of London, better known as the IUA, represents companies that trade in the [[London]] [[insurance]] market outside [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd’s]]. They include branches or subsidiaries of nearly all the world’s largest international insurance and [[reinsurance]] companies.  
The exact size of IUA members’ contribution to the London market is not known. They wrote a total of at least £10&amp;nbsp;billion&lt;ref name="thecityuk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Insurance 2010|url=http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Insurance-2010.pdf|publisher=TheCityUK|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; premium during 2009, a figure that does not include income processed outside the London market bureau. This business is [[wholesale]], the bulk being made up of insurance for large [[Multinational corporation|multinational companies]] or reinsurance. Most of it is international, brought into London by brokers.
The IUA provides a forum for discussing market issues and providing [[technical support]] to practitioners. IUA members collectively own a 25% share of Xchanging Ins-sure Services (XIS), the provider of [[back office]] processing services to the London market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clarity in the midst of uncertainty: Annual Report 2010|url=http://www.iua.co.uk/imis15/IUA_Test/Documents/Annual_Report/IUA_Test/Documents/Annual_Report/annual_report_home.aspx?hkey=a81ddddd-1366-452a-8de6-fc95fa108355|publisher=IUA of London|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
History
The IUA was formed in January 1998 from the [[merger]] of the London International Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association (LIRMA) and the Institute of London Underwriters (ILU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Robert|title=The British Insurance Industry Since 1900|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke, England|isbn=978-0230219649|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9780230239524|author2=Peter Falush}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main stated reason for the merger was the desire to give the London company market a single voice in dealings with [[government]], [[regulator (economics)|regulator]]s and other insurance bodies. Since the ILU had been formed in 1884, the IUA can claim to go back more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewer|first=Chris|title=A Problem Shared: A History of the Institute of London Underwriters, 1884-1984|year=1984|publisher=Witherby|isbn=9780900886911}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The association has always made reform of the London market a top priority, especially the replacement of out-of-date processes and increased use of [[technology]] to conduct business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Challenging the status quo to keep London relevant and efficient|url=https://www.insuranceday.com/reinsurance/challenging-the-status-quo-to-keep-london-relevant-and-efficient.htm?origin=internalSearch|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=Insurance Day|date=5 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led in 1999 to the creation of the IUA-Lloyd’s Forum. This soon expanded to include brokers and eventually evolved into the London Market Group, which is still active today.

==Aims and priorities==

The IUA’s mission is “To promote and enhance the business environment for international insurance and reinsurance companies operating in or through London”.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the IUA?|url=http://www.iua.co.uk/IUA_Test/About/IUA_Test/About_the_IUA/About_the_IUA_homepage.aspx?hkey=fde5f182-0b0b-4853-a8a1-eb918f24fbf2|work=International Underwriting Association|publisher=The International Underwriting Association of London Limited|accessdate=10 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702012542/http://www.iua.co.uk/IUA_Test/About/IUA_Test/About_the_IUA/About_the_IUA_homepage.aspx?hkey=fde5f182-0b0b-4853-a8a1-eb918f24fbf2|archivedate=2 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How this mission is interpreted has evolved over the years. From being a mainly strategic and [[lobbying]] organisation, it has become more concerned with activities that provide direct support to market professionals in their work. In 2009, the association set itself four strategic priorities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning for the future: Group Report and Accounts 2009|url=http://www.iua.co.uk/imis15/IUA_Test/Documents/Annual_Report/IUA_Test/Documents/Annual_Report/annual_report_home.aspx?hkey=a81ddddd-1366-452a-8de6-fc95fa108355|publisher=IUA of London|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Improving the efficiency of doing business in London;
*Advancing the development of market expertise and innovation;
*Influencing [[public policy]] and [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] developments;
*Fostering relationships with the broking community and other client-related stakeholders.

==Committee structure==

The IUA board is elected by the membership. Reporting to the board are the committees, sub-committees and working parties, which provide the backbone of the association. These are populated overwhelmingly by market practitioners with the full-time IUA [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] providing administrative support and implementing decisions (see chart).

These committees responsibilities include for overseeing and supporting: the IUA’s contribution to the London market modernisation programme; discussion with regulators and legislators and communicating the implications of regulatory changes to the membership; [[education]], [[training]] and [[research]]; and technical matters relating to [[underwriting]] and claims, including specialist classes of insurance and reinsurance.

IUA committees co-operate regularly with their counterparts at the Lloyd’s Market Association and the two organisations jointly run a number of [[marine insurance]] committees. Although most of its committees and sub-committees are populated by people working for IUA companies, some such as Digital Risk and Rehabilitation have cross-market membership.

==Other Activities==

The IUA holds regular lunchtime briefings and organises a number of events, most notably an annual [[catastrophe modelling]] conference, which normally attracts an international cast of speakers and delegates. It also supports an annual marine claims conference in [[Dublin]]. Its website has become an important communications tool and a repository of market statistics and other information.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

==IUA membership==

IUA member companies come overwhelmingly from overseas, reflecting the [[globalisation]] of the insurance and reinsurance industries. As of March 2011 thirty eight of the IUA’s forty members were based overseas or part of larger overseas groups. This external influence is reflected in the [[nationality]] of many of its board members. Around a third of IUA members also have operations at the Lloyd’s as part of the growing inter-relationship of the two main parts of the London market.

As well as Ordinary Membership, there are two other categories: Associate (for active insurance companies that do not operate in London but wish to have an association with the IUA); and Affiliate (for other organisations with an interest in the insurance and reinsurance market). Membership is always granted on a corporate rather than individual basis.

The number of Ordinary member companies dropped by around 50% in the first five years of the association’s existence even as their aggregate premium [[income]] increased, reflecting the [[consolidation (business)|consolidation]] of the company insurance market into fewer, larger players. Numbers have remained stable for several years with departures from the market being balanced by new arrivals.

Aushev was a businessman and a member of a prominent Ingushetian family.&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news |first=Ellen |last=Barry |title=Ingushetia Opposition Figure Is Shot Dead in Car |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/world/europe/26ingushetia.html?_r=1|work= [[New York Times]] |publisher=|date=2009-10-25 |accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Aushev's son and nephew were both kidnapped.  He blamed Ingush security forces under the control of then-[[President of Ingushetia]] [[Murat Zyazikov]] for the [[abductions]].&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; Aushev organized protests against the security forces and the Zyazikov government.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

In 2008, journalist [[Magomed Yevloyev]], the owner of [[Ingushetia.org]] and a critic of the Zyazikov government, was shot and killed while in police custody.  Aushev personally took over ownership of Ingushetia.org following Yevloyev's death.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

The Russian government removed Zyazikov in October 2008 and installed [[Yunus-Bek Yevkurov]] as president.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; Yevkurov offered [[dissidents]] in Ingushetia a certain amount of protection from politically motivated attacks.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; Aushev largely supported Yevkurov policies towards the opposition, and withdrew from his most vocal opposition to the government since Yevkurov's installation.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Aushev accepted a position on a human rights council set up by the ombudsman of Russia's federal government.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; However, he remained a vocal critic of former President Zyazikov and his relatives, as well as the human rights violations allegedly committed by Russian [[special forces]] in [[Ingushetia]] and [[Chechnya]].&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

Aushev survived an attempted kidnapping in September 2009.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; In an interview with an [[Australia]]n television network, he revealed that he had “very strong information that I was going to be killed” during the failed abuduction.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

On October 25, 2009, Aushev was shot and killed on the spot when gunmen attacked his car on a road near [[Nalchik]] in the neighboring Republic of [[Kabardino-Balkaria]].&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; He was buried in the Ingush village of [[Surkhakhi]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Post-death==

On 8 December 2009, Aushev was posthumously awarded the Russian Federation's [[Human rights in Russia|human rights]] ombudsman's medal “{{lang|ru|Спешите делать добро}}” (''{{lang|ru-Latn|Speshite delat dobro}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ombudsman.gov.ru/doc/vistup12/s09_12_09.shtml|script-title=ru:Сообщение пресс-службы Уполномоченного по правам человека в Российской Федерации|date=2009-12-09|work=[http://ombudsman.gov.ru/ Уполномоченный по правам человека в Российской Федерации]|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 [[Russia Today|RT]] documentary, ''Blood and Honor: Chechen Vendetta Code'', Aushev's father, Magomed Aushev, states that he has spent more than $1 million trying to track down his son's killers. Magomed said he would forgive his son's killers only if they came to him first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood and Honour|url=http://rtd.rt.com/films/blood-and-honour/|publisher=[[Russia Today]]|accessdate=19 April 2015|date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18213">A '''marketing information system''' ('''MKIS''') is a [[management information system]] (MIS) designed to support [[marketing]] [[decision making]]. Jobber (2007) defines it as a "system in which marketing data is formally gathered, stored, analysed and distributed to [[management|manager]]s in accordance with their informational needs on a regular basis." In addition, the online business dictionary defines Marketing Information System (MKIS) as "a system that analyzes and assesses marketing information, gathered continuously from sources inside and outside an organization or a store."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/marketing-information-system.html Marketing information system], Business Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, "an overall Marketing Information System can be defined as a set structure of procedures and methods for the regular, planned collection, analysis and presentation of information for use in making marketing decisions." (Kotler, at al, 2006)

== Overview ==
Reid and Bojanic(2010) claimed that, " The term market research informs relatively narrowerly than Marketing Information System(MkIS) which is altered from the term management information [[systemization]]. Market research indicates that information is not collected for a specific reason or project; the major objective is a one-time use. "&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hospitality Marketing Management|last = Reid|first = Robert D.|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780470088586|location = New Jersey|pages = 209|last2 = Bojanic|first2 = David C.|edition = 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A marketing information system, which continuously collects the initial, routine and systematic data, is not only used for one particular topic but is designed for monitoring the degree of the marketing success to ensure the achievable of the operation as well."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Importance ==
Developing a MKIS system is becoming extremely important as the strength of economies rely on services and to better understand the specific needs of customers.   Kotler, et al. (2006) defined it more broadly as "people, equipment, and procedures to gather, sort, analyze, evaluate, and distribute needed, timely, and accurate information to marketing decision makers."&lt;ref name="Kotler"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kotler |first=Philip |authorlink= Philip Kotler |author2=Keller, Kevin Lane |authorlink2=Kevin Lane Keller  |editor= |others= |title=Marketing Management |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= 12 |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Pearson Education |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as an economy focuses on services, marketing is important to "monitor the marketing environment for changes in [[buyer behavior]] competition, technology, economic conditions, and government policies."&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Harmon. (2003). Marketing Information Systems. Encyclopedia of Information Systems, Vol. 3. Elsevier Science (USA), 137-151.&lt;/ref&gt;   In this sense, the role of marketing is becoming pivotal for an organization to "adapt to changes in the market environment." (Harmon, 2003)

As an economy relies on the acquisition of knowledge, MkIS systems are necessary to be able to define and differentiate the [[value proposition]] that one organization provides with respect to another, as well as to define their [[competitive advantage]]. (Harmon, 2003)

The main benefit of MkIS systems is to integrate market-monitoring systems with strategy development and the strategic implementation of policies and processes that help capture and act on [[customer management]] applications with marketing [[decision support system]]s.  This area constitute [[Marketing intelligence]] that supports the analysis and market based activities that support customer relations and customer service with real time information with real time applications that support market based approaches.

=== Relevance of MkIS ===
Shajahan and arya(2004) stated that, "Demands for the MkIS can be expressed by three crucial developments. Firstly, when companies expand and diversify into new markets, both the companies and customer's point of view are needed to be handled by the marketing managers. Therefore, there would be greater need for marketing information. Secondly, when consumers obtain an increment in the level of their income, it causes a tendency for them to be more discriminating during the purchasing procedure. A full awareness of the points that drive a consumer prefer a brand and the points that distinguished his brand from that of the rivals should be obtained by the marketers. This awareness is possible only with the help of a well- designed effective MkIS. Thirdly, the development of the markets and the movement from price to non-price grounds of competition lead to an increase in the importance of adoption and implementation by the competitors and finding the response of the consumers towards them. Analyzing the needs for MkIS from a third person's angle, three more factors come to the forefront viz., the information explosion, increasing complexity in decision making and the technological developments. " &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management Information Systems|last = Shajahan|first = S.|publisher = New Page International(P) Ltd.|year = 2004|isbn = 8122415490|location = India|pages = 99|last2 = Priyadharshini|first2 = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing Research(MR)and MkIS ===

In addition, "Great demand of information gathering for marketing decisions results in the need of attention by themselves.  Though marketing research information can be generated by studies, which are normally conducted in the market place whereas marketing information systems are designed to gather, integrate, process and distribute marketing information comprehensively from all sources, including that from marketing research. The contrasting characteristics of MkIS and MR are presented in Table 5.1 as shown below:

The business function of marketing is concerned more with the planning, promotion and sale of products in existing markets and the development of new products and new markets. Thus marketing performs a vital function in the operation of a business enterprise. Business firms who turned to computers have been able to perform vital marketing function effectively for organizations' growth in the face of global competition."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Main Structure ==
According to Robert Jamon (2003), MkIS systems are decomposed on four components: (1) user interfaces, (2) application software, (3) databases, and (4) system support.   The following is a description of each one of these components.

1. [[User interfaces]]. The essential element of the MAkINAS is the managers who will use the system and the interface they need to effectively analyze and use marketing information.  The design of the system will depend on what type of decision managers need to make.

2. [[Application software]]. These are the programs that marketing decision makers use to collect, analyze, and manage data for the purpose of developing the information necessary for marketing decisions.

3. [[Database marketing]]. A marketing database is a system in which marketing data files are organized and stored.

4. [[IBM System/34, 36 System Support Program|System support]]. This component consists of system managers who manage and maintain the system assets including software and hardware network, monitor its activities and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

Along with these components, MkIS systems include [[Marketing decision support system|Marketing Decision Support Systems]] (MDSS), which in turn rely on simple systems such as [[Microsoft Excel]], [[SPSS]], and on-line analytical tools that help collect data.  Data compiled for analysis is stored and processed from a [[data warehouse]], which is simply a [[Information repository|data repository]] system that helps store and further process data collected internally and externally. (Harmon, 2003)

=== Databases ===
From Pride and Ferrell (2010), "Internal database is a part of the most marketing information systems. In addition, it's relatively convenient for access and retrieve of information. A databases allow marketers to tap into an abundance of information useful in making marketing decisions: internal sales reports, newspaper articles, company news releases, government economic reports, bibliographies, and more, often accessed through a computer system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marketing|last = Pride|first = William M.|publisher = Cengage Learning,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780547167473|location = Canada|pages = 148|last2 = Ferrell|first2 = O.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internal Data ====
In with Birn(2004), " internal data is a part of the data that is needed to be collect and handled by the marketing information system. Further more, managers regard this as a command to make effective operation.But getting the information that is really needed from a marketing information system depends on what the information is and how it is used. The following internal operating data are essential:
* Sales data, presented in a graphic format, can provide regular sales trend information and highlight whether certain customer types need to be targeted or focused.
* Price information by product line, compare with competitors, can monitor market trends; analyzed by customer type, it can check price trends in customer groups.
* Stock level data and trends in key accounts or distributors, focusing on whether different outlets need support, provide market share information.
* Market support information, coordinating the effects of marketing promotions, through advertising, direct marketing, trade incentives, consumer competitions and so on, helps to determine whether decisions are being made effectively.
* Competitive information, reviewing competitors'  promotions and communications to see if the company is doing it better or worse than competitors, can improve market targeting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Effective Use of Market Research: How to Drive and Focus Better Business Decisions|last = Birn|first = Robin|publisher = Kogan Page Limited|year = 2004|isbn = 074944200X|location = Great Britain|pages = 22|edition = 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental scanning ===
Sandhusen(2000) defined that, environmental scanning is a display of the nature of MIS processed. " It gives assistance for the marketers to develop the strategies, policies, plans and to make programs and budgets through dealing with the ongoing information on trends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marketing|last = Sandhusen|first = Richard L.|publisher = Barron's Educational Series|year = 2000|isbn = 9780764112775|location = Canada|pages = 165|edition = 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kotler's Model ===
According to Philip Kotler, the four components that comprise the MkIS system are Internal Reports (Records) System, Marketing Research System, Marketing Intelligence System, and Marketing Decision Support System

1.Internal Reports System: It records various data from different department of a company, which is regarded as a major source of information.

2.Marketing Intelligence System: It is a main source used by managers for gaining daily information of the external environment, hence assists the managers to react to the changing rapidly.

3.Marketing Research System: It is used to collect primary and secondary data, and displays the results in forms of reports.

4.Marketing Decision Support System: Compared to the supply of the data by the three previous systems, it focuses more on processing the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marketing/mis-marketing-information-system-with-diagram/48703/|title = MIS: Marketing Information System (With Diagram)|date = 2015|accessdate = 1 Nov 2015|website = YourArticleLibrary|publisher = |last = Jaideep|first = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages , Limitations &amp; Possible Risks ==

=== Advantages ===
Bhasin stated that,"With an increasingly competitive and expanding market, the amount of information needed daily by an organization is profound. So they have to establish a Marketing Information system. There are several advantages of Marketing information systems

* '''Organized Data collection''' –  MkIS can help the managers to organize loads of data collected from the market, thus results in an increment in the productivity.
* '''A broad perspective''' –  With a proper MkIS in place, the organization can be tracked which can be used to analyze independent processes. This helps in establishing a broader perspective which helps us know which steps can be taken to facilitate improvement.
* '''Storage of Important Data''' – The storage of important data is essential in execution and thus proves again that MkIS is not important only for information but also for execution.
* '''Avoidance of Crisis''' – The best way to analyze a stock (share market) is to see its past performance. Top websites like moneycontrol thrive on MIS. Similarly MIS helps you keep tracks of margins and profits. With an amazing information system established, an organizations direction can be analysed and probably crises averted before they place. 
* '''Co-ordination''' –  Consumer durables and FMCG companies have huge number of processes which needs to be co-ordinated. These companies depend completely on MIS for the proper running of the organization.
* '''Analysis and Planning''' –  MkIS plays a crucial role in the planning process, considering the planning procedure requires information. For planning, the first thing which is needed is the organizations capabilities, then the business environment and finallycompetitor analysis. In a proper MkIS, all these are present by default and are continuously updated. Therefore, MkIS is very important for planning and analysis.
* '''Control''' –  Just like MkIS can help in a crisis, in normal times it provides control as you have information of the various processes going on and what is happening across the company."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marketing91.com/customer-profitablity-analysis-2/|title = 8 Advantages of Marketing Information Systems|date = 23 Oct 2015|accessdate = 23 Oct 2015|website = Marketing 91|publisher = |last = Bhasin|first = Hitesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible risks ===
"Nevertheless, the collection of marketing information should obey a high-frequent manner due to the rapid change in the external market." The possible risks the business may face if they disobey the manner according to Bhasin are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marketing91.com/mis-marketing-information-system/|title = MIS – Marketing information system|date = 23 Oct 2015|accessdate = 23 Oct 2015|website = Marketing 91|publisher = |last = Bhasin|first = Hitesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Opportunities may be missed.
* There may be a lack of awareness of environmental changes and competitors' actions.
* [[Data collection]] may be difficult to analyze over several time periods.
* Marketing plans and decisions may not be properly reviewed.
* Data collection may be disjointed.
* Previous studies may not be stored in an easy to use format.
* Time lags may result if a new study is required.
* Actions may be reactionary rather than anticipatory.

Maintenance, complexity and setting up a MkIS are one of the major hindrances to Marketing information systems. Furthermore, wrong information being fed in MkIS can become cumbersome and appropriate filters need to be established.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Limitations ===
Kotler and Philip have said that "both primary and secondary researches offer loads of the data and information needed for the marketers, whereas the secondary data sources are relatively superior in quick provision of data at lower cost. Simultaneously, a firm cannot find all the data required by itself, but sometimes can be done with the help of secondary research. However, researchers must assess those data collected from both primary and secondary data sources to enable the accuracy, updates and fairness.  Each primary data collection method – observational, survey, and experimental – has its own advantages and disadvantages. Similarly, each of the various research contact methods – mail, telephone, personal interview, and online – also has its own advantages and drawbacks." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Marketing|last = Kotler|first = Philip|publisher = Pearson Education,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780137006694|location = United States of America|pages = 153|last2 = Armstrong|first2 = Gary|edition = 13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rural Marketing Information System (RuMIS) ==
A RuMIS is necessary not only for corporate organizations engaged in marketing of agricultural goods and manufactured goods intended for sales in rural areas. RuMIS is required also by the agriculturists and farmers who have enormous decis!ion-making to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rural Marketing: Indian Perspective|last = Singh|first = Awadhesh Kumar|publisher = New Age International (P) Ltd.|year = 2005|isbn = 8122416837|location = India|pages = 114|last2 = Pandey|first2 = Satyaprakash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Master of Business Informatics''' ('''MBI''') is a postgraduate degree in [[Business informatics|Business Informatics]] (BI). BI programs combine [[information technology]] (IT) and management courses and are common in central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Doukidis, G., et al. (Hrsg.): Proceedings of the 3rd European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS '95). Athens 1995, pp. 1295–1297&lt;/ref&gt;
The first master programs in Business Informatics were offered by the [[University of Rostock]], as a face-to-face program, and by the [[Virtual Global University]] (VGU) together with the [[Viadrina European University|European University Viadrina]] Frankfurt (Oder) as an online program (see [[virtual education]]).
An MBI programme, which includes inter-cultural studies affecting business operations in European markets, was first offered by [[Dublin City University]]. Within the [[Bologna process]], many Central European universities have been, or are in the process of, setting up master programmes in Business Informatics. Due to legal frameworks and restrictions, however, most of these programs are forced to award an M.Sc. degree instead of an MBI degree.

== Example ==

A typical MBI program is the [[Virtual Global University|VGU]]'s "International Master of Business Informatics" program in Germany. Since this program was set up and accredited in accordance with nationwide guidelines for content and structure, it reflects well the state-of-the-art of Business Informatics master programs. If studied full-time, the MBI program is a four-semester program and can be composed of courses from the following areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vg-u.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809170057/http://vg-u.org/ |archive-date=2018-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another typical MBI program is the MIAGE&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:MIAGE]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Méthodes Informatiques Appliquées à la Gestion des Entreprises) program in France, present in more than 20 universities ([https://miage.u-paris10.fr/ MIAGE Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense], [http://mido.dauphine.fr/fr/miage.html MIAGE Dauphine], [https://formations.univ-amu.fr/ME5BIG.html MIAGE Aix-Marseille], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160423134618/http://formations.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/catalogue/master-XB/sciences-technologies-sante-STS/master-methodes-informatiques-appliquees-a-la-gestion-des-entreprises-miage-program-master-miage.html MIAGE Grenoble Alpes], [http://www.univ-paris1.fr/diplomes/miage/ MIAGE Sorbonne]).
Some MBI programs are organized in tracks or profiles, guiding the students in the design of their master study plan. This is the case of the "Master in Business Informatics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=MBI website in Utrecht University|url=http://www.uu.nl/masters/en/business-informatics|website=Master in Business Informatics, Utrecht University|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Utrecht University]], which allows students to specialize in one of the following four career areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MBI tracks explanation|url=http://www.uu.nl/masters/en/business-informatics/tracks|website=Master in Business Informatics, Utrecht University |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; business consultant (provides business advice from an ICT perspective), IT consultant (provides ICT advice from a business perspective), entrepreneur (independent entrepreneur who develops ICT products), and IT researcher (continuing with a PhD or targeting a research and development department in a software company).

== Typical areas of study ==

* Basic Technology:

Courses may include topics like applied computer science, [[Computer Networks and Internet Technology|computer networks and Internet technology]], website engineering, programming, or information security.

* Business Informatics Methods:

Courses may focus on information systems development, database management, information systems architectures, business intelligence, or business process modelling.

* Management:

Management oriented topics may be studied in courses on management information systems, information management, management control, knowledge management, management and organization of IT departments, or software engineering management.

* Applications:

Important application domains of Business Informatics may be investigated in courses like enterprise resource planning, e-commerce and e-business networking, industrial information systems, or electronic finance/electronic banking.

== Typical positions for MBI graduates ==

Graduates in Business Informatics can fill positions like information manager, systems analyst, systems designer, project manager, business solutions developer, IT entrepreneur, IS specialist, consultant in areas like enterprise resource planning, supply chain management, customer relationship management, or knowledge management.

{{nihongo|'''Mori Koben'''|森 小弁||extra=October 15, 1869&amp;ndash;August 23, 1945}} was a Japanese businessman and adventurer, who was best remembered as one of the first [[Japanese settlement in the Federated States of Micronesia|Japanese pioneers in Micronesia]]. As a young man, Mori migrated from [[Japan]] to [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]], where he helped to establish Japanese businesses in Micronesia.&lt;ref&gt;Gaimusho (2000), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Mori's guidance and direction helped to expand Japanese business interests throughout [[Micronesia]] during the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Germany|German]] colonial-era. After Japan annexed Micronesia from Germany in 1914, Mori was hired as an adviser to the Japanese administration in the [[South Pacific Mandate]], and was instrumental in encouraging Japanese settlement in Micronesia. In his final years during [[World War II]], Mori facilitated Micronesian support in the Japanese war efforts, but was already suffering from failing health from old age. He died within a few days after the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]], and a sizeable minority of Micronesians with Japanese ancestry from [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]] trace their ancestry back to Mori.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yashinomi.to/pacific/tsushin01.html 【太平洋通信】南の島々から（１）「日本人の血、誇りに思う」「冒険ダン吉」のように] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011033720/http://www.yashinomi.to/pacific/tsushin01.html |date=2009-10-11 }} September 23, 2003, Coconuts College (retrieved October 9, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Mori was born in [[Tosa Province]] (part of modern-day [[Kōchi Prefecture]]), [[Shikoku]] to a [[Samurai]] family. In his youth, Mori developed an aptitude for the study of [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]] and Chinese classics. At the age of fifteen in 1884, Mori left his hometown to work as a houseboy for Oi Kentarō. At that time, Oi was plotting to raise an army to prepare for an invasion of [[Korea]]. Mori was inspired by Oi's, and often followed along Oi and his activist followers to carry out robbery and extortion to raise funds for the purchase of weapons. The police carried out a crackdown on Oi's followers the following year, and about 130 activists were arrested in [[Osaka]] and [[Nagasaki]]. Mori was among those who was arrested, but was released on account of his young age.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after he was released, Mori managed to secure employment to work as a houseboy in the Court where Kentarō was being tried. Mori attempted to steal evidence that was used against Oi in the prosecution, but was caught red-handed and convicted to prison for a year. After his release, Mori returned to his hometown, and later moved to [[Tokyo]] in 1889. Through a former acquaintance of Oi, Mori worked as a houseboy for [[Gotō Shōjirō]]'s household the following year. During his stint with Gotō's family, Mori came across artefacts and research which Gotō's son, Taketarō had gathered during his diplomatic to Micronesia. Mori left Gotō's household in May 1891 to work for the Ichiya company, a trading firm which had business interests in Micronesia.&lt;ref name="Peattie27"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult life==

===Early years in Micronesia===

Mori was selected to work as a resident representative of the company's branch in Micronesia, and left Japan from [[Yokohama]], on board the ''Tenyu Maru'' in November 1891 with eight other employees.&lt;ref name="Peattie27"/&gt; The ''Tenyu Maru'' stopped by the [[Bonin Islands|Bonins]], but encountered a typhoon when it came close to the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]]. Mori and his colleagues reached [[Pohnpei]] in 1891, where one of his colleagues got his wife pregnant and had a set of triplets disembarked to manage the company's branch store. The ''Tenyu Maru'' headed for [[Truk Lagoon]], and Mori left the ship's company and armed himself with a sword and two daggers. Mori offered his services as a military adviser for Manuppis, the most influential chief in [[Weno|Moen]]. After leading a successful attack against a rival tribe, Manuppis facilitated Mori's efforts to assimilate with [[Chuukese people|Chuukese]] society. He maintained contacts with the Ichiya company, and equipped Manuppis with Japanese Murata rifles. A few Japanese settlers came to Chuuk over the next few years, and Mori maintained close contacts with Japanese traders in Chuuk and Pohnpei.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; As tribal warfare continued into the 1890s, Mori and the other Japanese settlers continued to align themselves with the tribal chiefs in order to safeguard their business interests.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Mori lost the fingers on his right hand in 1896, while he was preparing gunpowder for ammunition which suddenly exploded. Mori tended to his own wounds in spite of the great pain, and remained in Chuuk for several weeks before leaving for Yokohama by a merchant ship. He sought medical treatment in Tokyo, before he returned to Tolas where he spent several months recuperating. The following year, Mori returned to Chuuk, and built a house at Moen. Mori was appointed the resident agent for Hiki Company, after the Ichiya company faced bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Mori married Manuppis' daughter, and their first son Taro was born in the same year. He became an independent trader in 1899, after the Hiki company ran into financial difficulties, and aligned himself with the ''Jaluit Gesellschaft'',&lt;ref name="Peattie323"/&gt; a German trading company at the turn of the century.&lt;ref name="Peattie"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after Germany purchased the Micronesian islands from Spain in 1898, the German authorities arrested the Japanese traders at Irais and deported them back to Japan, leaving only Mori in Chuuk and another Japanese trader stranded in Pohnpei. Japanese traders were barred from trading in Micronesia. Mori and his family relocated to [[Tol (island)|Tol]], and received occasional contacts of news reports from [[Japan]]. Japanese traders began settling in Micronesia after the Germans lifted the ban in 1907, but Mori kept a low profile to avoid antagonising the German administration.&lt;ref name="Peattie 1988, p. 31"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese colonial-era (1914-1945)===

Shortly after Japan seized the Micronesian islands from Germany, Mori was hired as a civil affairs adviser by the Japanese military administration. At the direction of the Japanese navy commander, Mori authored a thesis on the culture and customs of the Chuukese people, and was later used by the military administration in drafting local administrative policies.  When the military occupation gave way to the [[South Pacific Mandate]], Mori stayed on.  He was ranked among the wealthiest men in the Carolines in the 1920s, having built his wealth from revenues that he received from coconut and copra plantations that he had established. He lobbied the Japanese government to facilitate the construction of trade facilities, transportation and schools in Chuuk.&lt;ref name="Peattie 1988, p. 31"/&gt; He was also elected as the chief of [[Tol (island)|Tol]] within the Chuukese community, and was the first known foreigner to be elected to a political position in traditional Micronesian society.&lt;ref name="Peattie196"/&gt; A comic book written by Shimada Keizo in the 1930s, ''Boken Dankichi'' which drew its inspiration from Mori's experiences in his youth, led the general public to acquaint itself with Mori, both in Japan and Micronesia.&lt;ref name="Peattie323"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Government officials and businessmen based in Chuuk often paid their respects to Mori in his house before they went about carrying out their duties, and the Japanese press often referred to Mori as the "King of the South Seas" in news reports.&lt;ref name="Peattie196"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; During the opening ceremony for a new athletic field at [[Dublon]], Mori was awarded the 8th class&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~tetuya/REKISI/sitenlog/news070519.html ニュースな史点], May 19, 2007, 徹夜城の多趣味の城&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]].&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Second World War]], Mori provided assistance to the Japanese government for the country's war effort. At the persuasion of Mori's family, many Chuukese offered their services to the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; A few of his grandsons also served in the army, and Mori's sons and grandsons were instrumental in protecting the islanders' food resources from petty theft during the war.&lt;ref name="Poyer210"&gt;Poyer et al. (2001), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Mori himself suffered a stroke in 1942, and was left paralysed in the right side of his body. He gradually developed increasing signs of [[dementia]] which left him hallucinating of Japan's defeat in the [[Pacific War]]. Mori slipped into unconsciousness shortly before the Japanese surrender in early August 1945, and died at his home in Tol seven days after the surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Mori had six sons and five daughters with Manuppis' daughter. His wife was given the Japanese name of "Isa" at the time of their marriage in 1898. Mori gave his children Japanese names, and in his younger days he taught his children [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and often celebrated Japanese national holidays at home.&lt;ref name="Peattie"/&gt; When Japan ruled Micronesia between 1914 and 1945, Mori's family were granted Japanese citizenship and were identified by their Japanese heritage.&lt;ref name="Poyer210"/&gt; After the Japanese surrender, members of the Mori family renounced their Japanese citizenship, and identified themselves as Micronesians.&lt;ref&gt;Kiste et al. (1999), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; A 1984 survey counted that there were at least 1,000 male-line descendants of Mori,&lt;ref&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; mostly from the 3rd to the 6th generations. Descendants from the female-line make up approximately another 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micronesia.emb-japan.go.jp/whatsfsm/whatsfsm.html ミクロネシア連邦とは？] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208103400/http://www.micronesia.emb-japan.go.jp/whatsfsm/whatsfsm.html |date=2009-12-08 }} Embassy of Japan in the Federated States of Micronesia, retrieved October 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Najib Azmi Mikati''' ({{lang-ar|نجيب ميقاتي}}; born 24 November 1955) is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] politician who served twice as the [[Prime Minister of Lebanon]]. From April 2005 to July 2005 he was [[List of Prime Ministers of Lebanon|Prime Minister]] of [[Lebanon]] in a [[caretaker government]]. On 25 January 2011, he was nominated to serve as Prime Minister by a majority of the votes in the [[Parliament of Lebanon|parliamentary consultations]] following the 12 January fall of the [[Lebanese government of November 2009]]. The government was formed on 13 June 2011, after many delays.&lt;ref name=tds18may&gt;{{cite news|title=Mikati: new government will restore trust in economy|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2011/May-28/Mikati-new-government-will-restore-trust-in-economy.ashx#axzz2MlnuGumy|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 March 2013, Mikati submitted his resignation from office, which Lebanese president [[Michel Suleiman]] accepted on 23 March 2013.

==Early life and education==
Mikati was born on 24 November 1955&lt;ref name=bbc11&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Najib Mikati|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12277773|accessdate=6 October 2012|newspaper=BBC|date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hails from a prominent [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]] family based in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Harris|title=Lebanon: A History, 600-2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jY4ImTGnamUC&amp;pg=PA347|accessdate=18 March 2013|date=19 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518111-1|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1980 with a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree.&lt;ref name=marco15oct&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanese Power-brokers: The Most Powerful Families of Lebanon|url=http://www.marcopolis.net/lebanese-power-brokers-the-most-powerful-families-of-lebanon-1510.htm|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=Marcopolis|date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended a summer school program held at Harvard and the French business school [[INSEAD]].&lt;ref name=bbc11/&gt;

==Business career==
Mikati co-founded the telecommunications company Investcom with his brother Taha in 1982. He sold the company in June 2006 to South Africa's [[MTN Group]] for $5.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|title=The World's Billionaires|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Najib-Mikati_EF3J.html|accessdate=4 January 2011|newspaper=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated his net worth at $3.3 billion, making him the richest man in Lebanon.&lt;ref name=formarch&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbes' Billionaires|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/najib-mikati/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
After being appointed Minister of Public Works and Transport on 4 December 1998, Mikati was elected to the [[National Assembly of Lebanon|Lebanese parliament]] from his hometown of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in 2000, outpolling [[Omar Karami]], who was elected from the same multimember constituency. As a parliamentarian, Mikati retained his cabinet position and developed a reputation as a moderately pro-Syrian politician with a normal relationship with Syrian [[List of Presidents of Syria|president]] [[Bashar Assad]]. Later Mikati was made transportation minister and became an ally of then Lebanese president [[Émile Lahoud|Emile Lahoud]], supporting the extension of his term in 2004.&lt;ref name=moh8sep&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fakih|first=Mohalhel|title=Pulling at Lebanon's strings|journal=Al Ahram Weekly|date=2–8 September 2004|volume=706|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/706/re4.htm|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a perennial candidate for Lebanon's prime ministry since 2000, finally taking the office upon the resignation of Omar Karami on 13 April 2005.&lt;ref name=assir27apr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Assir|first=Serene|title=Divided we fall|journal=Al Ahram Weekly|date=21–27 April 2005|volume=739|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/739/re5.htm|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikati acted as a caretaker premier.&lt;ref name=blo13jun&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanon’s Mikati Forms New Cabinet With Hezbollah Support|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-13/lebanon-s-mikati-forms-new-cabinet-with-hezbollah-support.html|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=13 June 2011|author=Alaa Shahine|author2=Massoud A. Derhally}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the leader of the solidarity bloc, which has had two seats in the Lebanese parliament since 2004. He also created the centrist movement and ideology in Lebanon and the Arab world, for which he has held many international conferences in Lebanon. In [[Lebanese General Elections 2009|the general elections]] of 2009, Mikati won again a seat from Tripoli, being a member of the centrist groups in the Lebanese parliament.&lt;ref name=ifes&gt;{{cite web|title=Elections in Lebanon|url=http://qifanabki.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/ifes-lebanon-electoral-districts-2011.pdf|publisher=IFES|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First premiership==
During negotiations to form a government, Mikati emerged as a consensus candidate.&lt;ref name="arabnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hosri|first=Danielle|title=Opposition-Backed Moderate Mikati Named Lebanese PM|url=http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=62209&amp;d=16&amp;m=4&amp;y=2005|accessdate=4 January 2011|newspaper=Arab News|date=16 April 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616060530/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=62209&amp;d=16&amp;m=4&amp;y=2005|archivedate=16 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his closeness to Syria, his willingness to compromise and his promise to dismiss the chiefs of the security forces, whom many Lebanese suspected of involvement in the assassination of former prime minister [[Rafik Hariri]] on 14 February 2005, won him the support of the anti-Syrian opposition, who were opposed to [[Abdul Rahim Mourad]], the strongly pro-Syrian minister of defense. "We will be the symbol of moderation and national unity," Mikati declared after being sworn in at the [[Baabda Palace|Presidential palace]] in [[Baabda]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

He was appointed Prime Minister by president Émile Lahoud on 15 April 2005 to succeed [[Omar Karami]], who gave up after seven weeks of frustrated efforts to form a [[consensus government]] and resigned. Mikati held office for three months, with the position being transferred to [[Fouad Siniora]] on 19 July 2005.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

===Resignation===
Mikati's immediate priority was to prepare Lebanon for crucial parliamentary elections, which were scheduled to be held by 31 May 2005.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Constitutionally, a government must be in place to call for an election, and opposition politicians had accused president Lahoud and former prime minister Karami of stalling the formation of a government in order to thwart the elections, which anti-Syrian parties believed they could win.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Mikati's government succeeded in organizing the election, which saw the opposition (by that time known as the [[14 March Alliance|14 March Movement]]) win 72 out of the 128 seats in the [[National Assembly of Lebanon|National Assembly]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Second premiership==
{{further|Lebanese government of June 2011}}
On 24 January 2011, the [[March 8 alliance]], specifically [[Hezbollah]], [[Michel Aoun]] and [[Walid Jumblatt]], nominated Mikati to become prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Harris|title=Lebanon: A History, 600-2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jY4ImTGnamUC&amp;pg=PP2|accessdate=7 April 2013|date=19 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518111-1|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikati succeeded [[Saad Hariri]], whose government was brought down by the resignation of ten of the alliance's ministers and one presidential appointee on 12 January 2011, resulting from the collapse of the Saudi-Syrian initiative to reach a compromise on the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]]. On 25 January, 68 members of the [[parliament of Lebanon]] voted in favor of nominating Mikati for Prime Minister. [[President of Lebanon]] [[Michel Suleiman]] then invited Mikati to head a new [[Government of Lebanon|Lebanese government]]. The process of government formation lasted for five months due to serious disagreements between leaders.&lt;ref name=paul15june&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salem|first=Paul|title=Lebanon’s New Government: Outlines and Challenges|journal=Carnegie Middle East|date=15 June 2011|url=http://carnegie-mec.org/2011/06/15/lebanon-s-new-government-outlines-and-challenges/axk7|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 2011, Mikati became the Prime Minister of Lebanon for the second time.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

On 13 June, Mikati announced the formation of the government and stated that it would begin by "liberating land that remains under the occupation of the Israeli enemy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/lebanon-pm-new-government-to-liberate-land-under-occupation-of-israeli-enemy-1.367453?localLinksEnabled=false "Lebanon PM: New government to liberate land under occupation of 'Israeli enemy'."] ''Reuters'', 13 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olin12&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first=Kevin|title=Hezbollah: Terror in Context|url=http://digitalcommons.olin.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=ahs_capstone_2012&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dlebanese%2Bcivil%2Bwar%2Band%2Bpolitical%2Bpersonas%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D#search=%22lebanese%20civil%20war%20political%20personas%22|publisher=Olin College of Engineering|accessdate=2 July 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 March 2013, Mikati resigned from office, due to "intensifying pressure between the pro-Assad and anti-Assad camps"&lt;ref name="29 March CEIP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Salem|first=Paul|title=Lebanon Imperiled as Prime Minister Resigns Under Duress|url=http://www.carnegie-mec.org/2013/03/23/lebanon-imperiled-as-prime-minister-resigns-under-duress/fsq9|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|accessdate=29 March 2013|date=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lebanese president accepted his resignation on 23 March 2013.&lt;ref name=basha22mar&gt;{{cite news|last=El Basha|first=Thomas|title=Lebanese PM announces resignation of his government|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2013/Mar-22/211161-lebanese-pm-mikati-announces-his-resignation.ashx#axzz2ODDb0hpR|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2013, [[Tammam Salam]] was tasked to form a new government.&lt;ref name=bbc6apr&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanon names Tammam Salam as new prime minister|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22051776|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oak Investment Partners''' is a [[private equity]] firm focusing on [[venture capital]] investments in companies developing communications systems, [[information technology]], new [[Internet]] media, healthcare services and retail.

==History==
The firm, founded in 1978, is based in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] with offices in Norwalk, Connecticut, [[Minneapolis]] and [[Palo Alto]], California. Since inception, Oak had invested in more than 480 companies and had raised more than  $8.4 billion in investor commitments across 12 private equity funds.&lt;ref&gt;Mass High Tech: The Journal of New England Technology, July 21, 2006 ''[http://www.bizjournals.com/masshightech/stories/2006/07/24/story8.html Oak's $2.5B fund, closed in Q2, is nation's largest]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, Oak raised its 12th fund, at $2.56 billion reportedly the largest venture capital fund ever raised.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, July 17, 2006 ''[http://www.thomson.com/content/pr/tf/tf_priv_equiconsul/2006_07_17_2Q06_Mega_Funds_Drive Mega Funds Drive Private Equity Fundraising To New Heights In Second Quarter Of 2006]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Indian-born employee Iftikar Ahmed was sued by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] on suspicion of stealing US$65 million from the firm.&lt;ref name="wsjimmigrant"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvard, Goldman Sachs, Venture Capital…Fugitive |first1=Anupreeta|last1=Das|first2=Jean|last2=Eaglesham |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/harvard-goldman-sachs-venture-capitalfugitive-1444261176 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 7, 2015 |accessdate = October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed was believed to have fled to India.  In August 2015, Fortune reported that Mr. Ahmed had been detained in an Indian prison from May 22 until July 23 and that his passport had been confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;http://fortune.com/2015/08/07/ifty-ahmed-vc-charged-with-fraud-spent-past-two-months-in-india-jail/&lt;/ref&gt;

Oak also selectively invests in public companies through [[private investment in public equity|PIPE]] investments.

In December 2008, Oak invested $25 million in the online media outlet [[Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081201/huffington-post-nabs-25-million-in-funding-heres-an-exclusive-boomtown-interview-with-oak-investments-fred-harman/ Huffington Post Nabs $25 Million in Funding–Here’s a BoomTown Interview With Oak Investment’s Fred Harman]'' All Things Digital, December 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Paraphrasing of copyrighted material''' may reduce the probability that a court will find that [[copyright]] has been infringed; however, there have been many cases where a [[paraphrase]] that uses quite different words and sentence structure has been found to infringe on a prior work's copyright.

The acceptable degree of difference between a prior work and a paraphrase depends on a variety of factors and ultimately depends on the judgement of the court in each individual case.

==Legal traditions==

===Early years===
[[File:Zedler - Universal-Lexicon, Band 1 (Titelblatt).jpg|thumb|[[Johann Heinrich Zedler]]'s right to publish his ''[[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon|Universal-Lexicon]]'' was challenged on the grounds that an encyclopedia must always paraphrase other works.]]
An early example of the concept of paraphrasing as a copyright issue arose with [[Johann Heinrich Zedler]]'s application in 1730 for copyright protection in Saxony for his ''[[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon]]'', one of the first encyclopedias. 
The publisher of a rival ''General Historical Lexicon'' said that Zedler's ''Universal Lexicon'' would not differ in content from this and other existing lexicons apart from paraphrasing.{{sfn|Kirchhoff|1891|pp=198}}
On 16 October 1730, the Upper Consistory court in [[Dresden]] rejected Zedler's request, and warned that he would be subject to confiscation and a fine if he reproduced any material from the ''General Historical Lexicon'' in his ''Universal Lexicon''.{{sfn|Order against Zedler}}

Laws on the degree of copying or paraphrasing that is considered permissible have become steadily more restrictive over the years.
In his 2008 book ''Copyright's Paradox'', discussing the conflict between protecting copyright and protecting free speech,  Neil Netanel says, "Yeats [borrowed] from Shelley; Kafka from Kleist and Dickens; Joyce from Homer; and T.S. Eliot from Shakespeare, Whitman and Baudelaire, all in ways that would infringe today's bloated copyright."{{sfn|Saint-Amour|2011|p=31}}
Paraphrase may apply to music as well as to writing. It was commonplace for Baroque, Classical and Romantic composers to create variations on each other's work without permission.  This would not be allowed today.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=100}}

Copyright protection in Britain dates back to the 1556 Charter of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers]].
The [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]] gave publishers exclusive printing rights, but did not give any rights to authors.
Parliament failed to renew the act in 1694, primarily to remove monopoly and encourage a free press.
The [[Statute of Anne]] in 1710 prescribed a copyright term of fourteen years, and let the author renew for another fourteen years, after which the work went into the [[public domain]].
Over the years, additional acts and case law steadily refined the definitions of what could be protected, including derivative works, and the degree of protection given.{{sfn|Patterson|1993|pp=9ff}}

The Soviet Union's Copyright Act of 1925 in essence said that a work created by a minimal paraphrase of an existing text could be considered a new work eligible for copyright.{{sfn|Levitsky|1964|p=101}}
By 1991, the [[Copyright law of the Soviet Union]] had evolved to give much more protection to the author.
Free use, similar to the English [[common law]] concept of [[fair use]], was only allowed if it did not infringe upon the normal exploitation of the work or the legitimate interests of the author.{{sfn|Elst|2005|p=376}}

===Moral rights===

[[Moral rights (copyright law)|Moral rights]] are rights of creators of copyrighted works that are generally recognized in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some [[common law]] jurisdictions. 
They include the right of [[attribution (copyright)|attribution]] and the right to the integrity of the work, which bars the work from alteration, distortion, or mutilation without the author's permission.  Paraphrasing without permission may be seen as violating moral rights. 
Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. 
Even if the author has assigned their copyright to a third party, they still maintain the moral rights to the work.{{sfn|Rajan|2006|p=41-42}}
Moral rights were first recognized in [[France]] and [[Germany]].{{sfn|Rigamonti|2006|p=355}}
They were included in the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in 1928.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|p=37}}
While the [[United States]] became a signatory to the Berne convention in 1989, it does not completely recognize moral rights as part of [[copyright law]], which is seen as protecting commercial rights in intellectual property, but as part of other bodies of law such as defamation or unfair competition which protect the reputation of the author.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|pp=30ff}}
[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Gibbon]] was more concerned about poor translations of his book than about copyright violations.]]
[[Edward Gibbon]] published the last three volumes of his masterpiece ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' in 1788, at a time when both copyright and moral rights were poorly enforced.
With a small private income, he was not dependent on sales but was more concerned about the damage to his reputation from poor translations, a form of paraphrasing.
He wrote, "The French, Italian and German translations have been executed with various success; but instead of patronizing, I should willingly suppress such imperfect copes which injure the character while they propagate the name of the author.  The Irish pirates are at once my friends and my enemies...."{{sfn|Gibbon|2006|p=171}}

By the start of the twentieth century, U.S. decisions on unfair competition found that representing as the author's work a version of the work that substantially departed from the original was a cause of action.{{sfn|Winn|2006|pp=126-127}}
Section §43(a) of the [[Lanham Act]], which protects brands and trademarks, also provides similar protection to laws based on moral rights.
For any goods or services, it bans false designation of origin or a false description or representation.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|p=30}}
In ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting]]'' the British comedy group called ''[[Monty Python]]'' took action against the ABC network for broadcasting versions of their programs which had been correctly attributed to them but had been extensively edited, in part to remove content that their audience might consider offensive or obscene. 
The judgement of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] was in favor of ''Monty Python'', finding the cuts might be an "actionable mutilation" that violated the Lanham Act.{{sfn|Lumbard|1976}}

===Fair use===

In the United States, copyright was covered by common law until it was formalized in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].
Section §107 of this act set out four "[[fair use]]" principles to be used in evaluating whether copyright had been infringed:
*the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
*the nature of the copyrighted work;
*the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
*the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

These principles apply both to literal copies and to paraphrases.
Judges are required to consider these factors, but may also take others into consideration, and may choose what weight they apply to each factor.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=162ff}}
According to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp]]'' (1977), "The fair use doctrine offers a means of balancing the exclusive rights of a copyright holder with the public's interest in dissemination of information affecting areas of universal concern, such as art, science and industry."{{sfn|Burleson Enterprises|2011}}
Claims of fair use in copying or paraphrasing are more likely to succeed when the work being copied is factual.  
In ''[[Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] said, "the law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy."{{sfn|Perle|Fischer|Williams|1999|p=13-30}}
However, the court went on to quote Gorman, ''Fact or Fancy? The Implications for Copyright'' (1982) which said, "[E]ven within the field of fact works, there are gradations as to the relative proportion of fact and fancy. One may move from sparsely embellished maps and directories to elegantly written biography. The extent to which one must permit expressive language to be copied, in order to assure dissemination of the underlying facts, will thus vary from case to case."{{sfn|O'Connor|1985}}

[[File:Gerald Ford hearing.jpg|thumb|President [[Gerald Ford]] at the hearing on pardoning former President [[Richard Nixon]]. When ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine published excerpts of Ford's unpublished memoir describing his reason for pardoning Nixon, the Supreme Court ruled that copyright was infringed even though Ford was a public figure describing a public event.]]
Use of a work for critical commentary is generally considered fair, as long as the commentary is indeed about the substance or style of the original work.{{sfn|Port|Halpern|Nard|2011|p=132}}
Parody may be seen as a form of commentary, and to be effective must copy or paraphrase many of the elements of creative expression in the work being parodied.
Although courts have differed in the past about how closely a parody can copy an original work, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' (1994) ruled strongly: "[P]arody has an obvious claim to [[Transformativeness|transformative]] value... Like less ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, it can provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and in the process, creating a new one.  We thus line up with the courts that have held the parody, like other comment or criticism, may claim fair use under §107."{{sfn|Port|Halpern|Nard|2011|p=130–131}}

===Unpublished works===

Unpublished works have special status under both moral rights and copyright, since the author or copyright owner has the right to control first publication.
Publication of an excerpt or paraphrase of an unpublished work may infringe that right.
An author wishing to quote or even loosely paraphrase an unpublished work in France can only do so with permission from the author.{{sfn|Heins|Beckles|2005|p=17}}
In ''Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises'' (1985) the United States Supreme Court held that "under ordinary circumstances, the author's right to control the first public appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of fair use."{{sfn|Harper &amp; Row 1985}}

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]'', which concerned a biography in which a number of unpublished letters by the subject had been paraphrased, similarly concluded that the copyright owner's right to control publication took precedence over "fair use", so even limited paraphrasing was unacceptable.{{sfn|SALINGER v. RANDOM HOUSE, INC 1987}}
This drew support from those concerned with the rights of an individual to privacy and criticism from those more interested in the public "right to know."{{sfn|McDowell|1987}}
In 1992 the Copyright Act was amended as a result of the ''Salinger'' case to include a sentence at the end of §107 saying that the fact that a work is unpublished "shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration" of all four fair-use factors.{{sfn|Perle|Fischer|Williams|1999|p=13-7}}

==Comparison approaches==

A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words.  Equivalent concepts apply to images or music.
In most countries, copyright applies to the original expression in a work rather than to the meanings or ideas being expressed.
A loose paraphrase of a portion of a work may therefore be published without violating copyright.{{sfn|Head|2006|p=243}}
If the paraphrase is so different that the expression in the derivative work has no similarity to that of the prior work, there is no infringement.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=284}} 
In ''[[See v. Durang]]'' (1983) the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] found "Copying deleted or so disguised as to be unrecognizable is not copying."{{sfn|Browning|Choy|Ferguson|1983}}
But courts have struggled to find a clear method of comparing a paraphrase or derivative to a prior work to determine whether the copyright in the original expression has been infringed.

[[File:LearnedHand1910a.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Learned Hand]] gave a seminal description of the [[idea/expression dichotomy]] in his 1930 judgement on ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation]]''.]]
Philosophically, there is disagreement about the distinction between thought and language.
In the past it was often thought that the two could not be separated, and so a paraphrase could never exactly reproduce a thought expressed in different words.  
At the opposite extreme is the view that concepts and language are completely independent, so there is always a range of ways in which a concept can be expressed.{{sfn|Bently|Davis|Ginsburg|2010|p=190}}
Copyright law in common law countries tries to avoid theoretical discussion of the nature of ideas and expression such as this, taking a more pragmatic view of what is called the [[idea/expression dichotomy]].{{sfn|Bently|Davis|Ginsburg|2010|p=191-192}}
In ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation]]'' (1930), Judge [[Learned Hand]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] gave an explanation of the dichotomy that has often been cited by courts hearing copyright cases, and that illustrates the inherent subjectivity of any decision.{{sfn|Rooijen|2010|p=62-63}}
He said:
{{blockquote|Upon any work, and especially upon a play, a great number of patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well, as more and more of the incident is left out.  The last may perhaps be no more than the most general statement of what the play is about, and at times might consist only of its title; but there is a point in this series of abstractions where they are no longer protected, since otherwise the playwright could prevent the use of his "ideas," to which, apart from their expression, his property is never extended ... Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can.{{sfn|Hand|1930}}}}

The plaintiff in a copyright case must show that there is "[[substantial similarity]]" between the alleged copy and the prior work.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}} 
In ''[[Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co]]'' (1970) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit introduced the concept of "total concept and feel", holding that a work could be made up of elements that could not be copyrighted, but that the total concept and feel could be subject to copyright, and would be considered to be infringed if a normal reasonable person would consider that a disputed work was a copy of a prior work.{{sfn|Hamley|1970}}
This concept has been used in later cases such as ''[[Reyher v. Children's Television Workshop]]'' (1976), where two works derived from the same folk tale had similar plots.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that there had not been copying, since the different versions were very different in style and in detail, saying "the essence of infringement lies in taking not a general theme but its particular expression through similarities of treatment, details, scenes, events and characterization."{{sfn|Meskill|1976}}

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in ''[[Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.]]'' (1977) refined the concept by establishing a two-stage comparison.
An extrinsic test would determine similarity of general ideas, while an intrinsic test would compare the particular expressions used.
Extrinsic similarity means that two works are substantially similar in their general ideas, which can be determined objectively by an expert.
Intrinsic similarity means they are substantially similar in their forms of expression, and this is the more subjective test.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}}
The second test should be made by an "ordinary reasonable person" rather than an expert.{{sfn|Nimmer|2008|p=509}}
Both must be true for an infringement to exist.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}}

==Sample court findings==

The ideas or facts in a work are not subject to copyright protection, but the "protected expression" is.
A paraphrase of a work may infringe on copyright if the "protected expression" in the paraphrase is similar to that in the prior work.
Many court cases have hinged on how "protected expression" is defined and how similarity is determined.
[[File:H. T. Marshall and Martin Thomas Manton in 1915 at the Becker-Rosenthal trial in New York City.jpg|thumb|300px|In ''[[Nutt v. National Institute Inc.]]'' (1929), Judge [[Martin Thomas Manton]] ''(pictured, right)'' ruled that even loose paraphrasing may infringe copyright.]]
One of the earliest cases was ''[[Baker v. Selden]]'' (1879).  Charles Selden had developed a new system of bookkeeping and in 1865 published a short book that described his system, with sample forms.  W.C.M. Baker, who had seen Selden's book, published a similar book in 1867 describing an improved version of the system. A suit claiming copyright infringement went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1879.{{sfn|Samuelson|2005|p=2ff}} 
The Supreme court found that Selden's idea could not be protected since there was no patent, but his description or explanation of the system was protected by copyright law, and found that Baker's book was "in large and material part identical with and infringements of the books of Selden system."
The arguments and ruling differ from modern law in that there was no discussion of the expression, only of the close similarities in the ideas given in the two books.{{sfn|Samuelson|2005|p=18ff}}

In ''[[Nutt v. National Institute Inc.]]'' (1929), Nutt was prohibited from delivering in public and for profit lectures that were similar to lectures whose copyright was held by the National Institute for the Improvement of Memory.{{sfn|Standler|2009|p=13}}
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in this case found that the protected expression is more than the literal words but also includes the "association, presentation, and combination of the ideas and thought which go to make up the [author's] literary composition."{{sfn|American Law Book Company|1939|p=233}}
The court said "The infringement need not be a complete or exact copy. Paraphrasing or copying with evasion is an infringement, even though there may be little or no conceivable identity between the two."{{sfn|Manton|1929}}

Wainwright Securities was engaged in preparing in-depth analyses of public companies, and selling them to major investors. The Wall Street Transcript Corporation, publisher of the ''Transcript'' magazine, began to publish abstracts of the Wainwright reports.
In ''Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp'' (1977) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted that "news events" cannot be copyrighted, but found that "the Transcript appropriated almost verbatim the most creative and original aspects of the reports, the financial analyses and predictions."
The court said, "What is protected is the manner of expression, the author's analysis or interpretation of events, the way he structures his material and marshals facts, his choice of words and the emphasis he gives to particular developments."{{sfn|Mishler|1977}}
An example of very close paraphrasing in this case was:
:*Original: "And second, he says that likely to aid comparisons this year was the surprisingly limited extent to which Fiber Divisions losses shrank last year."
:*Paraphrase: "The second development likely to aid comparisons this year was the surprisingly limited extent to which the Fiber Division's losses shrank last year."{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=285}} 
[[File:Richard Wright (escritor).jpg|thumb|In ''Wright v. Warner Books'' (1991) the court found that use of paraphrases and sparing excerpts from unpublished work by [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] ''(pictured)'' was fair.]]
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]'' (1987) found that an unauthorized biography by [[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]] had infringed copyright with paraphrases of passages from unpublished letters written by the subject, the well-known novelist [[J. D. Salinger]]. As an example, the court cited:
:*Original: "He looks to me like a guy who makes his wife keep a scrapbook for him" 
:*Paraphrase: "[Salinger] had fingered [Wilkie] as the sort of fellow who makes his wife keep an album of press clippings."  
Despite differences in wording and sentence structure, the court found this to be a close paraphrase of a highly original expression.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=287}}
In this case, the close paraphrasing was considered to contribute to the "amount and substantiality" of the material that had been copied - that is, paraphrasing is a form of copying.{{sfn|Saint-Amour|2011|p=222}}
The court also found that Hamilton's practice of including phrases like "Salinger says," or "he said" within his paraphrase could give readers of the biography the false impression that they had read Salinger's own words. They might therefore decide not to buy a collection of the original letters. The court found that this meant there would be a financial impact.
The court barred publication.{{sfn|SALINGER v. RANDOM HOUSE, INC 1987}}

The case of ''[[Wright v. Warner Books]]'' (1991) was superficially similar to ''Salinger''.
[[Margaret Walker]] wrote an unauthorized biography of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], best known for his  books ''[[Native Son]]'' and ''[[Black Boy]]'', 
in which she made "sparing  use" of excerpts from the subject's unpublished letters and journals.
Ellen Wright, Richard Wright's widow, sued the author and [[Warner Books]], the publisher.{{sfn|Gaines|1992|p=175}}
In one example, the book paraphrased as follows from an unpublished letter that Wright had written:
:*Original: "Ellen, Julia, and Rachel will be here on Tuesday: they'll stay for two days.  Don't know what will happen when they get here. I'm hoping for peace and quiet."
:*Paraphrase: "Early in 1960, Wright wrote to Margrit de Sabloniere that Ellen, Julia, and Rachel would be arriving for a two or three day visit. Wright said that he did not know what would happen when they arrived but that he was hoping for peace and quiet."
Despite the apparent similarity, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that copyright had not been infringed.
The paraphrasing was just "straightforward and factual reportage" of the "most basic and banal factual matter."{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=286}}

==Exclusions==

There are cases where there is very little choice about how to express some fact or idea, so a copy or close paraphrase may be unavoidable.
In this case, the "[[Merger doctrine (copyright law)|merger doctrine]]" comes into play.
The fact or idea and the expression are seen as merged, and the expression cannot be protected.
The merger doctrine is typically applied only to factual information or scientific theories, not to imaginative works such as plays or novels where the author has a much broader choice of expression.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=288}}
The merger doctrine has been applied to the user interface design of computer software, where similarity between icons used by two different programs is acceptable if only a very limited number of icons would be recognizable by users, such as an image looking like a page to represent a document.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=47}}
However, in 1994 a U.K. judge in ''Ibcos Computers v. Barclays Mercantile Finance'' cast doubt on the merger doctrine, saying he was not comfortable with the idea that "if there is only one way of expressing an idea that way is not the subject of copyright."{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=45}}
[[File:Richard Posner at Harvard University.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Richard Posner]] has argued that websites should be legally required to obtain permission before paraphrasing news sources.]]
The term "Scenes a faire" means "obligatory scene", a scene in a play that the audience "has been permitted to foresee and to desire from the progress of the action; and such a scene can never be omitted without a consequent dissatisfaction."  The term was applied to copyright law in ''[[Cain v. Universal Pictures]]'' (1942), where the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California]] ruled that "... similarities and incidental details necessary to the environment or setting of an action are not the material of which copyrightable originality consists."{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=52}}
The concept has been used by U.S. and U.K. courts.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=54}}
The term is used both in the sense of a scene that follows inevitably from a situation,
or a standard scene that is always included in a particular genre of work.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=53}}
Another court said "Under the ... doctrine of ''[[scènes à faire]]'', courts will not protect a copyrighted work from infringement if the expression embodied in the work necessarily flows from a commonplace idea."{{sfn|Iyer|2012|p=53}}
The concept has been extended to computer software, where some aspects may be dictated by the problem to be solved, or may be standard programming techniques.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=59}}

==Permission agreements==

Publishers may formally allow limited quotation but prohibit paraphrasing, since they do not want readers to mistake the paraphrase for the original work.
In this case they would prohibit alteration of the work in their permission agreement.  
Although paraphrasing may be considered [[fair use]] under copyright law it may be considered breach of contract when the author of the paraphrase has implicitly or explicitly accepted a permission agreement.{{sfn|Stim|2010|p=46}}

Judge [[Richard Posner]] has argued in his blog in favor of laws that require online sites to obtain permission from the copyright holder before linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials from newspapers.  His concern is that existing laws based on fair use may not provide sufficient protection to the newspapers, who are paying for expensive news collection while the websites essentially get a free ride.  Without greater protection, Judge Posner considers that the result of widespread paraphrasing of newspapers on internet sites could be a drastic reduction in the number of news-gathering sources.{{sfn|Posner|2009}}

==Application status==

=== 2009 ===
Initial applications for regulatory approval to construct the PATH transmission line were filed in 2009. On September 9, 2009, the [[Maryland Public Service Commission]] rejected the application as improperly filed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvpubcast.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=11221 West Virginia Public Broadcasting, "PATH rejected by Maryland PSC on technicalities"].&lt;/ref&gt; PATH was given 30 days to declare whether they would refile in Maryland, but only announced they were reconsidering their options.  On October 19, 2009, the [[Virginia State Corporation Commission]] filed a motion to dismiss the PATH application in Virginia, citing inability to adequately analyze the project due to an uncertain Maryland termination point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leesburgtoday.com/articles/2009/10/23/news/fp11path102009.txt ''Leesburg Today'', "SCC Staff Recommends PATH Application Dismissal"].&lt;/ref&gt; On October 28, 2009 an attorney for the [[West Virginia Public Service Commission]] moved to dismiss the PATH application in West Virginia.  Virginia and West Virginia are requesting rejection of the application [[without prejudice]], meaning PATH will be able to refile in those states once they have refiled a proper application in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal-news.net/page/content.detail/id/527158.html?startIndex=26 [[The Journal (West Virginia newspaper)|The Journal]], "PSC seeks to halt PATH"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dick Ishler, President of the Citizens Against the Kemptown Electrical Substation (CAKES) says this is a huge victory for the little guy; "This is but the latest example of David beating Goliath, concerned citizens banding together, in this case, to stop a toxic coal-fired transmission line."&lt;ref name="fredericknewspost1"/&gt; Will Burns, the Sierra Club attorney who has spent hundreds of hours researching the PATH project is optimistic PJM's order will close the PATH project down; "We didn't believe this was needed for reliability reasons.

== Kemptown Property ==
{{References|date=April 2018}}
In December 2008 PATH Allegheny Transmission Company, LLC purchased two contiguous properties in Kemptown, Maryland comprising 152.2 acres for $6.83 million.  The properties, actively farmed at the time, were sold by the Browning family which held title to one property as a limited partnership and the other property as a limited liability company.   The Kemptown properties are bisected by a high tension electrical transmission line owned by the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company and are adjacent to a second high tension electrical transmission line.  PATH planned to  The Kemptown property was slated by PATH as the location of a large electrical substation.  In September 2010, PATH Allegheny Transmission Company, LLC conveyed the property to PATH Allegheny Maryland Transmission Company, LLC for no consideration.

On August 22, 2017 the two Kemptown properties, along with several other smaller properties in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia were sold at public auction.   F.C. Frederick, Inc. a non-profit soccer club based in Frederick Maryland submitted the winning bids on the Kemptown properties.  Settlement on the transaction occurred in October 2017 at a price of $1.008 million.

He was noted for his purchase of expensive art. Specifically, at consecutive auctions by [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]] in New York in mid  May 1990, Saito bought [[Van Gogh]]'s ''[[Portrait of Dr. Gachet]]'' and [[Renoir]]'s [[Bal du moulin de la Galette]] for $82.5 and $78.1 million, repectively. At the time, these were the two [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive paintings]] sold, either at auction or through private sales. Taking inflation in account, they remained the two most expensive paintings until the private sale of [[Klimt]]'s [[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]] in June 2006. It took 25 years before Saito's public auction price was broken, through the sale of [[Picasso]]'s [[Les Femmes d'Alger]] ("Version O") at Christie's, New York, in May 2015. 

Saito died of a stroke six years after his acquisitions. Three year later, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, after failing to locate the Van Gogh for an exhibition, expressed concern that both paintings may have been cremated with the owner, since Saito had mentioned in the early 1990s, after having to pay $24m in taxes for them, that it would be better to do so, in order to avoid colossal death duties for his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Usborne|first1=David|title=Missing Van Gogh feared cremated with its owner|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/missing-van-gogh-feared-cremated-with-its-owner-1108973.html|website=Independent|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in 2007 it became publicly known that the painting had been sold in 1997 or 1998 to the Austrian-born investment fund manager [[Wolfgang Flöttl]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Rosenbaum, [http://www.artsjournal.com/culturegrrl/2007/01/dr_gachet_sighting_it_was_flot.html "Dr. Gachet" Sighting: It WAS Flöttl!], ArtsJournal, January 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aventis===
[[File:Aventis logo.png|left]]
Aventis was formed in 1999 when French company [[Rhône-Poulenc]] S.A. merged with the German corporation [[Hoechst Marion Roussel]], which itself was formed from the 1995 merger of [[Hoechst AG]] with [[Cassella]], [[Roussel Uclaf]] and [[Marion Merrell Dow]].

At the time of the merger, Rhône-Poulenc's business included the pharmaceutical businesses Rorer, Centeon (blood products), and [[Sanofi Pasteur|Pasteur Merieux]] (vaccines),  the plant and animal health businesses Rhône-Poulenc Agro, Rhône-Poulenc Animal Nutrition, and [[Merial]], and a 67 percent share in [[Rhodia (company)|Rhodia]], a speciality chemicals company.&lt;ref name=Bris/&gt;{{rp|10}}   Hoechst, one of the companies resulting from the post-WWII split of [[IG Farben]], had seven primary businesses: Hoechst Marion Roussel (pharmaceuticals), [[AgrEvo]] (a joint venture with [[Schering AG|Schering]] in crop protection agents and pest control products), HR Vet (veterinary products), [[Dade Behring]] (diagnostics), Centeon, [[Celanese]] (chemicals), and Messer (chemicals).&lt;ref name=Bris/&gt;{{rp|9}} [[Institut Mérieux|Merieux]] has been in the business of selling blood products, and In the 1980s during the [[History of HIV/AIDS#1981: From GRID to AIDS|AIDS epidemic]], Merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to HIV-[[contaminated haemophilia blood products]] that were sold to developing nations.&lt;ref name = NYTimes1996&gt;{{cite news | title =  Blood, Money and AIDS: Haemophiliacs Are Split; Liability Cases Bogged Down in Disputes | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/11/business/blood-money-aids-hemophiliacs-are-split-liability-cases-bogged-down-disputes.html | first = Barry | last = Meier | date = 1996-06-11 | work = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid 2000 Aventis and [[Millennium Pharmaceuticals]], a US biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the then-new science of [[genomics]], announced that Aventis would make a $250M investment in Millennium and would pay $200M to Millennium in research fees over five years, one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pollack for the New York Times. 24 June 2000 [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/business/international-business-aventis-unit-sets-big-investment-biotechnology-start-up.html Aventis Unit Sets Big Investment in Biotechnology Start-Up]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2000, in the midst of the [[StarLink corn recall|recall of Starlink]], its [[genetically modified maize]] product, Aventis announced that it had determined to sell off Aventis Cropscience, the seed and pesticide business unit it had created from the agriculture businesses of its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, 16 November 2000 [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/16/business/aventis-to-sell-agriculture-unit.html Aventis to Sell Agriculture Unit]&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2001, [[Bayer]] and Aventis announced that Bayer would acquire the unit for about $6.6 billion, with the unit becoming [[Bayer CropScience]] and making Bayer the world's second-largest agrochemical company behind [[Syngenta]].&lt;ref&gt;CNN Money.  2 October 2001 [http://cnnfn.cnn.com/2001/10/02/europe/bayer/ Bayer buys CropScience]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Aventis entered into a collaboration with [[Regeneron]], a New York biotechnology company, to develop Regeneron's [[VEGF]]-inhibiting drug, [[aflibercept]], in the field of cancer, which was then in [[Phases of clinical research|Phase I]] clinical trials.

====Sanofi-Aventis merger====
Sanofi-Aventis was formed in 2004 when Sanofi-Synthélabo acquired Aventis. In early 2004, Sanofi-Synthélabo made a [[Takeover|hostile takeover]] bid worth €47.8 billion for Aventis. Initially, Aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the company's share value, and the board of Aventis went so far as to enact [[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill]] provisions and to invite [[Novartis]] to enter merger negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Timmons for the New York Times. 3 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/03/business/international-business-aventis-invites-novartis-to-counter-sanofi-s-bid.html Aventis Invites Novartis To Counter Sanofi's Bid]&lt;/ref&gt; The three-month takeover battle concluded when Sanofi-Synthélabo launched a friendly bid of €54.5 billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid.  The [[France|French]] government played a strong role, desiring what it called a "local solution", by putting heavy pressure on Sanofi-Synthélabo to raise its bid for Aventis and for Aventis to accept the offer&lt;ref&gt;Heather Timmons for the New York Times. 27 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/business/france-helped-broker-the-aventis-sanofi-deal.html France Helped Broker the Aventis-Sanofi Deal]&lt;/ref&gt; and by rejecting Aventis' poison pill proposal.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times 24 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/24/business/aventis-plan-is-rejected.html Aventis Plan Is Rejected]&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the largest risks in the deal for both sides, was the fate of the patents protecting [[Clopidogrel]] (Plavix) which was one of the top-selling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of Sanofi's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly S Cleaves and Ann M Thayer [http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/mdd/v07/i08/pdf/804business2.pdf Warning, merge with care: Sanofi-Aventis] Modern Drug Discovery, August 2004:21-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-merger activities===
In 2006, Iraqis infected with HIV sued Sanofi and Baxter due to HIV-[[contaminated haemophilia blood products]] sold by Merieux in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul von Zielbauer for the New York Times. 4 September 2006 [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/04/world/middleeast/04aids.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Iraqis Infected by H.I.V.-Tainted Blood Try New Tool: A Lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the US patents on [[clopidogrel]] (Plavix) were challenged when a Canadian generics company, [[Apotex]], filed an [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] under the [[Hatch-Waxman Act]], received FDA approval, and started marketing a generic clopidogrel. While Sanofi-Aventis and its partner on the drug, [[Bristol Myers Squibb]] (BMS), were able to get an injunction to stop Apotex from selling the drug,&lt;ref&gt;BMS Press Release. 8 December 2006 [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/preliminary-injunction-against-apotex-upheld-on-appeal-56053592.html Preliminary Injunction Against Apotex Upheld on Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt; the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice - the second time due to an [[oral agreement]] made by BMS CEO Peter Dolan that BMS failed to disclose to the [[Federal Trade Commission]] during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate [[antitrust]] law.  When Apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the FTC, the FTC launched an investigation that led to Dolan being fired by BMS.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Smith for CNNMoney.com 26 October 2006 [http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/12/news/companies/bristol/index.htm?postversion=2006091217 Bristol CEO Dolan gets fired: Company says it heeded request of a federal monitor]&lt;/ref&gt;  Apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues after its third appeal was decided in favor of BMS/Sanofi in November 2011; Apotex had to pay ~$442 million in damages and ~$108 million in interest for infringing the patent,&lt;ref&gt;Donald Zuhn for Patent Docs. 9 November 2011 [http://www.patentdocs.org/2011/11/sanofi-aventis-v-apotex-inc-fed-cir-2011.html Sanofi-Aventis v.

In 2007 Sanofi-Aventis expanded on Aventis' prior relationship with [[Regeneron]]; in the new deal Sanofi-Aventis agreed to pay Regeneron $100 million each year for five years, under which Regeneron would use its [[monoclonal antibody]] [[drug discovery|discovery]] platform to create new [[biopharmaceuticals]], which Sanofi-Aventis gained the exclusive right to co-develop.&lt;ref name=RegenExpand&gt;Ron Winslow for the Wall Street Journal. 10 Nov. 2009 [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703808904574528224003357650 Sanofi Expands Regeneron Deal]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 the companies expanded the deal to $160 million per year and extended it through 2017.&lt;ref name=RegenExpand/&gt;&lt;ref name=GEN2009&gt;Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. 11 Nov 2009 [http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/sanofi-aventis-commits-over-2-8b-to-regeneron-in-mab-discovery-alliance/68174500/ Sanofi-Aventis Commits Over $2.8B to Regeneron in mAb Discovery Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2009 the collaboration had four antibodies in clinical development and had filed an IND for a fifth.

Between 2008, when Chris Viebacher was hired as CEO, and 2010, the company spent more than $17 billion in mergers and acquisitions to strengthen its consumer healthcare and generics platforms, especially in emerging markets, in the face of looming [[patent cliff]]s and the growth of the consumer healthcare segment.&lt;ref&gt;FierceBiotech.

===Rename to Sanofi and beyond===
The company dropped the -Aventis suffix of its name on 6 May 2011 after receiving approval at its [[annual general meeting]].

'''Product recall and effects''': The Epinephrine auto-injection devices made by Sanofi SA currently on the market in the U.S. and Canada were voluntarily recalled on 28 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/allerject-epinephrine-auto-injectors-recalled-by-drugmaker-sanofi-1.3293765|title=All Allerject epinephrine auto-injectors recalled|website=Cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allerject.ca/Common/docs/en/Sanofi-Canada-Issues-Voluntary-Recall-of-Allerject.pdf|format=PDF|title=Sanofi Canada Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Allerject Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage Delivery|website=Allerject.ca|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason stated by Sanofi was that the products have been found to potentially have inaccurate dosage delivery, which may include failure to deliver drug.&lt;ref name="auvi-q.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.auvi-q.com/|title=Auvi-Q® (epinephrine injection, USP)|website=Auvi-q.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm469980.htm|title=Recalls, Market Withdrawals, &amp; Safety Alerts - UPDATED: Sanofi US Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of All Auvi-Q® Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage Delivery|first=Office of Regulatory Affairs, Office of the|last=Commissioner|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanofi US also added the following warning: If a patient experiencing a serious allergic reaction (i.e., anaphylaxis) did not receive the intended dose, there could be significant health consequences, including death because anaphylaxis is a potentially life‑threatening condition.&lt;ref name="auvi-q.com"/&gt;

In its news release on 28 October 2015, Sanofi Canada stated that it was "actively working with suppliers of alternative epinephrine auto-injectors to have a full stock available in Canada as soon as possible. Canadian customers were asked to immediately return the Allerject product to their local pharmacy to obtain an alternate epinephrine auto-injector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/sanofi-canada-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-of-allerject-due-to-potential-inaccurate-dosage-delivery-538090301.html|title=Sanofi Canada Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Allerject® Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage|website=Newswire.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also filed a news release&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt; confirming that the recall involves all Auvi-Q currently on the market in the U.S. The FDA release went on to provide information for consumers re: exchanging the device for another brand of product, also provided on the Auivi-Q web site. Sanofi US will provide reimbursement for out of pocket costs incurred for the purchase of new, alternate epinephrine auto-injectors with proof of purchase.

The alternate products expected to most commonly replace the recalled Sanofi devices are the EpiPens made by [[Mylan]] in the US and by Pfizer—under license from Mylan—in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epipen101.ca/en/welcome|title=Welcome to EpiPen® 101|website=Epipen101.ca|date=2015-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mylan already had an 85% market share of the auto-injectors in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/how-marketing-turned-the-epipen-into-a-billion-dollar-business|title=How Marketing Turned the EpiPen Into a Billion-Dollar Business|first=Cynthia Koons CynthiaLKoons Robert Langreth RobertLangreth|last=Reprints|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the first half of 2015. Maylan was expected to benefit from the recall by its competitor Sanofi, according to a report published in the Fierce Pharma newsletter of 2 November 2015: "....it is very hard to see Auvi-Q returning to the market, as it will need to be redesigned and face uphill battle to recapture patient trust after the recall," Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal wrote in a note to clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharmamarketing.com/story/sanofis-auvi-q-recall-puts-mylans-rival-epipen-full-control-blockbuster-mar/2015-11-02|title=Sanofi's Auvi-Q recall puts Mylan's rival EpiPen in full control of blockbuster market - FiercePharma|website=Fiercepharmamarketing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gal also believes that the company will eventually have 95% of the Epinephrine auto-injector market, according to another Fierce Pharma report on 3 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/its-open-season-mylans-epipen-sanofi-teva-stumble/2015-11-02|title=It's open season for Mylan's EpiPen as Sanofi, Teva stumble - FiercePharma|website=Fiercepharma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the summer of 2013, Sanofi was in a race with [[Amgen]] and [[Pfizer]] to win approval for a [[PCSK9 inhibitor|drug that inhibits PCSK9]], a protein that slows the clearance of [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) cholesterol - the form of cholesterol that leads to heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Gina Kolata for the New York Times. 9 July 2013 [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/health/rare-mutation-prompts-race-for-cholesterol-drug.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all Rare Mutation Ignites Race for Cholesterol Drug]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sanofi's drug was discovered by [[Regeneron]] and is called [[alirocumab]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regeneron.com/regn727 Alirocumab on Regeneron's website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416102019/http://www.regeneron.com/regn727 |date=16 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An FDA warning in March 2014 about possible cognitive adverse effects of PCSK9 inhibition threw the competition into disarray, as the FDA asked companies to include neurocognitive testing into their [[Phase III]] clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;John Carroll for FierceBiotech 7 March 2014 [http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/regeneron-sanofi-and-amgen-shares-suffer-fdas-frets-about-pcsk9-drug/2014-03-07 UPDATED: Regeneron, Sanofi and Amgen shares suffer on FDA's frets about PCSK9 class]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Sanofi moved its head office location to 54, [[Rue La Boétie]] in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]]. This former mansion designed by architect René-Patouillard had previously been the head office of Alcatel-Lucent.

Sanofi's previous head office was located in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]], 174 Avenue de France. The architecture of the head office is of the predominant style of the area surrounding the [[François Mitterrand Library]]. After Sanofi and Aventis merged, the employees at the former Aventis head office in [[Schiltigheim]], [[Alsace]] moved to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/reportage/les-sieges-sociaux-des-entreprises-du-cac-40/sanofi-aventis-regroupement-a-paris.shtml Sanofi-Aventis : regroupement à Paris]."

'''Servicewüste''' ({{IPA-de|ˈsœɐ̯vɪsˌvyːstə}}, ''service desert'') is a [[management]] [[buzzword]] coined in [[Der Spiegel]] by [[economics]] professor [[Hermann Simon]] in 1995, referring to "the total lack of acceptable services".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/suchen/dudenonline/servicew%C3%BCste Duden Online: Servicewüste]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used to describe a country, region or area where the [[service sector]] generally or [[customer service]] specifically is weak or completely undeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article663420/Das-Kreuz-mit-dem-Service.html Welt Online, 30 October 1995, ''Das Kreuz mit dem Service''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has correspondingly [[derogatory|negative connotations]].

It is often used for [[Germany]], where it is perceived that many organizations do not offer any other services after the purchase of a product and do not consider customers' needs.  Generally repairs and maintenance will be done only after paying additional fees.  An example given by Simon is that in contrast to those in the [[United States]], German [[supermarket]] checkouts did not have an employee dedicated to sacking groceries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9248874.html ''Servicewüste Deutschland'', in Spiegel Nr. 51/1995 S. 82]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3826">"'''Short and distort'''" is a type of [[securities fraud]] in which Internet investors [[short selling|short sell]] a [[stock]] and then spread negative rumors about the company in an attempt to drive down stock prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortanddistort.asp Investopedia entry of "short and distort"], [[Investopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2002/06/52785| last = Glasner| first = Joanna| title = New Market Trend: Short, Distort| work = Wired| publisher = Condé Nast Digital| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5nSEkhdBd?url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2002/06/52785| archivedate = February 11, 2010| accessdate = February 11, 2010| date = 3 June 2002| deadurl = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One way of shorting and distorting involves the sale of a security that is not even owned by the seller, but is either rented or borrowed, with the specific purpose of selling it to another person, then spreading untruthful, negative information to tank its stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=Timothy R.|title=Encyclopedia of Deception|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=541|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iRJzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA541&amp;lpg=PA541&amp;dq=short+and+distort+scheme+phone#v=onepage&amp;q=short%20and%20distort%20scheme%20phone&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 6, 2015|isbn=9781483306896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often performed as a form of [[naked short selling]] in which stock is sold without being borrowed and without any intent to borrow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Connecticut]] State [[Attorney General]] [[Richard Blumenthal]], cited in [https://www.forbes.com/2006/09/25/naked-shorts-sia-regs-biz-cx_0925naked.html Wall Street Disses Regs] - Liz Moyer, [[Forbes.com]] 25 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directorship.com/market-cop-cox-urges-restraint/ ‘Market Cop’ Cox Urges Restraint] - Directorship Boardroom Intelligence, 18 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Once the stock price has declined, the investor uses the proceeds of the initial sale to buy a larger number of the company's shares than sold originally. Some of the newly purchased stock is used to fulfill the short-selling contract; the remaining shares are then offered for sale, which causes an additional decline in the company's share price.

During the takeover of [[The Bear Stearns Companies]] by [[J.P. Morgan Chase]] in March 2008, reports swirled that short sellers were spreading rumors to drive down Bear Stearns' share price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directorship.com/short-and-distort-conduct-scrutinized/ ‘Short and Distort’ Conduct Scrutinized] - Directorship Boardroom Intelligence, 2 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Senate of the United States|Senator]] [[Christopher Dodd]] felt this was more than [[rumor]]s and said, "This is about [[collusion]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/business/30shorts.html "A New Wave of Vilifying Short Sellers"] ''New York Times'' 30 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Chase was victimized by a similar "short and distort" scheme six years earlier when rumors arose about its purported relationship with [[Enron]].&lt;ref&gt;In a 22 July 2001 hearing of a Senate subcommittee, questions were raised about a "maze of financial transactions that . . . makes Rube Goldberg look like a slacker" to which Chase was one of several banks was a party. Rumors flowed about Chase starting the day after the hearing; on 23 July 2001, Chase's stock prices dropped to a six year low ([http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/08/12/020812ta_talk_surowiecki  James Surowiecki, "Short and Distort"] ''[[The New Yorker]]'' 12 August 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 24-year ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' veteran and UBJ co-founder [[James Brooke (journalist)|James Brooke]], the magazine fills an important vacuum in Ukraine's fledgling independent English-language media marketplace and focuses reporting on "the 97% of Ukraine that works" as opposed to [[War in Donbass|the conflict]] that "affects 3% of Ukraine's national territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/ukraine-versus-china-the-fight-for-the-european-market|title=Ukraine Versus China: The Fight for Europe's Market|last=Brooke|first=James|work=Atlantic Council|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theubj.com/about|title=UBJ Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=www.theubj.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UBJ's founders and supporters, much of Ukraine's positive business news and success stories are being overshadowed by reporting on the War in Donbass and, modeling their reporting on ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Bloomberg]]'' and ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' standards, UBJ's reporting team are aiming to better cover Ukraine's vibrant and diversifying business landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/jhnhk6kc2qdk/ukraine-business-journal/|title=Introducing The Ukraine Business Journal|last=|first=|date=|website=prezi.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trade credit insurance, business credit insurance''', '''export credit insurance''', or '''credit insurance''' is an [[insurance policy]] and a [[risk management]] product offered by private insurance companies and governmental [[export credit agency|export credit agencies]] to business entities wishing to protect their [[accounts receivable]] from loss due to [[credit risk]]s such as protracted [[Default (finance)|default]], [[insolvency]] or [[bankruptcy]]. This insurance product is a type of [[property insurance|property]] and [[casualty insurance]], and should not be confused with such products as [[credit life insurance|credit life]] or [[credit disability insurance]], which individuals obtain to protect against the risk of loss of income needed to pay debts. Trade credit insurance can include a component of [[political risk insurance]] which is offered by the same insurers to insure the risk of non-payment by foreign buyers due to currency issues, political unrest, expropriation etc. 

This points to the major role trade credit insurance plays in facilitating [[international trade]]. [[Trade credit]] is offered by vendors to their customers as an alternative to prepayment or [[cash on delivery]] terms, providing time for the customer to generate income from sales to pay for the product or service. This requires the vendor to assume non-payment risk. In a local or domestic situation as well as in an export transaction, the risk increases when laws, customs communications and customer's reputation are not fully understood. In addition to increased risk of non-payment, international trade presents the problem of the time between product shipment and its availability for sale. The account receivable is like a loan and represents capital invested, and often borrowed, by the vendor. But this is not a secure asset until it is paid. If the customer's debt is credit insured the large, risky asset becomes more secure, like an insured building. This asset may then be viewed as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] by lending institutions and a loan based upon it used to defray the expenses of the transaction and to produce more product. Trade credit insurance is, therefore, a trade finance tool.

Trade credit insurance is purchased by business entities to insure their accounts receivable from loss due to the insolvency of the debtors. The product is not available to individuals. 
The cost (premium) for this is usually charged monthly, and are calculated as a percentage of sales for that month or as a percentage of all outstanding receivables.

Trade credit insurance usually covers a portfolio of buyers and pays an agreed percentage of an invoice or receivable that remains unpaid as a result of protracted default, insolvency or bankruptcy. Policy holders must apply a [[credit limit]] on each of their buyers for the sales to that buyer to be insured. The premium rate reflects the average credit risk of the insured portfolio of buyers. 
In addition, credit insurance can also cover single transactions or trade with only one buyer.

== History ==
Trade credit insurance was born at the end of the nineteenth century, but it was mostly developed in Western Europe between the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s.  Several companies were founded in many countries; some of them also managed the political risks of export on behalf of their state.

Following the privatisation of the short-term side of the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department in 1991, a concentration of the trade credit insurance market took place and three groups now account for over 85% of the global credit insurance market. These main players focused on Western Europe, but rapidly expanded towards Eastern Europe, Asia and the Americas:
* [[Euler Hermes]], merger of the two credit insurance companies of the [[Allianz Group]]. Euler Hermes is the world's number one credit insurance provider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroinvestor.co.uk/news/story.aspx?id=11050439 Euro Investor]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Coface]], a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Natixis]], the financing, asset management and financial services arm of the [[BPCE]] Group. Coface has the largest direct presence in the world.
* [[Atradius]], a merger between NCM and Gerling Kreditversicherung. Later renamed Atradius after it was demerged from the Gerling insurance group.

Many variations of trade credit insurance have evolved ranging from coverage that can be canceled or reduced at an insurers discretion, to coverage that cannot be canceled or reduced by the insurer during the policy period.  Other programs may allow the policy holder to act as the underwriter. 

While trade credit insurance is often mostly known for protecting foreign or export accounts receivable, there has always been a large segment of the market that uses Trade Credit Insurance for domestic accounts receivable protection as well. Domestic trade credit insurance provides companies with the protection they need as their customer base consolidates creating larger receivables to fewer customers. This further creates a larger exposure and greater risk if a customer does not pay their accounts. The addition of new insurers in this area have increased the availability of domestic cover for companies.

Many businesses found that their insurers withdrew trade credit insurance during the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], foreseeing large losses if they continued to [[underwrite]] sales to failing businesses.  This led to accusations that the insurers were deepening and prolonging the recession, as businesses could not afford the risk of making sales without the insurance, and therefore contracted in size or had to close.  Insurers countered these criticisms by claiming that they were not the cause of the crisis, but were responding to economic reality and ringing the alarm bells.&lt;ref name=failure&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2254318/5bn-government-trade-credit £5bn government trade credit scheme is branded a failure], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'', 3 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the UK government set up a short-term £5&amp;nbsp;billion Trade Credit Top-up emergency fund.  However, this was considered a failure, as the take-up was very low.&lt;ref name=failure/&gt;

==History==
In 1968, the Utah state legislature allocated 320 acres along the [[Bonneville Shoreline Trail]] to develop a [[research park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title 53B Chapter 17|url=http://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title53B/Chapter17/C53B-17-P5_1800010118000101.pdf|website=Utah Code|publisher=Utah State Legislature|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research Park was intended to stimulate economic development within the State of Utah and encourage students who graduate from the University of Utah to stay in Salt Lake City by providing research jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Bench Master Plan|url=http://www.slcdocs.com/Planning/Projects/EBMP/DraftPlanApril2016/6_RegionalActivityCenter.pdf|website=Plan Salt Lake City|publisher=Salt Lake City Corporation|accessdate=1 April 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, when the successful implantation of the [[Jarvik 7]] artificial heart attracted international headlines, artificial organ and medical device research and development at the University of Utah led [[Science Digest]] and the [[New York Times]] to nickname Salt Lake City the "Bionic Valley": "the epicenter of a bioengineering effort that promises to shake up the entire health-care system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Utah's 'Bionic Valley' Produces Another Life-Changing Medical Device|url=http://www.matr.net/article-39035.html|accessdate=1 April 2017|agency=Montana Associated Technology Roundtables|date=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaslowsky|first1=Dyan|title=Regional Job Roundup - Mountain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/13/jobs/regional-job-roundup-mountain.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=1 April 2017|date=13 October 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''work-in''' is a form of [[direct action]] under which workers whose jobs are under threat resolve to remain in their place of employment and to continue producing, without pay. Their intention is usually to show that their place of work still has long-term viability or that it can be effectively [[workers' self-management|self-managed by the workers]].

Historical examples of the work-in include the [[Upper Clyde Shipbuilders]] work-in and the [[1971 Harco work-in|Harco Steel]] work-in, both in 1971.
