In [[geometry]], an '''apeirogon''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ἄπειρος ''apeiros'', "infinite, boundless" and γωνία ''gonia'', "angle") is a generalized [[polygon]] with a [[countable set|countably]] infinite number of sides.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Regular polytopes, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered as the limit of an ''n''-sided polygon as ''n'' approaches infinity. The [[interior (topology)|interior]] of a linear apeirogon can be defined by a direction order of vertices, and defining half the plane as the interior.

This article describes an '''apeirogon''' in its linear form as a [[tessellation]] or partition of a [[line (geometry)|line]].

==Regular apeirogon==
A '''regular apeirogon''' has equal edge lengths, just like any [[regular polygon]], {p}. Its [[Schläfli symbol]] is {∞}, and its [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]] is {{CDD|node_1|infin|node}}. It is the first in the dimensional family of regular [[hypercubic honeycomb]]s.

This line may be considered as a [[circle]] of infinite radius, by analogy with regular polygons with great number of edges, which resemble a circle.

In two dimensions, a regular apeirogon divides the plane into two half-planes as a regular [[apeirogonal dihedron]]. The interior of an apeirogon can be defined by its orientation, filling one half plane. [[Dual polyhedron|Dually]] the [[apeirogonal hosohedron]] has digon faces and an apeirogonal vertex figure, {2, ∞}. A truncated apeirogonal hosohedron becomes a [[apeirogonal prism]], with each vertex bounded by two squares and an apeirogon. An alternated apeirogonal prism is a [[apeirogonal antiprism]], with each vertex bounded by three triangles and an apeirogon.

==Irregular apeirogon==

An '''isogonal apeirogon''' has a single type of vertex and alternates two types of edges.

A '''quasiregular apeirogon''' is an isogonal apeirogon with equal edge lengths.

An '''isotoxal apeirogon''', being the dual of an isogonal one, has one type of edge, and two types of vertices, and is therefore geometrically identical to the regular apeirogon. It can be shown seen by drawing vertices in alternate colors.

All of these will have half the symmetry (double the fundamental domain sizes) of the regular apeirogon.

== In hyperbolic plane==

[[File:Hyperbolic apeirogon example.png|250px|thumb|an apeirogon and circumscribed [[horocycle]] ]]

Apeirogons in the [[hyperbolic plane]], most notably the ''regular apeirogon'', {∞}, can have a curvature just like finite polygons of the Euclidean plane, with the vertices circumscribed by [[horocycle]]s or [[Hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]] rather than [[circle]]s.

Regular apeirogons that are scaled to converge at infinity have the symbol {∞} and exist on horocycles, while more generally they can exist on hypercycles.

The regular tiling {∞, 3} has regular apeirogon faces. Hypercyclic apeirogons can also be isogonal or quasiregular, with truncated apeirogon faces, t{∞}, like the tiling tr{∞,3}, with two types of edges, alternately connecting to triangles or other apeirogons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5501">'''Assemblage theory''' is an ontological framework developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], originally presented in their book ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980). Assemblage theory provides a bottom-up framework for analyzing social complexity by emphasizing fluidity, exchangeability, and multiple functionalities.&lt;ref name=UT2016&gt;Wikis.la.utexas.edu,. (2016). Assemblage Theory | University of Texas Theory. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from {{cite web|url=http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/theory/page/assemblage-theory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314011817/http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/theory/page/assemblage-theory |archivedate=2016-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblage theory asserts that, within a body, the relationships of component parts are not stable and fixed; rather, they can be displaced and replaced within and among other bodies, thus approaching systems through relations of exteriority. &lt;ref name=UT2016 /&gt;

== Deleuze and Guattari, ''A Thousand Plateaus'' == 
In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari draw from [[dynamical systems theory]], which explores the way material systems self-organize, and extends the system to include that of the social, linguistic, and philosophical in order to create assemblage theory.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008&gt;Smith, D., &amp; Protevi, J. (2008). Gilles Deleuze. Plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/#ThoPla&lt;/ref&gt; In assemblage theory, assemblages are formed through the processes of coding, stratification, and territorialization.

Deleuze and Guatarri use the term “constellation” when they talk about assemblage. A constellation, like any assemblage, is made up of imaginative contingent articulations among myriad heterogeneous elements.&lt;ref name=SlackandWise&gt;Wise, J., &amp; Slack, J. (2014). Culture and Technology. New York, NY: Lang, Peter New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of ordering matter around a body is called coding.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008 /&gt; According to Deleuze and Guatarri, assemblages are coded by taking a particular form; they select, compose, and complete a territory. &lt;ref name=SlackandWise /&gt;

In composing a territory, there exists the creation of hierarchical bodies, in the process of stratification.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008 /&gt; Drawing from the constellation metaphor, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the constellation includes some heavenly bodies but leaves out others; the included bodies being those in close proximity given the particular gathering and angle of view. The example constellation thus defines the relationships with the bodies around it and the way the universe is viewed.

Territorialization is the final process of assemblage theory, and is viewed as the ordering of the coded and stratified bodies that create the “assemblage”.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008 /&gt;   Assemblages territorialize both forms of content and forms of expression. Forms of content, also known as material forms, include the assemblage of human and nonhuman bodies, actions, and reactions. Forms of expression include incorporeal enunciations, acts, and statements.&lt;ref name=SlackandWise /&gt; Within this form of territorialization, assemblages do not remain static; they are further characterized by processes of [[deterritorialization]] and reterritorialization. Deterritorialization occurs when articulations are disarticulated and disconnected.&lt;ref name=SlackandWise /&gt; Reterritorialization describes the process by which new articulations are forged, thus constituting a new assemblage.&lt;ref name=SlackandWise /&gt; In this way, these axes of content/expressive and the processes of territorialization exist to demonstrate the complex nature of  assemblages.

== DeLanda, ''A New Philosophy of Society'' == 
Philosopher [[Manuel DeLanda]] has adopted the concept of assemblage in his book ''[[A New Philosophy of Society]]'' (2006). In his book, DeLanda draws from Deleuze and Guattari to further argue that social bodies on all scales are best analyzed through their individual components. Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda’s approach examines relations of exteriority, in which assemblage components are self-subsistent and retain autonomy outside of the assemblage in which they exist &lt;ref name=Karaman2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karaman | first1 = O | year = 2008 | title = A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory And Social Complexity by Manuel DeLanda | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2008.00646.x | journal = Antipode | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 935–937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLanda further expands upon Deleuze’s assemblage theory and relations of exteriority by suggesting that assemblage components are organized through the two axes of material/expressive and territorializing/deterritorializing.&lt;ref name=Karaman2008 /&gt; Further, a third axis exists of genetic/linguistic resources exists to define the interventions involved in the coding, decoding, and recoding of the assemblage.&lt;ref name=Karaman2008 /&gt; However, DeLanda further asserts that the social does not lose its reality, nor its materiality, through its complexity.&lt;ref name=UT2016 /&gt; In this way, assemblages are effective in their practicality; assemblages, though fluid, are nevertheless part of historically significant processes. In that way, DeLanda offers a reconfiguration of the Deleuzian concepts that provides a more robust theoretical framework for analyzing assemblages.

'''Communalness''', as suggested by [[Robert A. Freitas Jr.]], is a level of an [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomenon which originates from [[Artificial consciousness|electronic sentience]], and represents a broader mode of thinking than just normal [[consciousness]]. While consciousness is limited to the individual, communalness describes a complex organization of numerous individuals which on a higher level is tightly connected to each other. Such an organization would maybe have the same intimate awareness of its own existence as a whole as people have consciousness of their own bodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4076">'''Community-based conservation''' is a [[conservation movement]] that emerged in the 1980s through escalating protests and subsequent dialogue with local communities affected by international attempts to protect the [[biodiversity]] of the earth. Older conservation movements disregarded the interests of local inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Brockington, D. (2002) Fortress Conservation: The Preservation of the Mkomazi Game Reserve, Tanzania. International African Institute, Oxford( {{ISBN|0-253-34079-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from the [[Western culture|Western]] idea on which the conservation movement was founded, of [[nature]] being separate from [[culture]]. The object of community-based conservation is to incorporate improvement to the lives of local people while conserving areas through the creation of national parks or wildlife refuges.&lt;ref&gt;Gezon, Lisa. (1997) Institutional structure and the effectiveness of integrated conservation and development projects: case study from Madagascar, Human Organization 56(4), pp. 462–470 (ISSN 0093-2930)&lt;/ref&gt;  While there have been some notable successes, unfortunately community-based conservation has often been ineffective because of inadequate resources, uneven implementation, and over-wishful planning.  Some critics have also complained about often unintended [[neocolonialism|neocolonialist]] undertones involved in the particular conservation projects.

==History==
The first protected areas around the world such as Yosemite in 1864 and Yellowstone National Park in 1872 were founded by the colonial or classical conservation method.&lt;ref&gt;Cholchester, M. (2004) Conservation Policy and Indigenous Peoples. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 7(3), pp.145-153&lt;/ref&gt; Classical conservation created protected areas to protect wilderness and wildlife areas of pristine wilderness that was untouched and uninhabited by humans. All people inhabiting these areas were removed from the land and displaced onto marginal land surrounding or near by the newly protected land. It is estimated that 20 million people were displaced from their land.&lt;ref&gt;Veit, P. G., Benson, C. (2004) When Parks and People Collide. Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. 16 Oct. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This conservation strategy was used widely until the 1970s when indigenous people started to fight for their rights and land. In 1975 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Parks Congress recognized the rights of indigenous people and to recognize their rights of the protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;Cholchester, M. (2004) Conservation Policy and Indigenous Peoples. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 7(3), pp.145-153&lt;/ref&gt; More policy changes came about that increased the rights of indigenous people. Community-based conservation came into action from these changes.

==Strategies==
One strategy of community-based conservation is co-management or joint management of a protected area. Co-management combines local peoples’ traditional knowledge of the environment with modern scientific knowledge of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;WPC Recommendation 25 Co-management of Protected Areas, World Parks Congress (2003) {{cite web |url=http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_11/section_2/4449.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927164214/http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_11/section_2/4449.html |archivedate=2006-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Child, B.;Jones, B. (2006), Practical tools for community conservation in southern Africa, Participatory Learning and Action 55 (ISSN 1357-938X)&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of knowledge can lead to increased biodiversity and better management of the protected area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The '''Comstock–Needham system''' is a naming system for [[insect]] [[Insect wing|wing]] [[veins]], devised by [[John Henry Comstock|John Comstock]] and [[James George Needham|George Needham]] in 1898. It was an important step in showing the [[homology (biology)|homology]] of all [[insect wings]]. This system was based on Needham's ''pretracheation theory'' that was later discredited by [[Frederic Charles Fraser]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, F. C.  1938.  A note on the fallaciousness of the theory of pretracheation in the venation of Odonata.  ''Proc. Roy. Ent. Soc. London'' (A) 13: 60–70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vein terminology==

===Longitudinal veins===
[[Image:Comstock-needham.svg|thumb|Insect wing venation, showing the names after the Comstock–Needham system|400px|right]]The Comstock and Needham system attributes different names to the veins on an insect's wing. From the [[anterior]] (leading) edge of the wing towards the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (rear), the major [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]] veins are named:
*{{anchor|costa}}''costa'' '''C''', meaning ''rib''
*{{anchor|subcosta}}''subcosta'' '''Sc''', meaning ''below the rib''
*{{anchor|radius}}''radius'' '''R''', in analogy with a bone in the forearm, the [[radius (bone)|radius]]
*{{anchor|media}}''media'' '''M''', meaning ''middle''
*{{anchor|cubitus}}''cubitus'' '''Cu''', meaning ''elbow''
*{{anchor|anal veins}}''anal veins'' '''A''', in reference to its posterior location

Apart from the costal and the anal veins, each vein can be branched, in which case the branches are numbered from anterior to posterior. For example, the two branches of the {{anchor|subcostal vein}}subcostal vein will be called '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

The {{anchor|radial veins}}radius typically branches once near the base, producing anteriorly the '''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and posteriorly the ''radial sector'' '''Rs'''. The radial sector may fork twice.

The media may also fork twice, therefore having four branches reaching the wing margin.

According to the Comstock–Needham system, the cubitus forks once, producing the {{anchor|cubital vein}}cubital veins Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 
According to some other authorities, Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may fork again, producing the Cu&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt;.

As there are several anal veins, they are called '''A1''', '''A2''', and so on. They are usually unforked.

===Crossveins===
Crossveins link the longitudinal veins, and are named accordingly (for example, the medio-cubital crossvein is termed '''m-cu'''). Some crossveins have their own name, like the [[humeral]] crossvein '''h''' and the sectoral crossvein '''s'''.

==Cell terminology==
The cells are named after the vein on the anterior side; for instance, the cell between Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is called '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

In the case where two cells are separated by a crossvein but have the same anterior longitudinal vein, they should have the same name. To avoid this, they are attributed a number. For example, the R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cell is divided in two by the radial cross vein: the basal cell is termed "first R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;", and the distal cell "second R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;".

If a cell is bordered anteriorly by a forking vein, such as R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the cell is named after the distal vein, in this case R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Conservation agriculture''' (CA) can be defined by a statement given by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] as “a concept for resource-saving agricultural crop production that strives to achieve acceptable profits together with high and sustained production levels while concurrently conserving the environment” (FAO 2007).

Agriculture according to the New Standard Encyclopedia is “one of the most important sectors in the economies of most nations” (New Standard 1992). At the same time conservation is the use of resources in a manner that safely maintains a resource that can be used by humans. Conservation has become critical because the global population has increased over the years and more food needs to be produced every year (New Standard 1992). Sometimes referred to as "agricultural environmental management", conservation agriculture may be sanctioned and funded through conservation programs promulgated through agricultural legislation, such as the [[U.S. Farm Bill]].

== Key principles ==
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has determined that CA has three key principles that producers (farmers) can proceed through in the process of CA. These three principles outline what conservationists and producers believe can be done to conserve what we use for a longer period of time.

The first key principle in CA (Conservation Agriculture) is practicing minimum soil disturbance which is essential to maintaining minerals within the soil, stopping erosion, and preventing water loss from occurring within the soil. In the past agriculture has looked at soil tillage as a main process in the introduction of new crops to an area. It was believed that tilling the soil would increase fertility within the soil through mineralization that takes place in the soil. Also tilling of soil can cause severe erosion and crusting which leads to a decrease in soil fertility. Today tillage is seen as destroying organic matter that can be found within the soil cover. [[No-till farming]] has caught on as a process that can save soil organic levels for a longer period and still allow the soil to be productive for longer periods (FAO 2007). Additionally, the process of tilling can increase time and labor for producing that crop. Minimum soil disturbance also reduce destruction of soil micro and macro-organism habitats that is common in conventional ploughing practices.  

When no-till practices are followed, the producer sees a reduction in production cost for a certain crop. Tillage of the ground requires more money in order to fuel tractors or to provide feed for the animals pulling the plough. The producer sees a reduction in labor because he or she does not have to be in the fields as long as a conventional farmer.

The second key principle in CA is much like the first in dealing with protecting the soil. The principle of managing the top soil to create a permanent organic soil cover can allow for growth of organisms within the soil structure. This growth will break down the mulch that is left on the soil surface. The breaking down of this mulch will produce a high organic matter level which will act as a fertilizer for the soil surface. If CA practices were used done for many years and enough organic matter was being built up at the surface, then a layer of mulch would start to form. This layer helps prevent soil erosion from taking place and ruining the soil's profile or layout. The presence of mulching also reduce the velocity of runoff and the impact of rain drops thus reducing soil erosion and runoff.

According to the article “The role of conservation agriculture and sustainable agriculture”, the layer of mulch that is built up over time will become like a buffer zone between soil and mulch and this will help reduce wind and water erosion. With this comes the protection of the soil's surface when rain falls on the ground. Land that is not protected by a layer of mulch is left open to the elements (Hobbs et al. 2007). This type of ground cover also helps keep the temperature and moisture levels of the soil at a higher level rather than if it was tilled every year (FAO 2007).

The third principle is the practicing diverse crop rotations or crop interactions. According to an article published in the ''Physiological Transactions of the Royal Society'' called “The role of conservation agriculture and sustainable agriculture,” crop rotation can be used best as a disease control against other preferred crops (Hobbs et al. 2007). This process will not allow pests such as insects and weeds to be set into a rotation with specific crops. Rotational crops will act as a natural insecticide and herbicide against specific crops. Not allowing insects or weeds to establish a pattern will help to eliminate problems with yield reduction and infestations within fields (FAO 2007). Crop rotation can also help build up soil infrastructure. Establishing crops in a rotation allows for an extensive buildup of rooting zones which will allow for better water infiltration (Hobbs et al. 2007).

Organic molecules in the soil break down into phosphates, nitrates and other beneficial elements which are thus better absorbed by plants. Plowing increases the amount of oxygen in the soil and increases the aerobic processes, hastening the breakdown of organic material. Thus more nutrients are available for the next crop but, at the same time, the soil is depleted more quickly of its nutrient reserves.

== Examples ==
In conservation agriculture there are many examples that can be looked towards as a way of farming and at the same time conserving. These practices are well known by most producers. The process of no-till is one that follows the first principle of CA, causing minimal mechanical soil disturbance. No-till also brings other benefits to the producer . According to the FAO, tillage is one of the most “energy consuming” processes that can be used: It requires a lot of labor, time, and fuel to till. Producers can save 30% to 40% of time and labor by practicing the no-till process. (FAO 3020)

Besides conserving the soil, there are other examples of how CA is used. According to an article in ''Science'' called “Farming and the Fate of Wild Nature” there are two more kinds of CA . The practice of wildlife-friendly farming and land sparing are ideas for producers who are looking to practice better conservation towards biodiversity (Green, et al. 2005).

=== Wildlife-friendly farming ===
Wildlife-friendly farming is a practice of setting aside land that will not be developed by the producer (farmer). This land will be set aside so that biodiversity has a chance to establish itself in areas with agricultural fields. At the same time, the producer is attempting to lower the amount of fertilizer and pesticides used on the fields so that organisms and microbial activity have a chance to establish themselves in the soil and habitat (Green, et al. 2005). But as in all systems, not all can be perfect. To create a habitat suitable for biodiversity something has to be reduced, and as in this case for agriculture farmers, yields can be reduced. This is where the second idea of land sparing can be looked on as an alternative manner.

=== Land sparing ===
Land sparing is another way that producer and conservationist can be on the same page. Land sparing advocates for the land that is being used for agricultural purposes to continue to produce crops at increased yield. With an increase in yield on all land that is in use, other land can be set aside for conservation and production for biodiversity. Agricultural land stays in production but would have to increase its yield potential to keep up with demand. Land that is not being put into agriculture would be used for conserving biodiversity (Green, et al. 2005). In fact, data from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] shows that between 1961 and 2012, the amount of arable land needed to produce the same amount of food declined by 68 percent worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Ausubel|first1=Jesse H.|author-link1=Jesse H.

== Benefits ==
In the field of CA there are many benefits that both the producer and conservationist can obtain.

On the side of the conservationist, CA can be seen as beneficial because there is an effort to conserve what people use every day. Since agriculture is one of the most destructive forces against biodiversity, CA can change the way humans produce food and energy. With conservation come environmental benefits of CA. These benefits include less erosion possibilities, better water conservation, improvement in air quality due to lower emissions being produced, and a chance for larger biodiversity in a given area.

On the side of the producer and/or farmer, CA can eventually do all that is done in conventional agriculture, and it can conserve better than conventional agriculture. CA according to Theodor Friedrich, who is a specialist in CA, believes “Farmers like it because it gives them a means of conserving, improving, and making more efficient use of their natural resources" (FAO 2006). Producers will find that the benefits of CA will come later rather than sooner. Since CA takes time to build up enough organic matter and have soils become their own fertilizer, the process does not start to work overnight. But if producers make it through the first few years of production, results will start to become more satisfactory.

CA is shown to have even higher yields and higher outputs than conventional agriculture once it has been established over long periods. Also, a producer has the benefit of knowing that the soil in which his crops are grown is a renewable resource. According to New Standard Encyclopedia, soils are a renewable resource, which means that whatever is taken out of the soil can be put back over time (New Standard 1992). As long as good soil upkeep is maintained, the soil will continue to renew itself. This could be very beneficial to a producer who is practicing CA and is looking to keep soils at a productive level for an extended time.

The farmer and/or producer can use this same land in another way when crops have been harvested. The introduction of grazing livestock to a field that once held crops can be beneficial for the producer and also the field itself. Livestock manure can be used as a natural fertilizer for a producer’s field which will then be beneficial for the producer the next year when crops are planted once again. The practice of grazing livestock using CA helps the farmer who raises crops on that field and the farmer who raises the livestock that graze off that field. Livestock produce compost or manure which are a great help in generating soil fertility (Pawley W.H. 1963). The practices of CA and grazing livestock on a field for many years can allow for better yields in the following years as long as these practices continue to be followed.
     
The FAO believes that there are three major benefits from CA: 
* Within fields that are controlled by CA the producer will see an increase in organic matter. 
* Increase in water conservation due to the layer of organic matter and ground cover to help eliminate transportation and access runoff. 
* Improvement of soil structure and rooting zone.

== Future development ==
As in any other business, producers and conservationists are always looking towards the future. In this case CA is a very important process to be looked at for future generation. There are many organizations that have been created to help educate and inform producers and conservationists in the world of CA. These organizations can help to inform, conduct research, and buy land in order to preserve animals and plants (New Standard 1992).

Another way in which CA is looking to the future is through prevention. According to the ''European Journal of Agronomy'' producers are looking for ways to reduce leaching problems within their fields. These producers are using the same principles within CA, in that they are leaving cover over their fields in order to save fields from erosion and leaching of chemicals (Kirchmann &amp; Thorvaldsson 2000). Processes and studies like this are allowing for a better understanding of how to conserve what we are using and finding ways to put back something that may have been lost before.

In the same journal article is presented another way in which producers and conservationists are looking towards the future. Circulation of plant nutrients can be a vital part for conserving the future. An example of this would be the use of animal manure. This process has been used for quite some time now, but the future is looking towards ways to handle and conserve nutrients within manure for a longer time. But besides animal waste, food and urban waste are also being looked towards as a way to use growth within CA (Kirchmann &amp; Thorvaldsson 2000). Turning these products from waste to being used to grow crops and improve yields is something that would be beneficial for conservationists and producers.

'''Agri-environment schemes'''

In 1992, ‘agri-environment schemes’ became compulsory for all European Union Member States. In the following years the main purpose of these schemes changed slightly. 
Initially, they sought to protect threatened habitats, but gradually shifted their focus to the prevention of the loss of wildlife from agricultural landscapes. Most recently, the schemes are placing more emphasis on improving the services that the land can provide to humans (e.g. pollination). Overall, farmers involved in the scheme aim to practice environmentally friendlier farming techniques such as: reducing the use of pesticides, managing or altering their land to increase more wildlife friendly habitats (e.g. increasing areas of trees and bushes), reducing irrigation, conserving soil, and organic farming. 
As the changes in practices that ensure the protection of the environment are costly to farmers, the EU developed agri-environment schemes to financially compensate individual farmers for applying these changes and therefore increased the implementation of conservation agriculture. 
The schemes are voluntary for farmers. Once joined, they commit to a minimum of five years during which they have to adopt various sustainable farming techniques.
According to the Euro-stat website, in 2009 the agricultural area enrolled in agri-environment schemes covered 38.5 million hectares (20.9% of agricultural land in the 27 member states of the EU at the time) (Agri-environmental indicator 2015). The European Commission spent a total of €3.23 billion on agri-environment schemes in 2012, significantly exceeding the cost of managing special sites of conservation (Natura 2000) that year, which came to a total of €39.6 million (Batáry et al. 2015). 
There are two main types of agri-environment schemes which have shown different outcomes. Out-of-production schemes tend to be used in [[extensive farming]] practices (where the farming land is widespread and less [[intensive farming]] is practiced), and focus on improving or setting land aside that will not be used for the production of food, for example, the addition of wildflower strips.
In-production schemes (used for a smaller scale, but more intensively farmed land) focus on the sustainable management of arable crops or grassland, for example reduction of pesticides, reduction of grassland mowing, and most commonly, organic farming. In a 2015 review of studies examining the effects of the two schemes, it was found that out-of-production schemes had a higher success rate at enhancing the number of thriving species around the land. 
The reason behind this is thought to be the scheme’s focus on enhancing specific species by providing them with more unaltered habitats, which results in more food resources for the specific species.
On the other hand, in-production schemes attempt to enhance the quality of the land in general, and are thus less species specific. 
Based on the findings, the reviewers suggest that schemes which more specifically target the declining groups of species, may be more effective. The findings and the targets will be implemented between 2015 and 2020, so that by 2025, the effectiveness of these schemes can be re-assessed and will have increased significantly (Batáry et al. 2015).

== Problems ==
As much as conservation agriculture can benefit the world, there are some problems that come with it. There are many reasons why conservation agriculture cannot always be a win-win situation.
 
There are not enough people who can financially turn from conventional farming to conservation. The process of CA takes time; when a producer first becomes a conservationist, the results can be a financial loss to them(in most cases, the investment and policy generally exist). CA is based upon establishing an organic layer and producing its own fertilizer and this may take time. It can be many years before a producer will start to see better yields than he/she has had previously. Another financial undertaking is purchasing of new equipment. When starting to use CA, a producer may have to buy new planters or drills in order to produce effectively. These financial tasks are ones that may impact whether or not a producer decides to switch to CA or not.

With the struggle to adapt comes the struggle to make CA grow across the globe. CA has not spread as quickly as most conservationists would like. The reason for this is because there is not enough pressure for producers in places such as North America to change their way of living to a more conservationist outlook. But in the tropics there is more pressure to change to conservation areas because of the limited resources that are available. Places like Europe have also started to catch onto the ideas and principles of CA, but still nothing much is being done to change due to there being a minimal amount of pressure for people to change their ways of living (FAO 2006).

With CA comes the idea of producing enough food. With cutting back in fertilizer, not tilling the ground, and other processes comes the responsibility to feed the world. According to the Population Reference Bureau, there were around 6.08 billion people on Earth in the year 2000. By 2050 there will be an estimated 9.1 billion people. With this increase comes the responsibility for producers to increase food supply using the same or less land than we use today. Problems arise in the fact that if CA farms do not produce as much as conventional farms, this leaves the world with less food for more people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3428">A '''conservation management system''' (CMS) is a procedure for maintaining a species or habitat in a particular state. It is a means whereby humankind secures wildlife in a favourable condition for contemplation, education or research, in perpetuity.  It is an important topic in [[cultural ecology]], where conservation management counterbalances the unchecked exploitative management of natural resources.  Conservation management systems are vital for turning [[sustainable development]] strategies into successful operations.

In New Zealand the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] develops conservation management strategies in conjunction with the community as a means of prioritising conservation issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/getting-involved/consultations/conservation-management-strategies/how-the-strategies-are-developed/|title=Developing conservation management strategies: Consulting|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation management has historically adopted ideals deriving from 3 discursive approaches: the classic approach, populist approach, and neoliberal approach. All three approaches have differing ideas about the nexus of conservation and development and their potential interactions. 
* The Classic Approach understands local people to be a threat environmental conservation and therefore people occupying landed intended for conservation have historically and presently been evicted from their land. 
* The Populist Approach understands that conservation requires the participation and the empowerment of local people in order to reach both social and environmental aims. 
* The Neoliberal Approach sees the need for value to be placed on biodiversity in order for conservation to be incorporated in the economic systems and be successful as a tool of economic development&lt;ref&gt;Brown, K. (2002). Innovations for Conservation and Development. The Geographical Journal,168(1), 6-17. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/stable/3451218 &lt;/ref&gt;.

National Parks are heavily managed conservations areas. The approach adopted by a conservation authority will influence the management of a Park and dictate how the park authorities view the role of the park and the relationship visitors may have with it.  
An example of a park adopting a populist approach is the [[Rouge National Urban Park]] located in Canada’s largest city [[Toronto]]. Though controlled by the Government of Canada through Parks Canada, the Rouge National Urban Park encourages the community to access the park to learn, play and live. The complexity of the Park being in a large metropolitan city has meant that [[Parks Canada]] has incorporated the surrounding communities into the planning, implementation, and management of the park. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/on/rouge/info/~/media/028EC69FE3264676AD660595012FED36.ashx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13838">The '''curse of knowledge''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand.&lt;ref name=Kennedy1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=Jane|title=Debiasing the Curse of Knowledge in Audit Judgment|journal=The Accounting Review|date=1995|volume=70|issue=2|pages=249–273|jstor=248305}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a classroom setting, teachers have difficulty teaching novices because they cannot put themselves in the position of the student. A brilliant professor might no longer remember the difficulties that a young student encounters when learning a new subject. This curse of knowledge also explains the danger behind thinking about student learning based on what appears best to faculty members, as opposed to what has been verified with students.&lt;ref name=Wieman2007 /&gt;

== History of concept==
The term "curse of knowledge" was coined in a 1989 ''Journal of Political Economy'' article by economists [[Colin Camerer]], [[George Loewenstein]], and Martin Weber. The aim of their research was to counter the "conventional assumptions in such (economic) analyses of asymmetric information in that better-informed agents can accurately anticipate the judgement of less-informed agents".&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/FIE.2008.4720529|chapter=Faculty development strategies for overcoming the "curse of knowledge"|title=2008 38th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference|pages=|year=2008|last1=Froyd|first1=Jeff|last2=Layne|first2=Jean|isbn=978-1-4244-1969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such research drew from [[Baruch Fischhoff]]'s work in 1975 surrounding [[hindsight bias]], a cognitive bias that knowing the outcome of a certain event makes it seem more predictable than may actually be true.&lt;ref name="Camerer-Loewenstein-Weber"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camerer|first1=Colin|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|last3=Weber|first3=Martin|title=The Curse of Knowledge in Economic Settings: An Experimental Analysis|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=1989|volume=97|issue=5|pages=1232–1254|doi=10.1086/261651|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/22171/1/1831894%5B1%5D.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306005841/http://authors.library.caltech.edu/22171/1/1831894%5B1%5D.pdf|archivedate=2015-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by Fischhoff revealed that participants did not know that their outcome knowledge affected their responses, and, if they did know, they could still not ignore or defeat the effects of the bias. Study participants could not accurately reconstruct their previous, less knowledgeable states of mind, which directly relates to the curse of knowledge. This poor reconstruction was theorized by Fischhoff to be because the participant was "anchored in the hindsightful state of mind created by receipt of knowledge".&lt;ref name="Fischhoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischhoff|first1=Baruch|title=Hindsight is not equal to foresight: The effect of outcome knowledge on judgment under uncertainty|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=1975|volume=1|issue=3|pages=288–299|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.1.3.288 }} Reprinted: {{cite journal|last1=Fischhoff|first1=Baruch|title=Hindsight is not equal to foresight: The effect of outcome knowledge on judgment under uncertainty|pmid=12897366|pmc=1743746|volume=12|year=2003|journal=Qual Saf Health Care|pages=304–11|doi=10.1136/qhc.12.4.304}}&lt;/ref&gt; This receipt of knowledge returns to the idea of the curse proposed by Camerer, Loewenstein, and Weber: a knowledgeable person cannot accurately reconstruct what a person, be it themselves or someone else, without the knowledge would think, or how they would act. In his paper, Fischhoff questions the failure to empathize with ourselves in less knowledgeable states, and notes that how well people manage to reconstruct perceptions of lesser informed others is a crucial question for historians and "all human understanding".&lt;ref name="Fischhoff" /&gt;

This research led the economists Camerer, Loewenstein, and Weber to focus on the economic implications of the concept and question whether the curse harms the allocation of resources in an economic setting. The idea that better-informed parties may suffer losses in a deal or exchange was seen as something important to bring to the sphere of economic theory. Most theoretical analyses of situations where one party knew less than the other focused on how the lesser-informed party attempted to learn more information to minimize [[information asymmetry]]. However, in these analyses, there is an assumption that better-informed parties can optimally exploit their information asymmetry when they, in fact, cannot. People cannot utilize their additional, better information, even when they should in a bargaining situation.&lt;ref name="Camerer-Loewenstein-Weber"/&gt;

For example, two people are bargaining over dividing money or provisions. One party may know the size of the amount being divided while the other does not. However, to fully exploit his advantage, the informed party should make the same offer regardless of the amount of material to be divided.&lt;ref&gt;

Starr, and David A. Starrett. New York: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; But informed parties actually offer more when the amount to be divided is larger.&lt;ref name="Forsythe-Kennan-Sopher"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forsythe|first1=Robert|last2=Kennan|first2=John|last3=Sopher|first3=Barry|title=An Experimental Analysis of Strikes in Bargaining Games with One-Sided Private Information|journal=The American Economic Review|date=1991|volume=81|issue=1|pages=253–278|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barry_Sopher/publication/4901075_An_Experimental_Analysis_of_Strikes_in_Bargaining_Games_with_One-Sided_Private_Information/links/569fe31508ae2c638eb7cc28.pdf|jstor=2006799|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508091245/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barry_Sopher/publication/4901075_An_Experimental_Analysis_of_Strikes_in_Bargaining_Games_with_One-Sided_Private_Information/links/569fe31508ae2c638eb7cc28.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks-Camerer-Porter"&gt;Banks, Jeff; Camerer, Colin F.; and Porter, David.

Decision Sci., 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Informed parties are unable to ignore their better information, even when they should.&lt;ref name="Camerer-Loewenstein-Weber"/&gt;

==Experimental evidence==
A 1990 experiment by a Stanford graduate student, Elizabeth Newton, illustrated the curse of knowledge in the results of a simple task. A group of subjects were asked to "tap" out well known songs with their fingers, while another group tried to name the melodies. When the "tappers" were asked to predict how many of the "tapped" songs would be recognized by listeners, they would always overestimate. The curse of knowledge is demonstrated here as the "tappers" are so familiar with what they were tapping that they assumed listeners would easily recognize the tune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heath|first1=Chip|last2=Heath|first2=Dan|title=The Curse of Knowledge|url=https://hbr.org/2006/12/the-curse-of-knowledge|accessdate=26 April 2016|publisher=Harvard Business Review|date=Dec 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Susan Birch and Paul Bloom involving Yale undergraduate students used the curse of knowledge concept to explain the idea that the ability of people to reason about another person's actions is compromised by the knowledge of the outcome of an event. The perception the participant had of the plausibility of an event also mediated the extent of the bias. If the event was less plausible, knowledge was not as much of a "curse" as when there was a potential explanation for the way the other person could act.&lt;ref name="Birch-Bloom"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birch|first1=S. A.J.|last2=Bloom|first2=P.|title=The Curse of Knowledge in Reasoning About False Beliefs|journal=Psychological Science|date=2007|volume=18|issue=5|pages=382–386|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01909.x|pmid=17576275|url=http://bobweigel.net/projects/images/Birch%26bloom_curse.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507215639/http://bobweigel.net/projects/images/Birch%26bloom_curse.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a recent replication study found that this finding was not reliably reproducible across seven experiments with large sample sizes, and the true effect size of this phenomenon was less than half of that reported in the original findings. Therefore, it is suggested that "the influence of plausibility on the curse of knowledge in adults appears to be small enough that its impact on real-life perspective-taking may need to be reevaluated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092406|title=Do Adults Show a Curse of Knowledge in False-Belief Reasoning? A Robust Estimate of the True Effect Size|first1=Rachel A.|last1=Ryskin|first2=Sarah|last2=Brown-Schmidt|date=25 March 2014|publisher=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92406|via=PLoS Journals|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have linked the curse of knowledge bias with false-belief reasoning in both children and adults, as well as [[theory of mind]] development difficulties in children.

Related to this finding is the phenomenon experienced by players of [[charades]]: The actor may find it frustratingly hard to believe that his or her teammates keep failing to guess the secret phrase, known only to the actor, conveyed by [[pantomime]].

==Implications==
In the Camerer, Loewenstein and Weber's article, it is mentioned that the setting closest in structure to the market experiments done would be underwriting, a task in which well-informed experts price goods that are sold to a less-informed public. Investment bankers value securities, experts taste cheese, store buyers observe jewelry being modeled, and theater owners see movies before they are released. They then sell those goods to a less-informed public. If they suffer from the curse of knowledge, high-quality goods will be overpriced and low-quality goods underpriced relative to optimal, profit-maximizing prices; prices will reflect characteristics (e.g., quality) that are unobservable to uninformed buyers.&lt;ref name="Camerer-Loewenstein-Weber"/&gt;

The curse of knowledge has a paradoxical effect in these settings. By making better-informed agents think that their knowledge is shared by others, the curse helps alleviate the inefficiencies that result from information asymmetries (a better informed party having an advantage in a bargaining situation), bringing outcomes closer to complete information. In such settings, the curse on individuals may actually improve social welfare.

== Applications ==
Economists Camerer, Loewenstein, and Weber first applied the curse of knowledge phenomenon to economics, in order to explain why and how the assumption that better-informed agents can accurately anticipate the judgments of lesser-informed agents is not inherently true. They also sought to support the finding that sales agents who are better informed about their products may, in fact, be at a disadvantage against other, less-informed agents when selling their products. The reason is said to be that better-informed agents fail to ignore the privileged knowledge that they possess and are thus "cursed" and unable to sell their products at a value that more naïve agents would deem acceptable.&lt;ref name="Camerer-Loewenstein-Weber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Birch-Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birch|first1=Susan A. J.|last2=Bernstein|first2=Daniel M.|title=What Can Children Tell Us About Hindsight Bias: A Fundamental Constraint on Perspective–Taking?|journal=Social Cognition|date=2007|volume=25|issue=1|pages=98–113|doi=10.1521/soco.2007.25.1.98|url=http://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/downloads/Highsight_Bias_2007_Birch_and_Bernstein3964.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507215753/http://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/downloads/Highsight_Bias_2007_Birch_and_Bernstein3964.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the curse of knowledge could contribute to the difficulty of teaching.&lt;ref name=Wieman2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wieman|first=Carl|title=The 'Curse of Knowledge', or Why Intuition About Teaching Often Fails|journal=APS News|date=2007|volume=16|issue=10|url=http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/files/Wieman_APS_News_Back_Page_with_refs_Nov_2007.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410233551/http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/files/Wieman_APS_News_Back_Page_with_refs_Nov_2007.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curse of knowledge means that it could be potentially ineffective, if not harmful, to think about how students are viewing and learning material by asking the perspective of the teacher as opposed to what has been verified by students. The teacher already has the knowledge that he or she is trying to impart, but the way that knowledge is conveyed may not be the best for those who do not already possess the knowledge.

'''Denotation''' is a translation of a sign to its [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]], precisely to its [[wikt:literal#Adjective|literal]] meaning, more or less like dictionaries try to define it. Denotation is sometimes contrasted to [[connotation]], which includes [[association (psychology)|associated]] meanings. The denotational meaning of a word  is perceived through visible concepts, whereas connotational meaning evokes sensible attitudes towards the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;https://tr.scribd.com/document/137895627/%D0%92-%D0%9D-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0&lt;/ref&gt;

==In semiotics==
{{main|denotation (semiotics)}}
In [[logic]], [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]], the denotation of a word or [[phrase]] is a part of its [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]; however, the part referred to varies by context:
* In [[grammar]] and [[literary theory]], the '''literal''' meaning or "dictionary definition" of a term, devoid of emotion, attitude, and color.
* In [[denotation (Semiotics)|semiotics]], the surface or literal meaning of a signifier.
* In logic, formal semantics and parts of linguistics, the [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] of a term.

==In other fields==
* In [[computer science]], [[denotational semantics]] is contrasted with [[operational semantics]].
*In [[media studies]] terminology, denotation is an example of the first level of analysis: what the audience can visually see on a page. Denotation often refers to something literal, and avoids being a [[metaphor]]. Here it is usually coupled with [[connotation]] which is the second level of analysis, being what the denotation represents.

==Examples==
{|
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony red rose.svg|left|100px|right|Example one.]]
The denotation of this example is a red rose with a green stem. The connotation is that it is a '''symbol''' of passion and love – this is what the rose represents.
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony cross.svg|100px|left|Example two.]]
The denotation is a brown cross. The connotation is a '''symbol''' of religion, according to the media connotation. However, to be more specific this is a '''symbol''' of Christianity.
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony heart.svg|100px|left|Example seven
.]]
The denotation is a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cartoon heart. The connotation is a '''symbol''' of love and affection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12904">In [[financial mathematics]] and [[stochastic optimization]], the concept of [[risk measure]] is used to quantify the risk involved in a random outcome or risk position. Many risk measures have hitherto been proposed, each having certain characteristics. The '''entropic value-at-risk''' ('''EVaR''') is a [[coherent risk measure]] introduced by Ahmadi-Javid,&lt;ref name=Ahmadi1&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmadi-Javid|first=Amir|title=An information-theoretic approach to constructing coherent risk measures|year=2011|publisher=Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory|location=St. Petersburg, Russia|pages=2125–2127|doi= 10.1109/ISIT.2011.6033932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahmadi2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmadi-Javid|first=Amir|title=Entropic value-at-risk: A new coherent risk measure|journal=Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications|year=2012|volume=155|pages=1105–1123|doi=10.1007/s10957-011-9968-2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an upper bound for the [[value at risk]] (VaR) and the [[conditional value-at-risk]] (CVaR), obtained from the [[Chernoff inequality]]. The EVaR can also be represented by using the concept of [[relative entropy]]. Because of its connection with the VaR and the relative entropy, this risk measure is called "entropic value-at-risk". The EVaR was developed to tackle some computational inefficiencies{{clarify|reason=What inefficiencies?|date=February 2013}} of the CVaR. Getting inspiration from the dual representation of the EVaR, Ahmadi-Javid&lt;ref name="Ahmadi1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahmadi2" /&gt; developed a wide class of [[coherent risk measure]]s, called '''[[g-entropic risk measure]]s'''. Both the CVaR and the EVaR are members of this class.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]] with &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; a set of all simple events, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; a [[probability measure]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[random variable]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{M^+}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all [[Borel measurable]] functions &lt;math&gt;X:\Omega\to\R&lt;/math&gt; whose [[moment-generating function]] &lt;math&gt;M_X(z)&lt;/math&gt; exists for all &lt;math&gt;z\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. The entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) of &lt;math&gt;X\in \mathbf{L}_{M^+}&lt;/math&gt; with confidence level &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X):=\inf_{z&gt;0} \left \{z^{-1}\ln \left (\frac{M_X(z)}{\alpha} \right ) \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

In finance, the [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;X \in \mathbf{L}_{M^+},&lt;/math&gt; in the above equation, is used to model the ''losses'' of a portfolio.

Consider the Chernoff inequality

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Pr(X\geq a)\leq e^{-za}M_X(z),\quad \forall z&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Solving the equation &lt;math&gt; e^{-za}M_X(z)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a,&lt;/math&gt; results in 

:&lt;math&gt;a_X(\alpha,z):=z^{-1}\ln \left (\frac{M_X(z)}{\alpha} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

By considering the equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), we see that 

:&lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X):=\inf_{z&gt;0}\{a_X(\alpha,z)\},&lt;/math&gt;

which shows the relationship between the EVaR and the Chernoff inequality. It is worth noting that &lt;math&gt;a_X(1,z)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[entropic risk measure]]'' or ''[[exponential premium]]'', which is a concept used in finance and insurance, respectively.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{M}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all Borel measurable functions &lt;math&gt;X:\Omega\to \R&lt;/math&gt; whose moment-generating function &lt;math&gt;M_X(z)&lt;/math&gt; exists for all &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The [[dual representation]] (or robust representation) of the EVaR is as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)=\sup_{Q\in \Im}(E_Q(X)),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;X\in \mathbf{L}_{M},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Im&lt;/math&gt; is a set of probability measures on &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\Im=\{Q\ll P:D_{KL}(Q||P)\leq-\ln\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that 

:&lt;math&gt;D_{KL}(Q||P):=\int\frac{dQ}{dP}\left (\ln\frac{dQ}{dP} \right )dP&lt;/math&gt; 

is the [[relative entropy]] of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P,&lt;/math&gt; also called the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]]. The dual representation of the EVaR discloses the reason behind its naming.

==Properties==
* The EVaR is a coherent risk measure.

* The moment-generating function &lt;math&gt;M_X(z)&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by the EVaR: for all &lt;math&gt;X\in \mathbf{L}_{M^+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;M_X(z)=\sup_{0&lt;\alpha\leq 1}\{\alpha\exp(z\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X))\}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

* For &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in\mathbf{L}_M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)=\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(Y)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in]0,1]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;F_X(b)=F_Y(b)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;b\in\R&lt;/math&gt;.

* The entropic risk measure with parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta,&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by means of the EVaR: for all &lt;math&gt;X\in \mathbf{L}_{M^+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\theta^{-1}\ln M_X(\theta)=a_X(1,\theta)=\sup_{0&lt;\alpha\leq 1}\{\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)+\theta^{-1}\ln\alpha\}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

* The EVaR with confidence level &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the tightest possible upper bound that can be obtained from the Chernoff inequality for the VaR and the CVaR with confidence level &lt;math&gt;1 - \alpha&lt;/math&gt;;
{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\text{VaR}(X)\leq \text{CVaR}(X)\leq\text{EVaR}(X).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

* The following inequality holds for the EVaR: 
{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\text{E}(X)\leq\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)\leq\text{esssup}(X)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
:where &lt;math&gt;\text{E}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[expected value]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{esssup}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[essential supremum]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\inf_{t\in\R}\{t:\Pr(X\leq t)=1\}&lt;/math&gt;. So do hold &lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_0(X)=\text{E}(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\alpha\to 0}\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)=\text{esssup}(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
[[File:Comparing the VaR, CVaR and EVaR for the standard normal distribution.png|thumbnail|right|Comparing the VaR, CVaR and EVaR for the standard normal distribution]]
[[File:Comparing the VaR, CVaR and EVaR for the uniform distribution.png|thumbnail|right|Comparing the VaR, CVaR and EVaR for the uniform distribution over the interval (0,1)]]
For &lt;math&gt;X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2),&lt;/math&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)=\mu+\sigma\sqrt{-2\ln\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

For &lt;math&gt;X\sim U(a,b),&lt;/math&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)=\inf_{t&gt;0}\left\lbrace t\ln\left(t\frac{e^{t^{-1}b}-e^{t^{-1}a}}{b-a}\right)-t\ln\alpha \right\rbrace.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

Figures 1 and 2 show the comparing of the VaR, CVaR and EVaR for &lt;math&gt;N(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Optimization==
Let &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; be a risk measure. Consider the optimization problem

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\min_{\boldsymbol{w}\in \boldsymbol{W}}\rho(G(\boldsymbol{w},\boldsymbol{\psi})),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{w}\in\boldsymbol{W}\subseteq\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional real [[decision vector]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\psi}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional real [[random vector]] with a known [[probability distribution]] and the function &lt;math&gt;G(\boldsymbol{w},.) :\R^m\to\R&lt;/math&gt; is a Borel measurable function for all values &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{w}\in\boldsymbol{W}.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\rho=\text{EVaR},&lt;/math&gt; then the optimization problem ({{EquationNote|10}}) turns into:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\min_{\boldsymbol{w}\in\boldsymbol{W}, t&gt;0} \left \{t\ln M_{G(\boldsymbol{w},\boldsymbol{\psi})}(t^{-1})-t\ln\alpha \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

Let &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[support of the random vector]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\psi}.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;G(.,\boldsymbol{s})&lt;/math&gt; is [[convex function|convex]] for all &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}\in\boldsymbol{S}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}&lt;/math&gt;, then the objective function of the problem ({{EquationNote|11}}) is also convex. If &lt;math&gt;G(\boldsymbol{w},\boldsymbol{\psi})&lt;/math&gt; has the form

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;G(\boldsymbol{w},\boldsymbol{\psi})=g_0(\boldsymbol{w})+\sum_{i=1}^mg_i(\boldsymbol{w})\psi_i,\qquad g_i:\R^n\to\R, i=0,1,\ldots,m,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}

and &lt;math&gt;\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_m&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent random variables]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_M&lt;/math&gt;, then ({{EquationNote|11}}) becomes

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\min_{\boldsymbol{w}\in\boldsymbol{W}, t&gt;0}\left\lbrace g_0(\boldsymbol{w})+t\sum_{i=1}^m\ln M_{g_i(\boldsymbol{w})\psi_i}(t^{-1})-t \ln \alpha \right\rbrace.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}

which is computationally [[tractable problem|tractable]]. But for this case, if one uses the CVaR in problem ({{EquationNote|10}}), then the resulting problem becomes as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\min_{\boldsymbol{w}\in\boldsymbol{W}, t\in\R}\left\lbrace t+\frac{1}{\alpha}\text{E}\left[ g_0(\boldsymbol{w})+ \sum_{i=1}^{m} g_i(\boldsymbol{w}) \psi_i-t \right]_+ \right\rbrace.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}

It can be shown that by increasing the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, problem ({{EquationNote|14}}) is computationally intractable even for simple cases. For example, assume that &lt;math&gt;\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_m&lt;/math&gt; are independent [[discrete random variable]]s that take &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; distinct values. For fixed values of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{w}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t,&lt;/math&gt; the [[complexity]] of computing the objective function given in problem ({{EquationNote|13}}) is of order &lt;math&gt;mk&lt;/math&gt; while the computing time for the objective function of problem ({{EquationNote|14}}) is of order &lt;math&gt;k^m&lt;/math&gt;. For illustration, assume that &lt;math&gt;k=2, m=100&lt;/math&gt; and the summation of two numbers takes &lt;math&gt;10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt; seconds. For computing the objective function of problem ({{EquationNote|14}}) one needs about &lt;math&gt;4\times 10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; years, whereas the evaluation of objective function of problem ({{EquationNote|13}}) takes about &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; seconds. This shows that formulation with the EVaR outperforms the formulation with the CVaR (see &lt;ref name=Ahmadi2/&gt; for more details).

==Generalization (g-entropic risk measures)==
Drawing inspiration from the dual representation of the EVaR given in ({{EquationNote|3}}), one can define a wide class of information-theoretic coherent risk measures, which are introduced in.&lt;ref name=Ahmadi1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahmadi2/&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be a convex [[proper function]] with &lt;math&gt;g(1)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; be a non-negative number. The &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-entropic risk measure with divergence level &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{ER}_{g,\beta}(X):=\sup_{Q\in\Im}\text{E}_Q(X)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\Im=\{Q\ll P:H_g(P,Q)\leq\beta\}&lt;/math&gt; in which &lt;math&gt;H_g(P,Q)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[generalized relative entropy]] of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. A primal representation of the class of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-entropic risk measures can be obtained as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{ER}_{g,\beta}(X)=\inf_{t&gt;0,\mu\in\R}\left\lbrace t\left[ \mu+\text{E}_P\left( g^*\left( \frac{X}{t}-\mu+\beta \right) \right) \right] \right\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;g^*&lt;/math&gt; is the conjugate of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. By considering

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g(x)=\begin{cases} x\ln x &amp; x&gt;0 \\ 0 &amp; x=0 \\ +\infty &amp; x&lt;0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

with &lt;math&gt;g^*(x)=e^{x-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta=- \ln\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the EVaR formula can be deduced. The CVaR is also a &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-entropic risk measure, which can be obtained from ({{EquationNote|16}}) by setting

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g(x)= \begin{cases} 0 &amp; 0\leq x\leq \frac{1}{\alpha} \\ +\infty &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|18}}}}

with &lt;math&gt;g^*(x)=\tfrac{1}{\alpha}\max\{0,x\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta=0&lt;/math&gt; (see &lt;ref name=Ahmadi1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahmadi3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmadi-Javid|first=Amir|title=Addendum to: Entropic Value-at-Risk: A New Coherent Risk Measure|journal=Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications|year=2012|volume=155|pages=1124–1128|doi=10.1007/s10957-012-0014-9|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; for more details).

== Ordinary combustibles ==
[[File:Fire type A.svg|left|60px]]
Class A fires consist of ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, fabric, and most kinds of trash.&lt;ref name=IFSTA-10&gt;{{cite book | title=Fire Detection and Suppression Systems |edition=Third | publisher=International Fire Service Training Association | year=2005 | location=Stillwater, OK | page=10 | isbn=0-87939-267-3 |oclc=62785313}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

== Flammable liquid and gas==
[[File:Fire type B.svg|left|60px]]
[[File:Extincteur-p1010032.jpg|thumb|upright|A carbon dioxide fire extinguisher rated for flammable liquids and gasses]]

These are fires whose fuel is flammable or combustible liquid or gas.  The US system designates all such fires "Class B".  In the European/Australian system, flammable liquids are designated "Class B" having flash point less than 100&amp;nbsp;°F (38°C), while burning gases are separately designated "Class C".  These fires follow the same basic fire tetrahedron (heat, fuel, oxygen, chemical reaction) as ordinary combustible fires, except that the fuel in question is a flammable liquid such as gasoline, or gas such as [[natural gas]]. A solid stream of water should never be used to extinguish this type because it can cause the fuel to scatter, spreading the flames. The most effective way to extinguish a liquid or gas fueled fire is by inhibiting the chemical chain reaction of the fire, which is done by dry chemical and [[Halomethane|Halon]] extinguishing agents, although smothering with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or, for liquids, foam is also effective. Halon has fallen out of favor in recent times because it is an ozone-depleting material; the Montreal Protocol declares that Halon should no longer be used. Chemicals such as [[FM-200]] are now the recommended halogenated suppressant.

== {{anchor|Electrical}} Electrical ==
[[File:Class C fire icon.svg|left|60px]]
Electrical fires are fires involving potentially energized [[Electricity|electrical]] equipment.  The US system designates these "Class C"; the Australian system designates them "Class E".  This sort of fire may be caused by short-circuiting machinery or overloaded electrical cables. These fires can be a severe hazard to firefighters using water or other conductive agents, as electricity may be conducted from the fire, through water, to the firefighter's body, and then [[ground (electrical)|earth]].  [[Electrical shocks]] have caused many firefighter deaths.

Electrical fire may be fought in the same way as an ordinary combustible fire, but water, foam, and other conductive agents are not to be used.  While the fire is or possibly could be electrically energized, it can be fought with any extinguishing agent rated for electrical fire. [[Carbon dioxide]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NOVEC 1230, [[FM-200]] and dry chemical powder extinguishers such as [[Purple-K|PKP]] and even baking soda are especially suited to extinguishing this sort of fire. PKP should be a last resort solution to extinguishing the fire due to its corrosive tendencies.  Once electricity is shut off to the equipment involved, it will generally become an ordinary combustible fire.

In Europe, "electrical fires" are no longer recognized as a separate class of fire as electricity itself cannot burn. The items around the electrical sources may burn. By turning the electrical source off, the fire can be fought by one of the other class of fire extinguishers{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

== Metal ==

Class D fires involve combustible metals - especially [[alkali metal]]s like [[lithium]] and [[potassium]], [[alkaline earth metal]]s such as [[magnesium]], and [[group 4 element]]s such as [[titanium]] and [[zirconium]].&lt;ref name=IFSTA-10/&gt;

Metal fires represent a unique hazard because people are often not aware of the characteristics of these fires and are not properly prepared to fight them. Therefore, even a small metal fire can spread and become a larger fire in the surrounding ordinary combustible materials. Certain metals [[Pyrophoricity|burn in contact with air]] or water (for example, [[sodium]]), which exaggerate this risk. Generally speaking, masses of combustible metals do not represent great fire risks because heat is conducted away from hot spots so efficiently that the heat of combustion cannot be maintained. In consequence, significant heat energy is required to ignite a contiguous mass of combustible metal.  Generally, metal fires are a hazard when the metal is in the form of sawdust, machine shavings or other metal "fines", which combust more rapidly than larger blocks. Metal fires can be ignited by the same ignition sources that would start other common fires.

Care must be taken when extinguishing metal fires. Water and other common firefighting agents can excite metal fires and make them worse. The [[National Fire Protection Association]] recommends that metal fires be fought with dry powder extinguishing agents that work by smothering and heat absorption.  The most common agents are [[sodium chloride]] granules and [[graphite]] powder. In recent years, powdered [[copper]] has also come into use. These ''dry powder'' extinguishers should not be confused with those that contain ''dry chemical'' agents.  The two are not the same, and only dry powder should be used to extinguish a metal fire.  Using a dry chemical extinguisher in error, in place of dry powder, can be ineffective or actually increase the intensity of a metal fire.

== Cooking oils and fats (kitchen fires) ==
[[File:Class K fire icon.svg|left]]
[[File:Chip-pan-fire.jpg|upright|thumb|Laboratory simulation of a chip pan fire: a beaker containing wax is heated until it catches fire.  A small amount of water is then poured into the beaker. The water sinks to the bottom and vaporizes instantly (''[[boilover]]''), ejecting a plume of burning liquid wax into the air.]]

Class K fires involve unsaturated cooking oils in well-insulated cooking appliances located in commercial kitchens.&lt;ref name=IFSTA-10/&gt;

Fires that involve [[cooking oil]]s or fats are designated “Class K” under the American system, and “Class F” under the European/Australian systems.  Though such fires are technically a subclass of the flammable liquid/gas class, the special characteristics of these types of fires, namely the higher flash point, are considered important enough to recognize separately.  Water mist can be used to extinguish such fires. As with Class B fires, a solid stream of water should never be used to extinguish this type because it can cause the fuel to scatter, spreading the flames. Appropriate fire extinguishers may also have hoods over them that help extinguish the fire. Sometimes [[fire blanket]]s are used to stop a fire in a kitchen or on a stove.

'''Forced circumcision''' refers to [[circumcision]] of [[man|males]] who have not given their [[consent]] to the procedure. In a [[Bible|biblical]] context, the term is used especially in relation to [[Paul the Apostle]] and his [[polemic]]s against the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|forced circumcision of gentile Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Dunn, ''Paul and the Mosaic Law'', p. 265; Tomson, "Transformations of Post-70 Judaism," p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Among adults, forced circumcisions have occurred in a wide range of situations, most notably in the [[Forced conversion to Islam|compulsory conversion of non-Muslims to Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;"Although the Qur'an speaks against forced conversion, such conversions of Christians and Jews took place under Muslim rule until the early decades of the twentieth century." Lerner, ''Religion, Secular Beliefs and Human Rights'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; and the forced circumcision of [[Teso people|Teso]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]] and [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] men in [[Kenya]], as well as the abduction of [[South Africa]]n teenage boys to so-called circumcision schools ("bush schools").&lt;ref&gt;On occurrences of forced circumcision in Kenya, see Glazier, ''Land and the Uses of Traditions'', p. 25; Wamwere, ''I Refuse to Die'', p. 149, passim; Karimi and Ochieng, ''The Kenyatta Succession'', p. 13; Rutten and Owuor, "Weapons of mass destruction"; Kagwanja, "Courting genocide." Regarding the situation in South Africa, see Ndangam, ''Lifting the Cloak'', pp. 211-213; Meintjies, ''Manhood at a Price''; Mayatula and Mavundla, "A review on male circumcision procedures"; Crowly and Kesner, "Ritual Circumcision."&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, custom allows uncircumcised [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]-speaking men past the age of circumcision (i.e., 25 years or older) to be overpowered by other men and forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Funani, ''Circumcision among the Ama-Xhosa'', p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and contemporary forced circumcision==

===Hasmonean Kingdom (140 BCE–37 BCE)===
{{see also|Hasmonean Kingdom}}
[[1 Maccabees]] relates the story of how [[Mattathias]] (ca. 166 BC) forcibly circumcised the sons of [[Jews|Jewish]] parents who had abandoned the rite.&lt;ref&gt;"And Mattathias and his friends went around and tore down the altars; they forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys that they found within the borders of Israel " (1 Macc. 2:45-46, New Revised Standard Version).&lt;/ref&gt; Forced circumcision of Gentiles by Jews is attested from the second century BC onwards. In 125 BC [[John Hyrcanus]] conquered [[Edom]], which the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] called Idumea; and the Idumeans were converted to Judaism. As reported by [[Josephus]], circumcision was required of the Idumeans as a token of their acceptance of Judaism:

{{blockquote|Hyrcanus took also Dora and Marissa, cities of Idumea, and subdued all the Idumeans; and permitted them to stay in that country, if they would circumcise their genitals, and make use of the laws of the Jews; and they were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers, that they submitted to the use of circumcision, and the rest of the Jewish ways of living; at which time therefore this befell them, that they were hereafter no other than Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIII 9:1, 254 ff; see, e.g., Cohen, ''The Beginnings of Jewishness'', pp. 110-111; Taus, ''Torah for Today'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars disagree on the interpretation of the sources. For example, Steven Weitzman believes the Idumeans were forcibly circumcised for political, not religious, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, "Forced Circumcision."&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Shaye J. D. Cohen]], "[[Ptolemy]]'s claim, that the Idumaeans were compelled to be circumcised and to adopt Jewish ways, is a simplified account of what these urban Idumaeans experienced."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, "Religion, Ethnicity, and Hellenism," p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;
During the short reign of Hyrcanus' eldest son, [[Aristobulus I]] (104-103 BC), the [[Hasmonean]]s gained control of [[Galilee]]. In this case, too, sources indicate that the residents were subjected to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Fiensy, ''New Testament Introduction'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence suggests that, during this period, Gentiles fled from Galilee to avoid being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, "Why Evaluate Twenty-five Years," pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
{{see also|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}
Greeks and Romans regarded circumcision as a mutilation of the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|male genitalia]], but the practice is little discussed in [[Latin literature|Roman literary sources]] until the second century of the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal 14.103–104; [[Tacitus]], ''Historia'' 5.5.1–2; Martial 7.30.5, 7.35.3–4, 7.82.5–6, 11.94; Margaret Williams, "Jews and Jewish Communities in the Roman Empire," in ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 325; Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian'' (Brill, 1976), p. 431; Jack N. Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Religion," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy in Early Christianity]] but this was resolved at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] c.50 which made it clear that circumcision of gentile converts to Christianity was not required.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 15: 5-21&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus (who changed his allegiance from the Jews to the Roman [[Flavians]]) reports that two Roman officers who had taken refuge with Galileans during the war with Rome (early 67 AD) were put under pressure to convert to Judaism. Josephus, declaring that "every one should worship God in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience," claims to have saved the two Gentiles from forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Life'' 23 §113; see also Goodman, "Galilean Judaism," p. 602; Donaldson, ''Paul and the Gentiles'', p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First Roman-Jewish War]], a head tax, the [[Fiscus Judaicus]], was levied against all Jews. According to [[Suetonius]], [[Domitian]] (c.90) also applied this tax to those who were circumcisied, even if they claimed they were not Jews. [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)]] was put to death in 95 for adopting Jewish customs. In 96 [[Nerva]] relaxed the Jewish tax as applying only to those who professed to be Jews. Sometime between 128 and 132 AD, the emperor [[Hadrian]] seems to have temporarily banned circumcision, on pain of death.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World'' (Routledge, 1983, 2003), p. 150, and ''Judeophobia: Attitudes toward Jews in the Ancient World'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), p. 103, pointing out this depends on a single note on the ban as a cause for the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', the historical credibility of which is often cast in doubt. [[Cassius Dio]] mentions nothing about circumcision in his account of the revolt. See also Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', pp. 430–431, who thinks the ban makes more sense as a punitive measure after the revolt, since it "ran completely counter to the long established Roman policy of guaranteeing Jewish religious liberty."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoninus Pius]] exempted Jews from the ban,&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews'', p. 150; Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian priests]],&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Origen]] (d. ''ca.'' 253) says that in his time only Jews were permitted to practice circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', p. 103. Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 469, takes Origen as meaning that circumcision was "a solely Jewish rite" by his time.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation under [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the first Christian emperor, freed any slave who was subjected to circumcision; in the year 339, circumcising a slave became punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Greco-Roman writers view circumcision as an identifying characteristic of Jews, they believed the practice to have originated in Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Several Greco-Roman writers, such as [[Strabo]], regarded the Jews as of Egyptian descent, in what was apparently their understanding of [[the Exodus]]: Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded it among peoples they identified as [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Arab]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]], [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]], [[Colchis|Colchian]], and [[History of Ethiopia#Classical Antiquity|Ethiopian]]; circumcision was a marker of "the Other".&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 430; Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora Jews]] might circumcise their male slaves as well as [[Conversion to Judaism|adult male converts]] and Jewish male infants.&lt;ref&gt;Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Judaism," p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Catherine Hezser, it is an open question whether Jews of [[late antiquity]] refrained from forcibly circumcising their Gentile slaves and whether Romans avoided selling their slaves to Jews in reaction to the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, ''Jewish Slavery in Antiquity'', p. 42; see also Hezser, "Slaves and Slavery."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishnah]] (compiled about 200 AD) is silent on this point, whereas the [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael]] (written at the end of the fourth century or later) suggests that Jews might indeed possess uncircumcised slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, ''Jews and Blacks'', p. 378, n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia and North Africa===
Forced conversions, involving forced circumcision, are echoed in a vast body of [[scholarly method|scholarly]] literature spanning the entire history of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lerner, ''Religion, Secular Beliefs, and Human Rights'', p. 142; Ye'or, ''The Decline of Eastern Christianity'', pp. 88-91; Stark, ''God's Battalions'', p. 28; Clarence-Smith, ''Islam'', p. 39, passim; Misra, ''Identity and Religion'', p. 91, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars conclude that, during the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Islamic conquest of the Middle East and North Africa]], forced conversion to Islam through violence or threat of violence did not play a key role. However, [[tax]]es and regulations requiring the holders of prestigious positions to become Muslims have been regarded as a form of forced conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone, ''An Introduction to Islam'', p. 58; see also Misra, ''Identity and Religion'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Asia====
In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Pollilur|1780 Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British soldiers were held imprisoned by [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] and Tipu Sultan in the fortress of [[Srirangapatna|Seringapatnam]]. Of these, more than 300 were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Darby, ''A Surgical Temptation'', pp. 32-33; see also Oddy, ''Religion in South Asia'', p. 42, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell Massey, who kept a secret diary during his captivity, wrote: "I lost with the foreskin of my yard all those benefits of a Christian and Englishman which were and ever shall be my greatest glory."&lt;ref&gt;Colley, ''Captives'', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolescence|Adolescent]] captives were, in addition to being circumcised, made to wear female clothes. James Bristow, a teenage [[artillery]]man, revenged himself by circumcising [[dog]]s, believing that this would harm the religious feelings of the Muslim warders. The prospect of punishment did not deter him, because "compelling us to undergo an abhorred operation [was] so base and barbarous an act of aggression, that it was impossible to reflect on it with temper."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, ''Captives of Tipu'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Scurry]], also a prisoner of war, confirms in his book, ''The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry'' (1824), that English soldiers, [[Mangalorean Catholics]], and other prisoners were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref name=Bowring&gt;{{cite book

In 1784, when Tipu returned from [[Mangalore]], he brought back tens of thousands of Mangalorean Catholics from [[Kanara]] and subjected them to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Naravane, ''Battles'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; A Hindi idiom 'Mar-mar ke Musalman bana' (meaning 'make Muslim by repeated beating') can be traced to originate from forcible conversion of Hindus.

According to Kativa Daiya, during the 1947 [[partition of India]] "[f]orced circumcision, shaving facial and head hair (for [[Sikh]] men), and shaving off the Hindu [[Brahmin]]'s traditional, short, plaited hair (on an otherwise bald head) were routine Muslim conversion tactics for men and boys."&lt;ref&gt;Daiya, ''Violent Belongings'', pp. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asia News'' reported in 2004 that the Justice and Peace Commission of Lahor spoke out against young non-Muslim men in [[Pakistan]] being converted and circumcised against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Christian-minorities-in-Pakistan:-little-freedom-and-rising-Islamic-pressure-1583.html |title=Christian minorities in Pakistan: little freedom and rising Islamic pressure |date=9 March 2004 |publisher=AsiaNews.it |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the ''Gulf Times'' discussed a case of forced circumcision of [[Nepal]]ese boys in [[Mumbai]] in the context of sex trade in large Indian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Iraq====
[[Iraq]]i [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]], residing almost exclusively in [[Baghdad]] and [[Basra]], do not circumcise.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lupieri, ''The Mandaeans''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their religious sensitivity on this issue has not prevented hostile rulers from subjecting Mandaean men and boys to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, ''The Great Stem of Souls'', pp. 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandaean communities, especially after the invasion of Iraq, have been subject to "murder, kidnapping, rape, forced conversion, forced circumcision and destruction of religious property."&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson et al., "The impact of fear"; see also Nickerson et al., "Fear of Cultural Extinction."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iraq in 2003, shortly after the fall of the Saddam regime, the thirty-five families who made up the Mandean community in Fallujia were ordered at gunpoint to adopt Islam; the men were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabwashingtonian.org/english/article.php?issue=4&amp;articleID=71 |title=The Rape of Basra: Cleansing the Iraqi Mandaeans |author=C.G.

In 2007 the US Committee on International Religious Freedom heard testimony reporting: "Forced conversion is happening in an alarming degree. Boys are being kidnapped, forcibly circumcised - a major sin in the Mandaean religion - and forcibly converted to Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Dr Suhaib Nashi at the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] Hearing on Threats to Iraq's Communities of Antiquity, 25 July 2007; see [http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1268&amp;Itemid=114 USCIRF press release], "USCIRF Hearing: Threats to Iraq's Communities of Antiquity," July 25, 2007 (issued by Judith Ingram).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, after the exodus of the [[Christianity in Iraq|Christians]] from [[Mosul]] and the [[Yazidi|Yazidi's]] from [[Sinjar Mountains|Mount Sinjar]], it was reported that forced circumcisions were taking place conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tunisiadaily.com/2014/08/16/irak-circoncisions-de-chretiens-et-700-femmes-yazidies-vendues-a-150-dollars-piece/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anatolia====

=====The Ottoman Empire=====

It is well established that, before and during the [[Armenian Genocide]], forced conversions (involving forced circumcisions) of [[Armenia]]n boys and men were frequent.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Bobelian, ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; "In many cases young Armenian children were spared from deportation by local Turks who took them from their families. The children were coerced into denouncing Christianity and becoming Muslims, and were then given new Turkish names. For Armenian boys the forced conversion meant they each had to endure painful circumcision as required by Islamic custom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/armenians.htm |title=Armenians in Turkey 1915-1918 1,5000,000 |year=2000 |publisher=The History Place |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====
During the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] in September 1955, "many [[Greece|Greek]] men, including at least one [[priest]], were subjected to forced circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;Zayas, "The Istanbul Pogrom"; see also Vryonis, ''The Mechanism of Catastrophe'', pp. 224-226, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the pogrom, the Greek minority eventually emigrated from [[Turkey]].

====The Arab world====
John Rawlins had sailed for 23 years without incident when, in 1621, he and his crew were kidnapped by pirates from the [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa. Rawlins later reported that, after being taken to Algiers, two younger men were "by force and torment ... compelled ... to turn Turks," which means that they were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, "John Rawlins"; see also DiPiero, ''White Men Aren't'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; By organizing a successful [[mutiny]], he was able to return home in 1622.
The Portuguese Friar Jaono dos Sanctos claimed that, annually in Algiers in the 1620s, more than nine hundred Christian slaves were converted to Islam, "besides about fifty boys yearly circumcised against their wills."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Davis, ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Maluku Islands=====
Thousands of Christians were forcibly circumcised in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]] from December 1999 to January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, ''Religious Freedom in Asia'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sydney Morning Herald reported in detail on this, stating that "almost all" of 3,928 villagers forced to convert to Islam were circumcised.  Razors and knives were reused, causing infections.&lt;ref name="murdoch-smh"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those circumcised, Kostantinus Idi, reported: "I could not escape," he said. "One of them held up my foreskin between pieces of wood while another cut me with a razor ...the third man held my head back, ready to pour water down my throat if I screamed. But I couldn't help but scream and he poured the water. I kept screaming aloud and vomited. I couldn't stand the pain." He further reported that one of the clerics urinated on his wound, saying it would stop infection. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the forced conversions and forced circumcisions had been condemned by moderate Muslim leaders who said they were contrary to Islamic teachings. The local governor had also investigated the incidents.&lt;ref name="murdoch-smh"/&gt;

[[Marco Polo]], in his ''Travels'', relates how a Christian king of [[Ethiopia]] took revenge on the Sultan of Aden, who had forcibly circumcised a [[bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Marco Polo'', Book 3, Chapter 35; see also Strickland, ''Saracens, Demons, &amp; Jews'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
In Kenya, most tribes circumcise. Luo men from Western Kenya are a significant exception, for which reason they have regularly been subjected to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Glazier, ''Land and the Uses of Traditions'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2002, following a violent incident in [[Butere/Mumias District]], a district commissioner instructed the police to "crack down on traditional surgeons involved in forcible circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/news/thenation08-23-02/|title=Man Forcibly Circumcised As Crowd Watches|last=|first=|date=2002-08-23|website=|publisher=''The Nation'', Nairobi, Kenya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-10-07|quote=&lt;p&gt;A man was yesterday forcibly circumcised by traditional surgeons in Mumias-Butere District as police watched helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr John Otieko... was cornered by a mob ... stripped naked, frog-marched to a nearby river and covered with clay ... then brought to Mayoni trading centre ... to be circumcised as an excited crowd watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts by four traffic police officers who were manning a roadblock on the highway a few metres away from the scene failed when the crowd started stoning them. The victim was then left bleeding at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;District Commissioner Ernest Munyi expressed shock at the incident and told police to crack down on traditional surgeons involved in forcible circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[Kenyan Human Rights Commission]] announced that it would seek prosecutions against politicians for inciting such violence. In one instance, a cabinet minister had said, "Those who are not circumcised should be taken for a circumcision ceremony." The Commission said this amounted to an incitement to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In late January 2008, a disputed election in which circumcision became an issue between President Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu and opposition candidate Raila Odinga, a Luo, "the fact that Odinga was uncircumcised became an issue: He was seen by some Kikuyus as a 'child' unfit to rule because he had not passed through circumcision and initiation." Post-election violence reportedly "focused on tribal animosities", and included several cases of forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In September 2010, at Malaba, West Kenya, a 21-year-old Teso man was lured to a hotel, drugged, smeared with fermented millet flour and was being led away by several Bukusu to be circumcised when the police intervened. The Teso man, who agreed to a medical circumcision, condemned the Bukusu youths for trying to impose their culture on the Teso. Three weeks previously, village neighbours in Aedomoru sub location in Teso north armed themselves with clubs and prevented a 35-year-old man from being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1999, a woman who was feared throughout the Vaal Triangle district of South Africa, controlled a gang of kidnappers that abducted young people, forcibly circumcising the boys and extorting ransoms from their parents for their release. A local police officer said as many as 10 teenagers had been snatched every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In December 2004, 45-year-old Nceba Cekiso was caught and circumcised against his will. The report in the ''[[Cape Argus]]'' noted, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Xhosa culture allows people to forcibly circumcise boys deemed to be past the age of initiation... Forcing people do undergo the ancient ritual ... has, in recent times, caused concern among human rights organisations... (In) one instance two Rastafarians objected to the procedure on religious grounds.

Despite being medically circumcised, a Christian Xhosa was forcibly recircumcised by his father and community leaders in 2007. He laid a charge of unfair discrimination on the grounds of his religious beliefs, seeking an apology from his father and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. In the settlement that was reached, and which was made an order of the Equality Court, the Congress of Traditional Leaders accepted the right of adult males to choose whether to attend traditional circumcision schools according to their religious beliefs. It apologised for the comments made by its former chairman encouraging the ostracism of teenagers who refused to undergo traditional circumcision. The judge declared, "What is important in terms of the Constitution and law is that no one can be forced to submit to circumcision without his consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Sudan====
There is ample evidence that, for years, Christians of [[Khartoum]] and elsewhere in [[Sudan]] have been forcefully converted to Islam, and that Christian men and boys have been forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3df4bea71c.html "Sudan: Reports of Catholic residents of Khartoum or elsewhere in Sudan being forcefully converted to Islam"], Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 19 October 2001, and references therein; see also Akol, ''Burden of Nationality'', pp. 25-72. According to the ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000'', February 2001 (United States Department of State, Washington, DC), non-Muslim Sudanese boys kidnapped off the streets have undergone forced circumcision in government camps and juvenile houses; see {{cite web

====Uganda====
In 1885, [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Kabaka Mwanga]] ordered the murders of Bishop [[James Hannington]] and many local Christians. During the following period, Islamization led to several Christians being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Otiso, ''Culture and Customs of Uganda'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed by [[anthropology|anthropologist]] Suzette Heald and other scholars, the [[Gisu people|Gisu]] (alternatively, Bagishu) of [[Uganda]] "take pride in not tolerating uncircumcised men." For this reason, in Gisu society, any boy or man who has been able to escape ritual circumcision (called "imbalu") faces the prospect of being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, ''Manhood and Morality'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Voice of America, referring to the same practice, reports: "Among the Bagishu, uncircumcised men are treated with contempt; they are not allowed in society and in most cases they are seen as failing to get local women for marriage. This is supported by all the Bagishu including women who often report uncircumcised men to tribal elders. It's considered traditional that no male is to escape the ritual regardless of where he lives, what he does or what kind of security he has."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Australia===
Traditional circumcision is still practised in some tribal areas of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., DeMello, ''Encyclopedia'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist and anthropologist Peter Sutton, commenting on forced circumcision and the absence of law enforcement in remote settlements, claims that Australian law has been applied in a patchy way: "Involuntary circumcision has long been widely accepted as being de facto outside the scope of Australian law."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, ''The Politics of Suffering'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1996, 34-year-old Irwin Brookdale was drinking with a group of [[Australian Aborigines]] on the banks of a river in far north Queensland. After he passed out, a woman in the group felt down his pants, found that he was not circumcised and called on her companions to "make a man out of him." They attempted to circumcise him with a broken beer bottle. Brookdale ended up in hospital, one of his assailants was convicted of unlawful wounding and Brookdale was awarded A$10,000 compensation for nervous shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Breakup of Yugoslavia====
The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], according to Milica Z. Bookman, "was extremely violent, producing some two million refugees, over 100,000 killed, and evidence of gang rape, impaling, dismemberment and forced circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;Bookman, "War and Peace."&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Department of State reported that Muslim and Mujahedin irregular troops  "had routinely performed crude, disfiguring, nonmedical circumcisions on Bosnian Serb soldiers." One 18-year-old Bosnian Serb soldier "was so brutally circumcised that eventually the entire organ required amputation."&lt;ref&gt;''Fourth Report on War Crimes in the Former Yugoslavia: Part II—Torture of Prisoners'', US Department of State Dispatch, vol. 3, no. 52, 28 December 1992, quoted in Kohlmann, ''Al-Qaida's Jihad in Europe'', p. 30.

{{globalize|date=July 2010}}

In the [[social sciences]], '''framing''' comprises a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives on how individuals, groups, and societies, organize, perceive, and communicate about [[reality]]. Framing involves [[social construction]] of a [[social phenomenon]] – by [[mass media]] sources, political or social movements, political leaders, or other actors and organizations. Participation in a language community necessarily influences an individual's ''[[perception]]'' of the meanings attributed to words or phrases. Politically, the language communities of [[advertising]], [[religion]], and mass media are highly contested, whereas framing in less-sharply defended [[speech community|language communities]] might evolve imperceptibly and organically over [[cultural]] time frames, with fewer overt modes of disputation.

Framing can manifest in [[cognition|thought]] or interpersonal [[communication]]. ''Frames in thought'' consist of the mental representations, interpretations, and simplifications of reality. ''Frames in communication'' consist of the communication of frames between different actors.&lt;ref name="Druckman2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Druckman | first1 = J.N. | year = 2001 | title = The Implications of Framing Effects for Citizen Competence | url = | journal = Political Behavior | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 225–56 | doi=10.1023/A:1015006907312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can view framing in communication as positive or negative – depending on the audience and what kind of information is being presented. The framing may be in the form of ''equivalence frames'', where two or more logically equivalent alternatives are portrayed in different ways (see [[framing effect (psychology)|framing effect]]) or ''emphasis frames'', which simplify reality by focusing on a subset of relevant aspects of a situation or issue.&lt;ref name="Druckman2001" /&gt; In the case of  "equivalence frames", the information being presented is based on the same facts, but the "frame" in which it is presented changes, thus creating a reference-dependent perception.

The effects of framing can be seen in many journalism applications. With the same information being used as a base, the "frame" surrounding the issue can change the reader's perception without having to alter the actual facts. In the context of politics or mass-media communication, a frame defines the packaging of an element of [[rhetoric]] in such a way as to encourage certain interpretations and to discourage others.  For political purposes, framing often presents facts in such a way that implicates a problem that is in need of a solution. Members of political parties attempt to frame issues in a way that makes a solution favoring their own political leaning appear as the most appropriate course of action for the situation at hand.&lt;ref name="van der Pas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Pas|first=D.|title=Making Hay While the Sun Shines: Do Parties Only Respond to Media Attention When The Framing is Right?|journal=Journal of Press/Politics|year=2014|volume=19|issue=1|pages=42–65|doi=10.1177/1940161213508207}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social theory]], framing is a [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], a collection of [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotes]] and [[stereotype]]s, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events.&lt;ref name="Goffman1974"&gt;
Goffman, E. (1974). Frame analysis: An easy on the organization of experience. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, people build a series of mental "filters" through biological and cultural influences. They then use these filters to make sense of the world. The choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame.

Framing is also a key component of [[sociology]], the study of social interaction among humans.  Framing is an integral part of conveying and processing data on a daily basis.  Successful framing techniques can be used to reduce the ambiguity of intangible topics by contextualizing the information in such a way that recipients can connect to what they already know.

== Explanation ==
When one seeks to explain an event, the understanding often depends on the frame referred to. If a friend rapidly closes and opens an eye, we will respond very differently depending on whether we attribute this to a purely "physical" frame (they blinked) or to a social frame (they winked). Though the former might result from a speck of dust (resulting in an involuntary and not particularly meaningful reaction), the latter would imply a voluntary and meaningful action (to convey humor to an accomplice, for example). 

Observers will read events seen as purely physical or within a frame of "nature" differently from those seen as occurring with social frames. But we do not look at an event and then "apply" a frame to it. Rather, individuals constantly project into the world around them the interpretive frames that allow them to make sense of it; we only shift frames (or realize that we have habitually applied a frame) when incongruity calls for a frame-shift. In other words, we only become aware of the frames that we always already use when something forces us to replace one frame with another.&lt;ref&gt;
This example borrowed from Clifford Geertz: ''Local Knowledge: Further Essays in Interpretive Anthropology'' (1983), Basic Books 2000 paperback: {{ISBN|0-465-04162-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Goffman offers the example of the woman bidding on a mirror at an auction who first examines the frame and surface for imperfections, and then "checks" herself in the mirror and adjusts her hat. See Goffman, Erving. ''Frame Analysis: An essay on the organization of experience''. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-930350-91-X}}, p. 39. In each case the mirror represents more than simply a physical object.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Framing is so effective because it is an heuristic, or mental shortcut that may not always yield desired results; and is seen as a 'rule of thumb'. According to Susan T. Fiske and Shelley E. Taylor, human beings are by nature "cognitive misers", meaning they prefer to do as little thinking as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, S. T., &amp; Taylor, S. E. (1991). Social cognition (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; Frames provide people a quick and easy way to process information. Hence, people will use the previously mentioned mental filters (a series of which is called a schema) to make sense of incoming messages. This gives the sender and framer of the information enormous power to use these schemas to influence how the receivers will interpret the message.&lt;ref name="EntmanRobertTree"&gt;Entman, Robert "Tree Beard". Framing: Toward Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm. Journal of Communication; Autumn 1993, 43, 4, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some consider framing to be synonymous with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]], other scholars state that there is a distinction. According to an article written by Donald H. Weaver, framing selects certain aspects of an issue and makes them more prominent in order to elicit certain interpretations and evaluations of the issue, whereas agenda setting introduces the issue topic to increase its salience and accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weaver|first=David H.|title=Thoughts on Agenda Setting, Framing, and Priming|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=57|page=142|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00333.x|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framing effect in communication research==
In the field of communication, framing defines how news media coverage shapes [[mass opinion]]. [[Richard Vatz|Richard E. Vatz's]] discourse on creation of rhetorical meaning relates directly to framing, although he references it little.  To be specific, framing effects refer to behavioral or attitudinal strategies and/or outcomes that are due to how a given piece of information is being framed in [[public discourse]]. Today, many volumes of the major communication journals contain papers on media frames and framing effects.&lt;ref&gt;Scheufele, D. A. &amp; Iyengar, S. (forthcoming). The state of framing research: A call for new directions. In K. kENSKI, &amp; K. H. Jamieson (Eds.), The Oxford Handbook of political communication theories. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches used in such papers can be broadly classified into two groups: studies of framing as the dependent variable and studies of framing as the independent variable.&lt;ref&gt;Tewksbury &amp; Scheufele (2009). News framing theory and research, In J. Bryant, &amp; M. B. Oliver (Eds.) Media effects: Advances in theory and research, New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The former usually deals with ''frame building'' (i.e. how frames create societal discourse about an issue and how different frames are adopted by journalists) and latter concerns ''frame setting'' (i.e. how media framing influences an audience).

===Frame building===
Frame building is related to at least three areas: journalist norms, political actors, and cultural situations. It assumes that several media frames compete to set one frame regarding an issue, and one frame finally gains influence because it resonates with [[popular culture]], fits with media practices, or is heavily sponsored by [[elite]]s.
First, in terms of practices of news production, there are at least five aspects of news work that may influence how journalists frame a certain issue: larger societal norms and values, organizational pressures and constraints, external pressures from [[interest group]]s and other [[policy maker]]s, professional routines, and ideological or political orientations of journalists. The second potential influence on frame building comes from elites, including interest groups, government bureaucracies, and other political or corporate actors. Empirical studies show that these influences of elites seem to be strongest for issues in which journalists and various players in the policy arena can find shared narratives. Finally, cultural contexts of a society are also able to establish frame. [[Erving Goffman]]&lt;ref name="Goffman1974"/&gt; assumes that the meaning of a frame has implicit cultural roots. This context dependency of media frame has been described as 'cultural resonance'&lt;ref&gt;Gamson, W. A. &amp; Modigliani, A. (1987) The changing culture of affirmative action. Research in Political Sociology, 3, 137–77&lt;/ref&gt; or 'narrative fidelity'.&lt;ref name="SnowBenford1988"&gt;Snow, D. A., &amp; Benford, R. D. (1988). Ideology, frame resonance, and participant mobilization. In B. Klandermans, H. Kriesi, &amp; S. Tarrow (Eds.), International social movement research. Vol. 1, From structure on action: Comparing social movement research across cultures (pp. 197–217). Greenwich, CT: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frame setting===
When people are exposed to a novel news frame, they will accept the constructs made applicable to an issue, but they are significantly more likely to do so when they have existing schema for those constructs. This is called the applicability effect. That is, when new frames invite people to apply their existing schema to an issue, the implication of that application depends, in part, on what is in that schema. Therefore, generally, the more the audiences know about issues, the more effective are frames.

There are a number of levels and types of framing effects that have been examined. For example, scholars have focused on attitudinal and behavioral changes, the degrees of perceived importance of the issue, voting decisions, and opinion formations. Others are interested in psychological processes other than applicability. For instance, Iyengar&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, S. (1991). Is anyone responsible? How television frames political issues. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that news about social problems can influence attributions of causal and treatment responsibility, an effect observed in both cognitive responses and evaluations of political leaders, or other scholars looked at the framing effects on receivers' evaluative processing style and the complexity of audience members' thoughts about issues.

==In mass communication research==
News media frame all news items by emphasizing specific values, facts, and other considerations, and endowing them with greater apparent applicability for making related judgments.  News media promotes particular definitions, interpretations, evaluations and recommendations.&lt;ref name=Entman1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Entman|first=R.M.|title=Framing: Toward clarification of a fractured paradigm|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=4|pages=51–58|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01304.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NelsonClawsonOxley1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=T.E.|author2=Clawson, R.A. |author3=Oxley, Z.M. |title=Media framing of a civil liberties conflict and its effect on tolerance|journal=American Political Science Review|year=1997|volume=91|issue=3|pages=567–83|doi=10.2307/2952075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundations in mass communication research===

Anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]] first articulated the concept of framing in his 1972 book ''[[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]]''.  A frame, Bateson wrote, is "a spatial and temporal bounding of a set of interactive messages."&lt;ref name=Bateson1972&gt;{{cite book|last=Bateson|first=G.|title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind|year=1972|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sociological roots of media framing research====

Media framing research has both sociological and psychological roots.  Sociological framing focuses on "the words, images, phrases, and presentation styles" that communicators use when relaying information to recipients.&lt;ref name="Druckman2001" /&gt; Research on frames in sociologically driven media research generally examines the influence of "social norms and values, organizational pressures and constraints, pressures of interest groups, journalistic routines, and ideological or political orientations of journalists" on the existence of frames in media content.&lt;ref name=Scheufele2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scheufele|first=D.A.|title=Agenda-setting, priming, and framing revisited: Another look at cognitive effects of political communication|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2000|volume=3|issue=2&amp;3|pages=297–316|doi=10.1207/S15327825MCS0323_07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Todd Gitlin]], in his analysis of how the news media trivialized the student [[New Left]] movement during the 1960s, was among the first to examine media frames from a sociological perspective.  Frames, Gitlin wrote, are "persistent patterns of cognition, interpretations, and presentation, of selection [and] emphasis ... [that are] largely unspoken and unacknowledged ... [and] organize the world for both journalists [and] for those of us who read their reports."&lt;ref name=Gitlin1980&gt;{{cite book|last=Gitlin|first=T.|title=The Whole World is Watching: Mass Media in the Making and Unmaking of the New Left|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychological roots of media framing research====

Research on frames in psychologically driven media research generally examines the effects of media frames on those who receive them.  For example, Iyengar explored the impact of episodic and thematic news frames on viewers' attributions of responsibility for political issues including crime, terrorism, poverty, unemployment, and racial inequality.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991&gt;{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=S.|title=Is Anyone Responsible? How Television Frames Political Issues|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iyengar, an episodic news frame "takes the form of a case study or event-oriented report and depicts public issues in terms of concrete instances," while a thematic news frame "places public issues in some more general abstract context ... directed at general outcomes or conditions."&lt;ref name=Entman1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt; Iyengar found that the majority of television news coverage of poverty, for example, was episodic.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  In fact, in a content analysis of six years of television news, Iyengar found that the typical news viewer would have been twice as likely to encounter episodic rather than thematic television news about poverty.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  Further, experimental results indicate participants who watched episodic news coverage of poverty were more than twice as likely as those who watched thematic news coverage of poverty to attribute responsibility of poverty to the poor themselves rather than society.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  Given the predominance of episodic framing of poverty, Iyengar argues that television news shifts responsibility of poverty from government and society to the poor themselves.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  After examining content analysis and experimental data on poverty and other political issues, Iyengar concludes that episodic news frames divert citizens' attributions of political responsibility away from society and political elites, making them less likely to support government efforts to address those issue and obscuring the connections between those issues and their elected officials' actions or lack thereof.&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;

===Clarifying and distinguishing a "fractured paradigm"===

Perhaps because of their use across the social sciences, frames have been defined and used in many disparate ways.  Entman called framing "a scattered conceptualization" and "a fractured paradigm" that "is often defined casually, with much left to an assumed tacit understanding of the reader."&lt;ref name=Entman1993 /&gt; In an effort to provide more conceptual clarity, Entman suggested that frames "select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described."&lt;ref name=Entman1993 /&gt;

Entman's&lt;ref name=Entman1993 /&gt;  conceptualization of framing, which suggests frames work by elevating particular pieces of information in salience, is in line with much early research on the psychological underpinnings of framing effects (see also Iyengar,&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  who argues that accessibility is the primary psychological explanation for the existence of framing effects).  Wyer and Srull&lt;ref name=WyerSrull1984 /&gt;  explain the construct of accessibility thus:
# People store related pieces of information in "referent bins" in their long-term memory.&lt;ref name=WyerSrull1984&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyer Jr.|first=R.S.|title=Social Cognition: The Ontario Symposium|year=1984|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|last2=Srull |first2=T.K. |editor=E.T. Higgins |editor2=N.A. Kuiper |editor3=M.P Zanna |chapter=Category Accessibility: Some theoretic and empirical issues concerning the processing of social stimulus information}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# People organize "referent bins" such that more frequently and recently used pieces of information are stored at the top of the bins and are therefore more accessible.&lt;ref name=WyerSrull1984 /&gt;
# Because people tend to retrieve only a small portion of information from long-term memory when making judgments, they tend to retrieve the most accessible pieces of information to use for making those judgments.&lt;ref name=WyerSrull1984 /&gt;

The argument supporting accessibility as the psychological process underlying framing can therefore be summarized thus: Because people rely heavily on news media for public affairs information, the most accessible information about public affairs often comes from the public affairs news they consume.  The argument supporting accessibility as the psychological process underlying framing has also been cited as support in the debate over whether framing should be subsumed by [[agenda-setting theory]] as part of the second level of agenda setting.  McCombs and other agenda-setting scholars generally agree that framing should be incorporated, along with [[Priming (media)|priming]], under the umbrella of agenda setting as a complex model of media effects linking media production, content, and audience effects.&lt;ref name=Kosicki1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosicki|first=G.M.|title=Problems and opportunities in Agenda-setting research|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=2|pages=100–27|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01265.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCombsShaw1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M.E.|author2=Shaw, D.L.|title=The evolution of agenda-setting research: Twenty-five years in the marketplace of ideas|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=2|pages=58–67|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01262.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCombsLlamasLopez-EscobarRey1997 /&gt;  Indeed, McCombs, Llamas, Lopez-Escobar, and Rey justified their attempt to combine framing and agenda-setting research on the assumption of parsimony.&lt;ref name=McCombsLlamasLopez-EscobarRey1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M.F.|author2=Llamas, J.P. |author3=Lopez-Escobar, E. |author4=Rey, F. |title=Candidate images in Spanish elections: Second-level agenda-setting effects|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=1997|volume=74|pages=703–17|doi=10.1177/107769909707400404|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheufele, however, argues that, unlike agenda setting and priming, framing does not rely primarily on accessibility, making it inappropriate to combine framing with agenda setting and priming for the sake of parsimony.&lt;ref name=Scheufele2000 /&gt; Empirical evidence seems to vindicate Scheufele's claim.  For example, Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley empirically demonstrated that applicability, rather than their salience, is key.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt; By operationalizing accessibility as the response latency of respondent answers where more accessible information results in faster response times, Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley demonstrated that accessibility accounted for only a minor proportion of the variance in framing effects while applicability accounted for the major proportion of variance.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt; Therefore, according to Nelson and colleagues, "frames influence opinions by stressing specific values, facts, and other considerations, endowing them with greater apparent relevance to the issue than they might appear to have under an alternative frame."&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt;

In other words, while early research suggested that by highlighting particular aspects of issues, frames make certain considerations more accessible and therefore more likely to be used in the judgment process,&lt;ref name=Entman1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Iyengar1991 /&gt;  more recent research suggests that frames work by making particular considerations more applicable and therefore more relevant to the judgment process.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheufele2000 /&gt;

===Equivalency versus emphasis: two types of frames in media research===

Chong and Druckman suggest framing research has mainly focused on two types of frames: equivalency and emphasis frames.&lt;ref name=ChongDruckman2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chong|first=D.|author2=Druckman, J.N. |title=Framing theory|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|year=2007|volume=10|pages=103–26|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equivalency frames offer "different, but logically equivalent phrases," which cause individuals to alter their preferences.&lt;ref name="Druckman2001" /&gt; Equivalency frames are often worded in terms of "gains" versus "losses."  For example, Kahneman and Tversky asked participants to choose between two "gain-framed" policy responses to a hypothetical disease outbreak expected to kill 600 people.&lt;ref name=KahnemanTversky1984&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=D.|author2=Tversky, A.|title=Choices, values, and frames|journal=American Psychologist |year=1984|volume=39|issue=4|pages=341–50 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.39.4.341}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Response A would save 200 people while Response B had a one-third probability of saving everyone, but a two-thirds probability of saving no one.  Participants overwhelmingly chose Response A, which they perceived as the less risky option. Kahneman and Tversky asked other participants to choose between two equivalent "loss-framed" policy responses to the same disease outbreak.  In this condition, Response A would kill 400 people while Response B had a one-third probability of killing no one but a two-thirds probability of killing everyone.  Although these options are  mathematically identical to those given in the "gain-framed" condition, participants overwhelmingly chose Response B, the risky option.  Kahneman and Tversky, then, demonstrated that when phrased in terms of potential gains, people tend to choose what they perceive as the less risky option (i.e., the sure gain).  Conversely, when faced with a potential loss, people tend to choose the riskier option.&lt;ref name=KahnemanTversky1984 /&gt;

Unlike equivalency frames, emphasis frames offer "qualitatively different yet potentially relevant considerations" which individuals use to make judgments.&lt;ref name=ChongDruckman2007 /&gt; For example, Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley exposed participants to a news story that presented the [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s plan to hold a rally.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt;  Participants in one condition read a news story that framed the issue in terms of public safety concerns while participants in the other condition read a news story that framed the issue in terms of free speech considerations.  Participants exposed to the public safety condition considered public safety applicable for deciding whether the Klan should be allowed to hold a rally and, as expected, expressed lower tolerance of the Klan's right to hold a rally.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt;  Participants exposed to the free speech condition, however, considered free speech applicable for deciding whether the Klan should be allowed to hold a rally and, as expected, expressed greater tolerance of the Klan's right to hold a rally.&lt;ref name="NelsonClawsonOxley1997" /&gt;

==Framing effect in psychology and economics==
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
{{Main|Framing effect (psychology)}}
[[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] have shown that framing can affect the outcome (i.e. the choices one makes) of choice problems, to the extent that several of the classic axioms of [[rational choice]] do not hold.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tversky | first1 = Amos | last2 = Kahneman | first2 = Daniel | year = 1981 | title = The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice | url = | journal = Science | volume = 211 | issue = 4481| pages = 453–58 | doi = 10.1126/science.7455683 | pmid = 7455683 | bibcode = 1981Sci...211..453T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the development of [[prospect theory]] as an alternative to rational choice theory.&lt;ref&gt;Econport. "Decision-Making Under Uncertainty – Advanced Topics: An Introduction to Prospect Theory". (EconPort is an economics digital library specializing in content that emphasizes the use of experiments in teaching and research.) [http://www.econport.org/econport/request?page=man_ru_advanced_prospect]&lt;/ref&gt;

The context or framing of problems adopted by decision-makers results in part from extrinsic manipulation of the decision-options offered, as well as from forces intrinsic to decision-makers, e.g., their norms, habits, and unique [[temperament]].

===Experimental demonstration===
Tversky and Kahneman (1981) demonstrated systematic [[preference reversal|reversals of preference]] when the same problem is presented in different ways, for example in the Asian disease problem. Participants were asked to "imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume the exact scientific estimate of the consequences of the programs are as follows."

The first group of participants was presented with a choice between programs:
In a group of 600 people,
* Program A: "200 people will be saved"
* Program B: "there is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved, and a 2/3 probability that no people will be saved"

72 percent of participants preferred program A (the remainder, 28%, opting for program B).

The second group of participants was presented with the choice between the following:
In a group of 600 people,
* Program C: "400 people will die"
* Program D: "there is a 1/3 probability that nobody will die, and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die"

In this decision frame, 78% preferred program D, with the remaining 22% opting for program C.

Programs A and C are identical, as are programs B and D. The change in the decision frame between the two groups of participants produced a preference reversal: when the programs were presented in terms of lives saved, the participants preferred the secure program, A (= C). When the programs were presented in terms of expected deaths, participants chose the gamble D (= B).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Absolute and relative influences===
Framing effects arise because one can frequently frame a decision using multiple [[scenario]]s, wherein one may express benefits either as a relative risk reduction (RRR), or as absolute risk reduction (ARR). Extrinsic control over the cognitive distinctions (between [[risk tolerance]] and [[Incentive|reward anticipation]]) adopted by decision makers can occur through altering the presentation of [[relative risk]]s and [[Three degrees of comparison|absolute]] benefits.

People generally prefer the absolute certainty inherent in a positive framing-effect, which offers an assurance of gains. When decision-options appear framed as a ''likely gain'', risk-averse choices predominate.

A shift toward risk-seeking behavior occurs when a decision-maker frames decisions in negative terms, or adopts a negative framing effect.

In [[Decision-making|medical decision making]], [[framing bias]] is best avoided by using absolute measures of efficacy.&lt;ref name="pmid21792695"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Perneger TV, Agoritsas T | title=Doctors and Patients' Susceptibility to Framing Bias: A Randomized Trial | journal=J Gen Intern Med | year= 2011 | volume= 26| issue= 12| pages= 1411–17| pmid=21792695 | doi=10.1007/s11606-011-1810-x | pmc= 3235613| url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frame-manipulation research===
Researchers have found that framing decision-problems in a positive light generally results in less-risky choices; with negative framing of problems, riskier choices tend to result.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1981" /&gt;

In a study by researchers at [[Dartmouth Medical School]], 57% of the subjects chose a medication when presented with benefits in relative terms, whereas only 14.7% chose a medication whose benefit appeared in absolute terms. Further questioning of the patients suggested that, because the subjects ignored the underlying risk of disease, they perceived benefits as greater when expressed in relative terms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=8271086&amp;dopt=Abstract The framing effect of relative and absolute risk. [J Gen Intern Med. 1993&amp;#93; – PubMed Result&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical models===
Researchers have proposed&lt;ref&gt;Chong, D. and Druckman, J. N. (2007): Framing Theory, Annual Review of Political Science, vol. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, V., Tewksburg, D. and Powers, E. (1997): Switching Trains of Thought: The Impact of News Frames on Readers' Cognitive Responses, Communication Research, Vol. 24. No. 5, 481–506&lt;/ref&gt; various models explaining the '''framing effect''':
* cognitive theories, such as the [[fuzzy-trace theory]], attempt to explain the framing-effect by determining the amount of cognitive processing effort devoted to determining the value of potential gains and losses.
* [[prospect theory]] explains the framing-effect in functional terms, determined by preferences for differing perceived values, based on the assumption that people give a greater weighting to losses than to equivalent gains.
* [[motivation]]al theories explain the framing-effect in terms of [[hedonic]] forces affecting individuals, such as fears and wishes—based on the notion that negative emotions evoked by potential losses usually out-weigh the emotions evoked by hypothetical gains.
* cognitive [[Cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit]] trade-off theory defines choice as a compromise between desires, either as a preference for a correct decision or a preference for minimized cognitive effort. This model, which dovetails elements of cognitive and motivational theories, postulates that calculating the value of a sure gain takes much less cognitive effort than that required to select a risky gain.

===Neuroimaging===
Cognitive [[neuroscientist]]s have linked the framing-effect to neural activity in the [[amygdala]], and have identified another brain-region, the orbital and medial [[prefrontal cortex]] (OMPFC), that appears to moderate the role of [[emotion]] on decisions. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to monitor brain-activity during a financial decision-making task, they observed greater activity in the OMPFC of those research subjects less susceptible to the framing-effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Martino | first1 = B. | last2 = Kumaran | first2 = D. | last3 = Seymour | first3 = B. | last4 = Dolan | first4 = R.

==Framing theory and frame analysis in sociology==
Framing theory and frame analysis provide a broad theoretical approach that analysts have used in [[communication studies]], [[journalism|news]] (Johnson-Cartee, 1995), politics, and [[social movement]]s (among other applications).

According to some sociologists, the "social construction of collective action frames" involves "public discourse, that is, the interface of media discourse and interpersonal interaction; persuasive communication during mobilization campaigns by movement organizations, their opponents and countermovement organizations; and consciousness raising during episodes of collective action."&lt;ref&gt;
Bert Klandermans. 1997. ''The Social Psychology of Protest''. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 45
&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[diction|Word-selection]] or diction has been a component of [[rhetoric]] since time immemorial. But most commentators attribute the concept of framing to the work of [[Erving Goffman]] on [[frame analysis]] and point especially to his 1974 book, ''Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience''. Goffman used the idea of frames to label "schemata of interpretation" that allow individuals or groups "to locate, perceive, identify, and label" events and occurrences, thus rendering meaning, organizing experiences, and guiding actions.&lt;ref&gt;
Erving Goffman (1974). ''Frame Analysis: An essay on the organization of experience''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974, p. 21.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Goffman's framing concept evolved out of his 1959 work, ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]'', a commentary on the [[management]] of [[Impression management|impressions]]. These works arguably depend on [[Kenneth Boulding]]'s concept of image.&lt;ref&gt;
Kenneth Boulding: ''The Image: Knowledge in Life and Society'', University of Michigan Press, 1956)
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social movements===
Sociologists have utilized framing to explain the process of [[social movement]]s.&lt;ref name="SnowBenford1988" /&gt;
Movements act as carriers of beliefs and ideologies (compare [[meme]]s). In addition, they operate as part of the process of constructing meaning for participants and opposers (Snow &amp; Benford, 1988). Sociologists deem the mobilization of mass-movements "successful" when the frames projected align with the frames of participants to produce resonance between the two parties. Researchers of framing speak of this process as ''frame re-alignment''.

===Frame-alignment===
Snow and Benford (1988) regard frame-alignment as an important element in social mobilization or movement. They argue that when individual frames become linked in congruency and complementariness, "frame alignment" occurs,&lt;ref name="Snowetal1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Snow | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Rochford | first2 = E. B. | last3 = Worden | first3 = S. K. | last4 = Benford | first4 = R. D. | year = 1986 | title = Frame alignment processes, micromobilization, and movement participation | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 51 | issue = 4| page = 464 | doi=10.2307/2095581| jstor = 2095581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
producing "frame resonance", a catalyst in the process of a group making the transition from one frame to another (although not all framing efforts prove successful). The conditions that affect or constrain framing efforts include the following:
* "The robustness, completeness, and thoroughness of the framing effort". Snow and Benford (1988) identify three core framing-tasks, and state that the degree to which framers attend to these tasks will determine participant mobilization. They characterize the three tasks as the following:
*# diagnostic framing for the identification of a problem and assignment of blame
*# prognostic framing to suggest solutions, strategies, and tactics to a problem
*# motivational framing that serves as a call to arms or rationale for action
* The relationship between the proposed frame and the larger [[belief system|belief-system]]; centrality: the frame cannot be of low hierarchical significance and salience within the larger belief system. Its range and interrelatedness, if the framer links the frame to only one core belief or value that, in itself, has a limited range within the larger belief system, the frame has a high degree of being discounted.
* Relevance of the frame to the realities of the participants; a frame must seem relevant to participants and must also inform them. Empirical credibility or testability can constrain relevancy: it relates to participant experience, and has narrative fidelity, meaning that it fits in with existing cultural myths and narrations.
* [[Protest cycle|Cycles of protest]] (Tarrow 1983a; 1983b); the point at which the frame emerges on the timeline of the current era and existing preoccupations with social change. Previous frames may affect efforts to impose a new frame.

Snow and Benford (1988) propose that once someone has constructed proper frames as described above, large-scale changes in society such as those necessary for social movement can be achieved through frame-alignment.

====Types====
Frame-alignment comes in four forms: frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension and frame transformation.

# ''Frame bridging'' involves the "linkage of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected frames regarding a particular issue or problem" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;467). It involves the linkage of a movement to "unmobilized [''[[sic]]''] sentiment pools or public opinion preference clusters" (p.&amp;nbsp;467) of people who share similar views or grievances but who lack an organizational base.
# ''Frame amplification'' refers to "the clarification and invigoration of an interpretive frame that bears on a particular issue, problem, or set of events" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;469). This interpretive frame usually involves the invigorating of values or beliefs.
# ''Frame extensions'' represent a movement's effort to incorporate participants by extending the boundaries of the proposed frame to include or encompass the views, interests, or sentiments of targeted groups (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;472).
# ''Frame transformation'' becomes necessary when the proposed frames "may not resonate with, and on occasion may even appear antithetical to, conventional lifestyles or rituals and extant interpretive frames" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;473).

When this happens, the securing of participants and support requires new values, new meanings and understandings. Goffman (1974, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44) calls this "keying", where "activities, events, and biographies that are already meaningful from the standpoint of some primary framework, in terms of another framework" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;474) such that they are seen differently. Two types of frame transformation exist:

# Domain-specific transformations, such as the attempt to alter the status of groups of people, and
# Global interpretive frame-transformation, where the scope of change seems quite radical—as in a change of [[world view|world-views]], total conversions of thought, or uprooting of everything familiar (for example: moving from [[communism]] to [[market capitalism]], or vice versa; [[religious conversion]], etc.).

==Frame analysis as rhetorical criticism==
Although the idea of language-framing had been explored earlier by [[Kenneth Burke]] (terministic screens), political communication researcher [[Jim A. Kuypers]] first published work advancing [[frame analysis]] (framing analysis) as a rhetorical perspective in 1997. His approach begins inductively by looking for themes that persist across time in a text (for Kuypers, primarily news narratives on an issue or event) and then determining how those themes are framed. Kuypers's work begins with the assumption that frames are powerful rhetorical entities that "induce us to filter our perceptions of the world in particular ways, essentially making some aspects of our multi-dimensional reality more noticeable than other aspects. They operate by making some information more salient than other information...."&lt;ref&gt;
Jim A. Kuypers, "Framing Analysis" in ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action'', edited by J.A. Kuypers,  Lexington Press, 2009. p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 essay "Framing Analysis" in ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;ref&gt;
''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;/ref&gt; and his 2010 essay "Framing Analysis as a Rhetorical Process",&lt;ref&gt;Kuypers, Jim A. "Framing Analysis as a Rhetorical Process," Doing News Framing Analysis.  Paul D'Angelo and  Jim A. Kuypers, eds. (New York: Routeledge, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers offers a detailed conception for doing framing analysis from a rhetorical perspective. According to Kuypers, "Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner. Frames operate in four key ways: they define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest remedies. Frames are often found within a narrative account of an issue or event, and are generally the central organizing idea."&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers, ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers's work is based on the premise that framing is a rhetorical process and as such it is best examined from a rhetorical point of view. Curing the problem is not rhetorical and best left to the observer.

==Rhetorical framing in politics==

{{POV section|date=March 2017}}

Framing is used to construct, refine, and deliver messages. Framing in politics is essential to getting your message across to the masses. Frames are mental structures that shape the way we view the world (Lakoff, Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate 2004).&lt;ref name=Lakoff&gt;In Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate, by George Lakoff, 144. Chelsea Green Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Reframing is used particularly well by both conservatives and liberals in the political arena, so well that they have news anchors and commentators discussing the ideas, supplied phrases and framing (Lakoff, Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate 2004).&lt;ref name=Lakoff/&gt;

==Applications==

===Finance===
Preference reversals and other associated phenomena are of wider relevance within behavioural economics, as they contradict the predictions of [[rational choice]], the basis of traditional economics. Framing biases affecting investing, lending, borrowing decisions make one of the themes of [[behavioral finance]].

===Law===
[[Edward Zelinsky]] has shown that framing effects can explain some observed behaviors of legislators.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Zelinsky|Zelinsky, Edward A.]]. 2005. Do Tax Expenditures Create Framing Effects? Volunteer Firefighters, Property Tax Exemptions, and the Paradox of Tax Expenditure Analysis. ''Virginia Tax Review'' 24. [http://www.allbusiness.com/accounting/3584666-1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
The role framing plays in the effects of media presentation has been widely discussed, with the central notion that associated perceptions of factual information can vary based upon the presentation of the information.

====News media examples====
In ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age,''&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers, ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age'' (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2006),&lt;/ref&gt;[[Jim A. Kuypers]] examined the differences in framing of the [[War on Terror]] between the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush]] administration and the U.S. mainstream news media between 2001 and 2005.  Kuypers looked for common themes between presidential speeches and press reporting of those speeches, and then determined how the president and the press had framed those themes.  By using a rhetorical version of framing analysis, Kuypers determined that the U.S. news media advanced frames counter to those used by the Bush administration:

{{quote| the press actively contested the framing of the War on Terror as early as eight weeks following 9/11. This finding stands apart from a collection of communication literature suggesting the press supported the President or was insufficiently critical of the President's efforts after 9/11. To the contrary, when taking into consideration how themes are framed, [Kuypers] found that the news media framed its response in such a way that it could be viewed as supporting the idea of some action against terrorism, while concommitantly opposing the initiatives of the President.  The news media may well relay what the president says, but it does not necessarily follow that it is framed in the same manner; thus, an echo of the theme, but not of the frame.  The present study demonstrates, as seen in Table One [below], that shortly after 9/11 the news media was beginning to actively counter the Bush administration and beginning to leave out information important to understanding the Bush Administration's conception of the War on Terror.  In sum, eight weeks after 9/11, the news media was moving beyond reporting political opposition to the President—a very necessary and invaluable press function—and was instead actively choosing themes, and framing those themes, in such a way that the President's focus was opposed, misrepresented, or ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Jim A.

In 1991 Robert M. Entman published findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Entman | first1 = R. M. | year = 1991 | title = Symposium Framing U.S. Coverage of International News: Contrasts in Narratives of the KAL and Iran Air Incidents | url = | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 6–27 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1991.tb02328.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding the differences in media coverage between [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] and [[Iran Air Flight 655]]. After evaluating various levels of media coverage, based on both amount of airtime and pages devoted to similar events, Entman concluded that the frames the events were presented in by the media were drastically different:

{{quote| By de-emphasizing the agency and the victims and by the choice of graphics and adjectives, the news stories about the U.S. downing of an Iranian plane called it a technical problem, while the Soviet downing of a Korean jet was portrayed as a moral outrage… [T]he contrasting news frames employed by several important U.S. media outlets in covering these two tragic misapplications of military force. For the first, the frame emphasized the moral bankruptcy and guilt of the perpetrating nation, for the second, the frame de-emphasized the guilt and focused on the complex problems of operating military high technology. }}

Differences in coverage amongst various media outlets:

In 1988 Irwin Levin and Gary Gaeth did a study on the effects of framing attribute information on consumers before and after consuming a product (1988). In this study they found that in a study on beef, people who ate beef labeled as 75% lean rated it more favorably than people whose beef was labelled 25% fat.

===Politics===

Linguist and rhetoric scholar [[George Lakoff]] argues that, in order to persuade a political audience of one side of an argument or another, the facts must be presented through a rhetorical frame.  It is argued that, without the frame, the facts of an argument become lost on an audience, making the argument less effective.  The rhetoric of politics uses framing to present the facts surrounding an issue in a way that creates the appearance of a problem at hand that requires a solution.  Politicians using framing to make their own solution to an exigence appear to be the most appropriate compared to that of the opposition.&lt;ref name="van der Pas" /&gt;  Counter-arguments become less effective in persuading an audience once one side has framed an argument, because it is argued that the opposition then has the additional burden of arguing the frame of the issue in addition to the issue itself.

Framing a political issue, a political party or a political opponent is a [[strategy|strategic]] goal in [[politics]], particularly in the [[United States of America]]. Both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political parties compete to successfully harness its power of persuasion. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'':

{{quote|Even before the [[United States presidential election, 2004|election]], a new political word had begun to take hold of the party, beginning on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and spreading like a virus all the way to the inner offices of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]]. That word was 'framing.' Exactly what it means to 'frame' issues seems to depend on which Democrat you are talking to, but everyone agrees that it has to do with choosing the language to define a debate and, more important, with fitting individual issues into the contexts of broader story lines.|&lt;ref name="framingwars"&gt;
[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/magazine/17DEMOCRATS.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=e3e686efd4fa97c5&amp;ex=1183608000 The Framing Wars. ''[[New York Times]]'' 17 July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because framing has the ability to alter the public's perception, politicians engage in battles to determine how issues are framed. Hence, the way the issues are framed in the media reflects who is winning the battle. For instance, according to Robert Entman, professor of Communication at George Washington University, in the build-up to the Gulf War the conservatives were successful in making the debate whether to attack sooner or later, with no mention of the possibility of not attacking. Since the media picked up on this and also framed the debate in this fashion, the conservatives won.&lt;ref name="EntmanRobertTree" /&gt;

One particular example of [[George Lakoff|Lakoff's]] work that attained some degree of fame was his advice to rename&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Olson]], [http://www.overlawyered.com/2005/07/some_framing_advice.html Overlawyered weblog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707192530/http://www.overlawyered.com/2005/07/some_framing_advice.html |date=2007-07-07 }}, 2005-07-18&lt;/ref&gt; [[trial lawyer]]s (unpopular in the United States) as "public protection attorneys". Though Americans have not generally adopted this suggestion, the [[Association of Trial Lawyers of America]] did rename themselves the "American Association of Justice", in what the [[Chamber of Commerce]] called an effort to hide their identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al Kamen]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/16/AR2007011601429_pf.html "Forget Cash – Lobbyists Should Set Support for Lawmakers in Stone"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 2007-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' depicted similar intensity among Republicans:

{{quote|In one recent memo, titled 'The 14 Words Never to Use,' [[Frank Luntz|[Frank] Luntz]] urged conservatives to restrict themselves to phrases from what he calls ... the 'New American Lexicon.' Thus, a smart Republican, in Luntz's view, never advocates '[[oil drilling|drilling for oil]]'; he prefers 'exploring for energy.' He should never criticize the 'government,' which cleans our streets and pays our firemen; he should attack '[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]],' with its ceaseless thirst for taxes and regulations. 'We should never use the word [[outsourcing]],' Luntz wrote, 'because we will then be asked to defend or end the practice of allowing companies to ship American jobs overseas.'|&lt;ref name="framingwars"/&gt;}}

From a political perspective, framing has widespread consequences. For example, the concept of framing links with that of [[agenda setting theory|agenda-setting]]: by consistently invoking a particular frame, the framing party may effectively control discussion and perception of the issue. [[Sheldon Rampton]] and [[John Stauber]] in ''[[Trust Us, We're Experts]]'' illustrate how [[Public Relations|public-relations]] (PR) firms often use language to help frame a given issue, structuring the questions that then subsequently emerge. For example, one firm advises clients to use "bridging language" that uses a strategy of answering questions with specific terms or ideas in order to shift the discourse from an uncomfortable topic to a more comfortable one.&lt;ref&gt;
Rampton, Sheldon and Stauber, John. ''Trust Us, We're Experts!'' Putnam Publishing, New York, NY, 2002. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;
Practitioners of this strategy might attempt to draw attention away from one frame in order to focus on another. As Lakoff notes, "On the day that [[George W. Bush]] took office, the words "tax relief" started coming out of the White House."&lt;ref name="Lakoff2004"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lakoff|first=George|title=Don't think of an elephant!: know your values and frame the debate|year=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=978-1-931498-71-5|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By refocusing the structure away from one frame ("tax burden" or "tax responsibilities"), individuals can set the agenda of the questions asked in the future.

[[Cognitive linguistics|Cognitive linguists]] point to an example of framing in the phrase "[[tax cut|tax relief]]". In this frame, use of the concept "relief" entails a concept of (without mentioning the benefits resulting from) taxes putting strain on the citizen:

{{quote|The current tax code is full of inequities. Many single moms face higher marginal tax rates than the wealthy. Couples frequently face a higher tax burden after they marry. The majority of Americans cannot deduct their charitable donations. Family farms and businesses are sold to pay the death tax. And the owners of the most successful small businesses share nearly half of their income with the government. President Bush's tax cut will greatly reduce these inequities. It is a fair plan that is designed to provide tax relief to everyone who pays income taxes.|&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/reports/taxplan.html The President's Agenda for Tax Relief] retrieved 3 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alternative frames may emphasize the concept of taxes as a source of infrastructural support to businesses:

{{quote|The truth is that the wealthy have received more from America than most Americans—not just wealth but the infrastructure that has allowed them to amass their wealth: banks, the Federal Reserve, the stock market, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the legal system, federally sponsored research, patents, tax supports, the military protection of foreign investments, and much much more. American taxpayers support the infrastructure of wealth accumulation. It is only fair that those who benefit most should pay their fair share.|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognitivepolicyworks.com/resource-center/planning-tools/framing-tutorials/simple-framing/ Cognitive Policy Works/Rockridge Institute: Simple Framing]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frames can limit debate by setting the vocabulary and [[metaphor]]s through which participants can comprehend and discuss an issue. They form a part not just of political discourse, but of [[cognition]]. In addition to generating new frames, politically oriented framing research aims to increase public awareness of the connection between framing and reasoning.

====Examples====
* The initial response of the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|assault of September 11, 2001]] was to frame the acts of [[Counterterrorism|terror]] as [[crime]]. This framing was replaced within hours by a war metaphor, yielding the "[[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]". The difference between these two framings is in the implied response. Crime connotes bringing criminals to justice, putting them on trial and sentencing them, whereas as [[war]] implies enemy territory, military action and war powers for government.&lt;ref name="Lakoff2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Juyan |title=Beyond anti-terrorism: Metaphors as message strategy of post-September-11 U.S. public diplomacy |journal=Public Relations Review|year=2007|volume=33|issue=1|pages=31–39|doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2006.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The term "escalation" to describe an increase in American troop-levels in [[Iraq]] in 2007 implied that the United States deliberately increased the scope of conflict in a provocative manner and possibly implies that U.S. strategy entails a long-term military presence in Iraq, whereas [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|"surge"]] framing implies a powerful but brief, transitory increase in intensity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/48059/ "It's Escalation, Stupid." ''Alternet''] retrieved 3 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "bad apple" frame, as in the proverb "one bad [[apple]] spoils the barrel". This frame implies that removing one underachieving or corrupt official from an [[institution]] will solve a given problem; an opposing frame presents the same problem as systematic or structural to the institution itself—a source of infectious and spreading rot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-budner/the-rumsfeld-dilemma-dem_b_29550.html "The Rumsfeld Dilemma: Demand an Exit Strategy, Not a Facelift"] by Bruce Budner, in ''The Huffington Post'' 15 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "[[taxpayers]] money" frame, rather than [[government spending|public or government funds]], which implies that individual taxpayers have a claim or right to set [[government policy]] based upon their payment of tax rather than their status as [[citizen]]s or [[voters]] and that taxpayers have a right to control public funds that are the shared property of all citizens and also privileges individual self-interest above group interest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
* The "collective property" frame, which implies that property owned by individuals is really owned by a collective in which those individuals are members. This collective can be a territorial one, such as a nation, or an abstract one that does not map to a specific territory.
* Program-names that may describe only the intended effects of a program but may also imply their effectiveness. These include the following:
** "[[Foreign aid]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://hij.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/12/2/120 "Is It All in a Word? The Effect of Issue Framing on Public Support for U.S. Spending on HIV/AIDS in Developing Countries."] by Sara Bleich. Retrieved 2007-07-03
&lt;/ref&gt; (which implies that spending money will aid foreigners, rather than harm them)
** "[[Social security]]" (which implies that the program can be relied on to provide security for a society)
** "[[Stabilisation policy]]" (which implies that a policy will have a stabilizing effect).
* Based on [[opinion polling]] and [[focus group]]s, [[ecoAmerica]], a nonprofit environmental marketing and messaging firm, has advanced the position that [[global warming]] is an ineffective framing due to its identification as a leftist advocacy issue. The organization has suggested to government officials and environmental groups that alternate formulations of the issues would be more effective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/us/politics/02enviro.html "Seeking to Save the Planet, With a Thesaurus"] article by John M. Broder in ''[[The New York Times]]'' May 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* In her 2009 book ''Frames of War'', [[Judith Butler]] argues that the justification within liberal-democracies for war, and atrocities committed in the course of war, (referring specifically to the current war in Iraq and to [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib]] and [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]]) entails a framing of the (especially Muslim) 'other' as pre-modern/primitive and ultimately not human in the same way as citizens within the liberal order.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, J. (2009), ''Frames of War'', London: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Home Energy Resources Unit''' or Home Energy Recovery Unit (HERU) is a [[prototype]] [[kitchen appliance]] which is claimed to use [[household waste]] to generate [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43643709 |title=New gadget turning waste into hot water |last=Gregory-Kumar |first=David |date=2018-04-04 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-08-28 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Household waste, both organic and inorganic, is placed into a main chamber. Plastic and cardboard packaging as well as food waste can be inserted as fuel, and the waste does not need to be sorted or separated.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.mobile.reuters.com/video/2018/07/02/machine-transforms-household-trash-into?videoId=441354971&amp;videoChannel=82|title=Machine transforms household trash into fuel|work=Reuters video|date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then goes through an eight-hour cycle. The chamber containing the waste is heated to 100° [[celsius]] to evaporate water and remove [[oxygen]]. The temperature is then increased and [[pyrolysis]] takes place. Oxygen is then re-introduced to allow [[incineration]] of the [[Pyrolysis#Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars|pyrolised waste]] for [[water heating]]. After eight hours, a tankful of stored hot water is produced, and all plastic, cardboard and organic waste is reduced to [[gas]] and [[ash]]. The gas is then used in a domestic [[boiler]], and the ash can be flushed safely into an ordinary sewage system. Any glass or metal waste is left in a [[thermal cleaning|clean state]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43643709|title=New kitchen appliance turning rubbish into hot water|website=BBC.co.uk|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/04/personal-incinerators-are-one-mans-vision-of-the-future/|title=Personal Incinerators Are One Man's Vision of the Future|website=Gizmodo.co.uk|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14329">{{hatnote|This article concerns the discipline of intellectual history, and not its object, the whole span of human thought. For clarifications about the [[Global intellectual history|latter topic]], please consult the writings of the [[Intellectual history#Prominent individuals|intellectual historians listed here]] and entries on individual thinkers.}}

'''Intellectual history''' refers to the [[historiography]] of ideas and thinkers.  This [[history]] cannot be considered without the knowledge of the humans who created, discussed, wrote about, and in other ways were concerned with ideas. Intellectual history as practiced by [[historian]]s is parallel to the [[history of philosophy]] as done by philosophers, and is more akin to the [[history of ideas]]. Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them, and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture, lives, and historical contexts that produced them.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, "The history of ideas: Precept and practice, 1950-2000 and beyond." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 67#1 (2006): 1-32. [http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context. The term "context" in the preceding sentence is ambiguous: it can be political, cultural, intellectual, and social. One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context (for example, as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time) or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment (for example, as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place). Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do, nor are they exclusive. Generally speaking, intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts.

It is important to realize that intellectual history is not just the history of intellectuals. It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts, and as such is different from other forms of [[cultural history]] which deal also with visual and other non-verbal forms of evidence. Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history. The concept of the "[[intellectual]]" is relatively recent, and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought. Instead, anyone who has put pen to paper to explore his or her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history. A famous example of an intellectual history of a non-canonical thinker is [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s study of a 16th-century Italian miller, [[Menocchio]], in his seminal work ''The Cheese and the Worms''.

Although the field emerged from European disciplines of ''[[Kulturgeschichte]]'' and ''[[Geistesgeschichte]]'', the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions but others as well, including those in other parts of the world. Increasingly, historians are calling for a [[Global intellectual history]] that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies. Another important trend has been the [[history of the book]] and of reading, which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed, produced, distributed, and read.

==Intellectual historiography==
Intellectual history as a self-conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has precedents, however, in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of ideas]], and in [[cultural history]] as practiced since [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] or indeed since [[Voltaire]]. The history of the human mind, as it was called in the eighteenth century, was of great concern to scholars and philosophers, and their efforts can in part be traced to [[Francis Bacon]]’s call for what he termed a literary history in his [[The Advancement of Learning]]. In economics, [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) was both a historian of economic thought himself,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''Essays in Biography'', Macmillan, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subject of study by historians of economic thought because of the significance of the [[Keynesian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt; E.g. [[Peter Clarke (historian)]], ''The Keynesian Revolution in the Making, 1924-1936'', 1988. [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period, in its earlier incarnation as "the [[history of ideas]]" under the leadership of [[Arthur Lovejoy]], the founder of the [[Journal of the History of Ideas]]. Since that time, Lovejoy's formulation of "unit-ideas" has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity, and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase [[history of ideas]] by ''intellectual history''.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter,  "Begriffsgeschichte and the History of Ideas." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1987): 247-263. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709557 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history includes the history of thought in many disciplines, such as the [[history of philosophy]], and the [[history of economic thought]]. Analytical concepts - such as the nature of paradigms and the causes of paradigm shifts - have been borrowed from the study of other disciplines, exemplified by the use of the ideas of [[Thomas Kuhn]] about [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] to explain revolutions in thought in economics and other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt; E.g. Ghanshyam Mehta, ''The structure of the Keynesian Revolution'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the [[history of political thought]] has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|historians at Cambridge]], such as  [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[Quentin Skinner]]. They studied European political thought in its historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom. Skinner in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays, which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines, and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter, "Reconstructing the history of political languages: Pocock, Skinner, and the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe." History and Theory (1990): 38-70. [http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/122486/bdf9f28ccd0e5fa91c1b6dae307c0eed.pdf?sequence=1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output, not just the history of political ideas, and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought, associated especially with [[Anthony Grafton]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Formalized in 2010, the History and Culture Ph.D. at [[Drew University]] is one of a few graduate programs in the US currently specializing in intellectual history, both in its American and European contexts. Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the [[Renaissance]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic. Prominent examples of such work include [[Louis Menand]]'s ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' and [[Martin Jay]]'s ''[[The Dialectical Imagination]]''.

In continental Europe, equivalents of intellectual history can be found. An example is [[Reinhart Koselleck]]’s ''Begriffsgeschichte'' (history of concepts), though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo-American intellectual historians.

'''Joseph "Holy Joe" Wingate Folk''' (October 28, 1869 – May 28, 1923) was an American lawyer, reformer, and politician from [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He was [[Governor of Missouri]] from 1905 to 1909.

==Early life and education==
Joseph Folk was born in [[Brownsville, Tennessee]] to Henry Bate and Martha Estes Folk and raised in a strict [[Baptist]] household. His early education was completed at Brownsville Academy, after which he worked for several companies in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] as a clerk and bookkeeper. Folk studied law and graduated from [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1890. He joined his father's law firm and focused on criminal law.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite book|last=Piott|first=Steven L.|title=Dictionary of Missouri Biography|year=1999|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia, MO|isbn=0-8262-1222-0|pages=307–310|editor=Lawrence O. Christensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career, Folk ran for a seat in the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] in 1892, wrote newspaper articles, spoke on special occasions, and joined the [[Knights of Pythias]]. In 1893, he moved to St. Louis to join his uncle's law practice. Folk married Gertrude Glass on November 10, 1896. He helped to organize the Jefferson Club, a local young Democrats' organization, and acted as the group's president in 1898–1899.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

==St. Louis career==
Folk made his reputation as a lawyer for transit workers in the [[St. Louis Streetcar Strike of 1900]]. His work as mediator earned him a Democratic nomination for circuit attorney in 1900, and he won the election against Judge Eugene Mcquillen.

Folk earned his nickname by attacking local corruption and party machines. With the assistance of [[Lincoln Steffens]]'s articles published in ''[[McClure's]]'' magazine, Folk led investigations of the city's Democratic boss, Col. [[Edward Butler (American politician)|Ed Butler]] and the corrupt "boodle ring" of corporate bribery in the state and municipal government.&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Goodwin, The Bully Pulpit (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2013) pp. 370–378&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the convictions Folk obtained were overturned on appeal, his work had national and international consequences. Folk gained the respect of Republican President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as he and other crusading prosecutors and [[muckraking]] journalists brought national attention to municipal corruption. Folk's prosecution of the Suburban Railway Company stimulated a change in US treaties with [[Mexico]] to include bribery as grounds for extradition. As district attorney, Folk encountered opposition from many businessmen and politicians, who believed that his exposing corrupt practices hurt the city's reputation, and thus the Democratic party as well as the business climate.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

==Governor==
Folk was elected the [[List of Governors of Missouri|31st Governor of Missouri]] as a progressive reformer and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[Missouri gubernatorial election, 1904|1904 election]]. In the governor's office, he advocated the "Missouri Idea", the concept of Missouri as a leader in public morality through popular control of law and strict enforcement. His administration found initial success despite opposition and successfully conducted antitrust prosecutions, ended gratis railroad passes for state officials, extended bribery statues, improved election laws, required formal registration for lobbyists, made racetrack gambling illegal, and enforced the Sunday-closing law. The latter half of Folk's gubernatorial term found a Democratically controlled General Assembly, in large part due to Folk's reforms. The governor was able to enact further legislation, including an initiative and referendum amendment to the [[Constitution of Missouri]], and further regulation of elections, education, employment and child labor, railroads, food, business, and public utilities. A number of examiner boards and commissions were established during Folk's administration, including many agricultural boards and the Missouri library commission.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

==Later career==
Following his gubernatorial term, Folk's focus on morality and unwillingness to compromise eventually made him politically unpopular, and his initial attempts for a senate nomination were unsuccessful. He returned to law practice, toured as a [[Chautauqua]] speaker, and campaigned for [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Wilson appointed Folk as a solicitor for the [[US State Department]], where he investigated major railroad companies. In 1918, he was able to win a Democratic nomination for the [[US Senate]], but lost in the election. After a brief stint at the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce, Folk opened a private law office in [[Washington, D.C.]] He arbitrated in several international negotiations.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

Folk experienced a nervous breakdown in March 1922, believed to be from overwork.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt; He died aged 54 in 1923 in [[New York City]], and is buried at the Oakwood Cemetery in [[Brownsville, Tennessee]].

'''Lahontan cutthroat trout''' (''Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi'') is the largest [[subspecies]] of [[cutthroat trout]], and the [[List of U.S. state fish|state fish]] of [[Nevada]]. It is one of three subspecies of cutthroat trout that are listed as [[Endangered Species Act|federally threatened]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lahontan cutthroat trout |publisher=U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Nevada Office |url=http://www.fws.gov/nevada/protected_species/fish/species/lct.html |accessdate=2012-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural history==
[[File:lahontan pyramid.jpg|thumb |right |250px |Lahontan cutthroat trout, lake form, from [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], [[Nevada]].]]
[[File:Informal Remarks of the President in Imlay, Nevada - NARA - 197812.tif|250px |right |thumb |1938 remarks by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|FDR]] on the taste of Nevada trout.]]

The Lahontan cutthroat is native to the drainages of the [[Truckee River]], [[Humboldt River]], [[Carson River]], [[Walker River (Nevada)|Walker River]], [[Quinn River]] and several smaller rivers in the [[Great Basin]] of [[North America]].&lt;ref name=Behnke&gt;{{cite book |title=Native Trout of Western North America |author=Robert J. Behnke |location=Bethesda, Maryland |publisher=American Fisheries Society Press |year=1992 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iMWAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=lahontan#search_anchor |accessdate=2012-10-27 |isbn=9780913235799 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were tributaries of ancient [[Lake Lahontan]] during the [[ice age]]s until the lake shrank to remnants such as [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]] and [[Walker Lake (Nevada)|Walker Lake]] about 7,000 years ago, although [[Lake Tahoe]]&amp;mdash;from which the Truckee flows to Pyramid Lake&amp;mdash;is still a large mountain lake.

Lahontan cutthroats evolved into a large (up to 1 m or 39 in) and moderately long-lived predator of [[Tui chub|chub]], [[Catostomidae|suckers]], and other fish as long as 30 or {{convert|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.  The trout was able to remain a predator in the larger remnant lakes where [[prey fish]] continued to flourish, but upstream populations were forced to adapt to eating smaller fish and insects.  Some experts consider ''O. c. henshawi'' in the upper [[Humboldt River]] and tributaries to be a separate subspecies, ''O. clarkii humboldtensis'' or the [[Humboldt cutthroat trout]], adapted to living in small streams rather than large lakes.&lt;ref name=BT&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume=68 |number=1 |title=The case for ''humboldtensis'': A subspecies name for the indigenous cutthroat trout, ''Oncorhynchus clarkii'' of the Humboldt River, Upper Quinn River, and Coyote Basin Drainages, Nevada and Oregon |authors= Trotter, Patrick C. and [[Robert J. Behnke|Behnke, Robert J.]] |publisher=|pages=58–65 |year=2008 |jstor=41717657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record size cutthroat trout of any subspecies was a Lahontan caught in Pyramid Lake weighing {{convert|41|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}, although anecdotal and photographic evidence exists of even larger fish from this lake.

==Human history==
The Lahontan cutthroats of Pyramid and Walker Lakes were of considerable importance to the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] tribe. These trout, as well as [[cui-ui]], a sucker found only in Pyramid Lake, were dietary mainstays and were used by other tribes in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fishes of the Great Basin |authors=William F. Sigler and John W. Sigler |location=Reno, Nevada |publisher=University of Nevada Press |year=1987 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZC2dAGvtjQC&amp;dq=%22Gasterosteidae%22&amp;q=pyramid+lake#v=snippet&amp;q=paiute&amp;f=false |accessdate=2012-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[John C. Frémont]] and [[Kit Carson]] ascended the [[Truckee River]] on January 16, 1844, they called it the 'Salmon Trout River', after the huge Lahontan cutthroat trout that ran up the river from Pyramid Lake to spawn.&lt;ref name=Fremont&gt;{{cite book |title=Narrative of the exploring expedition to the Rocky mountains: in the year 1842, and to Oregon and north California in the years 1843-44 |author=John Charles Fremont |year=1847 |publisher=Hall &amp; Dickson |page=309 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-ZKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413&amp;dq=beaver+dam+rocky+mountains+altitude#v=onepage&amp;q=salmon%20trout%20river&amp;f=false |accessdate=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American settlement in the Great Basin nearly [[Extinction|extirpated]] these remarkable fish. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Lahontan cutthroats were caught in tremendous numbers and shipped to towns and [[California Gold Rush|mining camps]] throughout the West; estimates have ranged as high as {{convert|1000000|lb|kg|-4|abbr=on}} annually between 1860 and 1920. A dam in [[Mason Valley (Nevada)|Mason Valley]] blocked spawning runs from Walker Lake. By 1905, [[Derby Dam]] on the Truckee River below [[Reno]] interfered with Pyramid Lake's spawning runs. A poorly designed [[fish ladder]] washed away in 1907, then badly timed [[Newlands Reclamation Act|water diversions]] to farms in the [[Fallon, Nevada]], area stranded spawning fish and desiccated eggs below the dam. By 1943, Pyramid Lake's population was extinct. Lake Tahoe's population was extinct by 1930 from competition and inbreeding with introduced [[rainbow trout]] (creating [[cutbow]]s), predation by introduced [[lake trout]], and diseases introduced along with these exotic species.

Upstream populations have been isolated and decimated by poorly managed [[Managed intensive grazing|grazing]] and excessive water withdrawals for [[irrigation]], as well as by [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]], competition, and predation by non-native [[salmonid]]s. This is important, as although Lahontan cutthroat trout can inhabit either lakes or streams, they are obligatory stream spawners.&lt;ref name=Register&gt;{{cite journal |title=90-Day Finding on a Petition To Delist the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout |author=Nevada Fish and Wildlife Office |publisher=Federal Register |volume=73 |number=175 |date=2008-09-09 |url=http://www.fws.gov/nevada/protected_species/fish/documents/lct/090908_lct_fed_reg.pdf |accessdate=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyramid Lake and Truckee River water quality==
Pyramid Lake, the second-largest natural lake in the western U.S. prior to construction of the [[Derby Dam]], which diverted water from the lake, has been the focus of several water quality investigations, the most detailed starting in the mid-1980s. Under direction of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] a comprehensive dynamic [[hydrology transport model]], the Dynamic Stream Simulation and Assessment Model ([[DSSAM]]), was applied to analyze impacts of a variety of land use and wastewater management decisions throughout the {{convert|3120|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} [[Truckee River]] Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River |author=C. Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau of Earth Metrics Inc. |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series |location=Washington D.C. |year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses allowed more competent decisions to be made regarding the watersheds, as well as management of treated effluent discharged to the Truckee River.

==Conservation==
Lahontan cutthroat trout currently occupy a small fraction of their historic range. The primary obstacle to their recovery is non-native salmonid predation by [[brook trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis'') on [[fluvial]] cutthroat and [[lake trout]] (''Salvelinus namaycush'') on [[lacustrine]] cutthroat.&lt;ref name=Behnke/&gt; Also, hybridization of cutthroat with non-native [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') continues to threaten recovery of the pure Lahontan cutthroat. Only [[Independence Lake (California)|Independence Lake]] has continuously harbored its historic native Lahontan cutthroat population, although precariously low spawner numbers there have recently increased along with five years of brook trout removal.&lt;ref name=Independence&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effect of Brook Trout Removal from a Spawning Stream on an Adfluvial Population of Lahontan Cutthroat Trout |authors=G. Gary Scoppettone, Peter H. Rissler, Sean P. Shea, William Somer |journal=North American Journal of Fisheries Management |pages=586–596 |volume=32 |number=3 |year=2012 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02755947.2012.675958 |accessdate=28 October 2012 |doi=10.1080/02755947.2012.675958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyramid and Walker Lakes have been restocked with fish captured in [[Summit Lake (Nevada)]] and Lake Heenan, and those populations are maintained by fish [[Hatchery|hatcheries]]. Unfortunately, the Summit Lake strain does not live as long or grow as large as the original strain of fish. However, in the 1970s, fish believed to have been stocked almost a century ago from the Pyramid Lake strain were discovered in a small stream along the [[Pilot Peak (Nevada)|Pilot Peak]] area of western Utah border, and are a genetic match to the original strain. This Pilot Peak strain is now integral to the reintroduction and planting programs maintained by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bringing Home the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout |author=Mike Caltagirone |journal=Blood Knot Magazine |date=2010-01-19 |url=http://bloodknot.net/?p=1667 |accessdate=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation of highly complementary habitats is crucial for survival of the different age classes of cutthroat trout, with clean gravels needed for spawning, slow-moving side channel habitats used by juvenile fish, and deeper pool habitats such as beaver ponds for larger adult fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Complementation of Habitats for Bonneville Cutthroat Trout in Watersheds Influenced by Beavers, Livestock, and Drought |authors=Seth M. White, Frank J. Rahel |journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society |volume=137 |pages=881–894 |year=2008 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1577/T06-207.1 |accessdate=2012-10-28 |doi=10.1577/T06-207.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were classified as an [[endangered species]] between 1970 and 1975, then the classification was relaxed to [[threatened species]] in 1975, and reaffirmed as threatened in 2008.&lt;ref name=Register/&gt;

Although Lahontan cutthroat trout stand little chance of surviving for long in [[Lake Tahoe]], the [[Nevada Department of Wildlife]] (NDOW) planted them instead of rainbow trout on the lake's Nevada shore in summer 2011. The goal is to enable anglers to catch Lake Tahoe's native trout for the first time since 1939. The California state record was caught in Lake Tahoe in 1911 by William Pomin, weighing in at an impressive {{convert|31|lb|kg|abbr=out}}, {{convert|8|oz|g|abbr=out}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reintroduction of Lahontan cutthroat trout should benefit anglers |author=Bruce Ajari |newspaper=Tahoe Daily Tribune |date=2011-08-11 |url=http://www.tahoedailytribune.com/article/20110811/NEWS/110819959 |accessdate=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it tolerates water too [[alkaline]] for other trout, Lahontan cutthroats are stocked in alkaline lakes outside its native range, including [[Lake Lenore (Washington)|Lake Lenore]] (alternately Lenore Lake), [[Grimes Lake]] and [[Omak Lake]] in central [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/may/11/lahontans-still-thrive-at-lake-lenore-despite-net/|title=Lahontans still thrive at Lake Lenore despite net poaching|author=Rich Landers|date=11 May 2016|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mann Lake]]&lt;ref name="Sheehan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Madelynne Diness|title=Fishing in Oregon: The Complete Oregon Fishing Guide|edition=10th|publisher=Flying Pencil Publications|location=Scappoose, Oregon|pages=282&amp;ndash;83|isbn=0-916473-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Oregon's [[Alvord Desert]] east of [[Steens Mountain]].

In [[physiology]], [[psychology]], or [[psychophysics]], a '''limen''' or a '''liminal point''' is a [[sensory threshold|threshold]] of a physiological or psychological response. It is the boundary of perception. On one side of a limen (or threshold) a stimulus is perceivable, on the other side it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jameson K. |last1=Holden|first2= Eric M. |last2=Francisco|first3= Zheng |last3=Zhang|first4=Cristina |last4=Baric|first5= Mark |last5=Tommerdahl|title=An Undergraduate Laboratory Exercise to Study Weber’s Law|journal=Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education|volume=9|issue=2|pages=71-74|date=2011|pmid=23493843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liminal''', as an adjective, means situated at a sensory threshold, hence barely perceptible. Subliminal means below perception.
The [[absolute threshold]] is the lowest amount of sensation detectable by a sense organ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7989">'''Livestock Keepers' Rights''' are a bundle of [[rights]] that would support the survival of small-scale livestock keepers such as [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]], smallholders and family farms in a general policy environment that favours large-scale [[Intensive animal farming|industrial modes of livestock production]].

The term "Livestock Keepers' Rights" was coined during the [http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsummit/english/index.html World Food Summit] in 2002 by [[civil society]] attending the Forum for [[Food sovereignty|Food Sovereignty]] to flag the role of livestock keepers in animal genetic resource management. It alluded to "Farmers' Rights" as known from the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] that had been recently concluded.

== Background ==

Between . 2003 and 2007, a large number of grassroots consultations were carried out by and with livestock keeping communities to define the term more closely. These consultations took place in Kenya "Karen Comittment"), India, Italy ("Bellagio Brief") and Ethiopia ("Addis Résumé")  and involved about 500 representatives of livestock keeping communities from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe. They identified 7 cornerstones of "Livestock Keepers' Rights" that would enable livestock keepers to continue playing their role as guardians of [[biological diversity]].

During this process, Livestock Keepers’ Rights were elaborated into a much more comprehensive concept than Farmers’ Rights. Rather than representing legal rights, they correspond to development principles that would help livestock keepers continue to conserve biodiversity and [[Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|animal genetic resources]].

== Principles and Rights ==
During a workshop with legal experts held in [[Kalk Bay]], [[South Africa]] in December 2008, the rights were further refined and subdivided into principles and rights:

'''Principle 1:'''
''Livestock Keepers are creators of breeds and custodians of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. ''

'''Principle 2:'''
''Livestock Keepers and the sustainable use of traditional breeds are dependent on the conservation of their respective ecosystems. ''

'''Principle 3:'''
''Traditional breeds represent collective property, products of indigenous knowledge and cultural expression of Livestock Keepers.''

Based on these principles articulated and implicit in existing legal instruments and international agreements, Livestock Keepers from traditional livestock keeping communities and/or adhering to ecological principles of animal production, shall be given the following Livestock Keepers' Rights:

# ''Livestock Keepers have the right to make breeding decisions and breed the breeds they maintain.''
# ''Livestock Keepers shall have the right to participate in policy formulation and implementation processes on animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. ''
# ''Livestock Keepers shall have the right to appropriate training and capacity building and equal access to relevant services enabling and supporting them to raise livestock and to better process and market their products. ''
# ''Livestock Keepers shall have the right to participate in the identification of research needs and research design with respect to their genetic resources, as is mandated by the principle of [[Informed consent|Prior Informed Consent]].''
# ''Livestock Keepers shall have the right to effectively access information on issues related to their local breeds and livestock diversity.''

== Declaration on Rights ==

The workshop also resulted in a Declaration on Livestock Keepers Rights that references the individual principles and rights to existing international legal frameworks such as the UN [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]], the [http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a1404e/a1404e00.htm Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources] and the Interlaken Declaration on Animal Genetic Resources, as well as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], the [[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]], the Convention (No. 169) concerning [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries]], the [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]], and other pertinent legal agreements.

The Declaration on Livestock Keepers’ Rights was signed by a large number of individuals and organizations. At an International Technical Expert Workshop on [http://www.cbd.int/abs/ Access and Benefit Sharing] in Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, that was held in Wageningen in the Netherlands from 8–10 December 2010, it was decided that Livestock Keepers’ Rights should be addressed. At another workshop on rights to animal genetic resources that was held in Bern (Switzerland) on 20 June 2011, Livestock Keepers’ Rights were contrasted with Animal Breeders Rights.In July 2011,at a side-event during the 13th session of the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA) held at FAO in Rome, the concept of Livestock Keepers' Rights was introduced and supported by government officials.

'''MIVILUDES''' (an acronym for the [[French language|French-language]] phrase ''Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires'', i.e. "Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances") is a [[France|French]] [[government agency]], with responsibility for monitoring groups perceived &lt;!-- perceived by whom exactly ? --&gt; to constitute a threat to public order or that violate French law, coordinating the government response, informing the public about potential risks, and assisting victims. The agency was created in 2002.

==Functions==
The mission of MIVILUDES involves analysing "the phenomenon of movements with a [[cult]]ic character whose actions affront the [[rights of man]] and  fundamental liberties, or which constitute a threat to public order or which are contrary to the laws and regulations".&lt;ref&gt;From the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|Journal Officiel]]'' of 28 November 2002, quoted in [[:fr:Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires|Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires]] : ''Sa mission est définie officiellement (dans le Journal Officiel du 28 novembre 2002) comme étant d'analyser « le phénomène des mouvements à caractère sectaire dont les agissements sont attentatoires aux droits de l'homme et aux libertés fondamentales ou constituent une menace à l'ordre public ou sont contraires aux lois et règlements ».''&lt;/ref&gt;

MIVILUDES provides information related to "cultic deviances" to the media, the French government, and individual members of the public. It recommends contacts and other organizations, and produces and archives documentation and discussion papers on groups considered cults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=plan Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101013811/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=plan |date=2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Background===
The French authorities created MIVILUDES as the successor to MILS (''Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes''; English: "Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Cults"), which itself functioned from 7 October 1998 as the successor to the ''Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes'' established on 9 May 1996. These organisations were in charge of co-ordinating government monitoring of cults. 

In February 1998, MILS, headed by [[Alain Vivien]], released its annual report on their monitoring of cults in France. The operations of MILS, and Alain Vivien's background as the head of an [[Anti-Cult Movement|anti-cult organization]] (he had served as President of the [[Centre Roger Ikor]] from 1997 to 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ccmm.asso.fr/index.php3 |title=Centre de documentation, d'éducation et d'action Contre les Manipulations Mentales |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127111947/http://www.ccmm.asso.fr/index.php3 |archivedate=2007-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), had occasionally received criticism from several human-rights organizations, such as the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf-hr.org/viewbinary/viewhtml.php?doc_id=1797 |title=Open Letter to Alain Vivien about Religious Freedom in France |date=June 15, 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504010205/http://www.ihf-hr.org/viewbinary/viewhtml.php?doc_id=1797 |archivedate=May 4, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} a US government agency. (See also [[About-Picard law#Reactions]]). In January 1999 Vivien requested and received police protection following threats and the burglary of his home.&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Humanité]], January 14, 1999; {{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-01-14/1999-01-14-441385 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430103350/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-01-14/1999-01-14-441385 |archivedate=2005-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivien resigned in June 2002 under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cesnur.org/2002/fr_vivien.htm Alain Vivien Resigns from President of the French Anti-Cult Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MIVILUDES===
MIVILUDES was created by a [[President of the French Republic|president]]ial decree on 28 November 2002. [[Jean-Louis Langlais]], a senior civil-servant at the [[Ministry of the Interior]], served as its president from 2002 to 2005.&lt;ref name="miviludes.gouv.fr"&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?article138&amp;iddiv=2 Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013110316/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?article138&amp;iddiv=2 |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Announcing the formation of MIVILUDES, the French government acknowledged the criticism that MILS had received from outside France for certain activities that could be considered in violation of [[religious freedom]]. The decree establishing MIVILUDES&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?rubrique162&amp;iddiv=1 Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026085807/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?rubrique162&amp;iddiv=1 |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
referred to MILS only indirectly in announcing the abrogation (in Article 8) of the decree establishing MILS. 

In an interview in March 2003, Langlais categorised the fight as not against "sects", but against "sectarian deviances". He stated that current French law lacks a definition for a "sect" and, therefore "the law cannot define sectarian deviances". Nevertheless, he portrayed the role of MIVILUDES as contributing to "defining what could simply be an administrative jurisprudence".&lt;ref&gt;'France and "cults": a new orientation' - Interview with Jean-Louis Langlais, by Willy Fautré. ''Compass Direct'', 5 April 2003. [http://www.religioscope.info/article_138.shtml Available online; retrieved 2007-01-28 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 report by the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] concluded with an assessment that the restructuring of the main French agency concerned with this issue — referring to MILS being replaced by MIVILUDES — had improved religious freedoms in France.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Michel Roulet became president of MIVILUDES in October 2005,&lt;ref name="miviludes.gouv.fr"/&gt; followed by [[Georges Fenech]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/-Historique-?iddiv=2 Historique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507073958/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/-Historique-?iddiv=2 |date=2011-05-07 }}//La MIVILUDES&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{Lang|la|Mater semper certa est}}''' ("The mother is always certain") is a [[Roman law|Roman-law]]  principle which has the power of {{Lang|la|[[conclusive presumption|praesumptio iuris et de iure]]}}, meaning that no counter-evidence can be made against this principle (literally: Presumed there is no counter evidence and by the law). Its meaning is that the mother of the child is always known.&lt;ref name="ZweigertDrobnig1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. Zweigert|author2=K. Drobnig|title=International Encyclopedia of Comparative Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKPET7pA_4MC&amp;pg=PA28|date=1 January 1991|publisher=BRILL|pages=28–|id=GGKEY:1LUWFFPE9KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1978, when the first child was conceived by the technique of [[In vitro fertilisation|''in-vitro'' fertilization]], the principle of {{Lang|la|Mater semper certa est}} no longer applies, since a child may have a ''genetic'' and a ''natural'' ("[[birth]]") mother who are different individuals. Since then some countries have converted the old natural law to an equivalent [[Codification (law)|codified law]] - in 1997 Germany introduced paragraph 1571 {{Lang|de|Mutterschaft}} ("motherhood") of the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] ([[civil code]]) reading {{Lang|de|Mutter eines Kindes ist die Frau, die es geboren hat}} ("the mother of a child is the woman who gave birth to it"). 

The Roman law principle however does not stop at the mother, in fact it continues with {{Lang|la|pater semper incertus est}} ("The father is always uncertain"). This was regulated by the law of {{Lang|la|pater est, quem nuptiae demonstrant}} ("the father is he to whom marriage points"). Essentially [[paternity fraud]] had originally been a marriage fraud in the civil code&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In Germany, the historic {{Lang|de|Ehelichkeitsanfechtungsklage}} ("action in dispute of legitimacy") was simply renamed as {{Lang|de|Vaterschaftsanfechtungsklage}} ("action in dispute of fatherhood") when [[paternity (law)|legal paternity]] was redefined.{{CN|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to this principle. Today some married fathers use the modern tools of [[DNA testing]] to ensure a certainty on their fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580398-1,00.html | work=Time Magazine U.S. | location= | title=Duped Dads Fight Back | date=19 January 2007 | first=Julie | last=Rawe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''matrix field''' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] with [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] as elements. In [[field (mathematics)|field theory]] we come across two type of fields: [[finite field]] and [[infinite set|infinite]] field. There are several examples of matrix fields of finite and infinite order. In general, corresponding to each field of numbers there is a matrix field. 

There is a finite matrix field of order ''p'' for each positive [[prime]]&amp;nbsp;''p''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pandey|first1=S. K.|title=Matrix Field of Finite and Infinite Order|journal=International Research Journal of Pure Algebra|volume=5|issue=12|pages=214–216 | year=2015 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can find several finite matrix field of [[order theory|order]] p for any given positive prime p. In general, corresponding to each finite field there is a matrix field. However any two finite fields of equal order are algebraically equivalent. The [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of a [[finite field]] can be represented by matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| | last=Lidl | first=Rudolf | last2=Niederreiter | first2=Harald | author2-link = Harald Niederreiter | title=Introduction to finite fields and their applications| edition=1st | year=1986 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=0-521-30706-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way one can construct a finite matrix field.

Contrary to the general case for matrix multiplication, multiplication is [[commutative property|commutative]] in a matrix field (if the usual operations are used). Since addition and multiplication of matrices have all needed properties for field operations except for commutativity of multiplication, one way to verify if a set of matrices is a field with the usual operations of matrix sum and multiplication is to check wether 

# the neutral elements for sum and multiplication (that is, the [[zero matrix]] and the [[identity matrix]]) are included; 
# the set is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition and multiplication; and 
# multiplication is commutative. 

However, it may be possible to construct fields of matrices using other operations -- in which case it would be necessary to verify all properties of the operations in the set in order to guarantee that it is a field.

==Examples==
1. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[diagonal matrices]] of [[square matrix|order]] n over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[rational]] ([[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]]) [[number]]s is a matrix field of infinite order under [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of matrices.

2. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all diagonal matrices of order two over the field of [[integer]]s modulo ''p'' (a positive prime) forms a finite matrix field of order ''p'' under [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of matrices modulo ''p''.

3. (a negative example) It does not suffice for multiplication to commute in order to obtain a field of matrices. Take the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a      &amp; a      &amp; \cdots &amp; a \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;a\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; -- that is, matrices filled with zeroes except for the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th row, which is filled with the same real constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
These matrices are commutative for multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a      &amp; a      &amp; \cdots &amp; a \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
b      &amp; b      &amp; \cdots &amp; b \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}
b      &amp; b      &amp; \cdots &amp; b \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a      &amp; a      &amp; \cdots &amp; a \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
ab      &amp; ab      &amp; \cdots &amp; ab \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

However, there is no neutral element for multiplication, since this needs to be the identity matrix, and it is not included in the set, so this is ''not'' a matrix field.

4. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all matrices of order two of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
over the [[real number|real numbers]] (or over any other [[field (mathematics)|field]]), with the usual operations of matrix sum and matrix multiplication.
The zero matrix (&lt;math&gt;a=b=0&lt;/math&gt;) and the identity matrix (&lt;math&gt;a=1, b=0&lt;/math&gt;) are included. Summing two of these matrices results in another matrix of the same form:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
x &amp; yc \\
y &amp; x
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a+x &amp; c(b+y) \\
b+y &amp; a+x
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The same is true for multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x &amp; yc \\
y &amp; x
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
bcy+ax &amp; c(ay+bx) \\
ay+bx  &amp; bcy+ax
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, multiplication is commutative for these matrices:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x &amp; yc \\
y &amp; x
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
bcy+ax &amp; c(ay+bx) \\
ay+bx  &amp; bcy+ax
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
x &amp; yc \\
y &amp; x
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

5. As a particular case of example 4, taking &lt;math&gt;c=-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; ranging over the reals, one obtains the field of matrices of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; -b \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
which is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[complex number|complex numbers]]: &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the real part of the number, while &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; correspods to the imaginary part. So the number &lt;math&gt;2+3i&lt;/math&gt;, for example, would be represented as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; -3 \\
3 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
One can easily verify, for example, that &lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}^2
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
and also, by computing a [[matrix exponential]], that [[euler's identity|Euler's identity, &lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi}=-1&lt;/math&gt;]] is also valid:
:&lt;math&gt;
e^{\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\pi &amp; 0 \\
0   &amp; \pi
\end{pmatrix}}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
6. As another particular case of example 4, a field of matrices 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; [[square-free element|square-free]] and &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; rationals is isomorphic to the [[quadratic field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{c}]&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''maximum power principle''' or '''Lotka's principle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilley |first1=David Rogers |title=Howard T. Odum’s contribution to the laws of energy |journal=Ecological Modelling |date=2004 |volume=178 |pages=121–125 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.032 |url=http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/extensao/davidtilley-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed as the fourth [[Principles of energetics|principle of energetics]] in [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[thermodynamics]], where an example of an open system is a biological cell. According to [[Howard T. Odum]], "The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Odum 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer [[Myron Tribus]].

While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Vito Volterra|Volterra]] and Ludwig [[Boltzmann]], for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy.  In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum.

The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], where, as Gilliland (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as [[energy analysis]], itself associated with [[net energy]] and [[EROEI]], arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the [[energy unit]] to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or [[energy types]]), b)  the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment.

==Philosophy and theory==
Lotka said (1922b: 151): 
{{cquote|The principle of natural selection reveals itself as capable of yielding information which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are not competent to furnish. The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are, of course, insufficient to determine the course of events in a physical system. They tell us that certain things cannot happen, but they do not tell us what does happen.}}

Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory:
{{cquote|That theory, as it is expressed by the maximum power principle, addresses the empirical question of why systems of any type or size organize themselves into the patterns observed. Such a question assumes that physical laws govern system function. It does not assume, for example, that the system comprising economic production is driven by consumers; rather that the whole cycle of production-consumption is structured and driven by physical laws.}}

This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the [[second law efficiency]] of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: "the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power" (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101):

{{cquote|Neither the first or second law of thermodynamics include a measure of the rate at which energy transformations or processes occur. The concept of maximum power incorporates time into measures of energy transformations. It provides information about the rate at which one kind of energy is transformed into another as well as the efficiency of that transformation.}} 
     
In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological [[evolution]]. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;62):

{{cquote|Lotka provided the theory of natural selection as a maximum power organizer; under competitive conditions systems are selected which use their energies in various structural-developing actions so as to maximize their use of available energies. By this theory systems of cycles which drain less energy lose out in comparative development. However Leopold and Langbein have shown that streams in developing erosion profiles, meander systems, and tributary networks disperse their potential energies more slowly than if their channels were more direct. These two statements might be harmonized by an optimum efficiency maximum power principle (Odum and Pinkerton 1955), which indicates that energies which are converted too rapidly into heat are not made available to the systems own use because they are not fed back through storages into useful pumping, but instead do random stirring of the environment.}}

The Odum–Pinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply [[Ohm's law]] – and the associated [[maximum power theorem]] (a result in [[electric power|electrical power]] systems) – to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined "power" in electronic terms as the rate of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], where Work is understood as a "[[Thermodynamic free energy|useful energy]] transformation". &lt;!-- (In electrical engineering and physics, "[[Power (physics)|power]]" is defined as the rate of doing work or consuming energy, without any distinction between "useful energy" and any other energy.) --&gt;The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the '''''maximum''' rate of '''useful''' energy transformation''. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an [[Analogical models|analogical view]] which sees the world as an ecological-electronic-economic engine.

==Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law==
{{quotation|It has been pointed out by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] that the fundamental object of contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.|A.J. Lotka 1922a, p. 147}}

{{quotation|...it seems to this author appropriate to unite the biological and physical traditions by giving the Darwinian principle of natural selection the citation as the ''fourth law of thermodynamics'', since it is the controlling principle in rate of heat generation and efficiency settings in irreversible biological processes.|H.T. Odum 1963, p. 437}}

{{quotation|...it may be time to recognize the maximum power principle as the fourth thermodynamic law as suggested by Lotka.|H.T. Odum 1994}}

==Definition in words==
{{cquote|The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency. (H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311)}}

{{cquote|...the maximum power principle ... states that systems which maximize their flow of energy survive in competition. In other words, rather than merely accepting the fact that more energy per unit of time is transformed in a process which operates at maximum power, this principle says that systems organize and structure themselves naturally to maximize power. Systems regulate themselves according to the maximum power principle. Over time, the systems which maximize power are selected for whereas those that do not are selected against and eventually eliminated. ... Odum argues ... that the free market mechanisms of the economy effectively do the same thing for human systems and that our economic evolution to date is a product of that selection process. (Gilliland 1978, pp. 101–102)}}

Odum et al. viewed the [[maximum power theorem]] as a principle of '''power-efficiency reciprocity selection''' with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high-quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 541): "in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, "The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source." (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the [[Atwood machine]] as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power.

=== Mathematical definition ===
The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the [[maximum power theorem]] article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see [[Howard T. Odum#Ecological analog of Ohm.27s Law|Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law]])

==Contemporary ideas==
Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of [[microbiological]] systems, [[economic systems]], [[planet]]ary systems, and [[astrophysical]] systems. He called this corollary the '''[[Maximum empower#Empower and maximum empower|maximum empower]]''' principle.  This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note,

{{quotation|Maximum power might be misunderstood to mean giving priority to low level processes. ... However, the higher level transformation processes are just as important as the low level processes. ... Therefore, Lotka's principle is clarified by stating it as the principle of self organization for maximum ''empower''. |p. 18}}

C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote "The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka–Odum) is generally considered the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems" (C. Giannantoni 2002, § 13, p.&amp;nbsp;155). Nevertheless,  Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006).

The preceding discussion is incomplete. The "maximum power" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

In [[digital electronics]], [[analogue electronics]] and [[entertainment]], the [[user interface]] of media may include '''media controls''' or '''player controls''', to enact and change or adjust the process of watching [[film]] or listening to [[Sound|audio]]. These widely known symbols can be found in a multitude of software products, exemplifying what is known as [[dominant design]].

==Symbols==
[[File:Logitech G15 Media Keys.jpg|thumb|A multimedia keyboard with play, pause, stop, skip next and skip back buttons]]
These are common icons on [[data storage device|physical devices]] and [[application software]]. They are commonly found on [[portable media player]]s, [[videocassette recorder|VCRs]], [[DVD player]]s, [[Phonograph|record players]], [[remote control]]s, [[Cassette deck|tape players]] and [[multimedia keyboard]]s. Their application is described in [[ISO/IEC 18035]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/IEC 18035:2003 Information technology -- Icon symbols and functions for controlling multimedia software applications|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/30820.html|website=International Organization for Standardization|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=27 January 2018|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The main symbols date back to the 1960s, with the Pause symbol having reportedly been invented at [[Ampex]] during that decade for use on [[reel-to-reel]] audio recorder controls, due to the difficulty of translating the word "pause" into some languages used in foreign markets.  The Pause symbol was designed as a variation on the existing square Stop symbol and was intended to evoke the concept of an interruption or "stutter stop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Origin of play, stop, pause, etc. buttons? - Straight Dope Message Board |url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=493618 |date=2015-04-03 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Secret Histories of Those @#$%ing Computer Symbols |url=https://gizmodo.com/5612630/the-secret-histories-of-those-ing-computer-symbols |website=[[Gizmodo]] |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
=== Consumer products ===
In popular culture, the play triangle is arguably the most widely used of the media control symbols. In many ways, the symbol has become synonymous with music culture and more broadly the digital download era. As such, there are now a multitude of items such as T-shirts, posters, and tattoos that feature this symbol. Similar cultural references can be observed with the [[Power symbol]] which is especially popular among video gamers and technology enthusiasts.

=== Branding ===
Media symbols can be found on an array of advertisements, from live music venues to streaming services. In 2012, Google rebranded its digital download store to [[Google Play]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/introducing-google-play-all-your.html|title=Introducing Google Play: All your entertainment, anywhere you go|website=Official Google Blog|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a play symbol in its logo.  The play symbol also serves as a logo for the Google-owned video sharing site [[YouTube]] since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16216868/new-youtube-logo-redesign-font-color-app-design|title=YouTube has a new look and, for the first time, a new logo|work=The Verge|access-date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use on appliances and other mechanical devices ==
[[File:Washing machine Media Symbols.jpg|thumb|A washing machine with an illuminated ►❚❚ symbol.]]
In recent years, there has been a proliferation of devices that use media symbols in order to represent the Run/Stop/Pause functions. Likewise, user interface programing pertaining to these functions has also been influenced by that of media players. For example, some washers and dryers with a common illuminated play/pause button are programmed so that when the appliance is off, the play/pause light stays off.  When the device is running the light stays on, and when the washer/dryer is in a paused state, the button flashes. This type of programing is similar to that of earlier CD players, which are also set to flash in this manner in the pause state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.sony.com/release/deg3.pdf|title=Sony Portable CD Player Operating Instructions (Page 7)|last=|first=|date=|website=Sony.com|publisher=Sony Corporation|access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from appliances, there are many other instances when run/stop/pause functionality is needed and media symbols could theoretically  be used instead of or in addition to words. In recent years, some exercise machine manufactures have chosen to do this. A notable difference in the use of these symbols on exercise equipment is that these machines usually contain an emergency stop button. Typically, this function is denoted with a red octagonal stop sign symbol, as opposed to a square, when the button may also be used for emergencies.

'''Moral Development''' focuses on the emergence, change, and understanding of [[morality]] from infancy through adulthood. Morality develops across a lifetime and is influenced by an individual's experiences and their behavior when faced with moral issues through different periods' physical and cognitive development. In short, morality concerns an individual's growing sense of what is right and wrong; it is for this reason that young children have different moral judgement and character than that of a grown adult. Morality in itself is often a synonym for "rightness" or "goodness". It refers to a certain code of conduct that is derived from one's culture, religion or personal philosophy that guides one's actions, behaviors and thoughts.  

Notions of morality development have been developed over centuries, the earliest came from philosophers like [[Confucius]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], who all took a more humanist perspective and focused on the development of the conscience and sense of virtue. In the modern day, empirical research has explored morality through a moral psychology lens by theorists like [[Sigmund Freud]] and its relation to cognitive development by theorists like [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Carol Gilligan]] and Judith Smetana.  

The interest in morality spans many disciplines (e.g., [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[biology]], and [[political science]]) and specializations within psychology (e.g., [[Social psychology|social]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[Cultural psychology|cultural]]). In order to investigate how individuals understand morality, it is essential to consider their beliefs, emotions, attitudes, and behaviors that contribute to their moral understanding. Additionally, researchers in the field of moral development consider the role of peers and parents in facilitating moral development, the role of conscience and values, socialization and cultural influences, empathy and altruism, and positive development, in order to understand what factors impact morality of an individual more completely.

'''Freud: Morality and the Superego:''' The founder of psychoanalysis, [[Sigmund Freud]], proposed the existence of a tension between the needs of society and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Eli. ''Freud, Women, and Morality: The Psychology of Good and Evil''. New York: Basic Books, 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freud, moral development proceeds when the individual's selfish desires are repressed and replaced by the values of important socializing agents in one's life (for instance, one's parents).

'''B.F. Skinner's Behavioral Theory:''' A proponent of behaviorism, [[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] similarly focused on socialization as the primary force behind moral development&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Driscoll, Marcy Perkins. ''Psychology of Learning for Instruction''. Pearson, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to Freud's notion of a struggle between internal and external forces, Skinner focused on the power of external forces (reinforcement contingencies) to shape an individual's development.

'''Piaget's Theory of Moral Development''' : While both Freud and Skinner focused on the external forces that bear on morality (parents in the case of Freud, and behavioral contingencies in the case of Skinner), [[Jean Piaget]] (1965) focused on the individual's construction, construal, and interpretation of morality from a social-cognitive and social-emotional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, Jean, Ved P. Varma, and Phillip Williams. ''Piaget, Psychology and Education: Papers in Honour of Jean Piaget''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;To understand adult morality, Piaget believed that it was necessary to study both how morality manifests in the child's world as well as the factors that contribute to the emergence of central moral concepts such as welfare, justice, and rights. Interviewing children using the Clinical Interview Method, Piaget (1965) found that young children were focused on authority mandates, and that with age children become autonomous, evaluating actions from a set of independent principles of morality. Piaget characterizes the development of morality of children through observing children while playing games to see if rules are followed.

'''Social Domain Theory:''' Eliot Turiel  argued for a social domain approach to social cognition, delineating how individuals differentiate moral (fairness, equality, justice), societal (conventions, group functioning, traditions), and psychological (personal, individual prerogative) concepts from early in development throughout the lifespan&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, Elliot. ''The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Internet resource.&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the past 40 years, research findings have supported this model, demonstrating how children, adolescents, and adults differentiate moral rules from conventional rules, identify the personal domain as a nonregulated domain, and evaluate multifaceted (or complex) situations that involve more than one domain. This research has been conducted in a wide range of countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K., U.S., Virgin Islands) and with rural and urban children, for low and high income communities, and traditional and modern cultures. Turiel's social domain theory showed that children were actually younger in developing moral standards than past psychologists predicted.

'''Kohlberg: Moral Reasoning'':''''' [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] was inspired by the works of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, Lawrence. ''The Philosophy of Moral Development: Moral Stages and the Idea of Justice''. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1981. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the past 20 years, researchers have expanded the field of moral development, applying moral judgment, reasoning, and emotion attribution to topics such as prejudice, aggression, theory of mind, emotions, empathy, peer relationships, and parent-child interactions. The Handbook of Moral Development (2006), edited by Melanie Killen and Judith Smetana, provides a wide range of information about these topics covered in moral development today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Smetana, J.G. (Eds.) (2006). Handbook of moral development. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;One of the main objectives was to provide a sense of the current state of the field of moral development

==Cognition and intentionality==

A hallmark of moral understanding is intentionality which can be defined as an attribution of the target’s intentions towards another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Rizzo|first2=Michael T.|date=2014|title=Morality, Intentionality, and Intergroup Attitudes |journal=Behaviour|volume=151|issue=2–3|pages=337–359|doi=10.1163/1568539X-00003132 |pmc=4336952|pmid=25717199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five components make up people's concept of intentionality: an action is considered intentional if a personal has (a) a desire for an outcome, (b) a belief that the action will lead to the outcome, (c) an intention to perform the action, (d) skill to perform the action, and (e) awareness while performing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://research.clps.brown.edu/SocCogSci/Projects/intentionality.html|title=Intentionality {{!}} Malle Lab|website=research.clps.brown.edu|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on children's [[theory of mind]], ToM, has focused on when children understand others' intentions (Wellman &amp; Lui, 2004&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., &amp; Liu, D. (2004). Scaling of theory-of-mind tasks. ''Child Development'', 75, 502-517.&lt;/ref&gt;). The moral concept of one's intentionality develops with experience in the world. Yuill (1984) presented evidence that comprehension of one's intentions plays a role in moral judgment, even in young children.&lt;ref&gt;Yuill, N. (1984). Young children's coordination of motive and outcome in judgments of satisfaction and morality. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 2, 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen, Mulvey, Richardson, Jampol, and [[Amanda Woodward|Woodward]] (2011) present evidence that with developing false belief competence (ToM), children are capable of using information about one’s intentions when making moral judgments about the acceptability of acts and punishments, recognizing that accidental transgressors, who do not hold negative intentions, should not be held accountable for negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Mulvey, K. L., Richardson, C., Jampol, N., &amp; Woodward, A. (2011). The accidental transgressor: Testing theory of mind and morality knowledge in young children. ''Cognition'', 119, 197-215.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, children who lacked false belief competence were more likely to attribute blame to an accidental transgressor than children with demonstrated false belief competence. In addition to evidence from a social cognitive perspective, behavioral evidence suggests that even three-year-olds have the capacity to take into account a person's intention and apply this information when responding to situations. Vaish, Carpenter, and [[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] (2010), for instance, present evidence that three-year-olds are more willing to help a neutral or helpful person than a harmful person.&lt;ref&gt;Vaish, A., Carpenter, M., &amp; Tomasello, M. (2010). Young children selectively avoid helping people with harmful intentions. ''Child Development'', 81, 1661-1669.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the ability to identify one’s intentionality, mental state understanding plays a crucial role in identifying victimization. While obvious distress cues (e.g. crying) allow even three year olds to identify victims of harm (Zelazo, Helwig, &amp; Lau, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Zelazo, P. D., Helwig, C. C., &amp; Lau, A. (1996). Intention, act, and outcome in behavioral prediction and moral judgment. ''Child Development'', 67, 2478-2492.&lt;/ref&gt;), it is not until around six years of age that children are able to appreciate that a person may be an unwilling victim of harm even in the absence of obvious distress (Shaw &amp; Wainryb, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, L. A., &amp; Wainryb, C. (2006). When victims don't cry: Children's understandings of victimization, compliance, and subversion. ''Child Development'', 77, 1050-1062.&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, Shaw and Wainryb (2006) discovered that children older than six interpret compliance, resistance, and subversion to illegitimate requests (e.g., clean my locker) from the perspective of a victim. That is, they judge that victims who resist illegitimate requests will feel better than victims who comply.

==Emotions==

Moral questions tend to be emotionally charged issues which evoke strong affective responses. Consequently, emotions likely play an important role in moral development. However, there is currently little consensus among theorists on how emotions influence moral development. [[Psychoanalytic theory]], founded by Freud, emphasizes the role of guilt in repressing primal drives. Research on [[prosocial behavior]] has focused on how emotions motivate individuals to engage in moral or altruistic acts. Social-cognitive development theories have recently begun to examine how emotions influence moral judgments. Intuitionist theorists assert that moral judgments can be reduced to immediate, instinctive emotional responses elicited by moral dilemmas.

Research on socioemotional development and prosocial development has identified several "moral emotions" which are believed to motivate moral behavior and influence moral development (Eisenberg, 2000 for a review).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N. (2000). Emotion, Regulation, and Moral Development. ''Annual Review of Psychology'', 51,665–697.&lt;/ref&gt; These moral emotions are said to be linked to moral development because they are evidence and reflective of an individual’s set of moral values, which must have undergone through the process of internalization in the first place (Kochanska &amp; Thompson, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kochanska|first=Grazyna|last2=Aksan|first2=Nazan|date=2006-12-01|title=Children's Conscience and Self-Regulation|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1587–1618|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestation of these moral emotions can occur at two separate timings: either before or after the execution of a moral or immoral act. A moral emotion that precedes an action is referred to as an anticipatory emotion, and a moral emotion that follows an action is referred to as a consequential emotion (Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tangney|first=June Price|last2=Stuewig|first2=Jeff|last3=Mashek|first3=Debra J.|date=2006-12-06|title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=345–372|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|issn=0066-4308|pmc=3083636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary emotions consistently linked with moral development are [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[empathy]], and [[sympathy]]. Guilt has been defined as "an agitation-based emotion or painful feeling of regret that is aroused when the actor actually causes, anticipates causing, or is associated with an aversive event" (Fergusen &amp; Stegge, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson T. J. &amp; Stegge H. (1998). Measuring guilt in children: a rose by any other name still has thorns. In Guilt and Children, ed. J Bybee, pp. 19–74. San Diego: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Shame is often used synonymously with guilt, but implies a more passive and dejected response to a perceived wrong. Guilt and shame are considered "self-conscious" emotions, because they are of primary importance to an individual's self-evaluation. Moreover, there exists a bigger difference between guilt and shame that goes beyond the type of feelings that they may provoke within an individual. This difference lies in the fact that these two moral emotions do not weigh the same in terms of their impact on moral behaviors. Studies on the effects of guilt and shame on moral behaviors has shown that guilt has a larger ability to dissuade an individual from making immoral choices whereas shame did not seem to have any deterring effect on immoral behaviors. However, it should be noted that different types of behaviors in different types of population, under different circumstances might not generate the same outcomes (Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007). In contrast to guilt and shame, empathy and sympathy are considered other-oriented moral emotions. Empathy is commonly defined as an affective response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which mirrors the other's affective state. Similarly, sympathy is defined as an emotional response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which does not mirror the other's affect, but instead causes one to express concern or sorrow for the other (Eisenberg, 2000).

The relation between moral action and moral emotions has been extensively researched. Very young children have been found to express feelings of care, and empathy towards others, showing concerns for other's well being (Eisenberg, Spinard, &amp; Sadovsky, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., Spinard, T. L., &amp; Sadovsky, A. (2006). Empathy-related responding in children. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 517-549). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has consistently demonstrated that when empathy is induced in an individual, he or she is more likely to engage in subsequent prosocial behavior (Batson 1998;&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1998). Altruism and prosocial behavior. In The Handbook of Social Psychology, ed. DT Gilbert, ST Fiske, G Lindzey, 2:282–316. Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberg, 200 for review). Additionally, other research has examined emotions of shame and guilt in relation to children's empathic and prosocial behavior (Zahn-Waxler &amp; Robinson, 1995).

While emotions serve as information for children in their interpretations about moral consequences of acts, the role of emotions in children's moral judgments has only recently been investigated. Some approaches to studying emotions in moral judgments come from the perspective that emotions are automatic intuitions that define morality (Greene, 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. (2001). An fMRI Investigation of Emotional Engagement in Moral Judgment. ''Science'', 293 (5537), 2105-2108. {{doi|10.1126/science.1062872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2001). The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment. ''Psychological Review'', 108, 814-834.&lt;/ref&gt;). Other approaches place emphasis on the role of emotions as evaluative feedback that help children interpret acts and consequences (Turiel &amp; Killen, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E., &amp; Killen, M. (2010). Taking emotions seriously: The role of emotions in moral development. In W. Arsenio &amp; E. Lemerise (Eds.), Emotions in aggression and moral development. (pp. 33-52). Washington, D.C.: APA.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown children attribute different emotional outcomes to actors involved in moral transgressions than those involved in conventional transgressions (Arsenio, 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Arsenio, W. F. (1988). Children's conceptions of the situational affective consequences of sociomoral events. ''Child Development'', 59, 1611-1622.&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenio &amp; Fleiss, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Arsenio, W. F., &amp; Fleiss, K. (1996). Typical and behaviourally disruptive children's understanding of the emotional consequences of socio-moral events. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 14, 173-186&lt;/ref&gt;). Emotions may help individuals prioritize among different information and possibilities and reduce information processing demands in order to narrow the scope of the reasoning process (Lemerise &amp; Arsenio, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Lemerise, E., &amp; Arsenio, W. (2000). An integrated model of emotion processes and cognition in social information processing. ''Child Development'', 71, 107-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Malti, Gummerum, Keller, &amp; Buchmann, (2009) found individual differences in how children attribute emotions to victims and victimizers.&lt;ref&gt;Malti, T., Gummerum, M., Keller, M., &amp; Buchmann, M. (2009). Children's moral motivation, sympathy, and prosocial behavior. ''Child Development'', 80, 442-460.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of interpersonal, intergroup, and cultural influences==
Children's interactions and experiences with caregivers and peers have been shown to influence their development of moral understanding and behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/early-childhood-moral-development/|title=Early Childhood Moral Development|website=www.mentalhelp.net|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;Researchers have addressed the influence of interpersonal interactions on children's moral development from two primary perspectives: Socialization/Internalization (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994;&lt;ref&gt;Grusec, J. E., &amp; Goodnow, J. J. (1994). Impact of parental discipline methods on the child's internalization of values: A reconceptualization of current points of view.

A longitudinal study of the roots of preschoolers' conscience: Committed compliance and emerging internalization. ''Child Development'', 66, 1752-176&lt;/ref&gt;) and social domain theory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"&gt;Turiel, E. (1983). The development of social knowledge: Morality and convention.

Moral development and moral education: An overview.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research from the social domain theory perspective focuses on how children actively distinguish moral from conventional behavior based in part on the responses of parents, teachers, and peers.&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1997). Parenting and the development of social knowledge reconceptualized: A social domain analysis. In J. E. Grusec &amp; L. Kuczynski (Eds.), Parenting and the internalization of values (pp. 162-192). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Social domain suggests that there are different areas of reasoning co-existing in development those include societal (concerns about conventions and grouping), moral (fairness, justice and rights) and psychological (concerns with personal goals and identity).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Turiel|first=E|date=2007|chapter=The Development of Morality |editors=W. Damon, R. M. Lerner and N. Eisenberg|url=|title=Handbook of Child Psychology|volume=3|edition=6th|doi=10.1002/9780470147658.chpsy0313 |isbn=9780471272878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults tend to respond to children's moral transgressions (e.g. hitting or stealing) by drawing the child's attention to the effect of his or her action on others, and doing so consistently across various contexts. In contrast, adults are more likely to respond to children's conventional misdeeds (e.g. wearing a hat in the classroom, eating spaghetti with fingers) by reminding children about specific rules and doing so only in certain contexts (e.g. at school but not at home).&lt;ref name=Smetana1984&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1984). Toddlers' social interactions regarding moral and conventional transgressions. ''Child Development'', 55, 1767-1776.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1985). Preschool children's conceptions of transgressions: Effects of varying moral and conventional domain-related attributes. ''Developmental Psychology'', 21, 18-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Peers respond mainly to moral but not conventional transgressions and demonstrate emotional distress (e.g. crying or yelling) when they are the victim of moral but unconventional transgressions.&lt;ref name=Smetana1984/&gt; 

Research from a socialization/internalization perspective focuses on the ways in which adults pass down standards or rules of behavior to children through parenting techniques and why children do or do not internalize those values (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994; Kochanska &amp; Askan, 1995). From this perspective, moral development involves children's increasing compliance with and internalization of adult rules, requests, and standards of behavior. Using these definitions, researchers find that parenting behaviors vary in the extent to which they encourage children's internalization of values, and that these effects depend partially on a child attributes, such as age and [[temperament]] (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994). For instance, Kochanska (1997) showed that gentle parental discipline best promotes conscience development in temperamentally fearful children but that parental responsiveness and a mutually responsive parent-child orientation best promote conscience development in temperamentally fearless children.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G. (1997). Multiple pathways to conscience for children with different temperaments: From toddlerhood to age 5. ''Developmental Psychology'', 33, 228-240.&lt;/ref&gt; These parental influences exert their effects through multiple pathways, including increasing children's experience of moral emotions (e.g. guilt, empathy) and their self-identification as moral individuals (Kochanska, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G., Koenig, J. L., Barry, R. A., Kim, S., &amp; Yoon, J. E. (2010). Children's conscience during toddler and preschool years, moral self, and a competent, adaptive developmental trajectory. ''Developmental Psychology'', 46, 1320-1332&lt;/ref&gt;). Development can be divided up to multiple stages however the first few years of development is usually seen to be formed by 5 years of age. According to Freud's research, relationships between a child and parents early on usually provides the basis forth personality development as well as the formation of morality. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Freud|first=S|date=1930-1961|title=Civilization and its Discontents|url=|location=New York, NY|volume=|pages=|publisher=W. W. Norton.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers interested in intergroup attitudes and behavior related to ones moral development have approached the study of [[stereotypes]], [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] in children and adolescents from several theoretical perspectives. Some, however not limited to are of these theoretical frameworks: Cognitive Development Theory (Aboud, 1988);&lt;ref&gt;Aboud, F. E. (1988). Children and prejudice. Oxford, England: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Social Domain Theory (Killen &amp; Rutland, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Rutland, A. (2011).

''European Journal of Social Psychology'', 38, 922-934. {{doi|10.1002/ejsp.504}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plethora of research approaches is not surprising given the multitude of variables, (e.g. group identity, group status, group threat, group [[Norm (social)|norms]], [[Contact hypothesis|intergroup contact]], individual beliefs and context) that need to be considered when assessing children's intergroup attitudes. While most of this research has investigated two-dimensional relationships between each of the three components: stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination (e.g., role of stereotypes in intergroup prejudice, use of stereotypes to reason about intergroup discrimination, how prejudices manifest into discrimination), very few have addressed all three aspects of intergroup attitudes and behaviors together (McKown, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;McKown, C. (2004). Age and ethnic variation in children's thinking about the nature of racism. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 25, 597-617. {{doi|10.1016/j.appdev.2004.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developmental intergroup research, stereotypes are defined as judgments made about an individual's attributes based on group membership (Killen, Margie, &amp; Sinno, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Margie, N. G., &amp; Sinno, S. (2006). Morality in the context of intergroup relationships. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 155-183). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen et al., 2007). These judgments are more complex than regular judgments as they require one to recognize and understand (eg. gender, race, religion, culture, nationality, ethnicity) which group one individual belongs to as they might be treated differently delliberately because of the group they are associated with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychologists focus on stereotypes as a cognitive component influencing intergroup behaviors and tend to define them as being fixed concepts associated with a category (Allport, 1954).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). The nature of prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; Prejudice, on the other hand is defined in terms of negative attitudes or affective expressions toward a whole group or members of a group (Stangor, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Stangor, C. (2009). The study of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination within social psychology: A quick history of theory and research. In T. D. Nelson (Ed.), Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. (pp. 1-22). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative stereotypes and prejudices can manifest into discrimination towards an outgroup and for children and adolescents, this may come in the form of exclusion from peer groups as well as the wider community (Killen &amp; Rutland, 2011). Such actions can negatively impact a child in the long term in the sense of weakening ones confidence, self esteem as well personal identity. 

One explicit manner in which societies can socialize individuals is through moral education. Solomon and colleagues (1988) present evidence from a study that integrated both direct instruction and guided reflection approaches to moral development, with evidence for resultant increases in spontaneous prosocial behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, D., Watson, M. S., Delucchi, K. L., Schaps, E., &amp; Battistich, V. (1988). Enhancing children's prosocial behavior in the classroom. American Educational Research Journal, 25, 527-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture can also be a key contributor toward differences in morality within society.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosocial behavior, which is behavior that benefits others, is much more likely in societies with strong social goals rather than societies which emphasize the individual. For example, children being raised in China eventually adopt the collective communist ideals of their society. In fact, children learn to lie and deny responsibility for accomplishing something good instead of seeking recognition for their actions.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development" /&gt; Early indications of prosocial behavior include the sharing of toys and comforting distressed friends, and these characteristics can be seen in an individual’s behavior as young as infancy and toddlerhood.  Starting in preschool, sharing, helping, and other prosocial behaviors become more common, particularly in females, although the gender differences in prosocial behavior are not evident in all social contexts.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral relativism ===
[[Moral relativism]], also called “cultural relativism,” suggests that morality is relative to each culture. One cannot rightly pass moral judgement on members of other cultures except by their own cultural standards when actions violate a moral principle, which may differ from one’s own. [[Richard Shweder|Shweder]], Mahapatra, and Miller (1987) argued for the notion that different cultures defined the boundaries of morality differently.&lt;ref&gt;Shweder, R. A., Mahapatra, M., &amp; Miller, J. G. (1987). Culture and moral development In J. Kagan &amp; S. Lamb (Eds.), The emergence of morality in young children. (pp.1-83). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also different from [[moral subjectivism]] which refers to the view that moral truth is relative to the individual. Moral relativism can be identified as a form of [[moral skepticism]] and is often misidentified as [[moral pluralism]]. It opposes to the attitude of moral superiority and ethnocentrism found in [[moral absolutism]] and the views of [[moral universalism]]. Turiel and Perkins (2004) argued for the universality of morality, focusing largely on evidence throughout history of resistance movements that fight for justice through the affirmation of individual self-determination rights.&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E. &amp; Perkins, S. A. (2004). Flexibilities of mind: Conflict and culture. Human Development, 47, 158-178.&lt;/ref&gt;Miller (2006) proposes that there is cultural variability in the priority given to moral considerations (e.g., the importance of prosocial helping).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. G. (2006). Insights into moral development from cultural psychology. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 375-398). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than variability in what individuals consider moral (fairness, justice, rights). Wainryb (2006), in contrast, demonstrates that children in diverse cultures such as the U.S., India, China, Turkey, and Brazil share a pervasive view about upholding fairness and the wrongfulness of inflicting armong others.&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (2006). Moral development in culture: Diversity, tolerance, and justice. In M. Killen &amp; J.G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of Moral Development (pp. 211-242). NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultures vary in terms of conventions and customs, but not principles of fairness, which appear to emerge very early in development, prior to socialization influences. Wainryb (1991; 1993) shows that many apparent cultural differences in moral judgments are actually due to different informational assumptions, or beliefs about the way the world works.&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (1991). Understanding differences in moral judgments: The role of informational assumptions. ''Child Development'', 62, 840-851.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (1993). The application of moral judgments to other cultures: Relativism and universality. ''Child Development'', 64, 924-933.&lt;/ref&gt;  When people hold different beliefs about the effects of actions or the status of different groups of people, their judgments about the harmfulness or fairness of behaviors often differ, even when they are applying the same moral principles. 

=== Religion ===
The role of religion in a culture may influence a child's moral development and sense of moral identity. Values are transmitted through [[religion]], which is for many inextricably linked to a cultural identity. [[Religious development]] often goes along with moral development of the children as it shapes the child's concepts of right and wrong. Intrinsic aspects of religion may have a positive impact on the internalization and the symbolism of moral identity. The child may internalize the parents' morals if a religion is a family activity or the religious social group's morals to which the child belongs. Religious development mirrors the cognitive and moral developmental stages of the children. Nucci and Turiel (1993), on the other hand, proposed that the development of morality is distinct from the understanding of religious rules when assessing individuals' reactions to whether moral and nonmoral religious rules was contingent to God's word and whether a harmful act could be justified as morally right based on God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Nucci, L. P., &amp; Turiel, E. (1993). God's word, religious rules and their relation to Christian and Jewish children's concepts of morality. ''Child Development'', 64, 1485-1491.&lt;/ref&gt; Children form their own understanding of how they see the world, themselves or others and are able to understand that not all religious rules are applied to morality, social structures or different religions. 

===In indigenous American communities===

In [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]], morality is taught to children through [[storytelling]]. It provides children guidelines for understanding the core values of their community, the significance of life and ideologies of moral character from past generations. &lt;ref name="Howard 1999 45–53"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Scott J.|title=Contemporary American Indian storytelling: An outsider's perspective|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=1999|volume=23|pages=45–53|doi=10.2307/1185925|jstor=1185925}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Storytelling]] shapes the minds of young children in these communities as well as forms the dominant means for understanding and the basic foundation for learning and teaching.  

[[Storytelling]] in everyday life is used as an [[Informal learning|indirect form of teaching]]. Stories embedded with lessons of morals, ideals, and ethics are told alongside daily household chores. Most children in Indigenous American communities develop a sense of keen [[attention]] to the details of a story with the goal of learning from them, and to understand why people do the things they do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaskins|first=Suzanne|title=Open Attention as a Cultural Tool for Observational Learning|url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/learning/Gaskins.pdf|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding gained from a child's observation of morality and ethics taught through storytelling allows them to participate within their community appropriately.

Specific animals are used as characters to symbolize specific values and views of the culture in the [[storytelling]] where listeners are taught through the actions of these characters. In the [[Lakota tribe]], coyotes are often viewed as a trickster character, demonstrating negative behaviors like greed, recklessness, and arrogance &lt;ref name="Howard 1999 45–53"/&gt; while bears and foxes are usually viewed as wise, noble, and morally upright characters from which children learn to model .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/legends.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stories, trickster characters often get into troubles, thus teaching children to avoid exhibiting similar negative behaviors. The reuse of characters calls for a more predictable outcome that children can more easily understand.

===Social exclusion===

Intergroup exclusion context provides an appropriate platform to investigate the interplay of these three dimensions of intergroup attitudes and behaviors, prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Developmental scientists working from a Social Domain Theory (SDT: Killen et al., 2006; Smetana, 2006) perspective have focused on methods that measure children's reasoning about exclusion scenarios. This approach has been helpful in distinguishing which concerns children attend to when presented with a situation in which exclusion occurs. Exclusion from a peer group could raise concerns about moral issues (e.g. fairness and empathy towards excluded), social-conventional issues (e.g., traditions and social norms set by institutions and groups) and personal issues (e.g., autonomy, individual preferences related to friendships), and these can coexist depending on the context in which the exclusion occurs. In intergroup as well as intragroup contexts, children need to draw on knowledge and attitudes related to their own social identities, other social categories, the social norms associated with these categories as well as moral principals about the welfare of the excluded, and fair treatment, to make judgments about social exclusion. The importance of morality arises when the evaluation process of social exclusion requires one to deal with not only the predisposed tendencies of discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes and bias but also the internal judgments about justice equality and individual rights, which may prove to be a very complex task since it often evokes conflicts and dilemmas coming from the fact that the components of the first often challenge the components of the latter (Killen, Lee-Kim, McGlothlin, &amp; Stangor, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Lee-Kim|first2=Jennie|last3=McGlothlin|first3=Heidi|last4=Stangor|first4=Charles|last5=Helwig|first5=Charles C.|date=2002|title=How Children and Adolescents Evaluate Gender and Racial Exclusion|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=67|issue=4|pages=i–129|jstor=3181568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from a Social Domain Theory perspective show that children are sensitive to the context of exclusion and pay attention to different variables when judging or evaluating exclusion. These variables include, social categories, the stereotypes associated with them, children's qualifications as defined by prior experience with an activity, personality and behavioral traits that might be disruptive for group functioning and conformity to conventions as defined by group identity or social consensus. In the absence of information, stereotypes can be used to justify exclusion of a member of an out-group (Horn 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Horn, S. S. (2003). Adolescents' reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ''Developmental Psychology'', 39, 71-84&lt;/ref&gt; Killen and Stangor, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Stangor, C. (2001). Children's social reasoning about inclusion and exclusion in gender and race peer group contexts. ''Child Development'', 72, 174-186&lt;/ref&gt;). One's personality traits and whether he or she conforms to socially accepted behaviors related to identity also provide further criteria for social acceptance and inclusion by peers (Killen, Crystal, &amp; Watanabe, 2002;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Crystal, D. S., &amp; Watanabe, H. (2002). The individual and the group: Japanese and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion, tolerance of difference, and prescriptions for conformity. ''Child Development'', 73, 1788-1802&lt;/ref&gt; Park, Killen, Crystal, &amp; Watanabe, 2003&lt;ref&gt;Park, Y., Killen, M., Crystal, D., &amp; Watanabe, H. (2003). Korean, Japanese, and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion: Evidence for diversity. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 27, 555-565&lt;/ref&gt;). Also, research has documented the presence of a transition occurring at the reasoning level behind the criteria of inclusion and exclusion from childhood to adolescence (Horn, 2003). As children get older, they become more attuned to issues of group functioning and conventions and weigh them in congruence with issues of fairness and morality (Killen &amp; Stangor, 2001)

===Allocation of resources===

[[Resource allocation]] is a critical part of the [[decision making process]] for individuals in positions of public responsibility and authority (e.g., health care providers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=71–4|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmid=8083876|pmc=1376429}}&lt;/ref&gt; When resources become scarce, such as in rural communities experiencing situations when there is not enough food to feed everyone, authorities in position to make decisions that affect this community can create conflicts on various levels (e.g., personally, financially, socially, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.,|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.,|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moral conflict that arise from these decisions can be divided into a focus of conflict and a locus of moral conflict. The locus, or the place where conflict occurs, can develop from multiple sources which include “any combination of personal, professional, organizational, and community values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.,|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.,|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of conflict occurs from competing values held by stakeholders and financial investors. As K. C. Calman (1994) stated in regards to the reallocation of resources in a medical setting, resources must be thought of not only as money, but also in the form of skills, time, and faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=72–73|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmc=1376429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healthcare system has many examples where morality and resource allocation has ongoing conflicts. Concerns of morality arise when the initiation, continuation, and withdrawal of intensive care affects a patients well being due to medical decision making.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bone|first1=Roger C.|last2=Rackow|first2=Eric C.|last3=Weg|first3=John G.|last4=Butler|first4=Peter|last5=Carton|first5=Robert W.|last6=Elpern|first6=Ellen|last7=Franklin|first7=Cory|last8=Goldman|first8=Edward B.|last9=Gracey|first9=Douglas D.|last10=Hiss|first10=Roland G.|last11=Knaus|first11=William A.|last12=Lefrak|first12=Stephen S.|last13=McCartney|first13=Rev.

“How should I interpret new diagnostic information?
How do I select the appropriate diagnostic test? 
How do I choose among several risky treatments?” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owens|first1=Harold C. Sox, Michael C. Higgins, Douglas K.|title=Medical decision making|date=2013|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|isbn=978-0-470-65866-6|pages=1–3|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, in the United States, has had a moral consensus that there are no differences between these two therapies. However, even though a political decision offers support for medical practitioner's decision making, there continues to be difficulty withdrawing life-sustaining treatments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7375">'''Mythos''' is the term used by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) for the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of an [[Tragedy#Performance_of_Greek_tragedies|Athenian tragedy]]. It is the first of the six elements of tragedy that he gives.

== Variations on plot ==
“In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' 13 and 14, Aristotle turns from the discussion of the three separate parts of the plot to a consideration of the plot as a whole composed of these three parts”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 160&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Poetics'' 13, Aristotle states his idea that the purpose of tragedy is the arousal of pity and fear.  According to Belfiore, even though Aristotle uses one set of criteria for good plots in ''Poetics'' 13 and a different set in ''Poetics'' 14, “these two accounts are more consistent with one another than is often thought”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defines plot in chapter 13 of ''Poetics'' as a variation of two different “change types” and three different “character types”.  A tragic plot is a movement or change between the end points of good and bad fortune, because of that there are two possible kinds of change: change that begins in good fortune and ends in bad fortune, and change that begins in bad fortune and ends in good fortune.  The three possible “character types” are the characters of “decent” people, people “outstanding in excellence and justice”; “evil people”; and the “in-between man”.  Of the six logically possible outcomes, Aristotle lists only four.  Aristotle contends in ''Poetics'' 13 that the most desirable plot involves ‘An in-between person who changes from good to bad fortune, due to [[hamartia]], “error.”  Additionally, Aristotle states that the plot in which ‘An evil person changes from bad to good fortune,’ is the most untragic of all because it is not philanthropic, pitiable, or fearful.’  ''Poetics'' 13 deals with good and bad combinations of character types and change. Conversely, ''Poetics'' 14 discusses good and bad combinations of a pathos with the knowledge or ignorance of the agent.  “Ranked from worst to best, by Aristotle, these are the four logical possibilities of [[pathos]]:

1. A pathos is about to occur, with knowledge, but does not occur.

2. A pathos occurs, with knowledge.

3. A pathos occurs, in ignorance.

4. A pathos is about to occur, in ignorance, but does not occur”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotional effect peculiar to the tragic action is therefore that of promoting the experience of feelings such as pity and terror, which constitute the ultimate end at which the representation of the mythos aims.&lt;ref name="Rizzoli 11"&gt;Rizzoli 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aristotle's mythos vs. the modern interpretation of plot ==
Aristotle’s notion of mythos in ''Poetics'' differs from the modern interpretation of plot most prominently in its role in drama. According to Elizabeth Belfiore’s ''Tragic Pleasures; Aristotle on Plot and Emotion'', Aristotle believed that “plot is essential to tragedy, ethos [character] is second to plot”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore, Elizabeth. "Narratological Plots and Aristotle's Mythos." Arethusa 33 (2000): 37-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believes that “psychological and ethical considerations are secondary to the events themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 40&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle’s view focuses nearly all of his attention on the events of the plot, which, in turn, leaves the characters to become merely conveyors of situations rather than humans with convictions and motives. According to [[Meir Sternberg]], Aristotle “restricts the well-made epic or play to a ‘whole’ (holos) action, with ‘beginning, middle, and end’ linked throughout by necessary or probable sequence, so that nothing will follow its cutoff point”&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg|Sternberg, Meir]]. "Universals of Narrative and Their Cognitivist Fortunes (II)." ''[[Poetics Today]]'' 24 (2003): 517-638.&lt;/ref&gt;). Aristotle’s definition of plot states that every event portrayed and every action taken is a logical progression from previous events.  Aristotle’s focuses on mythos (plot) as opposed to a focus on ethos (character) or “conflict either in the sense of struggle within a person or in the sense of the clashing of opposed principles”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 64&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle explains that tragedy imitates the actions and lives of human beings rather than human beings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;1450.a:16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle concerns himself with the universally logical events of a plot, rather than the specific and often illogical conflicts between characters associated with those events.

[[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] believed that tragedy consists of the conflicts between each character’s ethical justification and the resolution toward a greater rational good.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, Mark W. "Introduction to Hegel's Theory of Tragedy." PhaenEx 1 (2006): 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel’s viewpoint places character conflict as the central focus of tragedy, in clear contradiction to Aristotle’s plot-centric theory of tragedy. According to Meir Sternberg, modernist dramatic theory endorses the “open ending, and poststructuralism for preaching endless indeterminacy,” which is most noticeable in the modern absurdist theater.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 519&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, Sternberg asserts that Aristotle’s viewpoint directs all complex endings and forms of closure into simple cause-and-effect sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 524&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, many of Aristotle’s conclusions directly oppose those of twentieth century narratologists such as [[Vladimir Propp]], who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not of human beings but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 45&lt;/ref&gt; Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are defined in terms of a character who has specific ethical qualities”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 46&lt;/ref&gt; Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in ''Poetics'' because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Nama Japam''' or '''Nama Sankeertanam''' is the ''[[japa]]'' (repetition) or ''[[Sankirtana]]'' of ''nama'' (name) of the Almighty.  The devotee chooses ''[[Ishta-deva]]'' or ''[[Ishta devata]]'' (Sanskrit ''{{IAST|iṣṭa-deva(tā)}}'', literally "cherished [[Deva (Hinduism)|divinity]]" from ''iṣṭa'' "desired, liked, cherished" and ''[[devatā]]'' "godhead, divinity," or ''[[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' "deity") and picks up a name of the Ishta deva to repeatedly [[chant]] the name vocally or in the mind any time, anywhere.  Devotees can form a group and do sankeertanam or singing together of name of the Almighty.

[[Bhishma]] considered chanting of the ''[[Vishnu sahasranama]]'' the best and easiest of all dharmas, or the means to attain relief from all bondage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephen-knapp.com/thousand_names_of_the_supreme.htm "Thousand Names of the Supreme"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Sankaracharya]], the [[Advaita]] enlightened master, in verse 27 of his hymn, [[Bhaja Govindam]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamakoti.org/shlokas/kshlok19.htm Bhaja Govindam: kamakoti.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the [[Gita]] and Vishnu sahasranama should be chanted and the form of the Lord of [[Lakshmi]]-Narayana should always be meditated on. He also said that the Sahasranama bestowed all noble virtues on those who chanted it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/12/16/stories/2005121603040200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=On the Buddha in verse | date=December 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Krishna has mentioned in Srimad [[Bhagavad Gita]], that He resides in the hearts of those who chant and sing His namas.

'''Occam's razor''' (also '''Ockham's razor''' or '''Ocham's razor'''; [[Latin]]: ''lex parsimoniae'' "'''law of parsimony'''") is the problem-solving principle that the simplest solution tends to be the correct one. When presented with competing [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to solve a problem, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. The idea is attributed to English [[Franciscan]] friar [[William of Ockham]] (c. 1287–1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian.

In science, Occam's razor is used as an [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] [[heuristic]] in the development of theoretical models, rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"&gt;Hugh G. Gauch, ''Scientific Method in Practice, Cambridge University Press'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-01708-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-01708-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=Roald |last2=Minkin |first2=Vladimir I. |last3=Carpenter |first3=Barry K. |title=Ockham's Razor and Chemistry |journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry |date=1997 |volume=3 |pages=3–28 |url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/3/hoffman.htm |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[scientific method]], Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the [[falsifiability]] criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives.  Since one can always burden failing explanations with [[ad hoc hypotheses|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]] to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more [[test method|testable]].&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"&gt;{{cite book |origyear=2004 |year=2010 |author=Alan Baker |chapter=Simplicity |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ |publisher=Stanford University |place=California |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |last1=Courtney |first1=A. |last2=Courtney |first2=M. |title=Comments Regarding 'On the Nature of Science' |arxiv=0812.4932 |journal=Physics in Canada |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=7–8|bibcode=2008arXiv0812.4932C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)"&gt;{{cite book |first=Elliott |last=Sober |chapter=Let's Razor Occam's Razor |pages=73–93 |editor-first=Dudley |editor-last=Knowles |title=Explanation and Its Limits |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''Occam's razor'' did not appear until a few centuries after [[William of Ockham]]'s death in 1347. [[Libert Froidmont]], in his ''On Christian Philosophy of the Soul'', takes credit for the phrase, speaking of "''novacula occami''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ockam's Razor: A User's Manual|last=Sober|first=Elliott|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=1107692539|location=|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham did not invent this principle, but the "razor"—and its association with him—may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ariew, Ockham's Razor: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Ockham's Principle of Parsimony, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham stated the principle in various ways, but the most popular version, "Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity" ({{lang|la|Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate}}) was formulated by the Irish [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] philosopher [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]] in his 1639 commentary on the works of [[Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;Johannes Poncius's commentary on John Duns Scotus's ''Opus Oxoniense,'' book III, dist. 34, q. 1. in John Duns Scotus ''Opera Omnia'', vol.15, Ed. Luke Wadding, Louvain (1639), reprinted Paris: Vives, (1894) p.483a&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formulations before William of Ockham ===
[[File:Pluralitas.jpg|thumb|Part of a page from Duns Scotus' book  ''Commentaria oxoniensia ad IV libros magistri Sententiarus'', novis curis edidit p. Marianus Fernandez Garcia (1914, p. 211)': "{{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}}", i.e., "Plurality is not to be posited without necessity"]]

The origins of what has come to be known as Occam's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as [[John Duns Scotus]] (1265–1308), [[Robert Grosseteste]] (1175–1253), [[Maimonides]] (Moses ben-Maimon, 1138–1204), and even [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 189a15, ''On the Heavens'' 271a33. See also Franklin, ''op cit.'' note 44 to chap. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = M. J. | year = 1956 | title = Aristotle's Razor | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies (Ireland) | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 105–112 | doi=10.5840/philstudies1956606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle writes in his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', "We may assume the superiority {{lang|la|ceteris paribus}} [other things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedians, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC ''Complexity and Dynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617112734/https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC |date=17 June 2016 }} citing [[Richard McKeon]] (tr.) Aristotle's ''Posterior Analytics'' (1963) p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] ({{nowrap|c. AD 90 – c. AD 168}}) stated, "We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible."&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher)|first=James|last=Franklin|year= 2001|title= The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}} Chap 9. p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrases such as "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer" and "A plurality is not to be posited without necessity" were commonplace in 13th-century [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] writing.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; Robert Grosseteste, in ''Commentary on'' [Aristotle's] ''the Posterior Analytics Books'' (''Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros'') (c. 1217–1220), declares: "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie]], ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science 1100–1700'' (1953) pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) states that "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many." Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to [[God's existence]], an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. ''[[quinque viae]]''), and specifically, through an argument based on [[causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also [[Correlation does not imply causation]]).

=== William of Ockham ===
[[William of Ockham]] (''circa'' 1287–1347) was an English Franciscan friar and [[theologian]], an influential medieval [[philosopher]] and a [[nominalist]]. His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occam's razor. The term ''razor'' refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by "shaving away" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.

While it has been claimed that Occam's razor is not found in any of William's writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |title=What Ockham really said |publisher=Boing Boing |first=Jacques |last=Vallee |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331171919/http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |archivedate=31 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; one can cite statements such as {{Lang|la|Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate}}[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William%20of%20Occam] ("Plurality must never be posited without necessity"), which occurs in his theological work on the [[The Four Books of Sentences|''Sentences of Peter Lombard'']] (''Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi''; ed. Lugd., 1495, i, dist. 27, qu. 2, K).

Nevertheless, the precise words sometimes attributed to William of Ockham, {{lang|la|Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem}} (Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |year=2007 |title=The linguistics Student's Handbook |location=Edinburgh |publisher= Edinburgh University Press}} p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; are absent in his extant works;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Antony |author-link= Antony Flew |year=1979 |title=A Dictionary of Philosophy |location=London |publisher=Pan Books}} p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; this particular phrasing comes from [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie|Crombie, Alistair Cameron]] (1959), ''Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard, Vol. 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; who described the principle as a "common axiom" (''axioma vulgare'') of the Scholastics.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; William of Ockham's contribution seems to restrict the operation of this principle in matters pertaining to miracles and God's power; so, in the [[Eucharist]], a plurality of miracles is possible, simply because it pleases God.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

This principle is sometimes phrased as {{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}} ("Plurality should not be posited without necessity").&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |title=Ockham's razor |year=2010 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823154602/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Summa Totius Logicae'', i. 12, William of Ockham cites the principle of economy, {{lang|la|Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora}} ("It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer"; Thorburn, 1918, pp.&amp;nbsp;352–53; [[William Kneale (logician)|Kneale]] and Kneale, 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;243.)

=== Later formulations ===
To quote [[Isaac Newton]], "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes."&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Shoulders of Giants|first=Stephen |last=Hawking|authorlink=Stephen Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0eRZr_HK0LgC&amp;pg=PA731|page=731|isbn=0-7624-1698-X|year=2003|publisher=Running Press|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Primary source: {{harvtxt|Newton|2011|p=387}} wrote the following two "philosophizing rules" at the beginning of part&amp;nbsp;3 of the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] 1726 edition.

: Regula I. Causas rerum naturalium non plures admitti debere, quam quæ &amp; veræ sint &amp; earum phænomenis explicandis sufficient.
: Regula II. Ideoque effectuum naturalium ejusdem generis eædem assignandæ sunt causæ, quatenus fieri potest.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offers a particular version of Occam's razor: "Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-construction/|title=Logical Constructions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, [[Ray Solomonoff]] founded the [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]], the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. This theory is a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Induction: From Kolmogorov and Solomonoff to De Finetti and Back to Kolmogorov JJ McCall – Metroeconomica, 2004 – Wiley Online Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.

Another technical approach to Occam's razor is [[Ontological commitment#Ontological parsimony|ontological parsimony]].&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;
{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Alan |title=Simplicity |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/simplicity/#OntPar |date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsimony means spareness and is also referred to as the Rule of Simplicity. This is considered a strong version of Occam's razor.&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html|title=What is Occam's Razor?|website=math.ucr.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706234202/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Everywhere The Soles of Your Feet Shall Tread |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shdlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30 |author=Stormy Dawn |date=17 July 2017 |isbn=9781480838024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variation used in medicine is called the "[[Zebra (medicine)|Zebra]]": a doctor should reject an exotic medical diagnosis when a more commonplace explanation is more likely, derived from [[Theodore Woodward]]'s dictum "When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sotos |first=John G. |year=2006 |origyear=1991 |title=Zebra Cards: An Aid to Obscure Diagnoses |location=Mt. Vernon, VA |publisher=Mt. Vernon Book Systems |isbn=978-0-9818193-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Mach]] formulated the stronger version of Occam's razor into [[physics]], which he called the Principle of Economy stating: "Scientists must use the simplest means of arriving at their results and exclude everything not perceived by the senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Philosophical Views of Ernst Mach |first=Erich |last=Becher |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=1905 |pages=535–562 |doi=10.2307/2177489 |jstor=2177489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle goes back at least as far as Aristotle, who wrote "Nature operates in the shortest way possible."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt; The idea of parsimony or simplicity in deciding between theories, though not the intent of the original expression of Occam's razor, has been assimilated into our culture as the widespread layman's formulation that "the simplest explanation is usually the correct one."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt;

== Justifications ==

=== Aesthetic ===
Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus more likely to be true. This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from [[theology]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] made this argument in the 13th century, writing, "If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices."&lt;ref&gt;Pegis 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 20th century, [[epistemology|epistemological]] justifications based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], [[logic]], [[pragmatism]], and especially [[probability theory]] have become more popular among philosophers.{{Who|date=July 2014}}

=== Empirical ===
Occam's razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see "Applications" section below for some examples).

In the related concept of [[overfitting]], excessively complex models are affected by [[statistical noise]] (a problem also known as the bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better [[predictive inference|predictive]] performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. [[model selection]], [[test set]], [[minimum description length]], [[Bayesian inference]], etc.).

==== Testing the razor ====
The razor's statement that "other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that "simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.

[[File:Leprechaun or Clurichaun.png|thumb|Possible explanations can become needlessly complex. It is coherent, for instance, to add the involvement of [[leprechaun]]s to any explanation, but Occam's razor would prevent such additions unless they were necessary.]]

Some increases in complexity are sometimes necessary. So there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an [[ad hoc hypothesis]]. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as [[consilience]], can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.

Put another way, any new, and even more complex, theory can still possibly be true. For example, if an individual makes [[supernatural]] claims that [[leprechauns]] were responsible for breaking a vase, the simpler explanation would be that he is mistaken, but ongoing ad hoc justifications (e.g. "... and that's not me on the film; they tampered with that, too") successfully prevent outright falsification. This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called [[saving hypothesis|saving hypotheses]], cannot be ruled out—except by using Occam's razor.&lt;ref name=Stanovich2007&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education, pp. 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html Carroll, Robert T. "Ad hoc hypothesis."

None of the papers provided a balance of evidence that complexity of method improved forecast accuracy. In the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons, complexity increased forecast errors by an average of 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = K.

=== Practical considerations and pragmatism ===
{{See also|Pragmatism|Problem of Induction}}

=== Mathematical ===
One justification of Occam's razor is a direct result of basic [[probability theory]]. By definition, all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong.

There have also been other attempts to derive Occam's razor from probability theory, including notable attempts made by [[Harold Jeffreys]] and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|E. T. Jaynes]]. The probabilistic (Bayesian) basis for Occam's razor is elaborated by [[David J. C. MacKay]] in chapter 28 of his book ''Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms | url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043535/http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | archivedate=15 September 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he emphasizes that a prior bias in favour of simpler models is not required.

[[William H. Jefferys]] and [[James Berger (statistician)|James O. Berger]] (1991) generalize and quantify the original formulation's "assumptions" concept as the degree to which a proposition is unnecessarily accommodating to possible observable data.&lt;ref name="Jefferys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jefferys|first=William H.|last2=Berger |first2=James O.|title=Ockham's Razor and Bayesian Statistics |journal=[[American Scientist]]|year=1991|volume=80|issue=1|pages=64–72|jstor=29774559|url=http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304065538/http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2005|df=dmy-all}} (preprint available as "Sharpening Occam's Razor on a Bayesian Strop").&lt;/ref&gt; They state, "A hypothesis with fewer adjustable parameters will automatically have an enhanced posterior probability, due to the fact that the predictions it makes are sharp."&lt;ref name="Jefferys" /&gt; The model they propose balances the precision of a theory's predictions against their sharpness{{vague|date=September 2016}}—preferring theories that sharply{{vague|date=September 2016}} make correct predictions over theories that accommodate a wide range of other possible results. This, again, reflects the mathematical relationship between key concepts in [[Bayesian inference]] (namely [[marginal probability]], [[conditional probability]], and [[posterior probability]]).

The [[bias–variance tradeoff]] is a framework that incorporates the Occam's razor principal in its balance between overfitting (i.e. variance minimization) and underfitting (i.e. bias minimization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spall |first1=James C. |title=Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control |date=11 March 2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780471441908 |pages=330–331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other philosophers ===

==== Karl Popper ====
[[Karl Popper]] argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its [[falsifiability]] criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones "because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable" (Popper 1992). The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.

==== Elliott Sober ====
The philosopher of science [[Elliott Sober]] once argued along the same lines as Popper, tying simplicity with "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, in the sense that it requires less information to a question.&lt;ref name=Sober975&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |year=1975 |title=Simplicity |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-824407-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an [[epistemology|epistemic]] justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a ''[[sui generis]]'' existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'"&lt;ref name=Sober2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |year=2004 |title=Simplicity, Inference and Modeling: Keeping it Sophisticatedly Simple |editor1-first=Arnold |editor1-last=Zellner |editor2-first=Hugo A. |editor2-last=Keuzenkamp |editor2-link=Hugo A.

==== Richard Swinburne ====

[[Richard Swinburne]] argues for simplicity on logical grounds:

{{quote|... the simplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more likely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis, that its predictions are more likely to be true than those of any other available hypothesis, and that it is an ultimate ''a priori'' epistemic principle that simplicity is evidence for truth.|Swinburne 1997}}

According to Swinburne, since our choice of theory cannot be determined by data (see [[Underdetermination]] and [[Duhem-Quine thesis]]), we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use. Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: "Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth." (Swinburne 1997).

==== Ludwig Wittgenstein ====
From the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'':

* 3.328 "If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam's Razor."
: (If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)
* 4.04 "In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents. They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz's Mechanics, on Dynamic Models)."
* 5.47321 "Occam's Razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing. Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent; signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless."

and on the related concept of "simplicity":

* 6.363 "The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the simplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences."

=== Science and the scientific method ===
[[File:Heliocentric.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Andreas Cellarius]]'s illustration of the Copernican system, from the ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]'' (1660). Future positions of the sun, moon and other solar system bodies can be calculated using a [[Geocentrism|geocentric]] model (the earth is at the centre) or using a [[Heliocentrism#The view of modern science|heliocentric model]] (the sun is at the centre). Both work, but the geocentric model arrives at the same conclusions through a much more complex system of calculations than the heliocentric model. This was pointed out in a preface to [[Copernicus]]' first edition of ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''.]]
In [[science]], Occam's razor is used as a [[heuristic]] to guide scientists in developing theoretical models rather than as an arbiter between published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In [[physics]], parsimony was an important heuristic in [[Albert Einstein]]'s formulation of [[special relativity]],&lt;ref name="fn_(102)"&gt;{{cite journal |language=German |first=Albert |last=Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content? |journal=Annalen der Physik |pages=639–41 |year=1905 |issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(103)"&gt;L. Nash, The Nature of the Natural Sciences, Boston: Little, Brown (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; in the development and application of the [[principle of least action]] by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] and [[Leonhard Euler]],&lt;ref name="fn_(104)"&gt;{{cite journal |language=French |first=P. L. M. |last=de Maupertuis |title=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale |page=423 |year=1744}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the development of [[quantum mechanics]] by [[Max Planck]], [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Louis de Broglie]].&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(105)"&gt;{{cite journal |language=French |first=L. |last=de Broglie |title=Annales de Physique |pages=22–128 |year=1925 |issue=3/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], Occam's razor is often an important heuristic when developing a model of a [[reaction mechanism]].&lt;ref name="fn_(107)"&gt;RA Jackson, Mechanism: An Introduction to the Study of Organic Reactions, Clarendon, Oxford, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(108)"&gt;Carpenter, B. K. (1984). ''Determination of Organic Reaction Mechanism'', New York: Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is useful as a heuristic in developing models of reaction mechanisms, it has been shown to fail as a criterion for selecting among some selected published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In this context, Einstein himself expressed caution when he formulated Einstein's Constraint: "It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience".&lt;!-- ref: "On the Method of Theoretical Physics" The Herbert Spencer Lecture, delivered at Oxford (10 June 1933); also published in ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (April 1934), pp. 163–169., p. 165. --&gt; An often-quoted version of this constraint (which cannot be verified as posited by Einstein himself)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529075018/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "Everything should be kept as simple as possible, but not simpler."

In the scientific method, parsimony is an [[epistemological]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or [[heuristic]] preference, not an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt; As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation that is consistent with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

When scientists use the idea of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may have nothing to do with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

It has been suggested that Occam's razor is a widely accepted example of extraevidential consideration, even though it is entirely a metaphysical assumption. There is little [[empirical evidence]] that the world is actually simple or that simple accounts are more likely to be true than complex ones.&lt;ref name="fn_(120)"&gt;{{cite journal |date=4 February 1994 |author1=Naomi Oreskes |author2=Kristin Shrader-Frechette |author3=Kenneth Belitz |title=Verification, Validation, and Confirmation of Numerical Models in the Earth Sciences |journal=Science |volume=263 |pages=641–646 |url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;see note 25 |issue=5147 |bibcode=1994Sci...263..641O |doi=10.1126/science.263.5147.641 |pmid=17747657 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502042408/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, Occam's razor is a conservative tool, cutting out "crazy, complicated constructions" and assuring "that hypotheses are grounded in the science of the day", thus yielding "normal" science: models of explanation and prediction.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)" /&gt; There are, however, notable exceptions where Occam's razor turns a conservative scientist into a reluctant revolutionary. For example, [[Max Planck]] interpolated between the [[Wien approximation|Wien]] and [[Rayleigh–Jeans law|Jeans]] radiation laws and used Occam's razor logic to formulate the quantum hypothesis, even resisting that hypothesis as it became more obvious that it was correct.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt;

Appeals to simplicity were used to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, [[ball lightning]], [[continental drift]], and [[reverse transcriptase]]{{fact|date=August 2018}}. One can argue for atomic building blocks for matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the [[atomic theory]] was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles that had not been directly detected. [[Ernst Mach]] and the logical positivists rejected [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] until the reality of atoms was more evident in [[Brownian motion]], as shown by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=Pojman2009&gt;{{cite book |year=2009 |author=Paul Pojman |chapter=Ernst Mach |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ernst-mach/ |place=California |publisher=Stanford University |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, postulating the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] is more complex than transmission of light through a [[vacuum]]. At the time, however, all known waves propagated through a physical medium, and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium. Likewise, Newton's idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygens's idea of waves, so many favored it. In this case, as it turned out, neither the wave—nor the particle—explanation alone suffices, as [[wave–particle duality|light behaves like waves and like particles]].

Three axioms presupposed by the scientific method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

There are examples where Occam's razor would have favored the wrong theory given the available data. Simplicity principles are useful philosophical preferences for choosing a more likely theory from among several possibilities that are all consistent with available data. A single instance of Occam's razor favoring a wrong theory falsifies the razor as a general principle.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; Michael Lee and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = M.

If multiple models of natural law make exactly the same testable predictions, they are equivalent and there is no need for parsimony to choose a preferred one. For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

=== Biology ===
Biologists or philosophers of biology use Occam's razor in either of two contexts both in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]: the units of selection controversy and [[systematics]]. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966) argues that the best way to explain [[altruism]] among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson &amp; E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as [[Morgan's Canon]]: "In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development." (Morgan 1903).

However, more recent biological analyses, such as [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', have contended that Morgan's Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as [[Emergent evolution|emergent]] features of evolution.

[[Zoology]] provides an example. [[Muskox]]en, when threatened by [[Gray wolf|wolves]], form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.  Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles.  Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf – which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males.  It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring.  That would be an example of regular natural selection – a phenomenon called "the selfish herd".

[[Systematics]] is the branch of [[biology]] that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that [[genealogy]] alone should determine classification, pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sober|first1=Elliot|title=Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference|date=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-69144-2|page=7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is among the cladists that Occam's razor is to be found, although their term for it is ''cladistic parsimony''. Cladistic parsimony (or [[maximum parsimony]]) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of [[phylogenetic trees]] (more specifically, cladograms). [[Cladistics|Cladograms]] are branching, tree-like structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on shared, derived character states. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations. Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree, parsimony consistently produces the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or [[long branch attraction]]). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened.  Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, AVZ. 2017.  Statistical consistency and phylogenetic inference: a brief review.  Cladistics. (early view:  {{DOI|10.1111/cla.12216}})&lt;/ref&gt;  For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see [[Elliott Sober]]'s ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference'' (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam's razor in biology, see Sober's article "Let's Razor Ockham's Razor" (1990).

Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. [[Likelihood function|Likelihood]] methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ [[information theory]], a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.

[[Francis Crick]] has commented on potential limitations of Occam's razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: "While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research."&lt;ref&gt;Crick 1988, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biogeography]], parsimony is used to infer ancient [[Historical migration|migrations]] of [[species]] or [[population]]s by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing [[organism]]s. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement.

=== Religion ===
{{Main| Existence of God}}

In the [[philosophy of religion]], Occam's razor is sometimes applied to the [[existence of God]]. [[William of Ockham]] himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Scripture; he writes that "nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ |publisher=Stanford |title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |contribution=William Ockham |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. However, unlike many theologians of his time, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery, but theology was a matter of [[revelation]] and [[faith]]. He states: "only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover."&lt;ref&gt;Dale T Irvin &amp; Scott W Sunquist. ''History of World Christian Movement Volume, I: Earliest Christianity to 1453'', p. 434. {{ISBN|9781570753961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', uses a formulation of Occam's razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In turn, Aquinas answers this with the ''[[quinque viae]]'', and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who viewed belief in God as a [[leap of faith]] that sometimes directly opposed reason.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the doctrine of [[Gordon Clark]]'s [[presuppositional apologetics]], with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also [[Fideism]]).

Various [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments in favor of God]] establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]]).

Another application of the principle is to be found in the work of [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against [[materialism]], stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find [[Solipsism|solipsism]] itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.

Occam's razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Napoleon]]. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of [[Lagrange]], appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, "It's because I had no need of that hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;p. 282, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ ''Mémoires du docteur F. Antommarchi, ou les derniers momens de Napoléon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514072842/https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ |date=14 May 2016 }}, vol. 1, 1825, Paris: Barrois L'Ainé&lt;/ref&gt; Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's [[atheism]], more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of [[methodological naturalism]], or even simply that the fewer [[premise|logical premises]] one assumes, the [[List of mathematical jargon#strong|stronger]] is one's conclusion.

In his article "Sensations and Brain Processes" (1959), [[J. J. C. Smart]] invoked Occam's razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over [[mind-body dualism|spirit-body dualism]]. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam's razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. [[Paul Churchland]] (1984) states that by itself Occam's razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam's razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of [[folk psychology]] including such entities as "pain", "joy", "desire", "fear", etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.

=== Penal ethics ===
In penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of [[punishment]] in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the philosophy of punishment, [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s "parsimony principle" states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern [[restorative justice]], and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the [[prison abolition movement]]. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the [[sensibility]] of the individual—an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tonry | first1 = Michael | year = 2005 | title =  Obsolescence and Immanence in Penal Theory and Policy | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074821/http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf | journal = [[Columbia Law Review]] | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 1233–1275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probability theory and statistics ===
Marcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|Solomonoff's mathematical formalization of the razor]] to calculate the expected value of an action.

There are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam's razor from probability theory, applying it in [[statistical inference]], and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference.

One of the problems with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on [[Bayes factor]]s and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as [[Akaike information criterion]], [[Bayesian information criterion]], [[Variational Bayesian methods]], [[false discovery rate]], and [[Laplace's method]] are used. Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on [[Occam Learning]] or more generally on the [[Free energy principle]].

Statistical versions of Occam's razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term ''simplicity'', and that definition can vary. For example, in the [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]–[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] [[minimum description length]] approach, the subject must pick a [[Turing machine]] whose operations describe the basic operations ''believed'' to represent "simplicity" by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam's razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.

==== Objective razor ====
The minimum instruction set of a [[universal Turing machine]] requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of most practical theories. [[Marcus Hutter]] has used this consistency to define a "natural" Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|title=Algorithmic Information Theory|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224043538/http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|archivedate=24 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the program for the universal program as the "hypothesis", and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] that "the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized."&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. B. Vitányi and Ming Li; ''IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'', Volume 46, Issue 2, Mar 2000 Page(s):446–464, "Minimum Description Length Induction, Bayesianism and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a two-part message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the [[minimum message length]] (MML) principle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One possible conclusion from mixing the concepts of Kolmogorov complexity and Occam's razor is that an ideal data compressor would also be a scientific explanation/formulation generator. Some attempts have been made to re-derive known laws from considerations of simplicity or compressibility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0001020|title= Why Occam's Razor|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|volume=17|issue=3|pages=255–266|last1=Standish|first1=Russell K|year=2000|doi=10.1023/B:FOPL.0000032475.18334.0e|bibcode=2004FoPhL..17..255S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], the appropriate mathematical theory of Occam's razor already exists, namely, [[Ray Solomonoff|Solomonoff's]] [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of optimal inductive inference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomonoff | first1 = Ray | authorlink = Ray Solomonoff | year = 1964 | title = A formal theory of inductive inference.

== Controversial aspects of the razor ==
Occam's razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity, or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may.{{Refn|"Ockham's razor does not say that the more simple a hypothesis, the better."&lt;ref name=SkepticDict2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert T. Carroll |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |chapter=Occam's Razor |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter-url=http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Last updated 18 February 2012 |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301193834/http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |archivedate=1 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Occam's razor is used to adjudicate between theories that have already passed "theoretical scrutiny" tests and are equally well-supported by evidence.{{Refn|"Today, we think of the principle of parsimony as a heuristic device. We don't assume that the simpler theory is correct and the more complex one false. We know from experience that more often than not the theory that requires more complicated machinations is wrong. Until proved otherwise, the more complex theory competing with a simpler explanation should be put on the back burner, but not thrown onto the trash heap of history until proven false."&lt;ref name="SkepticDict2012" /&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Furthermore, it may be used to prioritize empirical testing between two equally plausible but unequally testable hypotheses; thereby minimizing costs and wastes while increasing chances of falsification of the simpler-to-test hypothesis.

Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or [[syntax]]), while its [[ontology]] (or [[semantics]]) becomes simpler, or vice versa.{{Refn|"While these two facets of simplicity are frequently conflated, it is important to treat them as distinct. One reason for doing so is that considerations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in different directions. Postulating extra entities may allow a theory to be formulated more simply, while reducing the ontology of a theory may only be possible at the price of making it syntactically more complex."&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Quine, in a discussion on definition, referred to these two perspectives as "economy of practical expression" and "economy in grammar and vocabulary", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W V O|last=Quine|author-link= W. V. Quine|year=1961|chapter=Two dogmas of empiricism|title= From a logical point of view|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=20–46|isbn=0-674-32351-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galileo Galilei]] lampooned the ''misuse'' of Occam's razor in his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]]''. The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.

== Anti-razors ==
Occam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. [[Walter Chatton]] (c. 1290–1343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347) who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own ''anti-razor:'' "If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on." Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution ''Se non è vero, è ben trovato'' ("Even if it is not true, it is well conceived") when referred to a particularly artful explanation.

Anti-razors have also been created by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), and [[Karl Menger]] (1902–1985). Leibniz's version took the form of a [[principle of plenitude]], as [[Arthur Lovejoy]] has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam's razor and thus created his own counter-razor: "The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Critique of Pure Reason|year=1929|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|author=[[Immanuel Kant]]|editor=Norman Kemp-Smith transl|accessdate=27 October 2012|page=92|quote=Entium varietates non temere esse minuendas|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516172030/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables, so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: "Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy" and "It is vain to do with fewer what requires more." A less serious but (some{{Who|date=May 2015}} might say) even more extremist anti-razor is [['Pataphysics]], the "science of imaginary solutions" developed by [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873–1907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, "'Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own." Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his story/mock-essay "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]". There is also [[Crabtree's Bludgeon]], which cynically states that "[n]o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated."

'''Peer critique''', a specialized form of [[critique]], is the common practice of writers reviewing and providing constructive criticism of each other's work. Most fiction writers use some form of peer critique as part of their process of writing.

== In action ==

=== In the classroom ===

Peer critique has long been used as part of the process of teaching writing. In traditional classrooms power and authority can often be teacher-centric,&lt;ref&gt;Goodfellow, R. (2001). Credit where it is due: Assessing students’ contributions to collaborative online learning. In D. Murphy, R. Walker, &amp; G. Webb (Eds.), Online learning and teaching with technology (73–80). London: Kogan Page.&lt;/ref&gt; with teachers correcting work to their own vision of ideal writing.&lt;ref&gt;Gere, A. R., &amp; Stevens, R. (1985). The language of writing groups: How oral response shapes revision. In S. W. Freedman (Ed.). The acquisition of written language: Response and
revision (85–105). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.
&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers have found that peer critique offers a complementary style of feedback&lt;ref&gt;Cho, K., Schunn, C. D., &amp; Charney, D. (2006). Commenting on writing: Typology and perceived helpfulness of comments from novice peer reviewers and subject matter experts. Written Communication, 23, 260–294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Topping, K., (1988). Peer assessment between students in colleges and universities. Review of Educational Research, 68(3). 249–276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Topping, K., Smith, E. F., Swanson, I., &amp; Elliot, A. (2000). Formative peer assessment of academic writing between postgraduate students. Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education, 25(2), 149–169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saito, H., &amp; Tomoko, F. (2004). Characteristics and user acceptance of peer rating in EFL writing classrooms, Language Teaching Research, 8(1), 31–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas teachers' feedback often focuses on general comments and error correction, peers tend to give specific, deep comments on the work before them rather than correcting to an ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Caulk, N. (1997). Comparing teacher and student responses to written work. TESOL Quarterly, 28(1), 181–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his groundbreaking 1973 book ''Writing without Teachers'', [[Peter Elbow]]&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, P. (1973). Writing without Teachers. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; stated a powerful argument for peer-only writing classes, eliminating the teacher from the process entirely. Many informal writing groups still use Elbow's methods for peer critique.

Peer critique has also been found to be useful to those who provide critiques, helping students to develop analytical and critical thinking abilities and become better able to judge their own writing.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. (1984). Helping students help themselves: Peer evaluation of writing. Curriculum Review, 23, 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it can also in today’s era be harmful to a students psyche, as these critiques can cause emotional distress on the one being critiqued.  Many of today’s youths can take the critique in a negative manor which can cause them to self doubt or ultimately become depressed.  It has been said that this method maybe outdated and harmful in our age of information.

=== Outside the classroom ===

Peer writing groups have existed probably as long as writing has. Anne Ruggles Gere has written several useful articles and books about the history of writing groups, and how they have evolved over time from social "clubs" and [[chautauquas]] to the many types of groups we have today, including online peer critique sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gere, A. R. (1987). Writing groups: History, theory and implications. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gere, A. R., &amp; Abbot, R. D. (1985). Talking about writing: The language of writing groups. Research in the Teaching of English, 19, 362–379.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gere, A. R., &amp; Stevens, R. (1985). The language of writing groups: How oral response shapes revision. In S. W. Freedman (Ed.). The acquisition of written language: Response and revision (85–105). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Face-to-face critiques ===

The most traditional form of peer critique, both inside and outside the classroom, is face-to-face. In this method, writers gather together in person and discuss each other's work in detail. Face-to-face writing groups (also known as [[writing circles]], [[writing groups]], or workshops) can be a source of great support and encouragement for writers in what is sometimes a lonely endeavor. The greatest challenge for informal groups is keeping a face-to-face critique group together; many fall apart quickly due to lack of commitment, personality conflicts, or hurt feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, P. (1973). Writing without Teachers. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online writing classes ===

In recent years with the advent of the [[Blackboard Learning System]] and similar online teaching tools, it has become possible to take writing courses entirely online. In online courses students generally give each other feedback on writing in message-board style posts. Comments are usually brief. Teachers must beware of the "pile-on effect" of students merely echoing what teachers and previous commenters have mentioned; it will be useful for teachers to apply lessons from peer critique websites, which have functioned online for many years.

=== Online critique sites ===

Since at least 1985, with the [http://community.compuserve.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?webtag=ws-books&amp;redirCnt=1 Compuserve Books &amp; Writer's Forum], writers have formed writing spaces online where they can discuss writing, share resources, and critique work{{fact|date=October 2014}}. There are many active critique sites now, catering to all levels and genres of writers; the popular website Reddit has a sub-reddit dedicated to writing critique, titled [https://www.reddit.com/r/critiquemywriting critique my writing.], while another popular forum, [http://www.writingforums.com www.writingforums.com], is dedicated to writing and online critique. Other peer critique sites include [[Authonomy]] and [[Youwriteon]].

== Types of critique sites ==

Online peer critique sites tend to vary by:
* Charge: Some sites are free, some require membership, and some charge only for premium services
* Privacy: Sites vary on whether they are open to public view, require a password, or require approval by moderators to join
* Style: Many sites use general message-board formats, though some use e-mail loops for actual work
* Genre: There are specific critique sites for romance writers, science fiction/fantasy writers, short story writers, etc.
* Commitment: Nearly all sites generally require some time or activity commitment, but sites vary significantly on how much is required to receive critiques
* Moderation: Some sites are only lightly moderated, and some heavily; a few sites even have editors on staff who judge critiques
* Level of expertise: Some sites cater to beginners, while others have many advanced and published authors on their rosters

[[File:Guantanamo Cellblock, Camp Delta - 1.jpg|thumb|320px|A typical Prison cell block in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay detention center]], camp delta.]]

'''Prison violence''' is a daily occurrence due to the diverse inmates with varied [[criminal]] backgrounds in [[Penitentiary|penitentiaries]]. The three different types of attacks are [[inmate]] on inmate, inmate on guard, and self-inflicted. These attacks can either be impulsive and spontaneous or well-planned out and premeditated.&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan Jr.|first1=William J.|title=The Major Causes of Institutional Violence|journal=American Jails|date=December 2009|volume=23|issue=5|pages=63, 65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Factors such as [[Gangs|gang]] rivalries, [[Prison overcrowding|overcrowding]], minor disputes, and [[prison design]] contribute to the violent attacks that transpire.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Prisons are trying to avoid, or at least better deal with these situations by being proactive. They are taking steps like placing violent convicts and gang leaders into [[solitary confinement]], balancing the cells by critically examining each inmate to see where they are likely to reside peacefully, reducing blind spots, and training as well as educating the officers.&lt;ref name="La Vigne"&gt;{{cite web|last1=La Vigne|first1=Nancy G.|last2=Debus-Sherrill|first2=Sara|last3=Brazzell|first3=Diana|last4=Downey|first4=P. Mitchell|title=Preventing Violence and sexual Assault in Jail: A situational Crime Prevention Approach|publisher=Urban Institute|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acts of violence ==
Prison [[violence]] is inflicted onto either another [[Prisoner|inmate]], a [[prison guard]], or themselves. In 1999, it was reported that one in five inmates, or twenty percent of inmates, at fourteen [[state prisons]] had been physically assaulted by another inmate.&lt;ref name="La Vigne" /&gt;  Prison violence can consist of inmates fighting with their fists, homemade [[Weapon|weapons]], or being [[rape]]d.  The attacks that are implemented onto anyone but the self are either instrumental or expressive.

* '''Instrumental violence''' is premeditated; it is planned out, calculated, and then implemented. More commonly executed by males,&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt; this act typically establishes power and is, “…justified and rationalized by the inmate population by creating peer admiration, fear, protection…”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Typically, surviving in prison involves establishing strength and power, which is why instrumental violence is so commonly used.

* '''Expressive violence''' is a spontaneous attack typically carried out by women.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  In this tactic, the attacker lashes out suddenly due to intense feelings of danger, fear, anger or resentment, resulting in the sudden jump into action.  It can be concluded that expressive violence is a more responsive attack that occurs when the perpetrator feels provoked or threatened, whereas instrumental violence is carefully planned out and driven by vengeance.

* '''[[Self-harm]]''' is a purely [[psychological]] act.  Many people that get sentenced to prison often suffer from or develop [[mental disorders]] such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]], and need psychiatric attention.&lt;ref name="La Vigne"/&gt;  Due to influences such as their surroundings, the harsh treatment they receive from officers and inmates, and their sentencing time, self-harm and [[suicide]] rates are believed to be higher in prison populations than any non-incarcerated population.&lt;ref name="La Vigne"/&gt;

== Where violence occurs ==
Prison violence is capable of occurring anywhere throughout a prison. Any inmate is capable of acting rash and snapping at any given moment, that an outbreak can occur anywhere and at any time.  Oftentimes, an inmate will look for a place that offers a sufficient amount of time to commit their act proficiently.  If they are outside of their cell, they have the chance to smuggle out a homemade weapon by placing it up their [[rectum]].&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Graeme|title=How Gangs Took Over Prisons|journal=Atlantic Media Company|date=October 2014|volume=314|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these acts can occur anywhere, a very common place inmates search for is a blind spot.

=== Blind spots ===
Prisons are covered with guards standing watch, [[CCTV]], or a combination of the two.  Neither of these can possibly cover every inch of a prison’s ground, which is why “…blind spots…allow inmates to conceal illicit activity from security staff”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Therefore, inmates purposefully look for these blind spots to commit violent acts undetected by prison guards.  The inmate’s goal is to know that they are going to be able to complete the act of violence to the degree that they desire without guards noticing and intervening.  Inmates look for places that give them more time to complete their attacks.

== Causes of violence ==
The perpetrators of violent attacks are convicted criminals, some of whom in prison for committing crimes that left multiple people brutally beaten and left for dead, so violence is in many of these individual’s nature.  These people, “…settle disputes and seek power in the way they are accustomed- through violence”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  This natural fire in their bellies is undoubtedly a huge factor that goes into why prison violence occurs, but the physical design of the prison can serve as another factor. A prison can either have indirect or direct supervision.  Both types of supervision have their strengths, but also detrimental weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;

=== Indirect supervision ===
Indirect supervision is when a correctional officer is placed in an enclosed booth and must constantly watch over the inmates through a [[bird’s eye view]].  The physical interactions that officers have with the inmates is minimal, for most of the communication comes through an [[intercom]] system.  Inmates are placed in their own cells and officers have physical barriers to ensure their own safety.  When havoc is wreaked, a call for a response team is placed over the intercom.  This type of supervision is strong, but has some drawbacks, such as the creation of blind spots.  These are created through indirect supervision because the guards standing watch can have objects blocking tiny spots or they may just not be looking in the right direction at the right time.  Indirect supervision is an impersonal and more distant form of supervision that helps with officer safety, but leaves blind spots for “…inmates to conceal illicit activity from security staff”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;

=== Direct supervision ===
Direct supervision is a more personal type of design because officers are assigned a cell block to patrol. Through this layout, the guards actually speak to cellmates one-on-one.  The minor altercations that take place throughout the day is directly handled by the patrol officer, but this single officer cannot prevent a violent attack from happening. As soon as their back is turned or their attention is focused on someone else, the perpetrator can still commit their violence.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  In this form of supervision officers are left more vulnerable, but it also leads to, “…decreased tension and stress of staff and inmates…”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Direct supervision is more of a hands-on form of management, where “…major incidents are not as numerous and minor incidents result in higher numbers…”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;

=== Overcrowding ===
[[prison overcrowding|Overcrowding]] is a huge problem many prisons face &lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt; because handling so many short-fused inmates at once can lead to many altercations.  The combination of “…overcrowding, inadequate supervision, and inmate access to weapons- can create opportunities for…offenses”.&lt;ref name="La Vigne" /&gt;  Trying to assert authority and strict rules on these violent offenders is extremely difficult due to the fact that these people do not respond well to restrictions and being told what to do.  Having to focus on so many dangerous people at once is just not possible because there will always be someone not being watched over at any given moment; this is most likely when inmates choose to strike.  Overcrowding is a very common issue in American prisons that leads to prison violence because the prisons will be understaffed.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;

=== Staffing levels ===
Prison violence and [[prison suicide]] in [[England]] and [[Wales]] have been increasing year on year while staffing levels have been falling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37702964 Are prisons becoming more dangerous places?] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Reduction in the number of staff is blamed for this and the [[Ministry of Justice]] has admitted that staff cuts are a factor.&lt;ref name="Guardian27/10/2016"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/27/prison-violence-staff-cuts-moj-deaths-assaults Prison violence epidemic partly due to staff cuts, MoJ admits] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  It was felt urgent action was needed.  The government has provided money for increased staff but staffing levels are set to remain below 2010 levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37789042 Prison violence in England and Wales up yet again] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37842500 Truss to hold talks with prison officers over violence] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/ministry-justice-urged-get-grip-prison-staffing-amid-rising-violence Ministry of Justice urged to "get a grip" on prison staffing amid rising violence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/02/prisons-in-england-and-wales-given-boost-of-2500-new-staff-to-tackle-violence Prisons in England and Wales to get 2,500 extra staff to tackle violence] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Day, of the [[Prison Reform Trust]] spoke of a “hidden emergency unfolding in our prison system” and said increasing prison violence should not become the new normal the lives of people living and working in prisons depended on that.  [[Frances Crook]], of the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]], said: 
{{quote|Cutting staff and prison budgets while allowing the number of people behind bars to grow unchecked has created a toxic mix of violence, death and human misery … Today’s figures show that we cannot wait for legislation – bold and radical action is needed now to stop the death toll rising further.&lt;ref name="Guardian27/10/2016"/&gt;}}

== Weapons used ==
Most inmates look to get into an altercation armed with some sort of homemade weapon.  The weapons they use to attack their victims are made to be very destructive and can easily be both hidden and accessed.  They use objects such as shanks, [[Club (weapon)|clubs]], [[dagger]]s, [[razors]], and saps to serve as weapons.&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lincoln|first1=J.M.|last2=Chen|first2=L-H|last3=Mair|first3=J.S.|last4=Biermann|first4=P.J.|last5=Baker|first5=S.P.|title=Inmate-made weapons in prison facilities: assessing the injury risk|journal=Brief Report|date=29 March 2006|pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A shank is a homemade knife,&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt; and is used to stab the person they are planning on fighting with, typically created by sharpening a common object.  Clubs are considered “…objects such as pitchers, hot pots, and broom handles…”.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;  They are put into use by throwing or hitting their target with these objects.  A sap is typically a [[padlock]] enclosed in a sock,&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt; but really any hard object can be placed inside.  Their prey is hit, typically over the head, with this weapon.  [[Razor blades]] are very commonly used to commit prison violence.  When an inmate knows there is a possibly of facing an attack, they will often place razors inside their mouths (in their cheeks) so that they can spit the razor out of their mouth and slash up the other person’s face.  Since this tactic has been caught onto, many times a person will first punch whomever they are fighting in the face so that if a razor is in there, their whole mouth will get cut up.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  An inmate can choose the shank, club, dagger, razor, or sap as their weapon of choice to either do harm or protect themselves.   When it comes to creating these weapons, prisoners really do serve as craftsmen and make weapon-making into an art of the sort.

== Weapon creation ==
The prison store, supplies provided by prisons, and objects visitors bring&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt; are typically where the weapon creation process begins.  They get a hold of items, “…such as disposable razors and [[toothbrushes]]”.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;  Then, these materials get manipulated and transformed into a weapon of destruction. They may sharpen it or harden it using other items.  In other instances, “Items that appear innocuous have been converted into weapons”.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.correctionsone.com/officer-safety/articles/8691247-What-are-the-most-dangerous-makeshift-prison-weapons/|title=What are the most dangerous makeshift prison weapons?|newspaper=CorrectionsOne|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inmates also use everyday items in their natural form in dangerous ways that is clearly not used as they were originally intended.  Often, when an inmate uses this form to create their weapons, it is used on officers because the items do not look questionable so it is easy to catch the corrections officer off guard.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;  Some will, “…fashion the metal post of a bunk bed or the edge of a cell door into a spear…that could be flung from inside a cell and penetrate a man’s neck or liver”,&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; which is called the bone crusher.  Some inmates will go to great lengths to create weapons and many different ways to create these weapons has been discovered.

== Security threat groups ==
Officers call prison gangs STGs, or [[Prison gang|security threat groups]].  These groups are highly dangerous and take part in a huge majority of attacks that occur in prisons.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Originally, “The early formation of STGs was based on racial/ethnic ideologies and protection from other groups.  Later they developed the intent to commit acts of violence and form crime syndicates”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  These gangs’ sole purpose is to have control and dominance, which is gained through violent attacks.  Often, these attacks are committed onto rivals and people issued in the Bad News List.  The Bad News List can be presumed as a factor for prison violence.   This list is circulated among a gang and once a name is found on this list, it is inevitable that they will be attacked.  A person is typically place on the Bad News List if they, “…stole from an affiliate on the outside, or because you failed to repay a drug debt, or because you’re suspected of ratting someone out”.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  The people on the list will be attacked on sight, but once their debts are paid, they are immediately removed from the Bad News List.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  Most, if not all, gang prison violence is instrumental and is very intricately planned out.  Gang members will often send out or receive encoded, in depth letters on violent attacks that are ordered to take place, other times, “…gang members used the drainage pipes of their in-cell toilets to communicate clandestinely across cellblocks…”.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  It has become clear that, “Extensive communication systems coordinated between inmates, criminal activity, and street gangs are common”,&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; and a vast majority of the prison violence that occurs begins with these communication systems.  Security threat groups are at the heart of many of the altercations that take place within prison walls and they remorselessly commit these vicious acts simply because they are ordered to do so.

== Violence against prison guards ==
Inmates often feel animosity and a sense of hatred towards prison guards due to the treatment they receive and the power the guards have over them.  In 1999, more than 2,400 correctional officers required medical attention after being assaulted by an inmate, and according to a 2002-2003 study, most guards were assaulted through the use of clubs.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;  Along with these clubs, inmates tend to use weapons of opportunity when attacking an officer.  A weapon of opportunity is any typical, everyday object that is not considered a weapon until used in a destructive way.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;  The reason for this hostility, and ultimately inmate attacks on guards can be placed onto the way the incarcerated are treated.

Inmates are often humiliated and have extreme force placed upon them.   There are no excuses that can be made in an officer’s offense to defend these actions, unless their life was put into jeopardy.  Implementing these uncalled for actions reasonably cause animosity between the inmates and guards.  There are cases where if an inmate disobeys an order, “…groups of officers…approach his cell, dressed in protective gear and armed with shield, [[Taser]]s, and other weapons.  If the inmate refuses to comply, the officers will flood his cell with chemical agents…they have reportedly thrown stinger grenades, which spray rubber pellets into a concentrated area…and violently subdue him”.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Derek S.|title=Cruel but Not Unusual|journal=Commonweal|date=13 June 2014|volume=141|issue=11|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Correctional and Detention personnel use force as a last resort, in the above scenario; entry into an inmate's cell would need to be necessary before force could be justified. For example, if an inmate has a court hearing and has barricaded himself in his cell, refusing to come out or comply with the officials orders force might be used. Another instance would be if the inmate needed to be transferred to another facility and refuses to comply with the directives to move.

== Violence prevention measures ==
Preventing all prison violence is an impossible task because it is impossible to be prepared for any and every situation.  Nevertheless, prisons are taking measures to avoid, or at least limit, this violence.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  They are doing things such as balancing the cells, reducing blind spots, and training officers.  When prisons receive new inmates, they search the background of the individual; they look into things like any possible gang affiliation and any history of [[racism]] or anger issues.  After piecing this information together, the officers will place them in a cell block that they feel is most appropriate and that will cause the least arousal between the new inmate and the ones already housed there.  Reducing the blind spots is a difficult task to complete because it is impossible to watch every inch of the prison at once, but by watching over as much as possible at a time does reduce the chances of violence occurring.  Training officers is the third measure being taken.  If officers treat the inmates properly and not be rash and assert violence on them so quickly, the inmates may feel more respected and not look to retaliate.  Also with the training, officers are learning how to deal with minor altercations more effectively, as in without force and violence unless necessary.  Also, the correction officers are learning about the psychology of the inmates.  These officers are becoming aware of the psychological differences and hardships the incarcerated tend to face and how to properly deal with them.&lt;ref name="La Vigne" /&gt;  If all of these precautionary measures are taken, then prison violence rates can definitely lower, although completely vanishing is something not likely.

=== Supermax facilities ===
A [[Supermax prison|supermax]] is a separate facility within a prison where inmates are placed, “…for violent/predatory behavior within other institutions.  They may be identified as gang leaders, or considered high risk for escape. Inmates incarcerated in the supermax facility do not have the freedoms allowed inmates in general population because of their security status/institutional disciplinary record”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  These inmates are placed in a cell for twenty three hours a day and have limitation than the typical convict possess.  This prevention measure works because it takes the biggest threats and influences, such as gang members, out of the picture.  An issue that arises with this is that, “…some prisoners subjected to isolation become so damaged that they pose a renewed threat to staff and inmates when they return to the general prison population”.&lt;ref name="Jeffreys"/&gt;  This means that the already dangerous and threatening inmates can return to the regular prison population with a new, stronger desire to retaliate and cause prison violence.&lt;ref name="Jeffreys"/&gt; The supermax facility serves as a good method to eradicate the influence of the most dangerous of inmates, but risks the return of a vengeful inmate.

'''Rational-legal authority''' (also known as '''rational authority''', '''legal authority''', '''rational domination''', '''legal domination''', or '''bureaucratic authority''') is a form of [[leadership]] in which the [[authority]] of an [[organization]] or a ruling [[regime]] is largely tied to legal [[rationality]], [[Legitimacy (political science)|legal legitimacy]] and [[bureaucracy]]. The majority of the modern [[State (polity)|states]] of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are rational-legal authorities, according to those who use this form of classification.

==Rational-legal authority==
In [[sociology]], the concept of rational-legal domination comes from [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]] (one of several classifications of government used by sociologists); the other two forms being [[traditional authority]] and [[charismatic authority]]. All of those three domination types represent an example of his [[ideal type]] concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition. Charismatic authority is legitimized by the personality and leadership qualities of the ruling individual. Finally, rational-legal authority derives its powers from the system of [[bureaucracy]] and [[legality]].

==Legal rationality and legitimate authority ==
Under rational-legal authority, legitimacy is seen as coming from a legal order and the laws that have been enacted in it (see also [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]]).

Weber defined legal order as a system where the rules are enacted and obeyed as legitimate because they are in line with other laws on how they can be enacted and how they should be obeyed. Further, they are enforced by a government that monopolizes their enactment and the [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|legitimate use of physical force]].

If society, as a whole, approves the exercise of the power in a certain way, then the power is considered "legitimate authority". 
* An example of this type of authority would be the viewing of a police car in our rear view mirrors.

== Max Weber's theory: type of authority ==
Max Weber broke down legitimate authority into three different types of societies: Traditional Authority, Rational-legal Authority, and Charismatic Authority. Each of these authorities have their own unique complex societies that have evolved from simple definitions.

=== 1.Traditional authority: traditional grounds ===

* Is the type of power that has been around longer, it is the type of power that is traditionally rooted in beliefs and the practices of society. This authority is liked by many individuals because of two main reasons: the inheritance of past generations and religiousness that the societies have.
* Traditional authority is based on a tradition or custom that is followed by the traditional leaders. In traditional authority, status is a key concept. There are no requirements to serving a traditional leader but there are no salaries. The consequences to traditional authority are discouragement of education and rational calculation.
* Traditional authority consists of a dominant profile, one who embodies tradition and rule. This type of leadership exemplifies the power to construct order.

=== 2. Rational-legal authority: rational grounds ===

* Acquire from law and is constructed from the reliance of society's rules and laws. This type of authority has the confidence to leave the right of leaders to undertake the decisions and set the policy. Rational-legal authority is the basis of modern democracies. Examples of this type of authority: officials elected by voters, rules that are in the constitution, or policies that are written in a formal document.
* Rational-legal authority is built on a structure of bureaucr
* Rational-legal authority requires a logical and systematic approach to leadership. Weber's rational leadership prevails in decision making.

=== 3. Charismatic authority: charismatic grounds ===

* Comes from individuals and their personal qualities that they have to offer. Certain individuals are influential to others with their unique qualities which help them gain followers. The "charismatic" individuals exercise power and authority over a whole society or even a specific group of within a bigger society. The exercise of their power of these individuals are either for good or bad. Examples of these charismatic leaders can range from: Joan of Arc to Adolf Hitler or Martin Luther king Jr to Jesus Christ.
* Charismatic authority has no clear structure. It is based one's individual influence.  One is chosen to be staff by their charismatic characteristics. Someone under a charismatic authority lives under gifts not salary. As long as someone has influence they will be a legitimate power.
* In charismatic authority, confidence is the driving force for leadership. With charismatic authority leadership has the ability to connect distinct groups and lead them to the finish line.

==Emergence of the modern state==
Weber wrote that the modern state based on rational-legal authority emerged from the patrimonial and feudal struggle for power (see [[traditional authority]]) uniquely in the [[Western culture|Occidental civilization]]. The prerequisites for the modern Western state are:
* Monopolization by central authority of the means of administration and control based on a centralized and stable system of taxation and use of physical force
* Monopolization of legislative
* Organisation of an officialdom, dependent upon the central authority

Weber argued that some of those attributes have existed in various time or places, but together they existed only in Occidental civilization. The conditions that favoured this were
* Emergence of rational-legal rationality (various [[status class|status groups]] in the [[Western world|Occident]] promoted that emergence)
* Emergence of modern officialdom (bureaucracy), which required
** Development of the money economy, where officials are compensated in money instead of kind (usually land grants)
** Quantitative and qualitative expansion of administrative tasks
** Centralization and increased efficiency of administration.

Weber's belief that rational-legal authority did not exist in [[History of China|Imperial China]] has been heavily criticized, and does not have many supporters in the early 21st century.

==Modern state==
According to Max Weber, a modern state exists where a political community has:
* An administrative and legal order that has been created and can be changed by legislation that also determines its role
* Binding authority over citizens and actions in its jurisdiction
* The right to legitimately use the physical force in its jurisdiction

An important attribute of Weber's definition of a modern state was that it is a [[bureaucracy]].

The vast majority of the modern states from the 20th century onward fall under the rational-legal authority category.

==Rational-legal leaders==
The majority of modern [[bureaucrat|bureaucratic officials]] and [[politician|political leaders]] represent this type of authority.

&lt;u&gt;Officials:&lt;/u&gt;
* Are personally free.
* Serve a higher authority.
* Are appointed on the basis of conduct and their technical qualifications.
* Are responsible for the impartial execution of assigned tasks.
* Their work is a full-time occupation.
* Their work is rewarded by a salary and prospects of career advancement.

&lt;u&gt;Politicians:&lt;/u&gt;
* Are solely responsible for independent action.
* Must recognize that public actions that conflict with their basic policy must be rejected.
* Should have [[charismatic authority|charismatic appeal]] to win [[election]]s under conditions of [[universal suffrage]].
&lt;u&gt;Additional, Weber provided ten necessities addressing: "how individual officials are appointed and work". The administrative staff are under the supreme authority for legal authority in a bureaucratic administrative style.&lt;/u&gt;

# They are personally free and subject to authority only with respect to their impersonal official obligation.
# They are organized in a clearly defined hierarchy of offices.
# Each office has a clearly defined sphere of competence in the legal sense.
# The office is filled by a free contractual relationship or free selection.
# Candidates are selected on the basis of technical qualification.
# They are remunerated by fixed salaries in money for the most part, with a right to pensions.
# The office is treated as the sole, or at least primary, occupation of incumbent.
# It constitutes a career. Promotions are dependent on the judgement of superiors.
# The official works entirely separated from ownership of the means of administration and without appropriation of his/her position.
# He is subject to strict and systematic discipline and control in the conduct of the office.

{{Mental state}}
'''Relaxation''' in [[psychology]], is the [[emotional state]] of a living being, of low tension, in which there is an absence of [[arousal]] that could come from sources such as [[anger]], [[anxiety]], or [[fear]].  According to the [[Oxford dictionary]]&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary (2014). Relaxation,
http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/relaxation?q=relaxation+
&lt;/ref&gt; relaxation is when the body and mind are free from tension and anxiety. Relaxation is a form of mild ecstasy coming from the frontal lobe of the brain in which the backward cortex sends signals to the frontal cortex via a mild sedative. Relaxation can be achieved through [[meditation]], [[autogenics]], and [[progressive muscle relaxation]]. Relaxation helps improve coping with [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. Stress is the leading cause of mental problems and physical problems,&lt;ref&gt;Physical health and mental health, https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/p/physical-health-and-mental-health&lt;/ref&gt; therefore feeling relaxed is beneficial for a person's health. When we are stressed, the [[sympathetic nervous system]] is activated because we are in a [[fight-or-flight response]] mode; over time, this could have negative effects on a human body.

== History ==
The idea of relaxation in psychology was popularized by Dr.Edmund Jacobson in his published book ''[[Progressive relaxation|Progressive Relaxation]]''. It was a technical book intended for doctors and scientists.  His book describes tensing and relaxing specific muscles at a time to achieve overall relaxation in the body.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pagnini, F., Manzoni, G. M., Castelnuovo, G., &amp;  Molinari, E. (2013). Brief literature review about relaxation therapy and anxiety.''Body,'' Movement and Dance in Psychology, 8
&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson then published another book called ''You Must Relax ''published in 1934 that was geared towards the general public. According to Jacobson, his research started in 1908 at [[Harvard University]], and later moving on to [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations|Cornell]] and [[University of Chicago]]. His research was aimed at improving the general human well being.

In 1932, [[Johannes Schultz (composer)|Johannes Schultz]] and Wolfgang Luthe developed a method of relaxation that emphasized using the power of suggestion, called [[autogenic training]].

In 1975, Herbert Benson and Mirium Z. Klipper published a book called ''[[The Relaxation Response]]'', which gives instructions on tying meditation techniques into daily activities the average person could do.&lt;ref&gt;Lettus, D. (2010) Breathe and Relax. ''Library Journal'', ''135''. pp 30-32.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relaxation techniques ==
{{main|Relaxation technique}}
Although stress levels vary across society, the fact remains that stress can be detrimental to one's health. In order to combat this stress, there have been a variety of methods developed that have been proven to reduce stress and its consequences in everyday life. The majority of techniques can be classified in to either Physical, Mental or Therapeutic techniques.

=== Physical relaxation technique ===
Breathing techniques is one of the easiest ways to reduce stress. It requires little effort and can be done anywhere at any time. Proper breathing techniques that incorporate deep abdominal breathing have been shown to reduce the physical symptoms of depression, anxiety and hypertension as well as everyday emotional symptoms of anger and nervousness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;MacGregor, H.E. (2004, Oct 17). Take a breath to relieve stress specialized breathing techniques beneficial to health, practitioners say. Journal-Gazette. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/411159521&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressive muscle relaxation is a relaxation technique that requires an individual to focus on flexing and holding a certain set of muscles and then slowly relaxing those same muscles. As the individual flexes and releases those muscles from top to bottom they will feel a deep sense of relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation is a somewhat adapted version of the Jacobsonian Relaxation Technique developed in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Greenwald, D. (2012, May 24). Innovative Health: De-stress with progressive muscle relaxation technique. Alamogordo Daily News. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1015669126
&lt;/ref&gt; Progressive muscle relaxation is currently used in clinical and non-clinical settings to reduce the effects of anxiety and sleeplessness brought upon by stress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The long-term goal of this relaxation technique is to be able to identify when your body's muscles are suffering the effects of stress and to be able to relax the individual and the individuals muscles when directed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Mental technique ===
[[Meditation]] has long been practiced in other regions around the world. However, it is a practice that is fairly new to North America and it is gaining attention quickly for the physical and psychological benefits it provides to your body. Studies have shown that in addition to reducing physiological and psychological stresses placed on your body, individuals who practice meditation have much fewer doctor visits for both physical and psychological illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Take a mental break (meditation can help ease stress). (1996). Benefits Canada, 20(3), 7. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/224308859
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hypnosis]] relaxation therapy has recently become another technique used among healthcare professionals to promote relaxation. When performed correctly, hypnosis has the ability to put an individual in a deep state of relaxation. During this state the individual is vulnerable to suggestions stated by the person performing the hypnosis. Not only will the hypnotized individual be stress free and in a deep state of relaxation but it is thought that when the individual is out of hypnosis they will be less susceptible to the effects of stress as suggested by the person who performed the hypnosis on them. In addition to relaxation, hypnosis therapy is being used to treat a variety of conditions. Treatments for conditions using hypnosis that are currently being promoted by The [[Mayo Clinic]] are; smoking addiction therapy, pain control therapy, weight loss, coping with chemotherapy, asthma, and allergy relief.&lt;ref&gt;Carrero, M.D. (2012, Nov 13). Is hypnosis for you? Therapeutic hypnosis has been shown to help patients reduce stress, quit smoking, lose weight and more. Morning Call. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1151633865
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Therapeutic relaxation ===
[[Relaxation technique]]s used in therapy by a certified counselor or therapist could include any of the previous techniques discussed. Professionals in the fields of psychology or counseling will have the ability to administer a variety of these techniques. If they feel it is appropriate they may prescribe medication to assist the patient with relaxation. Although a number of these techniques are simple and can be performed on one's own time, patients may receive better results if they are guided by a professional who is very familiar with the techniques.

==Meditation==
[[Herbert Benson]], a professor at the medical school at [[Harvard University]], has proposed in his book ''[[The Relaxation Response]]'' a mechanism of the body that counters the [[fight-or-flight response]]. The relaxation response reduces the body’s metabolism, heart and breathing rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and calms brain activity. It increases the immune response, helps attention and decision making, and changes gene activities that are the opposite of those associated stress.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} The relaxation response is achieved through meditation. Benson's meditation technique involves these four steps:
# A quiet environment to help focus
# A mental device to help keep attention constant (a sound or word said repeatedly)
# A positive attitude to avoid getting upset over failed attempts
# A comfortable position

==Autogenics==
[[Autogenics]] was invented by Dr. [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz]] in the 1920s. The process of autogenics is by relaxing muscles deeply, and by doing so, the mind follows through and relaxes as well. There as six parts to autogenics training:
# Heaviness in parts of the body (arms and legs feel heavy)
# Warmth in parts of the body (arms and legs feel warm)
# Heartbeat (heart is calm)
# Breathing (breathing is calm)
# Warmth in the abdominal area 
# Forehead is cool

==Progressive muscle relaxation==
[[Progressive muscle relaxation]] helps relax your muscles by tensing certain parts of the body (such as the neck), and then releasing the tension in order to feel the muscles relaxing. This technique helps for people with [[anxiety]] because they are always tense throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zandt|first1=Daniel|title=Deep Relaxation Meditation: Guidance &amp; Best Picks|url=http://stillmind.org/deep-relaxation-meditation/|website=Stillmind.org|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
The benefits of relaxation can be found in three main areas of an individual’s health, including; mental, physical and physiological health. Being relaxed can do positive things for someone’s health from just elevating your mood&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wachholtz, A., &amp; Pargament, K. (2005). Is Spirituality a Critical Ingredient of Meditation? Comparing the Effects of Spiritual Meditation, Secular Meditation, and Relaxation on Spiritual, Psychological, Cardiac, and Pain Outcomes. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 28(4), 369-384.
&lt;/ref&gt; to helping with insomnia.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Benson, H. (1993). The Relaxation Respone. ''Mind Body Medicine How to Use Your Mind For Better Health'', 233-25
&lt;/ref&gt; All of these things can help an individual live a happier and healthier life and may increase the longevity of one's life.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are not many draw backs of relaxation. It is an easy technique to understand and follow through with. Three categories that relaxation can help with are mental, physical, and physiological.

=== Mental ===
Mental health is very important and needs to be worked on every day. Relaxation can help with many impairments that can occur in one's mental health. There is a higher mood and lower anxiety in those who practice relaxation techniques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those who are relaxed have much slower and clearer thought processes than those who are not relaxed; this can be shown on an EEG.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kenneth R. Jones &amp; Steve Heymen (1988). Using Relaxation: Coping with Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders. ''UNC Center for Functional GI &amp; Motility Disorders''.
&lt;/ref&gt; It is well known that relaxation can help reduce stress. With reducing stress, a person can help reduce the negative things that stress can do to the body.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Coping mechanisms are also improved with relaxation techniques in both mental and physical pain.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Sleep disorders are an area that can produce stress and mental health issues. Relaxation may help reduce insomnia in those who have sleeping disorders. Those with insomnia may even give up sleeping aids just by practicing relaxation techniques.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Being off of unnecessary medication or sleep aids will help health as an over all. Even though relaxation cannot get rid of chronic diseases, it may help dull of the symptoms one may have. Many cancer and AIDS patients are taught relaxation techniques.{{nonspecific|date=November 2016}}

=== Physical ===
Physical health is also something that needs to be worked on daily, whether it is exercise, healthy eating, or relaxation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; states that blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate will all decrease when one is relaxed.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} This means that a person's heart does not beat as fast and their breathing is shallow, helping one's body have time to rest. This will reduce the extra stress that these things can do to the body if they are over worked. Muscle tension will decrease.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If one's muscle tension is decreased they are not burning up extra energy that they may need later in the day. Metabolism can also decrease; this is mostly seen in hibernation and sleep and that gives the body extra time to rest and focus on other aspect that it needs to.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This could be seen as a good or bad thing, depending on the overall quality of health. People who practice relaxation have said to be able to tolerate pain better both mentally and physically.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Physiological ===
In regards to the nervous system, relaxation can also play a big role. An individual will go from active and alert, which is the sympathetic, to parasympathetic which is rest and digest.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When they are relaxing, it gives the body time to catch up. A person does not need to worry about running, because they are sitting still and allowing “rest and digest”. Immune systems will increase with increased relaxation&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which is why relaxation can be seen as part of treatment for AIDS and cancer patients.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{quote|Instead of the stream of thought being one of ''con''-sciousness, 'thinking its own existence along with whatever else it thinks'...it might better be called a stream of Sciousness pure and simple, thinking objects of some of which it makes what it calls a 'Me,' and only aware of its 'pure' Self in an abstract, hypothetic or conceptual way. Each 'section' of the stream would then be a bit of sciousness or knowledge of this sort, including and contemplating its 'me' and its 'not-me' as objects which work out their drama together, but not yet including or contemplating its own subjective being.&lt;ref&gt;[[William James]] (1890), [[The Principles of Psychology]] (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When James first introduced "sciousness" he held back from proposing it as a possible prime reality&lt;!--what does 'prime reality' mean exactly?--&gt; in ''The Principles of Psychology'', warning that it "traverse[s] common sense."&lt;ref&gt;[[William James]] (1890), [[The Principles of Psychology]] (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; He allowed that he might return to a consideration of sciousness at the conclusion of the book, where he would "indulge in some metaphysical reflections," but it was not until two years later in his conclusion to the abridged edition of ''The Principles'' that he added:
{{quote|Neither common-sense, nor psychology so far as it has yet been written, has ever doubted that the states of consciousness which that science studies are immediate data of experience. "Things" have been doubted, but thoughts and feelings have never been doubted. The outer world, but never the inner world, has been denied. Everyone assumes that we have direct introspective acquaintance with our thinking activity as such, with our consciousness as something inward and contrasted with the outer objects which it knows. Yet I must confess that for my part I cannot feel sure of this conclusion. Whenever I try to become sensible of thinking activity as such, what I catch is some bodily fact, an impression coming from my brow, or head, or throat, or nose. It seems as if consciousness as an inner activity were rather a postulate than a sensibly given fact, the postulate, namely, of a knower as correlative to all this known; and as if "sciousness" might be a better word by which to describe it. But "sciousness postulated as a hypothesis" is a practically a very different thing from "states of consciousness apprehended with infallible certainty by an inner sense." For one thing, it throws the question of who the knower really is wide open...&lt;ref&gt;[[William James]] (1892), ''Psychology: The Briefer Course'' in ''William James: Writings: 1878-1899'' (New York: Library of America)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Then thirteen years later, writing solely as a philosopher, James returned to his "parenthetical digression" of sciousness that "contradict[ed] the fundamental assumption of every philosophic school."&lt;ref&gt;[[William James]] (1890), [[The Principles of Psychology]] (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; James had founded a new school of philosophy, called "[[radical empiricism]]," and nondual sciousness was its starting point. He even wrote a note to himself to "apologize for my dualistic language, in the Principles."&lt;ref&gt;[[William James]] (1988), ''Manuscript Essays and Notes'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; James did not continue to use the word "sciousness" in later essays on radical empiricism, but the concept is clearly there as the "plain, unqualified ... existence" he comes to call "pure experience," in which there is "no self-splitting ... into consciousness and what the consciousness is of."&lt;ref&gt;[[William James]] (1904), ''Does Consciousness Exist?'' in ''William James: Writings 1902-1910'' (New York: Library of America), p. 1151&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure experience sciousness was mostly attacked when first presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/TaylorWoz.htm Eugene Taylor and Robert Wozniak: Pure Experience: The Response to William James]&lt;/ref&gt; With some notable exceptions, such as [[Bergson]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], Western philosophers rejected James' view. That rejection continues to this day.

One of the first to appreciate James's concept was the Swiss psychologist [[Theodore Flournoy]], a mentor of [[Jung]]. In a book about James he wrote:
{{quote|...while most philosophers conceive ... [a] primordial state, the origin of all psychic life, as a purely ''subjective'' state from which subsequent evolution draws forth (no one knows how) the idea of a non-self and the representation of an exterior world, for James, on the contrary, these primordial facts, these pure experiences are entirely objective, simple phenomena of 'sciousness' and not of 'consciousness.' This means that he holds that the distinction between self and non-self, implied in the word 'consciousness,' from which we are in a normal state unable to free ourselves, is not primary, but results from a conceptual sorting and classifying of the primitive experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Flournoy (1917), ''The Philosophy of William James'' (New York: Henry Holt and Co.), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 20th century philosopher [[Kitaro Nishida]]—introduced to James by [[D.T. Suzuki]]—compared James's concept of sciousness and his phrase "pure experience" to [[tathata]] or suchness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kitaro Nishida]] (1992), ''An Enquiry into the Good'', Tr. by Masao Abe &amp; Christopher Ives (New Haven: Yale University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet James scholars today still do not agree on how receptive James himself remained to sciousness. As psychologist [[Benny Shanon]] observed recently:
{{quote|Most pertinent ... is William James with his notion of sciousness which comes in contrast to consciousness. The former consists of pure experience only, the latter involves knowledge of experience. The crucial question is whether mere sciousness does in fact exist. In a most insightful scholarly discussion, Bricklin (''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'' [http://www.atpweb.org/journal.asp], 2003) argues that basically the Jamesian position is positive in this regard. Natsoulas (Philosophical Psychology, 1993; ''Journal of Mind and Behavior'' [http://www.umaine.edu/jmb/], 1996) argues that James vacillated on this issue. I would say that the topic calls for much further examination.[http://www.kjf.ca/95-C11SHA.htm Karl Jaspers Forum]|sign=|source=}}

A '''seating plan''' is a [[diagram]] or a set of written or spoken instructions that determines where people should take their seats. It is widely used on diverse occasions. 

Seating plans have a wide range of purposes. At formal [[dinner]]s, they are usually used to avoid chaos and confusion upon entrance and to follow the [[etiquette]]. In this case, it is customary to arrange the [[Hospitality|host]] and hostess at the opposite sides of the table, and alternate male and female guests throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Oretha D. Swartz|title=Service Etiquette|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1988|isbn=9780870216206|pages=267-278}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Place card]]s can be used to direct guests. [[State dinner]]s have their own protocol and arrangements are made so that the most distinguished guests can have the possibility to engage in conversation. Plans are also made for [[airplanes]], where the objective is to differentiate [[passenger]]s between the various [[Travel class|travel classes]] and ensure everybody has a place. Similarly, [[theatre]]s or [[movie theatre|cinema]]s may allow spectators to choose their seats beforehand. A seating plan is of crucial importance for [[musical ensemble]]s or [[orchestra]]s, where every type of [[Musical instrument|instrument]] is allocated a specific section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching Band &amp; Orchestra: Methods and Materials|author=Lynn G. Cooper|publisher=GIA Publications|year=2004|isbn=9781579992750|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silence''' is the absence of ambient [[hearing (sense)|audible]] [[sound]], the emission of sounds of such low [[sound intensity|intensity]] that they do not draw attention to themselves, or the state of having ceased to produce sounds; this latter sense can be extended to apply to the cessation or absence of any form of [[communication]], whether through [[speech]] or other medium.&lt;ref name=Dictionary.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/silence |title=Silence &amp;#124; Define Silence at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sometimes speakers fall silent when they hesitate in searching for a word, or interrupt themselves before correcting themselves. [[Discourse analysis]] shows that people use brief silences to mark the boundaries of [[prosodic unit]]s, in [[turn-taking]], or as
reactive tokens, e.g., as a sign of displeasure, disagreement, embarrassment, desire to think, confusion, and the like.  Relatively prolonged intervals of silence can be used in [[ritual]]s; in some religious disciplines, people maintain silence for protracted periods, or even for the rest of their lives, as an ascetic means of spiritual transformation. 

==Social Uses of Silence==
===In danger===
[[Joseph Jordania]] has suggested that in [[social animals]] (including [[humans]]), silence can be a sign of danger. Many social animals produce seemingly haphazard sounds which are known as [[contact calls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Macedonia |first1=Joseph M. |title=Individuality in a contact call of the ringtailed lemur (Lemur catta) |journal=American Journal of Primatology |date=1986 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=163–179 |doi=10.1002/ajp.1350110208}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are a mixture of various sounds, accompanying the group's everyday business (for example, [[foraging]], [[feeding]]), and they are used to maintain [[Sound|audio]] contact with the members of the group. Some social animal species communicate the signal of potential danger by stopping contact calls and freezing, without the use of [[alarm calls]], through silence. [[Charles Darwin]] wrote about this in relation with wild horse and cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]] | author = Charles Darwin |year = 2004 | publisher = Penguin Books. pg. 123 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordania has further suggested that human [[humming]] could have been a contact method that early humans used to avoid silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordania|first1= Joseph|date= 2009|title= Times to Fight and Times to Relax: Singing and Humming at the Beginnings of Human Evolutionary History|journal= Kadmos|volume= 1|pages= 272–277|url=http://www.josephjordania.com/files/57-Times-to-fight-and-times-to-relax-Kadmos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his suggestion, humans find prolonged silence distressing (suggesting danger to them). This may help explain why lone humans in relative sonic isolation feel a sense of comfort from humming, whistling, talking to themselves, or having the TV or radio on.

===In spirituality===
{{See also|Vow of silence|Monastic silence}}
"Silence" in spirituality is often a metaphor for inner stillness. A silent mind, freed from the onslaught of thoughts and thought patterns, is both a goal and an important step in spiritual development. Such "inner silence" is not about the absence of sound; instead, it is understood to bring one in contact with the divine, the ultimate reality, or one's own true self, one's divine nature.&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/tp4 ''Ontology and the Wonder of Silence'', Part Four of The Tree of Philosophy] (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 2000). See also "[http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/SFPQ.htm Silence as the Ultimate Fulfillment of the Philosophical Quest]", ''Journal Hekmat Va Falsafeh'', (''Journal of Wisdom and Philosophy''), Issue 6 (August 2006), pp.67–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious traditions imply the importance of being quiet and still in mind and spirit for transformative and integral spiritual growth to occur. In Christianity, there is the silence of [[contemplative prayer]] such as [[centering prayer]] and [[Christian meditation]]; in Islam, there are the wisdom writings of the [[Sufis]] who insist on the importance of finding silence within. In [[Buddhism]], the descriptions of silence and allowing the mind to become silent are implied as a feature of spiritual [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. In Hinduism, including the teachings of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and the many paths of yoga, teachers insist on the importance of silence, ''[[Mauna (silence)|Mauna]]'', for inner growth. Perkey Avot, the Jewish Sages guide for living, states that, "Tradition is a safety fence to Torah, tithing a safety fence to wealth, vows a safety fence for abstinence; a safety fence for wisdom&amp;nbsp;... is silence." In some traditions of [[Quakerism]], communal silence is the usual context of worship meetings, in patient expectancy for the divine to speak in the heart and mind.&lt;ref&gt;Britain Yearly Meeting, "Quaker Faith and Practice"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quakerweb.org.uk/qfp/ Third Edition, 2005 (?), sections 2.01, 2.12–17 etc., The Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain, London], {{ISBN|0-85245-375-2}} / {{ISBN|0-85245-374-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eckhart Tolle]] says that silence can be seen either as the absence of noise, or as the space in which sound exists, just as inner stillness can be seen as the absence of thought, or the space in which thoughts are perceived.

===Commemorative silence===
{{Main|Moment of silence}}
[[File:US_Army_51759_Soldiers_bow_their_heads_during_a_moment_of_silence_before_going_on_a_commemorative_march_on_Forward_Operating_Base_Warrior,_Kirkuk,_Iraq,_Sept._11._The_march_gave_Soldiers_the_opportunity_to_reflect.jpg|thumb|Soldiers bow their heads during a moment of silence before going on a commemorative march on ''[[Forward operating base|Forward Operating Base Warrior]]'', [[Kirkuk]], [[Iraq]], Sept. 11. The march gave Soldiers the opportunity to reflect on the tragedy that happened eight years prior.]]
A common way to remember a tragic incident and to remember the victims or casualties of such an event is a commemorative [[moment of silence]].

===In debate===
Argumentative silence is the [[rhetoric]]al practice of saying nothing when an opponent in a [[debate]] expects something to be said. Poorly executed, it can be offensive, like refusing to answer a direct question. However, well-timed silence can throw an opponent off and give the debater the upper hand.

An [[argument from silence]] ({{lang-la|argumentum ex silentio}}) is an argument based on the assumption that someone's silence on a matter suggests (an [[informal fallacy]]) that person's ignorance of the matter. In general, ''ex silentio'' refers to the claim that the absence of something demonstrates the proof of a proposition.

===In law===
The [[right to silence]] is a legal protection enjoyed by people undergoing police interrogation or trial in certain countries. The law is either explicit or recognized in many legal systems.

==In art, entertainment, and media==
===Film===
The documentary film ''[[In Pursuit of Silence]]'' (2016) portrays the spiritual and physical benefits of silence, as well as the price paid individually and collectively for a noisy world.&lt;ref name=HuffPost20160308/&gt; It is narrated by authors Helen Lees (''Silence in Schools''), [[Pico Iyer]] (''The Art of Stillness''), [[Susan Cain]] (''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking|Quiet]]''), [[Martha Reeves (anchorite)|Maggie Ross]] (''Silence: A User’s Guide''), and George Prochnik (''In Pursuit of Silence'').&lt;ref name=HuffPost20160308&gt;{{cite news |last1=McColman |first1=Carl |title=In Pursuit of Silence: A Quiet Movie With Much to Say |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-mccolman/in-pursuit-of-silence-a-q_1_b_9396596.html |work=The Huffington Post|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312171246/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-mccolman/in-pursuit-of-silence-a-q_1_b_9396596.html |archivedate=March 12, 2016 |date=March 8, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Rest (music)}}
Music inherently depends on silence, in some form or another, to distinguish other periods of sound and allow [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Melody|melodies]], and [[Rhythm|rhythms]] to have greater impact. For example, most music scores feature ''[[rest (music)|rest]]s'', which denote periods of silence. In addition, silence in music can be seen as a time for contemplation. The audience feels the effects of the previous notes and melodies, and can intentionally reflect on what they have heard. Silence does not hinder musical excellence but can enhance the sounds of instruments and vocals within a given [[musical composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cox |first1=Christoph |last2=Warner |first2=Daniel  |year=2004 |title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music}}:&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Sound and Silence'' (1970), the composer [[John Paynter (composer)|John Paynter]] says, "the dramatic effect of silence has long been appreciated by composers." He gives as an example "the general pause in the middle of the chorus ‘Have lightnings and thunders …’ in [[Johan Sebastian Bach|Bach]]’s ''[[St Matthew Passion|St. Matthew Passion]]''":&lt;ref name="Paynter, J. 1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paynter, J.|author2=Aston, P.|last-author-amp=yes |date=1970|title=Sound and Silence|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bach from St Matthew Passion.png|thumb|center|500px|"Sind Blitze, sind Donner" (chorus) from the ''St. Matthew Passion''.]]
After the pause, the music continues to the words: "Open up the fiery bottomless pit, O hell!" The silence is intended to communicate a momentary sensation of terror, of staring into unfathomable darkness. Another example of a dramatic silence comes in the "rest full of tension" at the climactic ending of the [[Messiah Part II|''Hallelujah'' chorus]] in [[Handel]]’s [[Messiah (Handel)|''Messiah'']]:
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 44 hallelujah.ogg|title=''Hallelujah'' (3:47)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
[[File:Hallelujah Chorus (conclusion).png|thumb|center|500px|The closing bars of the famous ''Hallelujah'' chorus from Handel's 1741 [[oratorio]] ''Messiah'']]

Musical silences may also convey humour. [[Haydn]]'s Quartet in E flat, Op. 33 was nicknamed "The Joke", because of the [[comic timing]] of the pauses at the end of the last movement:
[[File:Haydn op 33 No 2 ending.png|thumb|center|500px|The closing bars of String Quartet in E flat, Op. 33 by Haydn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmoA5fy_kvQ&amp;t=2m45s|title=Endellion String Quartet play Haydn's "The Joke" Presto|first=|last=sanmiguelmusica|date=6 August 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Taruskin (2010, p.&amp;nbsp;552) says, "whenever this ending is performed, it takes the audience an extra second or so to recover its wits and realize that the piece is indeed over. The result is an inevitable giggle—the same giggle that overtakes a [[prestidigitator]]’s audience when it realizes that it has been ‘had’."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.oxfordwesternmusic.com/|last=Taruskin|first= Richard|authorlink=Richard Taruskin| |date=2010|title=Spotlight On|work=The Oxford History of Western Music|volume= 2|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Cooper (2011, p.38) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Barry|title= Beethoven's Uses of Silence|journal=The Musical Times|volume=  152|issue= 1914 |date=Spring 2011|pages=25-43 |jstor=23039954}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes extensively of [[Beethoven]]'s many uses of silence for contemplation, for dramatic effect and especially for driving the rhythmic impetus of the music. He cites the start of the second movement of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], where the silences contribute to a powerful sense of propulsion: "The rhythm of bar 1 is incomplete and demands a note at the beginning of bar 2. The substitution of such a note by a whole-bar rest therefore gives the effect of a suppressed sound, as if one were about to speak but then refrains at the last moment. The 'suppressed sound' is then repeated in bar 4, and 'developed' (by being doubled) in bars 7 and 8." {{harvtxt|Grove|1898|p=355}} writes of the "strange irregularity of rhythm in the sixth bar" of this movement.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, G. (1898, p.355) ''Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies''.  London, Novello.  Reprinted by Dover (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beethoven 9 scherzo.png|thumb|center|500px|The opening bars of the ''[[scherzo]]'' from Beethoven's ninth symphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTdQECUTDu8|title=Ludwig van Beethoven - Molto Vivace (Sinfonía Nº9, Op. 125)|first=|last=Jedioberon|date=27 December 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Much has been said about the [[Tristan chord|harmony]] of the opening to [[Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', which Taruskin (2010, p.540) calls "perhaps the most famous, surely the most commented-on, single phrase of music ever written."  However, Wagner’s strategic use of silences between phrases intensifies the troubled ambiguity of the music: "The chord that fills the ensuing silence in the listener’s inner ear… is the unstated – indeed never to be stated, and ultimately needless to be stated – tonic of that key."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Taruskin|Taruskin, Richard]] (2010) The Oxford History of Western Music, Volume 3. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{listen|type=music|filename=Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg|title=''Tristan und Isolde'' (opening bars)|description=Performed by the [[Fulda Symphonic Orchestra]]}}[[File:Tristan opening.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Prelude to ''Tristan and Isolde'', opening bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAULLxcWSpM|title=[HD] Richard Wagner - Tristan Und Isolde - Prelude - Daniel Barenboim, Bayreuth Festival|first=|last=Above the Mists|date=9 December 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Some of the most effective musical silences are very short, lasting barely a fraction of a second. In the spirited and energetic finale of his [[Brahms Symphony No. 2|Symphony No. 2]], [[Brahms]] uses silences at several points to powerfully disrupt the rhythmic momentum that has been building. (See also [[syncopation]].)

During the 20th century, composers explored further the expressive potential of silence in their music.&lt;ref&gt;Lossef, N. and Doctor, J. (eds.) (2007) Silence, Music, Silent Music. London, Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; The contemplative concluding bars of Anton [[Webern]]’s ''Symphony''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVrCpylDGS8&amp;t=2m32s|title=Anton Webern: Simfonija op. 21., 2. stavak: Variationen|first=|last=dorotea1997|date=26 November 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1928) and [[Stravinsky]]’s ''[[Les Noces]]'' The Wedding, 1923)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNBDJNHeZmo&amp;t=24m05s|title=Igor Stravinsky - Les Noces (1923)|first=|last=Bartje Bartmans|date=1 August 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; make telling and atmospheric use of pauses. Eric Walter White (1947, p.74) describes the ending of ''[[Les Noces]]'' as follows: "As the voices cease singing, pools of silence come flooding in between the measured strokes of the bell chord, and the music dies away in a miraculously fresh and radiant close."&lt;ref&gt;White, E.W. (1947) ''Stravinsky: a Critical Survey''.  London, John Lehmann.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Paynter (composer)|John Paynter]] (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;24) vividly conveys how silence contributes to the titanic impact of the third section&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f4qdJHatNM&amp;t=12m20s|title=Messiaen - Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum|first=|last=orangejamtw|date=16 October 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Messiaen]]’s orchestral work ''[[Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum]]'' (1964):&lt;blockquote&gt;Woodwinds jump, growl and shriek. Silence. Eight solemn bell strokes echo and die. Again silence. Suddenly the brasses blare, and out of the trombones’ awesome processional grows a steady roar … the big gongs the tam-tam beaten in a long and powerful resonance, shattering and echoing across mountains and along valleys. This is music of the high hills, music for vast spaces: ‘The hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God’. We can feel the awe and the majesty of the High Alps and the great churches. The instrumental sounds are vast the silences are deep. The words of St John are alive in the music, and through these sounds Messiaen reveals himself and his vision.&lt;ref name="Paynter, J. 1970" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;An extreme example from 1952 is ''[[4′33″]]'', an [[experimental music]]al work by [[avant-garde composer]] [[John Cage]], incorporating ambient sounds not foreseeable by the composer. Though first performed on the [[piano]], the piece was composed for any instrument or instruments and is structured in three [[movement (music)|movement]]s. The length of each movement is not fixed by the composer, but the total length of the combination of three movements is. The score instructs the performer(s) to remain silent throughout the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTEFKFiXSx4|title=John Cage's 4'33"|first=|last=Joel Hochberg|date=15 December 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cage, J.(1952),  4’33", Published by Edition Peters (PE.P06777)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are telling examples of the use of silence in jazz. A frequently used effect, known as "[[stop-time]]", places silences at moments where listeners or dancers might expect a strong beat, contributing to the [[syncopation]]. [[Scott Joplin]]'s ''[[The Ragtime Dance|Rag-Time Dance]]'' (1902) features stop-time silences:
[[File:Rag-Time Dance.png|thumb|center|500px|Scott Joplin, ''Rag-Time Dance'' (1902)]]

Early recordings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unGmMmD8kPQ&amp;t=2m13s|title=The Ragtime Dance - SCOTT JOPLIN (1906)|first=|last=RagtimeDorianHenry|date=27 June 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''Rag Time Dance'' follow Joplin’s instructions as follows: "To get the desired effect of 'Stop Time', the pianist will please stamp the heel of one foot heavily upon the floor."&lt;ref&gt;Joplin, S. (1971) ''Collected Piano Works: Rags, Waltzes and Marches''. New York Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, later recordings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImJ1jqLYfGk&amp;t=7m22s|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; disregard this direction – the regular beat is implied rather than stated and the silences are more palpable. Keith Swanwick (1979, p.70) is enchanted by the "playfulness and humour" engendered by the stop-time effects in [[Jelly Roll Morton]]'s solo piano recording of ''The Crave'' (1939):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k8QokoPPrU&amp;t=1m24s|title=THE CRAVE by Jelly Roll Morton - NEW ORLEANS MEMORIES 1939|first=|last=cdbpdx|date=5 December 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If we listen to this, tapping or clicking along with the beat, we shalt find ourselves surprised by two patches of silence near the end. The beat goes on but the sound stops. The effect is something like being thrown forward when a car stops suddenly. It is the biggest surprise in an engaging piece of music full of little deviations ([[syncopation]]s) from the repeated beat."&lt;ref&gt;Swanwick, K. (1979) A Basis for Music Education.  London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include the closing bars of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s recording of ''Struttin' with Some Barbecue'' (1928)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl-2R_Pb7dk&amp;t=2m46s|title=Louis Armstrong - Struttin' With Some Barbecue|first=|last=Praguedive|date=20 June 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the hair's-breadth pause at the end of pianist [[Bill Evans]]' solo on [[Miles Davis]]' recording of [[On Green Dolphin Street (song)|''On Green Dolphin Street'']] (1959).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGVdAlxlp18&amp;t=8m20s|title=Miles Davis - On Green Dolphin Street (Audio)|first=|last=MilesDavisVEVO|date=14 May 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duke Ellington]]'s "Madness in Great Ones", from his Shakespearean Suite ''[[Such Sweet Thunder]]'' (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhpqIMor2P8|title=Duke Ellington - Such Sweet Thunder - Madness in Great Ones.|first=|last=bill K|date=21 October 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; conveys the feigned madness of Prince Hamlet through abrupt and unpredictable pauses that interrupt the flow of the music. The [[reggae]] band [[Black Slate]] had a hit in 1980 with the song ''Amigo''. The instrumental introduction features sudden silences before the voice enters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7O3wufbQY|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sin Ik-hui''' ([[Hangul|Chosŏn'gŭl]]: 신익히, [[hanja]]: 申翼熙) (9 June 1892 - 5 May 1956) was a [[Korea]]n independence activist and politician during the period of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SCg786J3nnsC&amp;pg=PT28|title=Korea Focus - August 2012|last=Foundation|first=The Korea|date=2013-03-30|publisher=한국국제교류재단|year=|isbn=9788986090888|location=|pages=28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Speaker of the National Assembly of South Korea|Speaker of the National Assembly]] during President [[Syngman Rhee]]'s first term (4 August 1948 and 30 May 1950) and second term (19 June 1950 and 30 May 1954). His nickname was '''Haegong''' (해공, 海公) or '''Haehu''' (해후; 海候); his [[courtesy name]] was '''Yeogu''' (여구; 如耉).

== Life ==
Sin Ik-hui was a descendant of [[Sin Rip]] and [[Sin Kyung-hee]], [[Sin Saimdang]]. He was born in Samaru country in [[Gwangju, Gyeonggi|Gwangju]], [[Gyeonggi Province]]. He became an orphan and his second elder half-brother Sin Kyu-hee nurtured him. In his early years, he studied abroad in [[Japan]].

In 1918, he was exiled to [[Shanghai]] in [[China]], in April 1919.

==Politician==
He was involved in the creation of the [[Provisional National Assembly of Korea]]s. He was elected as a Congressman of the Provisional National Assembly of Korea. On April 23, he was appointed to Vice minister of Foreign Affairs of [[Provisional Government of Korea]].

In August 1919, Sin became vice Minister of Justice and in September, he was appointed as Justice Minister and in September 1920, Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1930s he became an English professor at a Chinese University.

In May 1940 he was appointed to Provisional Government of Korea, and in 1944 he was reappointed to Interior Minister to the Provisional Government.

In May 1948 he was elected Congressman of [[National Assembly of Korea]]. On August 4, 1948 he was 2nd term head of First Republic and 19 June 1950, he again was Speaker until 30 May 1954.

In 1955 he was involved with the founding of the [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 1955)|Democratic Party]] and elected as its fourth leader. In 1956 he ran for president, but died of heart failure and overwork at age 64. He had boarded a train to [[Seoul]] with John Chang to commence campaigning soon after registration of candidates had closed. Minutes after taking their seats however, Sin became violently ill. He rushed to the toilet, but died. When the November election was held three months later, his name was still on the ballot, and he received close to half of the people's votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QUKMAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT243|title=One Happy Old Priest|last=Sullivan|first=Thomas K.|date=2010-03-17|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|year=|isbn=9781465328823|location=|pages=243|language=en}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1673">The concept of ''Social Identity Complexity'' (Roccas and Brewer, 2002) is a theoretical construct that refers to an individual's subjective representation of the interrelationships among his or her multiple group identities. Social identity complexity reflects the degree of overlap perceived to exist between groups of which a person is simultaneously a member.

Roccas and Brewer also report that membership in many different groups (multiple social identities) can lead to greater social identity complexity, which can foster the development of superordinate social identities and global identity, making international identity more likely in individualist cultures (see Tajfel &amp; Turner [1986] for a review of [[social identity theory]]).

[[Poetics]] – like [[coolie|coolitude]] or [[creolization]] – have used the [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]] to refer to multiple identities.

Social identity complexity is also related to higher importance of openness to change and universalism values, lower importance of conservatism and power values, and higher tolerance for diversity.

Social identity complexity may be a crucial factor to consider in applying social psychological models of bias reduction.

'''Source Separated Organics''' (SSO) is the system by which waste generators segregate [[compostable]] materials from other waste streams at the source for separate collection.

==Types of Materials==
Organic materials, such as yard trimmings, food scraps, wood waste, and paper and paperboard products, typically make up about one-third (by weight) of the municipal solid waste stream.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw2008rpt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; SSO&amp;nbsp;programs depend on the composition of local waste stream, acceptance specifications for the organics processing facility, and collection methods. The types of organic materials collected include:

* '''Yard and landscaping debris''': floral trimmings, tree trimmings, leaves, grass, brush, and weeds
* '''Food waste''': organic residues generated by the handling, storage, sale, preparation, cooking, and serving of foods, including fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, seafood, shellfish, bones, rice, beans, pasta, bakery items, cheese, eggshells, and coffee grounds
* '''Paper fibers''': waxed cardboard, napkins, paper towels, uncoated paper plates, tea bags, coffee filters, wooden crates, and greasy pizza boxes
* '''Wood waste''': urban wood waste, woody debris from suburban land clearing, and rural forestry residuals

==Programs==
SSO programs have been launched in a wide range of venues, including single-family residential units, commercial businesses, events, food processors, schools, hospitals, and airports. The [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has assembled tools and resources for food waste management to assist communities interested in launching their own food waste reduction and collection efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=May 1994 |title=Composting Yard Trimmings and Municipal Solid Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/rrr/composting/pubs/cytmsw.pdf |publisher= |page= |docket=EPA530-R-94-003 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSO&amp;nbsp;materials are typically collected in wet-strength paper bags, unlined plastic bins, or compostable film-plastic liners that meet ASTM 6400 standards.

==Benefits==
The organic fraction of the waste stream is increasingly viewed as a resource.  The resulting products – renewable energy and compost – benefit the environment: reduce greenhouse gas emissions; reduce dependency on foreign energy imports; increase the nutrient composition of our soils; reduce the amount of waste going to landfills; reduce the amount of wet, sloppy waste going to other methods of disposal; reduce the [[leachate]] associated with [[stormwater]] management at landfills; reduce the [[greenhouse gas emissions]] from uncontrolled landfill operations; improve erosion and stormwater control through biofiltration (Schwab, 2000).

==Barriers to adoption==
Communities and businesses that want to implement SSO programs face a few challenges. First, they need participation at the source of their organic waste generation. Second, they need a [[hauler]] willing to collect the organic waste. Third, they need a composting facility permitted to process the material. These challenges have been overcome by many successful SSO programs. Tactics for addressing barriers to adoption include creating outreach and education materials,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stopwaste.org/docs/foodscrap_pitch_2_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cetonline.org/Publications/res-schools-online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/compost/compost_pdf/schmanual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; forging partnerships between local businesses to share fixed collection costs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jgpress.com/archives/_free/000496.html&lt;/ref&gt; and creating incentives for organic diversion through regulated tip fees for solid waste and organics.

==Processing==
Organic materials collected in SSO programs typically get delivered to composting facilities where the waste is turned into nutrient-rich soil amendments known as [[compost]]. Organic feedstock can also be delivered to anaerobic digestion facilities that produce [[biogas]], a source of [[renewable energy]].
Anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of MSW Municipal Solid Waste has been found to be in a number of LCA&amp;nbsp;analysis studies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idosi.org/gjer/gjer3(3)09/4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurojournals.com/ejsr_34_3_11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to be more environmentally effective, than landfill, incineration or [[pyrolysis]]. The resulting biogas (methane) can then be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to [[hydrogen]] for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells.

The phrase comes from a joke that spoofs the simplifying assumptions that are sometimes used in theoretical physics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/04/the-coase-theorem-is-widely-cited-in-economics-ronald-coase-hated-it/ Washington Post: "The Coase Theorem"]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ quote
| Milk production at a dairy farm was low, so the farmer wrote to the local university, asking for help from academia. A multidisciplinary team of professors was assembled, headed by a theoretical physicist, and two weeks of intensive on-site investigation took place. The scholars then returned to the university, notebooks crammed with data, where the task of writing the report was left to the team leader. Shortly thereafter the physicist returned to the farm, saying to the farmer, "I have the solution, but it works only in the case of spherical cows in a vacuum".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3196">'''Sponsored mobility''' refers to a system of [[social mobility]] where [[elite]] individuals in [[society]] select (either directly or through agents) recruits to induct into high [[status groups]].  This [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] functions in opposition to [[contest mobility]], in which everyone is seen as having [[equal opportunity]] to attain high [[Social status|status]].  

The definitive research article on the subject was published in 1960 by Ralph H. Turner.  Turner compared the American and British systems of [[secondary education]] and found the two to be markedly different.  He links the idea of sponsored mobility with the British system.

In a system of sponsored mobility, [[elite]] [[Social status|status]] is not earned, but given on the basis of some objective criterion and cannot be taken.  Individuals must be [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] by one or more members already in the [[elite]] circle in order to gain access.  Those who are already members judge potential entrants on the extent to which they possess characteristics they wish to see in their future peers.

Sponsored mobility favors a much greater degree of [[social control]] than [[contest mobility]].  Individual effort means nothing; only qualities that grant sponsorship matter. In this system, [[credentials]] exist not to identify [[elite]] members to outsiders, but only to each other.  These are things that only the elite are trained to recognize (i.e. [[Discrimination]] in cultural tastes) therefore making it difficult for interlopers to gain access to [[wiktionary:Membership|membership]].
One instance where a system of sponsored mobility may develop into a [[contest mobility]] scenario is when there is no one dominant elite.  Without a [[monopoly]], elites must compete amongst themselves because no one group can control the recruitment process.  

In comparing [[contest mobility]] with sponsored mobility, Deborah Abowitz surveyed American college students and examined effects of family [[Social class|class]] position, income, gender, and other status variables in determining attitudes about the norm that exists in the U.S.  

Abowitz studied college students instead of secondary students precisely because, “What brings college students' beliefs into question…is the effect of radical critiques of the system that they are often exposed to in college -- in courses which focus not on the [[rhetoric]] of an [[open class system]] but on evidence of [[social reproduction]] and the rising levels of [[Economic inequality|inequality]] in wealth and income among Americans today.”

Her study concluded that students do in fact subscribe to the achievement [[ideology]] enforced by contest mobility, and reject the sponsored mobility notion that background is a more important determinant of future status than effort.

In [[applied mathematics]], a '''trapping region''' of a [[dynamical system]] is a region such that every trajectory that starts within the trapping region will move to the region's interior and remain there as the system evolves.

More precisely, given a [[dynamical system]] with [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] &lt;math&gt;\phi_t&lt;/math&gt; defined on the phase space &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, a subset of the phase space &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a trapping region if it is [[compact space|compact]] and &lt;math&gt;\phi_t(N) \subset \mathrm{int}(N)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Meiss, J. D., ''Differential dynamical systems'', Philadelphia: Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, he won the J.D. Bernal Prize from the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]] for "distinguished contributions to Science and Technology Studies over the course of [a] career".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4sonline.org/prizes/bernal, retrieved 19 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pinch was born in [[Lisnaskea]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.cornell.edu/stories/1999/10/christopher-ober-and-trevor-pinch-named-department-chairs|title=''Christopher Ober and Trevor Pinch named to department chairs at Cornell'', Cornell Chronicle|work=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
He has a degree in [[Physics]] from [[Imperial College London]] and a PhD in Sociology from the [[University of Bath]].

== Career ==
He taught sociology at the [[University of York]] before moving to the United States.

Together with [[Wiebe Bijker]], Pinch started the movement known as [[Social Construction of Technology]] (SCOT) within the sociology of science.

==Works==
He is a significant contributor to the study of [[Sound culture]], and his books include a major study of [[Robert Moog]].

Pinch's book, ''Confronting Nature'' is widely considered the definitive sociological account of the history of the solar neutrino problem, and was mentioned by Raymond Davis in his 2002 Nobel Prize autobiography.&lt;ref name=Nobel&gt;{{cite web|title=Raymond Davis Jr. – Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2002/davis-bio.html|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vera Brown Starr''' (May 23, 1924 – March 4, 1985) was the first woman elected as chair of the [[Yavapai-Apache Nation]] and served two years in the office, as well as serving over fifteen years on the council. She was one of the delegates to the [[1977 National Women's Conference]], a major U.S. women's conference held in conjunction with the [[International Women's Year]] celebrations of the United Nations. In 2012, her name was inscribed on an arch recognizing women who were Native American leaders at the [[University of Arizona]].

==Early life==
Vera Brown was born on May 23, 1924 at the Indian Reservation of [[Camp Verde, Arizona]] to Mary and Sam Brown, members of the Mojave-[[Apache]]. She was the youngest of three siblings.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1934|p=8}} Her father was a miner, working in the United Verde Mine near [[Jerome, Arizona]] and the smelters in [[Clarkdale, Arizona|Clarkdale]] and [[Clemenceau, Arizona|Clemenceau]].{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} Until she was school age, the family lived in a ''[[Wigwam|wickiup]]'' near Clarkdale.{{sfn|Winters|1980|p=16}} She attended the segregated public school in Clarkdale, which allowed whites to attend in the mornings and [[Hispanic]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] to attend afternoon classes and though she was placed in the morning session, she remembered experiencing discrimination and did not speak English.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|Winters|1980|p=16}} When she was eleven, her father died on April 19, 1935, from [[silicosis]], having worked the mines without any protective respiratory equipment.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1934|p=8}} She was sent to the [[Valentine Indian School]] under the [[American Indian boarding schools|American Indian boarding school program]] and graduated from the Indian High School in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Though she earned a scholarship to the [[University of New Mexico]], Brown returned to Carkdale to care for her mother because the pension her father earned had ended after one year and her mother was denied social security.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} 

After World War II, Brown married Antonio L. Moreno (1924–1968), a veteran and miner, from Clarkdale.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1968|p=80}} The couple originally made their home in Jerome, where their children Anthony Jr. (1948–2009) and Petra (1949–2011) were born.{{sfn|''Ajo Copper News''|2009|p=2}}{{sfn|''Ajo Copper News''|2011|p=2}} In 1949, they moved to [[Ajo, Arizona|Ajo]], where Antonio worked at the [[Phelps Dodge|Phelps-Dodge smelter]].{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1968|p=80}} 

==Tribral council career==
In 1967, against her mother's recommendation, Moreno decided to run for a seat on the tribal council of the [[Yavapai-Apache Nation]].{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} After her husband's death in 1968, Moreno remarried with Henry Starr.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} She was successful in attaining a seat in 1969 and served for six years, before becoming the first woman to serve as the Tribal Chair in 1975.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1975|p=27}}{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} After serving two-years as Tribal Chair, the 1977 election was fraught with factionalism, causing a contested election, a court battle, and finally a new vote.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|October 27, 1977|p=29}} Starr did not win her re-election bid as Chair.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|November 15, 1977|p=21}} 

Starr joined the [[North American Indian Women's Association]] (NAIWA), an organization formed to foster inter-tribal betterment for Native Americans.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} In 1977, she attended the [[1977 National Women's Conference|National Women's Conference]], which was held in conjunction with the [[United Nations]]' [[International Women's Year]] celebrations. As one of Arizona's four Native American delegates, of specific interest to her were the anti-discrimination resolution passed by the women which addressed minority rights, including the removal of American Indian children from their homes and tribes, as well as the discussion of the failure of Arizona to pass [[Medicaid]] legislation to provide health care to low-income families.{{sfn|Sowers|1977|p=2}}

Though defeated in her bid for re-election to the chair, Starr continued to serve on the council, being returned in 1978 as a council member.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1978|p=16}} In 1981, she was elected as treasurer of the tribe and held that post until her election as vice chair of the tribe in 1982.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1982|p=18}} She returned as vice chair in 1983.{{sfn|Funk|1983|p=21}} Issues on which she focused during her time on the council were those that would improve the lives of tribe members. She advocated for improved housing, health care initiatives, and protection of water rights.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|Sowers|1977|p=2}}

==Death and legacy==
Starr died on March 4, 1985 in [[Cottonwood, Arizona]] at the Marcus J. Lawrence Memorial Hospital.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1985|p=38}} Posthumously, her name was inscribed in 2011 on the Native American Women of Arizona Arch on the [[University of Arizona]] campus,{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} after having been selected to represent their tribe by the Yavapai-Apache Nation.{{sfn|Ruiz-McGill|2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9662">'''Virtuality''' is a concept in [[philosophy]] elaborated by French thinker [[Gilles Deleuze]]. [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/]

==Overview==
Deleuze used the term '''virtual''' to refer to an aspect of reality that is ideal, but nonetheless real. An example of this is the meaning, or sense, of a proposition that is not a material aspect of that proposition (whether written or spoken) but is nonetheless an attribute of that proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Germinal Life. The Difference and Repetition of Deleuze|last=Pearson|first=K. Ansell|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=|location=London and New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Henri Bergson]], who strongly influenced Deleuze, and Deleuze himself build their conception of the virtual in reference to a quotation in which writer [[Marcel Proust]] defines a virtuality, [[memory]] as "''real but not actual, ideal but not abstract''".  A dictionary definition written by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], referencing the philosophy of [[Duns Scotus]], supports this understanding of the virtual as something that is "as if" it were real, and the everyday use of the term to indicate what is "virtually" so, but not so in fact.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S.  "Virtual."  [https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofphil21bald Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology], ed. James Mark Baldwin.  New York: Macmillan, 1902 (Vol. II, pp. 763-764).&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|'''Virtual''' [Lat. ''virtus'', strength, from ''vir'', a man]: Ger. ''virtuell'' ; Fr. (1) ''virtuel''; Ital. (1) ''virtuale''. (1) A virtual ''X'' (where ''X'' is a common noun) is something, not an ''X'', which has the efficiency (''virtus'') of an ''X''.

This is the proper meaning of the word; but (2) it has been seriously confounded with 'potential' which is almost its contrary.  For the potential ''X'' is of the nature of ''X'', but is without actual efficiency.  A virtual velocity is something ''not'' a velocity, but a displacement; but equivalent to a velocity in the formula, 'what is gained in velocity is lost in power.'

So ''virtual representation'' was the non-representation of the American colonies in the British Parliament, which was supposed to be replaced by something.  So Milton asks whether the angels have ''virtual'' or immediate touch.  So, too, the sun was said to be ''virtualiter'' on earth, that is, in its efficiency.

(3) ''Virtual'' is sometimes used to mean pertaining to virtue in the sense of an ethical habit.

''Virtual knowledge'': a term of Scotus defined by him (''Opus Oxon''., Pt. I. iii. 3) as follows: 'Quantum ad notitiam habitualem sive virtualem, primo expono quid intelligo per terminos.  ''Habitualem'' notitiam voco, quando obiectum sic est praesens intellectui [i.e. to the thought] in ratione intelligibilis actua ut intellectus statim possit habere actum elicitum circa illud obiectum.  Voco ''virtualem'', quando aliquid intelligitur in aliquo, ut pars intellecti primi, non autem ut primum intellectum sive ut totale terminans intellectionem; sicut cum intelligitur homo intelligitur animal in nomine, ut pars intellecti, non ut intellectum primum, sive totale terminans intellectionem.  Hoc satis proprie vocatur intellectum ''virtualiter'', quia est satis proximum intellecto in actu.  Non enim posset esse actualius intellectum, nisi esset propria intellectione intellectum, quae esse ipsius primi, ut termini totalis.'

''Virtual difference'': a term of the doctrine of ''formalities'' set forth by Scotus, ''Opus Oxon''. Pt. I. ii. 7.  (C.S.P)}}{{efn|The long quote in Latin embedded in '''Note a''' is translated by John van den Bercken into English in ''On being and cognition : Ordinatio 1.3'', Fordham University Press, 2016}}

==Deleuze's concept==
Deleuze's concept of the virtual has two aspects: first, the virtual is a kind of surface effect produced by actual causal interactions at the material level.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} When one uses a computer, the monitor displays an image that depends on physical interactions happening at the level of hardware. The window is nowhere in actuality, but is nonetheless real and can be interacted with. This example actually leads to the second aspect of the virtual that Deleuze insists upon: its generative nature. This virtual is a kind of potentiality that becomes fulfilled in the actual. It is still not material, but it is real.

Deleuze argues that [[Henri Bergson]] developed "the notion of the ''virtual'' to its highest degree" and that he based his entire philosophy on it.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1966, 43).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Bergsonism'', Deleuze writes that "virtual" is not opposed to "real" but opposed to "actual", whereas "real" is opposed to "possible".&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1966, 96-98).&lt;/ref&gt; This definition, which is almost indistinguishable from ''potential'', originates in medieval [[Scholastics]] and the [[Medieval Latin]] word ''virtualis''. Deleuze identifies the virtual, considered as a continuous [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]], with Bergson's "[[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]": "it is the virtual insofar as it is actualized, in the course of being actualized, it is inseparable from the movement of its actualization."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1966, 42-43, 81) and Deleuze (2002a, 44).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other concepts==
Another core meaning has been elicited by [[Denis Berthier]], in his 2004 book "[http://www.editions-harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&amp;obj=livre&amp;no=17563 Méditations sur le réel et le virtuel]" ("Meditations on the real and the virtual"), based on uses in science ([[virtual image]]), technology ([[virtual world]]), and [[etymology]] (derivation from virtue—[[Latin]] ''virtus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). At the same [[ontology|ontological]] level as "the possible" (i.e. ideally-possible) abstractions, representations, or imagined "fictions", the actually-real "material", or the actually-possible "probable", the "virtual" is "ideal-real".  It is what is ''not real'', but displays the full qualities of the real—in a plainly actual (i.e., not potential)—way.  The [[prototype|prototypical]] case is a [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] in a [[mirror]]: it is already there, whether or not one can see it; it is not waiting for any kind of actualization. This definition allows one to understand that real effects may be issued from a virtual object, so that our perception of it and our whole relation to it, are fully real, even if it is not. This explains how [[virtual reality]] can be used to cure [[phobia]]s.  Brian Massumi shows the political implications of this.

However, note that the writers above all use terms such as "possible", "potential" and "real" in different ways and relate the virtual to these other terms differently.  Deleuze regards the opposite of the virtual as the actual.  Rob Shields argues that the opposite of the virtual is the material for there are other actualities such as a probability (e.g., "risks" are actual dangers that have not yet materialized but there is a "probability" that they will).&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Rob ''The Virtual'' Routledge 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtual is far more than a technical or communications term. [[Martin Luther]] argued in his writing [[The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ—Against the Fanatics]] with other Protestants, most notably Zwingli, over the ''virtualism'' of the Christian Eucharist, in alignment with Catholic tradition, that the Eucharist was ''actually'' and not ''virtually'' the body and blood of [[Christ]].

According to Massumi in "Parables for the Virtual&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48557573|title=Parables for the virtual : movement, affect, sensation|last=Brian.|first=Massumi,|date=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822328828|location=Durham, NC|oclc=48557573}}&lt;/ref&gt;''"'', the virtual is something "inaccessible to the senses" and can be felt in its effects. His definition goes on to explain virtuality through the use of a topological figure, in which stills of all of the steps in its transformation superposed would create a virtual image. Its virtuality lies in its inability to be seen or properly diagramed, yet can be figured in the imagination.

Something that is ''yabo'' is usually unrefined, gigantic, coarse, childish, colorful, self-conscious, permanent, loud, superficial, vulgar, snobbish, boorish, etc.

The word ''yabo'' was often used by city dwellers, or ''[[Chōnin]]'' (especially those of [[Edo]]). It often refers to [[samurai]] and farmers (''[[nomin]])'' from outside Edo, but could also be applied to another ''chonin''. The city dwellers of Edo sometimes called themselves ''[[Edokko]]'' (similar to ''New Yorker'' or ''Parisian''). Proud of having been born and raised in Edo, they had a tendency to despise outsiders. However, the origins of many chonin could be traced back to other areas and backgrounds.

The meaning of the term has expanded and generalized through the [[modernization of Japan]]. Today, the word ''yabo'' is used more frequently than ''[[iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]]''.{{fact|date=April 2017}}
