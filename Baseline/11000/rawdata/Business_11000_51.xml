      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8420">'''Adriano B. Lucatelli''' (born 23 February 1966) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[entrepreneur]] in the financial services industry.

== Life ==
Adriano Lucatelli was born on 23 February 1966 in [[Uster]] near Zurich, Switzerland. His father’s family originated from [[Apulia]] in [[Southern Italy]], and worked primarily in agriculture and the [[textile industry]]. His mother’s family comes from [[Central Switzerland]]. His great-grandfather was the entrepreneur and pioneer in electricity Zeno Durrer, and his great uncle was [[Ludwig von Moos]], a member of the Swiss federal government (the [[Swiss Federal Council]]).

== Education and career ==
Lucatelli studied [[International relations|international affairs]] and [[economics]] at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) and at the [[London School of Economics]] ([[Master of Science|MSc]]). In 1995 he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the [[University of Zurich]] with a dissertation on global financial market regulation. Parallel to his career he has also completed an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] program at the [[University of Rochester]] ([[New York (state)|N.Y.]]), and an advanced management program at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]].

He is a co-founder and CEO of Descartes Finance AG, a Swiss [[robo-advisor]], and Chairman of Additiv AG, a Swiss banking and insurance software provider.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlSCUMTHDFs ''Digitalisierung im Banking.''] ''finews.ch tv'', 4 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Swiss business magazine “Bilanz” chose him among the top 100 Swiss bankers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://descartes-finance.com/media/news/Lucatelli_Bilanz_TopBanker_2017.pdf ''Die 100 Top-Banker der Schweiz''] Bilanz 10/2017, pp. 54, 27 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012 to 2018, he lectured at the [[University of Zurich]] on the [[political economy]] of [[international finance]].

He started his career in 1994 at [[Credit Suisse]], where he held various managerial positions in [[Zurich]] and [[London]]. From 2002 to 2009 Lucatelli was managing director and member of the management committee at [[UBS]] Switzerland in [[Lugano]] and Zurich. He then co-founded Swiss financial services group Reuss Private Group, and between 2009 and 2013 headed securities dealer and investment firm Reuss Private AG&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finews.ch/news/banken/11674-reuss-private-vermoegensverwaltung/ ''Führungswechsel bei Reuss Private.''] ''finews.ch'', 23 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as its CEO.

== Publications and commentaries ==
In the course of his career Lucatelli has published various articles in newspapers and journals, and has authored the books Finance and World Order (1997),&lt;ref&gt;''Finance and world order: financial fragility, systemic risk, and transnational regimes.'' Greenwood Press, Westport, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30378-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Off-Target Corporate Governance (2013),&lt;ref&gt;''Off-Target Corporate Governance or How Not to Throw Good Money after Bad.'' Versus Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-03909-155-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Fine Art of Efficient Investing (2015).&lt;ref&gt;''The Fine Art of Efficient Investing or How to Make Sure You Sleep Better at Night.'' Versus Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-03909-195-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, he co-authored with Lucienne C. Vaudan “Eine kurze Reise durch die Finanzmärkte.”&lt;ref&gt;''Eine kurze Reise durch die Finanzmärkte.'' Versus Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-03909-265-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also writes guest commentaries for publication in the German online magazine stern.de, the Swiss finance portal finews.ch, the Swiss business portal moneycab.com and the ETF-platform 10x10.ch. In terms of [[Klout]] score, Lucatelli has been one of the five most influential Swiss economists on social media from 2015 to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://ranking.influencer.world/en/set/economists ''Klout Ranking der Schweizer Ökonomen'', 3 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investment expertise ==
Lucatelli is a well-known financial expert. Before the [[dot-com bubble|dotcom crash]] in July 2000 he warned that the majority of the new internet firms would disappear,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merlinifinance.com/fileadmin/docs/BAZ_20000722.pdf ''Börse: «Irrationaler Überschwang».''] ''Basler Zeitung'', 22/23 July 2000, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 2011, at the peak of the [[European debt crisis|euro crisis]], he recommended that investors progressively get back into equities and steer clear of overpriced gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/startseite/ruhe-bewahren-1.11899325 ''«Ruhe bewahren» – Sieben Fragen an Adriano Lucatelli.''] ''NZZ am Sonntag'', 14 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated his buy recommendation in March 2014, setting a target of 3,000 index points for the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] by mid-2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merlinifinance.com/fileadmin/docs/20140315_Bull_Rally_MF_E.pdf ''Stock markets: growth in sight?''] ''merlini finance'', Kilchberg, 14 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Added to this Lucatelli, in collaboration with [[Ernst Fehr]], was the first to calculate the [[Market-Adjusted Performance Indicator]] (MAPI) for listed Swiss companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finews.com/news/english-news/22118-adriano-b-lucatelli-ernst-fehr-mapi ''Adriano B. Lucatelli: Share Price Doesn't Tell the Whole Truth''] ''finews.ch'', 26 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The indicator shows that good management systematically creates value for shareholders, reflected in the fact that shares of these companies outperform the broad [[Swiss Performance Index]] (SPI), in some cases by a considerable margin. 

Lucatelli is also one of the first critics of [[Bitcoin]]. He warned early about the uncontrolled speculation with the [[cryptocurrency]].

== Awards &amp; recognition ==
In 2011 he earned the Distinguished Alumni Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unr.edu/alumni/Gala.aspx ''Distinguished Alumni Award Recipients.'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''unr.edu''&lt;/ref&gt; from the College of [[Liberal arts education|Liberal Arts]] at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]]. The same year he was nominated by Ernst &amp; Young Switzerland for the [[Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award|Entrepreneur of the Year award]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.versus.ch/shop/d/scripts/detail.cfm?art_nr=307&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extraprofessional activities ==
Outside work, since 2009 Lucatelli has served as chairman of the readers’ commission of the [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] newspaper, and he funds two [[scholarship]]s giving financial support to students at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://system.nevada.edu/tasks/sites/Nshe/assets/File/BoardOfRegents/Agendas/2012/nov-mtgs/foundations/unr/UNR-2.pdf ''University of Nevada, Reno Foundation. Annual Report to the NSHE Board of Regents.''] ''unr.edu'' 30 November 2012, p. 16 (PDF, 2,7&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unr.edu/silverandblue/archive/2006/fall/NevadaKnow-How.pdf ''Young Nevada alumnus promotes international affairs education.''] ''unr.edu'' Archive 2006, p. 16 (PDF, 400&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unr.edu/silverandblue/archive/2011/fall/NSB%20Fall%202011_40-45.pdf ''Nevada Silver &amp; Blue, Fall 2011.''] ''unr.edu'' Fall 2011, p. 45 (PDF, 429&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucatelli is a life member of the Cantonal Art Museum in [[Lugano]], an honorary member of [[Pi Sigma Alpha]] (the National Political Science Honor Society), and a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in [[London]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2171">The '''Alexander''' family was a prominent [[Croatia]]n Jewish family from [[Zagreb]]. Alexander family ancestors moved to Zagreb from [[Güssing]] in [[Austria]]. For a century, the family played an important role in the economic and social life of Zagreb. Until 1941 and the establishment of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] the Alexanders were a large clan.

The great-grandparents of the Zagreb Alexanders were Samuel and Julija ([[née]] Neumann) Alexander, who had five sons and several daughters. Counting all of their deceased and still living members, including also the descendants of the female line, there were 224 Alexanders in seven generations. Many members of the family perished during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Today only one male descendant bears the surname Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ivan Mirnik|2012|pp=395–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Ivan Mirnik; ''Obitelj Alexander ili kratka kronika izbrisanog vremena''; Institute of Croatian History, [[Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb]]; 1995 Zagreb; Vol. 28; pp. 108, 109, 110, 111, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BRM Costruções Aeronáuticas''' ({{lang-en|BRM Aircraft Manufacturing}}) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[aircraft manufacturer]] based in [[Sintra|Pero Pinheiro]]. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of [[ultralight aircraft]] in the form kits for [[Homebuilt aircraft|amateur construction]] and ready-to-fly aircraft for the European [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] [[microlight]] category.&lt;ref name="WDLA11"&gt;Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: ''World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12'', pages 33-34. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is noted as one of very few light aircraft manufacturers located in Portugal, a country not known for aircraft production.&lt;ref name="WDLA11" /&gt;

BRM's aircraft are built with [[aluminium]] sheet "all-metal" construction. The company's first light two-seat [[STOL]] design was the [[BRM Okavango]], which was superseded by the [[BRM Land Africa]]. The [[BRM Citius]] is an improved model, with a higher cruise speed. The company also produces a [[low-wing]] design, the two-seat [[BRM Argos]].&lt;ref name="WDLA11" /&gt;

Chris Heintz, the designer of the [[Zenith STOL CH 701]] considers the Land Africa an unauthorized copy of the CH 701.&lt;ref name="WDLA11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.zenithair.com/stolch701/7-photo-copies.html|title = STOL CH701|accessdate = 14 January 2015|last = Zenith Aircraft Company|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Ernest Archer''' is a British businessman.

==Career==
In 1987 Archer and [[Greg Stanley]] of Fads DIY acquired Choice DIY, a small [[do it yourself]] (DIY) company with six stores in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and the north of [[England]] for £900,000. In 1988 the [[Focus DIY]] company was bought by Archer and all stores were re-branded Focus DIY.  With the help of [[private equity]] the chain grew to 72 stores in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.focus-d-i-y.co.uk/faboutus.htm|title=About us|publisher=[[Focus DIY]]|accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002 the chain had grown to over 450 stores following several buyouts including the [[Wickes]] DIY chain.  Archer and his partners received over £650 million from the sale of [[Wickes]] in 2005. When his core Focus business was in financial difficulty, US [[private equity]] firm [[Cerberus Capital Management]] bought Focus for £1 in June 2007. Cerberus, which also took on debts of £180m, brought in Bill Grimsey, former chief executive of Wickes. “When we came in, staff morale had been wiped out and the shelves had no stock because suppliers thought it was going bust. The business was still selling eight-year-old kitchens because there had been no investment,” said Grimsey.&lt;ref name="business.timesonline.co.uk"&gt;http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article5487963.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;{{subscription required}}

==Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.==
Archer was also involved in the controversial 1997 sale of the [[Goldstone Ground]] in [[Hove]], the then-home of [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.]], for conversion into a retail park. The club had been based there for many years until the board of directors decided to sell the stadium. The sale, implemented by Archer as majority shareholder and his chief executive [[David Bellotti]], proved controversial and provoked widespread protests against the board. The club received minimal payment from this sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsincrisis.com/brighton/brighton_crisis_history.html|title=Club In Crisis – Brighton|publisher=Club in Crisis|accessdate=6 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926121254/http://www.clubsincrisis.com/brighton/brighton_crisis_history.html|archivedate=26 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/25/brighton-dreamers-miracle-fa-cup|title=The dreamers who built 'the miracle' that is Brighton today|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2013-01-25|location=London|first=Amy|last=Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5561">'''Biomanufacturing''' is a type of [[manufacturing]] or [[biotechnology]] that utilizes biological systems to produce commercially important [[biomaterial|biomaterials]] and [[biomolecule|biomolecules]] for use in [[pharmaceutical drug|medicines]], food and beverage processing, and industrial applications.  Biomanufacturing products are recovered from natural sources, such as blood, or from cultures of [[microbes]], [[animal cells]], or [[plant cells]] grown in specialized equipment.  The cells used during the production may have been naturally occurring or derived using [[genetic engineering]] techniques. 

==Products==
There are thousands of biomanufacturing products on the market today.  Some examples of general classes are listed below: 

=== Medicine ===
* [[Amino acids]]
* [[Biopharmaceuticals]]
* [[Cytokines]]
* [[Fusion proteins]]
* [[Growth factors]]
* [[Monoclonal antibodies]]
* [[Vaccines]]

=== Food and beverage ===
* [[Amino acids]]
* [[Enzymes]]
* Protein supplements

=== Industrial applications that employ cells and/or enzymes ===
* [[Microbiologically induced calcite precipitation|Biocementation]]
* [[Bioremediation]]
* [[Detergents]]
* [[Plastics]]

==Unit operations==
A partial listing of unit operations utilized during biomanufacturing includes the following:
* [[Blood plasma fractionation]]
* [[Cell culture]]
* Cell separation, such as [[filtration]] and [[centrifugation]]
* [[Fermentation]]
* [[Homogenization (biology)|Homogenization]]
* [[Column chromatography]]
* [[Ultrafiltration]] and/or [[diafiltration]]
* Clarification, such as [[filtration]]
* Formulation
* Filling vials or syringes for injectable medicines
 
==Equipment and facilities==

Equipment and facility requirements are dictated by the product(s) being manufactured. Process equipment is typically constructed of stainless steel or plastic.  Stainless steel equipment can be cleaned and reused.  Some plastic equipment is disposed of after a single use. [[File:BTEC Bioreactors.jpg|thumb|center|alt=Photo of BTEC's 30L and 300L bioreactor.|Stainless Steel Bioreactors]]  Products manufactured for medical or food use must be produced in facilities designed and operated according to [[Good manufacturing practice | Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)]] regulations.  [[Cleanrooms]] are often required to control the levels of particulates and microorganisms.  [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]] and [[aseptic]] processing equipment are required for production of [[injectable]] products. 


==Employment==
Skilled professionals are required for positions throughout the life cycle of a biomanufacturing product, which includes:
* [[Research]]
* [[Product development]]
* [[Process development]]
* [[Pre-clinical development|Preclinical evaluation]]
* [[Clinical trials]]
* [[Engineering]]
* [[Manufacturing|Production]]
* [[Supply Chain Management]]
* [[Validation (drug manufacture)|Validation]]
* [[Quality control|Quality Control]]
* [[Quality Assurance]]
* [[Materials Management]]
* [[Sales]]

Details for some of these positions are listed in “The Model Employee,” published by the [[North Carolina Biotechnology Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbiotech.org/sites/default/files/TME-EmailFriendly.pdf|title=The Model Employee|publisher=ncbiotech.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the North Carolina Association for Biomedical Research (NCABR) maintains the website ''About Bioscience'' that offers free online videos on various careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbioscience.org|title=About Bioscience|publisher=www.ncabr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and training==
Several academic institutions have developed curricula and built facilities to provide education and training in biomanufacturing to students from community colleges, universities, and/or industry.   [[NCBioImpact]], established in 2004, is an example of a comprehensive state-wide training network.  Member institutions [[Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center|Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC)]] at [[North Carolina State University]], (BRITE) at [[North Carolina Central University]], and [[North Carolina Community College System|North Carolina Community College System’s]] BioNetwork operate multidisciplinary centers dedicated to workforce development for the biomanufacturing industry.

[http://www.miracosta.edu/biotech MiraCosta College] and [http://www.solano.edu/biotech Solano College] in California developed the first bachelor of science degree in biomanufacturing.  The degree is largely lab-based and is built on a contextualized science and statistics backbone.  The upper division classes recognize the unique environment of biological production where the process sciences and technology thrive in partnership with quality and regulatory compliance.

'''Biotechnology consulting''' (or biotech consulting) refers to the practice of assisting organizations involved in research and commercialization of [[biotechnology]] in improving their methods and efficiency of production, and approaches to [[R&amp;D]]. This assistance is usually provided in the form of specialized technological advice and sharing of expertise. Both start-up and established organizations would hire biotechnology consultants mainly to receive an independent and professional advice from key opinion leaders, individuals with extensive knowledge and experience in a particular area of biotechnology or [[biological science]]s, and, often, to outsource their projects for implementation by well qualified individuals. Large management consulting firms would often be able to provide technological advice as well, depending on the qualifications of their consulting team. With the growth of [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]], biotechnology consulting has recently developed into an industry of its own and separated from the [[management consulting]] industry that traditionally also provides technological advice on R&amp;D projects to various industries. This has also been fueled by the impact various conflicts of interests can have on [[commercialization]] when biotechnology organizations contract services from [[academic institution]]s or government scientists&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Fox. Biotech consulting, investing by NIH scientists curbed. Nature Biotechnology. (2005) 23, 274. [http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n3/abs/nbt0305-274.html ] {{doi|10.1038/nbt0305-274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is exemplified by the successful emergence of a large number of consulting companies dedicated exclusively to servicing the biotech industry. Occasionally, [[university professor]]s and Phd students engage in biotechnology consulting, either commercially or free of charge.

A special type of consulting is [[patent]] strategy and management consulting or simply '''patent consulting''' which specifically emphasizes on the scope of [[patent rights]] versus R&amp;D in industry. It also assets successful commercialization of patentable matter. The primary aim of patent consulting company is to assist various small, medium and large corporation in realizing their research project toward successful patent registration with minimized danger of infringement and other risks that patent registrations may be subjected to prior to commercialization. One example of patent consulting firm is ''The Patent World''.

'''''Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies''''' is a book written by [[James C. Collins|Jim Collins]] and [[Jerry I. Porras]]. The first edition of the book was published on October 26, 1994 by [[HarperBusiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1945533.Built_to_Last|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=''Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies'' by James C. Collins, Jerry I. Porras|accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The text outlines the results of a six-year research project into what makes enduringly great companies. Two primary objectives for the authors’ research goes as follows: “to identify underlying characteristics are common to highly visionary companies” and “to effectively communicate findings so they can influence management”. The research conducted by Collins and Porras was articulated in ''Built to Last'', presenting valid examples based on stories and research data. The book is said to be "one of the most influential business books of our era".&lt;ref name="fastcompany0"&gt;See [http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/88/built-to-last.html?page=0%2C0 Was Built To Last Built To Last?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visionary defined ==
Collins and Porras listed a total of eighteen companies they identified as ‘visionary.’ They defined a visionary company as one that is a premier institution in its [[industry]], is widely admired by knowledgeable businesspeople, made an imprint on the world, had multiple generations of [[Chief executive officer]]s (CEOs), had multiple product/service life cycles, and was founded before 1950. The list of visionary companies was determined based on the results of a survey of 1,000 CEOs. The authors ensured representation across all industries and various sized organizations by sampling from [[Fortune 500]] industrial companies, Fortune 500 service companies, [[Inc. (magazine)|Inc]]. 500 private companies and Inc. 100 public companies. The survey yielded a 23% response rate with 3.2 companies listed per response. An important caveat the authors express is the fact that through their research, they can claim a correlation, not a causal link between their findings and the success of companies.

These companies have taken leadership roles in their industries, offering innovative products and services and consistently outsmarting rivals. What made the research particularly useful and interesting is that Collins and Porras compared and contrasted these visionary companies with a control set of rivals. For instance, Boeing was compared and contrasted with [[Douglas Aircraft]], Marriott was compared and contrasted with [[Howard Johnson's]], and Merck was compared and contrasted with [[Pfizer]]. The findings are based on what the visionary companies do that is different than close competitors who have achieved a high level of success, but not to the extent of the visionary companies. From 1926 through 1990 the comparison companies outperformed the general [[stock market]] by 2 times whereas the visionary companies outperformed the market by 15 times.

==Impact==
''Built to Last'' has influenced many executives and entrepreneurs since it was originally published, including [[Red Hat]].&lt;ref&gt;http://darkmattermatters.com/2009/04/13/the-top-10-books-behind-dark-matter-matters&lt;/ref&gt; Co-author [[James C. Collins|Jim Collins]] became a "superstar" among M.B.A.'s and used his share of the profits to "set up his own research center in Boulder, Colo., staffed with a team of grad students who tackle multiyear research projects aimed at answering big-business questions."&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10313611/site/newsweek/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814060050/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10313611/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=2007-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This research ultimately led to subsequent books such as ''[[Good to Great]]''.

==Criticism==
In his book ''[[The Halo Effect (business book)|The Halo Effect]]'', Phil Rosenzweig is critical of not only ''Built to Last'' but also the entire genre of business books that it belongs to, including ''[[In Search of Excellence]]'', ''[[Good to Great]]'', and ''[[What Really Works]]''. It finds similar faults with a swathe of [[business journalism]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/18/theobserver.observerbusiness14|title=The snares and delusions of pseudoscience|last=Caulkin|first=Simon|date=March 18, 2007 |work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media|accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenzweig uses ''Built to Last'' as an example of the "Delusion of Rigorous Research".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned that the authors had deliberately implied that their research is backed by a huge quantity of data, but the problem is that most of this data are tainted by the Halo Effect.

:"It's so slippery, it's like grabbing a frog," says [[Richard D'Aveni]], professor of strategic management at Dartmouth's [[Tuck School of Business]], of the book, and goes on to further comment "To take this book—or any business book—as gospel is to set yourself up for a fall."&lt;ref name="fastcompany0"/&gt;

''Built to Last'' has also been criticized for the fact that many of the companies it profiled have subsequently faltered. For example:

:"Ten years on, almost half of the visionary companies on the list have slipped dramatically in performance and reputation, and their vision currently seems more blurred than clairvoyant. Consider the fates of Motorola, Ford, Sony, Walt Disney, Boeing, Nordstrom, and Merck. Each has struggled in recent years, and all have faced serious questions about their leadership and strategy. Odds are, none of them today would meet BTL's criteria for visionary companies, which required that they be the premier player in their industry and be widely admired by people in the know."&lt;ref name="fastcompany0"/&gt;

However, author [[James C. Collins|Jim Collins]] has subsequently argued that "The books never promised that these companies would always be great, just that they were once great."&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.inc.com/by-the-book/2009/09/paranoia_your_best_friend.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Kahneman in ''[[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]''&lt;ref name="thinking"&gt;Kahneman, Daniel (2011). "Thinking, fast and slow". Penguin Books. {{ISBN|978-1-846-14606-0}}. Part 3 - Overconfidence, Chapter 19.&lt;/ref&gt; criticizes Collins' overstatement of the importance of good practices relative to sheer luck (explaining the low performance of companies as a typical [[Regression toward the mean|regression to the mean]]):

:"The basic message of Built to Last and other similar books is that good managerial practices can be identified and that good practices will be rewarded by good results.  Both messages are overstated.  The comparison of firms that have been more or less successful is to a significant extent a comparison between firms that have been more or less lucky. Knowing the importance of luck, you should be particularly suspicious when highly consistent patterns emerge from the comparison of successful and less successful firms.  In the presence of randomness, regular patterns can only be mirages." &lt;ref name="thinking"/&gt;

Chris Grams, former Senior Director of Red Hat and one of Collins' biggest admirers, admits&lt;ref name="defense"&gt;See http://newkind.com/2012/01/a-nobel-prize-winner-takes-on-jim-collins-and-the-business-book-industry/&lt;/ref&gt; Kahneman's analysis is technically correct, but he also thinks it is emotionally bankrupt. Although Collins' books may lack academic rigor they make up for in one simple area: they inspire people. They also create the possibility of hope. "Others have done it. I could too!"

Morten Hansen who co-authored Jim Collins on ''[[Great by Choice]]'' has responded to Kahneman's criticism&lt;ref name="defense"/&gt; by referring to Chapter 7 of their book wherein they have analyzed that successful companies are not luckier than the comparisons and therefore luck cannot explain the difference, and that "[[Regression toward the mean|Regression to the mean]] is not always happening, and so (it is true) for companies too."

'''''Chocolatier: Decadence by Design''''' is a [[casual game|casual]] [[strategy video game]], developed by [[Big Splash Games LLC]] and published by [[PlayFirst]]. The game was released on January 22, 2009 for the [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. In 2011 it was released on the [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] platform. In Chocolatier: Decadence by Design, players are able to create their own chocolate by combining ingredients and designing their own chocolate. It is the third video game in the ''[[Chocolatier (video game)|Chocolatier]]'' series.

==Gameplay and plot==

===Introduction===

The game begins with a movie titled "Chocolatier: Decadence by design, a brief history of Baumeister confection" The movie explains the history of Baumeister confection. About 100 years ago, Hierynomous Baumeister built a small shop in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] to support his father's, Marten, chocolate invention. A few years later the confection was a success and became the world's chocolate household, but the company was divided thanks to family squabbles. Sisters Evangeline and Rowena managed to reconcile and rebuild the company, but by the roaring 20's, the company is in decline again. Evangeline's granddaughter, Alexandra Tangye uses secret ingredients and fresh recipes to turn things around, but the company is broken up once more because of the depressing [[World War II|second world war]]. Chocolate factories all over the world are either converted into a weapon factory or abandoned, plus Alex's husband, Sean Fletcher disappeared during an airplane mission.

===Rebuilding===

Alex is now giving the players a chance to rebuild the great company and become its leader. Players will start at [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] where Alex will give out missions in order to become a CEO candidate.

===Endorsements===

She later explains that in order to become CEO, players must earn endorsement from five different board members (Felix Baumeister, Deiter Baumeister, Evangeline Baumeister, Joseph Tangye, and Whitney Baumeister). The ports to these board members unlock one by one after each member gives an endorsement. Players must achieve a few conditions given by the board member (example: recipe requirements, cash in hand, and shops ownership) in order to receive an endorsement. To meet these conditions, players must finish a number of quests given by random people and/or board members.

===Secret laboratory===

After becoming a CEO candidate, players gain access to a secret tasting laboratory located in Reykjavik. In the secret lab, players can create their own chocolate recipes using the ingredients slot, after combining ingredients players will earn a feedback from Teddy Baumeister. After hearing the feedback, players can choose to continue designing the chocolate or go back and choose more suitable ingredients.

===Continuing===

The players can design the chocolate shape and colors they can also name it and gave a description. After creating the recipe, players can manufacture it and start selling it on shops, keep in mind that in order to create recipes players must have an empty slot in the "Creations" section in the recipe book. The slot can be earned by continuing their success in the chocolate world. In the third game, players will be able to not only manufacture series of chocolates, but also coffees. Coffee come in two forms: Coffee and Coffee blends, in order to manufacture coffee players must buy certain coffee beans that matches the recipes.

===Purchases===

Players can purchase ingredients all over the world, some of the market sells mostly sugars and cacao beans. Certain ingredients and beans are only available in certain places in the world, for example the Kona coffee beans can only be purchased at the plantation in Hawaii. Ingredients can also be rewarded to players if they finish certain quest, example: finishing Bianca Rabiti's quest will earn players a few sacks of honey.

==Minigames==
There are four different minigames in Chocolatier: Decadence by design:
*'''Making Chocolates''': Players must shoot out ingredients into the correct tray. If all five tray is filled correctly, players will receive five case/week. If the players match the available tray colours, they'll receive production bonus. But if they missed eight ingredients, production will be halted. This minigame is available on any factory that's equipped with a chocolate machine (Bars, infusions, truffles, or exotics)
*'''Making Coffees''': Players must shoot out ingredients into the conveyor belt to perform a three in a row. If they managed to do four in a row or more, they'll receive a production bonus. But if they missed eight ingredients, production will be halted. This minigame is available on any factory equipped with a coffee machine (Coffee or coffee blends)
*'''Slot Machine''': First, players choose their wager (the amount is determined by their net worth) there are three wagers: x100, x1000, or x10000 (example: 400, 4000, and 40000) after choosing wagers, players can pull down the slot machine handle. If their machine shows a winning row, they'll receive money. This minigame is available only in [[Havana]] and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casino.
*'''Mystery Box''':First, players choose their wager. After choosing wagers they may open mystery boxes, these boxes are filled with money, but three of them are filled with a "Whammy" If players found a whammy, their bet and extra earnings from opening boxes is taken. They can choose to quit at any time (even if their earnings doesn't reach the original bet) This minigame is available only in the Havana and Las Vegas casino

==Reviews==
Slide to play rated the game as a "Must have" and praise its twist on the empire building genre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slidetoplay.com/review/chocolatier-decadence-by-design-ipad-review/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constant Elasticity of Transformation''' (CET) was first advanced by Alan Powell and [[Fred Gruen]] in a 1968 publication.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=Alan A.|author2=Gruen, F.H.G.|date=October 1968|title=The Constant Elasticity of Transformation Production Frontier and Linear Supply System|journal=International Economic Review|publisher=Wiley|volume=9|issue=3|pages=315–328|jstor=2556228|doi=10.2307/2556228}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a new form of [[production-possibility frontier]].
Following on that early work, [[George Philippidis]] made a detailed introduction of the CET function in 1999. The CET is the corollary [[Constant elasticity of substitution|CES]] function, where the production possibilities of the firm (industry) are a function of different combination of supply activities.

'''Danieli''' ({{IPA-it|danˈjɛːli}}) is an Italian supplier of equipment and [[physical plant]]s to the
[[metal industry]].  The company has factories in [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], [[Austria]], [[Thailand]], [[China]], [[India]] and [[Iran]].

Its headquarters are in [[Buttrio]], in the north-east of Italy.

== History ==

Danieli’s origins date to 1914 when two brothers Mario and Timo Danieli founded the Angelini Steelworks in Brescia, Italy, one of the first companies to use the electric arc furnace for steel making &lt;ref&gt;https://industrytoday.com/article/company-of-steel/&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1929 part of the steelworks was transferred to Buttrio to manufacture tools for forging plants and auxiliary machines for rolling mills.
In 1955, led by Luigi Danieli, the company started designing and manufacturing equipment for the steel industry. His idea was to manufacture more competitive equipment, simplify layouts and maximize the use of automation.
One of the concepts developed, the "EAF/Conticaster-Rolling mill" production route, has characterized and contributed to the successful development of the minimill process, which is widely adopted today.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Danieli has since acquired German (Josef Fröhling), Swedish (Morgårdshammar), British (Davy Distington), French (Rotelec), American (Wean Industries, United Engineering), and Dutch (Corus Technical Services) companies. 

Beginning in 1969, through Danieli Automation, the company developed its own automation systems, including instrumentation and power control technologies. 
In 2005 the company started a transformation program and expanded into developing countries by establishing fully owned and directly managed design and production centers. In the early 90s Danieli acquired a local steelmaking company, ABS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6952">'''Data Stream Mining''' is the process of extracting knowledge structures from continuous, rapid data records. A data stream is an ordered sequence of instances that in many applications of data stream mining can be read only once or a small number of times using limited computing and storage capabilities.

In many data stream mining applications, the goal is to predict the class or value of new instances in the data stream given some knowledge about the class membership or values of previous instances in the data stream.
Machine learning techniques can be used to learn this prediction task from labeled examples in an automated fashion.
Often, concepts from the field of [[incremental learning]] are applied to cope with structural changes, [[online Machine Learning|on-line learning]] and real-time demands. 
In many applications, especially operating within non-stationary environments, the distribution underlying the instances or the rules underlying their labeling may change over time, i.e. the goal of the prediction, the class to be predicted or the target value to be predicted, may change over time. This problem is referred to as [[concept drift]].

Examples of data streams include computer network traffic, phone conversations, ATM transactions, web searches, and sensor data.
Data stream mining can be considered a subfield of [[data mining]], [[machine learning]], and [[knowledge discovery]].

==Software for data stream mining==
* [[MOA (Massive Online Analysis)]]: free open-source software specific for mining data streams with concept drift. It has several machine learning algorithms ([[Statistical classification|classification]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[data clustering|clustering]], outlier detection and recommender systems).  Also it contains a prequential evaluation method, the EDDM concept drift methods, a reader of ARFF real datasets, and artificial stream generators as SEA concepts, STAGGER, [[rotating hyperplane]], random tree, and [[random radius based functions]]. MOA supports bi-directional interaction with [[Weka (machine learning)]].
* [[RapidMiner]]: commercial software for knowledge discovery, data mining, and machine learning also featuring data stream mining, learning time-varying concepts, and tracking drifting concept (if used in combination with its data stream mining plugin (formerly: Concept Drift plugin))

[[File:Data warehouse architecture.jpg|thumb|360px|The basic architecture of a data warehouse]]

In [[computing]], a '''data warehouse''' ('''DW''' or '''DWH'''), also known as an '''enterprise data warehouse''' ('''EDW'''), is a system used for [[Business reporting|reporting]] and [[data analysis]], and is considered a core component of [[business intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Dedić|first1=Nedim|last2=Stanier|first2=Clare|year=2016|editor1-last=Hammoudi|editor1-first=Slimane|editor2-last=Maciaszek|editor2-first=Leszek|editor3-last=Missikoff|editor3-first=Michele M.

They store current and historical data in one single place&lt;ref name="rjmetrics"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2014/12/04/10-common-mistakes-when-building-a-data-warehouse/|publisher=blog.rjmetrics.com|title=9 Reasons Data Warehouse Projects Fail|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the enterprise.&lt;ref name="spotlessdata"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726071809/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-warehouses-and-data-quality|publisher=spotlessdata.com|title=Exploring Data Warehouses and Data Quality|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data stored in the warehouse is [[upload]]ed from the [[operational system]]s (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an [[operational data store]] and may require [[data cleansing]]&lt;ref name="rjmetrics"/&gt; for additional operations to ensure [[data quality]] before it is used in the DW for reporting.

The typical [[extract, transform, load]] (ETL)-based data warehouse&lt;ref name="spotlessdata2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217144032/https://spotlessdata.com/what-big-data|publisher=spotlessdata.com|title=What is Big Data?|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses [[Staging (data)|staging]], [[data integration]], and access layers to house its key functions. The staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems. The integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer often storing this transformed data in an [[operational data store]] (ODS) database. The integrated data are then moved to yet another database, often called the data warehouse database, where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups, often called dimensions, and into facts and aggregate facts. The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a [[star schema]]. The access layer helps users retrieve data.&lt;ref name=IJCA96Patil&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijcaonline.org/proceedings/icwet/number9/2131-db195 |author1=Patil, Preeti S. |author2=Srikantha Rao |author3=Suryakant B. Patil |title=Optimization of Data Warehousing System: Simplification in Reporting and Analysis |work=IJCA Proceedings on International Conference and workshop on Emerging Trends in Technology (ICWET) |year=2011 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=33–37 |publisher=Foundation of Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of the data is [[data cleansing|cleansed]], transformed, catalogued, and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for [[data mining]], [[OLAP|online analytical processing]], [[market research]] and [[decision support]].&lt;ref&gt;Marakas &amp; O'Brien 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the means to retrieve and analyze data, to extract, transform, and load data, and to manage the [[data dictionary]] are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system. Many references to data warehousing use this broader context. Thus, an expanded definition for data warehousing includes [[business intelligence tools]], tools to extract, transform, and load data into the repository, and tools to manage and retrieve [[metadata]].

==Benefits==
A data warehouse maintains a copy of information from the source transaction systems. This architectural complexity provides the opportunity to:
* Integrate data from multiple sources into a single database and data model. More congregation of data to single database so a single query engine can be used to present data in an ODS.
* Mitigate the problem of database isolation level lock contention in transaction processing systems caused by attempts to run large, long-running, analysis queries in transaction processing databases.
* Maintain [[Provenance#Data provenance|data history]], even if the source transaction systems do not.
* Integrate data from multiple source systems, enabling a central view across the enterprise. This benefit is always valuable, but particularly so when the organization has grown by merger.
* Improve [[data quality]], by providing consistent codes and descriptions, flagging or even fixing bad data.
* Present the organization's information consistently.
* Provide a single common data model for all data of interest regardless of the data's source.
* Restructure the data so that it makes sense to the business users.
* Restructure the data so that it delivers excellent query performance, even for complex analytic queries, without impacting the [[operational system]]s.
* Add value to operational business applications, notably [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems.
*Make decision–support queries easier to write.
*Organize and disambiguate repetitive data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idera.com/resourcecentral/whitepapers/modern-data-architecture|title=Modern Data Architecture {{!}} IDERA|last=|first=|date=|website=www.idera.com|publisher=|accessdate=2016-09-18|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generic environment==
The environment for data warehouses and marts includes the following:

* Source systems that provide data to the warehouse or mart;
* Data integration technology and processes that are needed to prepare the data for use;
* Different architectures for storing data in an organization's data warehouse or data marts;
*Different tools and applications for the variety of users;
*Metadata, data quality, and governance processes must be in place to ensure that the warehouse or mart meets its purposes.

In regards to source systems listed above, R. Kelly Rainer states, "A common source for the data in data warehouses is the company's operational databases, which can be relational databases".&lt;ref name=rainer2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Rainer|first=R. Kelly|first2=Casey G. |last2=Cegielski |title=Introduction to Information Systems: Enabling and Transforming Business, 4th Edition (Kindle Edition)|date=2012-05-01|publisher=Wiley|pages=127, 128, 130, 131, 133 |isbn=978-1118129401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding data integration, Rainer states, "It is necessary to extract data from source systems, transform them, and load them into a data mart or warehouse".&lt;ref name=rainer2012/&gt;

Rainer discusses storing data in an organization's data warehouse or data marts.&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt;

Metadata are data about data. "IT personnel need information about data sources; database, table, and column names; refresh schedules; and data usage measures".&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt;

Today, the most successful companies are those that can respond quickly and flexibly to market changes and opportunities. A key to this response is the effective and efficient use of data and information by analysts and managers.&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt; A "data warehouse" is a repository of historical data that are organized by subject to support decision makers in the organization.&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt; Once data are stored in a data mart or warehouse, they can be accessed.

==Related systems (data mart, OLAP, OLTP, predictive analytics)==
A [[data mart]] is a simple form of a data warehouse that is focused on a single subject (or functional area), hence they draw data from a limited number of sources such as sales, finance or marketing. Data marts are often built and controlled by a single department within an organization. The sources could be internal operational systems, a central data warehouse, or external data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/html/E10312_01/dm_concepts.htm |title=Data Mart Concepts |publisher=Oracle |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denormalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system. Given that data marts generally cover only a subset of the data contained in a data warehouse, they are often easier and faster to implement.

Types of data marts include dependent, independent, and hybrid data marts.{{clarify |date=March 2017 |reason= }}

[[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP) is characterized by a relatively low volume of transactions. Queries are often very complex and involve aggregations. For OLAP systems, response time is an effectiveness measure. OLAP applications are widely used by [[Data Mining]] techniques. OLAP databases store aggregated, historical data in multi-dimensional schemas (usually [[star schema]]s). OLAP systems typically have data latency of a few hours, as opposed to data marts, where latency is expected to be closer to one day. The OLAP approach is used to analyze multidimensional data from multiple sources and perspectives. The three basic operations in OLAP are : Roll-up (Consolidation), Drill-down and Slicing &amp; Dicing.

[[Online transaction processing]] (OLTP) is characterized by a large number of short on-line transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). OLTP systems emphasize very fast query processing and maintaining [[data integrity]] in multi-access environments. For OLTP systems, effectiveness is measured by the number of transactions per second. OLTP databases contain detailed and current data. The schema used to store transactional databases is the entity model (usually [[Third normal form|3NF]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://datawarehouse4u.info/OLTP-vs-OLAP.html |title=OLTP vs. OLAP |year=2009 |website=Datawarehouse4u.Info |quote=We can divide IT systems into transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP). In general we can assume that OLTP systems provide source data to data warehouses, whereas OLAP systems help to analyze it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system.

[[Predictive analytics]] is about [[pattern recognition|finding]] and quantifying hidden patterns in the data using complex mathematical models that can be used to [[prediction|predict]] future outcomes. Predictive analysis is different from OLAP in that OLAP focuses on historical data analysis and is reactive in nature, while predictive analysis focuses on the future. These systems are also used for [[customer relationship management]] (CRM).

==History==
The concept of data warehousing dates back to the late 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/databasetopics/data/story/0,10801,70102,00.html |title=The Story So Far |date=2002-04-15 |accessdate=2008-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708182105/http://www.computerworld.com/databasetopics/data/story/0%2C10801%2C70102%2C00.html |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy developed the "business data warehouse". In essence, the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to [[decision support system|decision support environments]]. The concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow, mainly the high costs associated with it. In the absence of a data warehousing architecture, an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision support environments. In larger corporations, it was typical for multiple decision support environments to operate independently. Though each environment served different users, they often required much of the same stored data. The process of gathering, cleaning and integrating data from various sources, usually from long-term existing operational systems (usually referred to as [[legacy system]]s), was typically in part replicated for each environment. Moreover, the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged. Often new requirements necessitated gathering, cleaning and integrating new data from "[[data mart]]s" that was tailored for ready access by users.

Key developments in early years of data warehousing were:

* 1960s – [[General Mills]] and [[Dartmouth College]], in a joint research project, develop the terms ''dimensions'' and ''facts''.&lt;ref name="kimball16"&gt;Kimball 2002, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1970s – [[ACNielsen]] and IRI provide dimensional data marts for retail sales.&lt;ref name="kimball16" /&gt;

* 2012 – [[Bill Inmon]] developed and made public technology known as "textual disambiguation". Textual disambiguation applies context to raw text and reformats the raw text and context into a standard data base format. Once raw text is passed through textual disambiguation, it can easily and efficiently be accessed and analyzed by standard business intelligence technology. Textual disambiguation is accomplished through the execution of textual ETL. Textual disambiguation is useful wherever raw text is found, such as in documents, Hadoop, email, and so forth.

==Information storage==

===Facts===
A fact is a value or measurement, which represents a fact about the managed entity or system.

Facts, as reported by the reporting entity, are said to be at raw level. E.g. in a mobile telephone system, if a BTS ([[base transceiver station]]) received 1,000 requests for traffic channel allocation, it allocates for 820, and rejects the remaining, it would report three '''facts''' or measurements to a management system:
* tch_req_total = 1000
* tch_req_success = 820
* tch_req_fail = 180

Facts at the raw level are further aggregated to higher levels in various [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]] to extract more service or business-relevant information from it. These are called aggregates or summaries or aggregated facts.

For instance, if there are three BTS in a city, then the facts above can be aggregated from the BTS to the city level in the network dimension. For example:

* tch_req_success_city = tch_req_success_bts1 + tch_req_success_bts2 + tch_req_success_bts3
* avg_tch_req_success_city = (tch_req_success_bts1 + tch_req_success_bts2 + tch_req_success_bts3) / 3

===Dimensional versus normalized approach for storage of data===
There are three or more leading approaches to storing data in a data warehouse&amp;nbsp;— the most important approaches are the dimensional approach and the normalized approach.

====Dimensional approach====
The dimensional approach refers to [[Ralph Kimball]]'s approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using a Dimensional Model/[[star schema]]. The normalized approach, also called the [[Third normal form|3NF]] model (Third Normal Form) refers to Bill Inmon's approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using an E-R model/normalized model.

In a [[Star schema|dimensional approach]], [[transaction data]] are partitioned into "facts", which are generally numeric transaction data, and "[[dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]]", which are the reference information that gives context to the facts. For example, a sales transaction can be broken up into facts such as the number of products ordered and the total price paid for the products, and into dimensions such as order date, customer name, product number, order ship-to and bill-to locations, and salesperson responsible for receiving the order.

A key advantage of a dimensional approach is that the data warehouse is easier for the user to understand and to use. Also, the retrieval of data from the data warehouse tends to operate very quickly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dimensional structures are easy to understand for business users, because the structure is divided into measurements/facts and context/dimensions. Facts are related to the organization's business processes and operational system whereas the dimensions surrounding them contain context about the measurement (Kimball, Ralph 2008). Another advantage offered by dimensional model is that it does not involve a relational database every time. Thus, this type of modeling technique is very useful for end-user queries in data warehouse.

The model of facts and dimensions can also be understood as [http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~dbd/cs831/notes/dcubes/dcubes.html data cube]. Where the dimensions are the categorical coordinates in a multi-dimensional cube, while the fact is a value corresponding to the coordinates.

The main disadvantages of the dimensional approach are the following:
# To maintain the integrity of facts and dimensions, loading the data warehouse with data from different operational systems is complicated.
# It is difficult to modify the data warehouse structure if the organization adopting the dimensional approach changes the way in which it does business.

====Normalized approach====
In the normalized approach, the data in the data warehouse are stored following, to a degree, [[database normalization]] rules. Tables are grouped together by ''subject areas'' that reflect general data categories (e.g., data on customers, products, finance, etc.). The normalized structure divides data into entities, which creates several tables in a relational database. When applied in large enterprises the result is dozens of tables that are linked together by a web of joins. Furthermore, each of the created entities is converted into separate physical tables when the database is implemented (Kimball, Ralph 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.svrtechnologies.com/datastage-training/data-warehouse-online-training |title=Data Warehouse kimball |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to add information into the database. Some disadvantages of this approach are that, because of the number of tables involved, it can be difficult for users to join data from different sources into meaningful information and to access the information without a precise understanding of the sources of data and of the [[data structure]] of the data warehouse.

Both normalized and dimensional models can be represented in entity-relationship diagrams as both contain joined relational tables. The difference between the two models is the degree of normalization (also known as [[Database normalization#Normal forms|Normal Forms]]). These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there are other approaches. Dimensional approaches can involve normalizing data to a degree (Kimball, Ralph 2008).

In ''Information-Driven Business'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillard|first=Robert|title=Information-Driven Business|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-62577-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Hillard proposes an approach to comparing the two approaches based on the information needs of the business problem. The technique shows that normalized models hold far more information than their dimensional equivalents (even when the same fields are used in both models) but this extra information comes at the cost of usability. The technique measures information quantity in terms of [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]] and usability in terms of the Small Worlds data transformation measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/Small_Worlds_Data_Transformation_Measure |title=Information Theory &amp; Business Intelligence Strategy - Small Worlds Data Transformation Measure - MIKE2.0, the open source methodology for Information Development |publisher=Mike2.openmethodology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design methods==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===Bottom-up design===
In the ''bottom-up'' approach, [[data mart]]s are first created to provide reporting and analytical capabilities for specific [[business process]]es. These data marts can then be integrated to create a comprehensive data warehouse. The data warehouse bus architecture is primarily an implementation of "the bus", a collection of [[Dimension (data warehouse)#Types|conformed dimension]]s and [[Facts (data warehouse)#Types|conformed fact]]s, which are dimensions that are shared (in a specific way) between facts in two or more data marts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://decisionworks.com/2003/09/the-bottom-up-misnomer/|title=The Bottom-Up Misnomer - DecisionWorks Consulting|website=DecisionWorks Consulting|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top-down design===
The ''top-down'' approach is designed using a normalized enterprise [[data model]]. [[Data element|"Atomic" data]], that is, data at the greatest level of detail, are stored in the data warehouse. Dimensional data marts containing data needed for specific business processes or specific departments are created from the data warehouse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gartner, Of Data Warehouses, Operational Data Stores, Data Marts and Data Outhouses, Dec 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid design===
Data warehouses (DW) often resemble the [[hub and spokes architecture]]. [[Legacy system]]s feeding the warehouse often include [[customer relationship management]] and [[enterprise resource planning]], generating large amounts of data. To consolidate these various data models, and facilitate the [[extract transform load]] process, data warehouses often make use of an [[operational data store]], the information from which is parsed into the actual DW. To reduce data redundancy, larger systems often store the data in a normalized way. Data marts for specific reports can then be built on top of the data warehouse.

A hybrid DW database is kept on [[third normal form]] to eliminate [[data redundancy]]. A normal relational database, however, is not efficient for business intelligence reports where dimensional modelling is prevalent. Small data marts can shop for data from the consolidated warehouse and use the filtered, specific data for the fact tables and dimensions required. The DW provides a single source of information from which the data marts can read, providing a wide range of business information. The hybrid architecture allows a DW to be replaced with a [[master data management]] repository where operational, not static information could reside.

The [[data vault modeling]] components follow hub and spokes architecture. This modeling style is a hybrid design, consisting of the best practices from both third normal form and [[star schema]]. The data vault model is not a true third normal form, and breaks some of its rules, but it is a top-down architecture with a bottom up design. The data vault model is geared to be strictly a data warehouse. It is not geared to be end-user accessible, which when built, still requires the use of a data mart or star schema based release area for business purposes.

==Data warehouse characteristics==
There are basic features that define the data in the data warehouse that include subject orientation, data integration, time-variant, nonvolatile data, and data granularity.

===Subject-Oriented===
Unlike the operational systems, the data in the data warehouse revolves around subjects of the enterprise ([[database normalization]]). Subject orientation can be really useful for decision making.
Gathering the required objects is called subject oriented.

===Integrated===
The data found within the data warehouse is integrated. Since it comes from several operational systems, all inconsistencies must be removed. Consistencies include naming conventions, measurement of variables, encoding structures, physical attributes of data, and so forth.

===Time-variant===
While operational systems reflect current values as they support day-to-day operations, data warehouse data represents data over a long time horizon (up to 10 years) which means it stores historical data. It is mainly meant for data mining and forecasting, If a user is searching for a buying pattern of a specific customer, the user needs to look at data on the current and past purchases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/662453070|title=Data warehousing fundamentals for IT professionals|last=Paulraj.|first=Ponniah,|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|others=Ponniah, Paulraj.|isbn=9780470462072|edition= 2nd |location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=662453070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonvolatile===
The data in the data warehouse is read-only which means it cannot be updated, created, or deleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61762085|title=Building the data warehouse|last=H.|first=Inmon, William|date=2005|publisher=Wiley Pub|isbn=9780764599446|edition= 4th |location=Indianapolis, IN|oclc=61762085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summarized===
In the data warehouse, data is summarized at different levels.The user may start looking at the total sale units of a product in an entire region. Then the user looks at the states in that region. Finally, they may examine the individual stores in a certain state. Therefore, typically, the analysis starts at a higher level and moves down to lower levels of details.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Data warehouse architecture==
The different methods used to construct/organize a data warehouse specified by an organization are numerous. The hardware utilized, software created and data resources specifically required for the correct functionality of a data warehouse are the main components of the data warehouse architecture. All data warehouses have multiple phases in which the requirements of the organization are modified and fine tuned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Satinder Bal|last2=Mittal|first2=Aditya|title=Introduction to Database Management System|year=2009|publisher=Laxmi Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Database_Management_Syst.html?id=fyQTae6c9l4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus operational system==
Operational systems are optimized for preservation of [[data integrity]] and speed of recording of business transactions through use of [[database normalization]] and an [[entity-relationship model]]. Operational system designers generally follow [[Codd's 12 rules]] of [[database normalization]] to ensure data integrity. Fully normalized database designs (that is, those satisfying all Codd rules) often result in information from a business transaction being stored in dozens to hundreds of tables. [[Relational database]]s are efficient at managing the relationships between these tables. The databases have very fast insert/update performance because only a small amount of data in those tables is affected each time a transaction is processed. To improve performance, older data are usually periodically purged from operational systems.

Data warehouses are optimized for analytic access patterns. Analytic access patterns generally involve selecting specific fields and rarely if ever 'select *' as is more common in operational databases. Because of these differences in access patterns, operational databases (loosely, OLTP) benefit from the use of a row-oriented DBMS whereas analytics databases (loosely, OLAP) benefit from the use of a [[column-oriented DBMS]]. Unlike operational systems which maintain a snapshot of the business, data warehouses generally maintain an infinite history which is implemented through ETL processes that periodically migrate data from the operational systems over to the data warehouse.

==Evolution in organization use==
These terms refer to the level of sophistication of a data warehouse:

; Offline operational data warehouse: Data warehouses in this stage of evolution are updated on a regular time cycle (usually daily, weekly or monthly) from the operational systems and the data is stored in an integrated reporting-oriented data
; Offline data warehouse: Data warehouses at this stage are updated from data in the operational systems on a regular basis and the data warehouse data are stored in a data structure designed to facilitate reporting.
; On time data warehouse: Online Integrated Data Warehousing represent the real time Data warehouses stage data in the warehouse is updated for every transaction performed on the source data
; Integrated data warehouse: These data warehouses assemble data from different areas of business, so users can look up the information they need across other systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tech-faq.com/data-warehouse.html |title=Data Warehouse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denis O'Donnell''' (28 May 1875 - 16 June 1933) was a well-known entrepreneur in [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]], in the early 1900s. 
[[Image:Denis OD.jpg|frame|Denis O'Donnell, founder of the Lee Strand Creamery]]

==Background==
He was born in Tubrid, [[Ardfert]], County Kerry, to Patrick O'Donnell of Tubridmore, and Bridget (née Griffin) of Lerrig. He was a grandson of John O'Donnell of Ardfert, who lived at Tubridmore, and descended from O'Donnells of [[Tyrconnell]], following on the implantation of O'Donnells in Ardfert by Prince [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell]] en route to the [[Battle of Kinsale]] in 1601, as recorded in the [[Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland]]. He wrote poetry as a hobby. He initially farmed a family farm at Tubrid until he left to [[Ballyhaise College|Ballyhaise]], an agricultural college.&lt;ref&gt;''Writer recalls Tralee youth'', interview with Patrick Denis O'Donnell (Denis's son), published in '''The Kerryman''', August 15, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Hannah Leane, from Ballintobeenig, and they had one child, [[Patrick Denis O'Donnell]]. He died of an accident when his son Patrick was only 11 years old, and his widow, Hannah, subsequently emigrated to the [[United States of America]] at the outbreak of [[World War II]], when their son, Patrick, joined the [[Irish Defence Forces]].

==Education==
Denis O'Donnell was schooled in Tubrid, in Spa, and later in Chapeltown national schools, and then farmed some years before proceeding to study and become one of the first graduates of [[Ballyhaise College]], [[County Cavan]], Ireland, with a Diploma in Dairy Science, having studied there from 1908 to 1910. This was the only such qualification available in the country at the time.

==Business career==
In his early career he was manager in some small creameries, one in [[County Tipperary]], and others in  Black Abbey, [[Adare]], [[County Limerick]]; in Dicksgrove, Farranfore, and  BallymcElligott, and Ballydwyer in [[County Kerry]]. He was influenced by the cooperative movement being driven by Sir [[Horace Plunkett]], well described in the account of country life of the times by Elizabeth, Countess of [[Fingal]]l, ''Seventy Years Young''.  Sir Horace Plunkett, MP, and later Senator of the [[Irish Free State]], third son of Lord Dunsany, was father of the Irish agricultural co-operative movement, and founded the [[Irish Agricultural Organisation Society]] (now the [[Irish Co-operative Organisation Society]]), which included several hundred creameries. Accordingly, Denis O'Donnell actively organised farmers in the early [[cooperative movement]] in County Kerry, and founded the Lee Strand Co-operative Creamery on April 20, 1920 in Church Street, [[Tralee]], still a going concern in 2009 although it relocated to Ballymullen in 1992. He owned a pub at #2 Edward Street, Tralee, run by his sister Bride, until her emigration to Kimberly, South Africa. The pub was sold in 1938. He also owned shops in Rock Street and Castle Street in Tralee. He was the first to introduce the [[pasteurisation]] of milk, much against the prejudice of dairy farmers at the time, and also was the first to market [[ice-cream]] in Tralee.

His entrepreneurial streak and outreach to farming communities provided a socio-economic complement to the political mobilisation undertaken by his kinsman, [[Thomas O'Donnell, M.P.]] for West Kerry, who campaigned for agrarian reforms. [[Maurice Moynihan]], father of [[Maurice Gerard Moynihan]], was a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], was Thomas O'Donnell's campaign manager and was a cousin of Denis O'Donnell.

'''Downtown Athens''' is the oldest of the main commercial and residential centers in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]].  Downtown is generally considered to be the area bounded by Dougherty Street on the north, Broad Street and the [[University of Georgia]] campus on the south, Pulaski Street on the west, and Foundry Street by the east.

A [[Downtown Athens Historic District]] was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by Austin Kinsey in 1978.

The commercial and governmental heart of the city has traditionally been toward the eastern end of Downtown Athens, between Lumpkin and Thomas Streets. Recent developments, particularly between Lumpkin and Pulaski Streets, have expanded the boundaries of the "central" part of the neighborhood. The term "Downtown Athens" can also mean this smaller, more commercial area, particularly when used in the context of the city's nightlife and restaurants. 

Some definitions of "Downtown" include the area west of Pulaski Street, which is a much more residential area characterized by historic homes, new infill construction, and some public housing. This part of Downtown Athens has the highest concentration of hotels {{citation needed|date=October 2010}} particularly along Broad Street.  The Prince Avenue commercial corridor is an important center of business, particularly for those living in the [[Boulevard (Athens)|Boulevard]] and [[Normaltown (Athens)|Normaltown]] neighborhoods.

The area has several hotels and apartment buildings, and more high-rise condos are either under construction or planned for the area. Some of these high-rises as well as the construction of the new Multi-Modal Transportation Center have the potential to redefine the area encompassing downtown Athens to stretch east to the banks of the [[Oconee River]].

[[Image:Dt athens.jpg|600px|thumb|center|A map of Athens with Downtown and UGA shaded. Note that the common definition of Downtown does not include the area west of Pulaski Street.]]

== Defining "Downtown Athens" ==

The exact delineation of what is "Downtown" differs for varying purposes. Some of the more common ones are:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! South         !! North             !! East            !! West            !! Function/context, etc.
|-
| Broad&amp;nbsp;St || Hancock&amp;nbsp;St   || Foundry&amp;nbsp;St  || Pulaski&amp;nbsp;St || This is the boundary of the "no-cruising zone" established by Athens-Clarke County ordinance. ("No cruising" means no motor vehicle may pass the same point within the zone more than three times in an hour, during the hours of midnight to 4 a.m.) [http://library.municode.com/HTML/12400/level3/PIII_T3_C3-3.html#PIII_T3_C3-3_s3-3-64]
|-
| Broad&amp;nbsp;St || Dougherty&amp;nbsp;St || Foundry&amp;nbsp;St || Pulaski&amp;nbsp;St || This is the common definition of Downtown, clearly distinguished from the rest of Athens by such things as building density, metered on-street parking, etc. Athens-Clarke County uses a distinctive street sign design (using the ACC logo on signs) within this boundary.
|-
| Broad&amp;nbsp;St || Dougherty&amp;nbsp;St/ Prince&amp;nbsp;Ave || Foundry&amp;nbsp;St || Milledge&amp;nbsp;Ave || This is a more generous area of Downtown, including the above in addition to the Broad Street and Prince Avenue corridors immediately to the west of the core of Downtown.
|}

== Cultural significance ==

The Downtown area is the cultural center of the city. Several dozen night clubs host performances of local, regional and national bands and artists.  The [[40 Watt Club]] at the corner of Washington and Pulaski and [[Georgia Theater]] on Lumpkin Street between Clayton and Washington are among the most well-known night spots where many bands have made the jump to a larger regional stage (See [[Music of Athens, Georgia]]).  The Classic Center, located on Thomas Street on the eastern edge of the neighborhood, is a multi-purpose facility containing a performing arts center, convention space, and banquet halls. It was a filming site for ''[[Blue Collar TV]]''.

== Restaurants and bars ==

Downtown Athens is home to award-winning restaurants&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitathensga.com/restaurants/award-winning-dining/&lt;/ref&gt; including The Last Resort and Weaver D's. Five &amp; Ten, a high class expensive restaurant is known for the famous chef, [[Hugh Acheson]], who was named Best Chef Southeast by the James Beard Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitathensga.com/restaurants/award-winning-dining/&lt;/ref&gt; and also on [[Top Chef: Masters (season 3)]].  Other notable restaurants include The Porterhouse Grill and De Palmas. There are a variety of eating options, ranging from higher-priced luxury dining, chain restaurants, ethnic food restaurants, and inexpensive bar food.&lt;ref&gt;http://voices.yahoo.com/you-havent-tasted-pizza-athens-georgia-6872758.html?cat=22{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The streets, particularly on Thursday through Saturday, are filled with people and cars late into the night. Popular bars are on every street corner, including Magnolia's, Allgood, Blue Sky, Silver Dollar, General Beauregard's, Walker's Pub, Boars Head, Sandbar and Trappeze. There are around 80 bars in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownathensga.com/businesses.php?category%3D29 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812061825/http://www.downtownathensga.com/businesses.php?category=29 |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, nightlife for this demographic has been concentrated in the neighborhood's rapidly changing "West End", the area between Lumpkin and Pulaski Streets. Nightlife catering to a more mainstream college-age demographic remains in the eastern part of the neighborhood, especially along Broad and Clayton Streets. During the day, visitors of all ages can find a reason to visit Downtown Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/the-pros-cons-downtown-athens-georgia-11203126.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728235949/http://voices.yahoo.com/the-pros-cons-downtown-athens-georgia-11203126.html |archivedate=2014-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shopping ==
Locally- owned fashion boutiques line the streets, including Encore, Heery's and Cheeky Peach that all include designer brand names. Catering to the city's diverse populations, vintage shops like Agora and Cillies host a variety of items. Many of these outlets reflect Athens's status as a university town and a small liberal city. In particular, independent music stores such as the world-famous Wuxtry Records and alternative shops are found along Clayton Street, as well as the Georgia Bulldogs fan shop known as The Red Zone.

== Government ==

The Athens-Clarke County unified government is located in the Downtown district.  Several local and federal government buildings are located along Washington Street, and the county adult health center is located just within the western boundary of Downtown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2705">'''Frederick Simeon Carus Driffield''' (1825 &amp;ndash; 18 June 1889) was a businessman in the early days of the colony of South Australia.

==History==
Frederick Driffield was born at [[Prescot]], [[Lancashire]], the sixth son of the Rev. Charles George Townshend Driffield, Vicar of Prescot. &lt;!-- and grandson of the Rev. W. W. D. Driffield, Rector of [[Feering]], and his wife, the Hon. Elizabeth Townshend.--&gt; He was a cousin of General [[Arnold Burrowes Kemball|Sir Arnold Kemball]].&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47064375 |title=Death of F. S. C. Driffield |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=19 June 1889 |accessdate=22 November 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated for the Church, and afterwards qualified to go out to China as a teataster. Instead, he emigrated to South Australia with a younger brother and J. Hamilton Parr in the ship ''Posthumous'', arriving in June 1849. Shortly after their arrival they built the Knowsley flourmill, near [[Woodside, South Australia|Woodside]] and supported [[John Baker (Australian politician)|John Baker]] in his successful [[Members of the South Australian Legislative Council, 1851–1855|1851 bid]] for the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] seat of Mount Barker. They were brought to financial ruin with the exodus to the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n diggings and were compelled to join the rush. Driffield returned to Woodside in 1853 after enjoying some success prospecting at [[Ovens, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=death/&gt;

*He was appointed Secretary of the [[Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia|Agricultural and Horticultural Society]] in 1866, which position he held for some nine or ten years.
*In 1866 he founded the highly successful West Adelaide Building Society.
*He was for many years Secretary to the Adelaide branch of [[Lloyd's of London]], which he remodelled as the Adelaide Marine and Fire Assurance Company.
*He was appointed Secretary of the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce.

An employee, [[John Creswell (sportsman)|John Creswell]], took over the business and also succeeded him (though not immediately) as Secretary of both the Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Society. Creswell was succeeded in both roles by [[J. A. Riley]]; all three capably and for considerable periods.

==Family==
He married Jane McMinn ( &amp;ndash; 28 June 1914) on 22 January 1856; they had one daughter and six sons.

'''Human systems engineering''' ('''HSE''') is a field based on [[systems theory]] intended as a structured approach to influence the intangible reality in organizations in a desirable direction. HSE claims to turn complexity into an advantage, to ease innovation processes in organizations and to master problems rooted in negative emotions and lack of motivation. It is taught in a Master of Advanced Studies program of the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HES-SO) as a complementary and postgraduate program for students who have already achieved a bachelor level or an MBA.

Recently, after the crisis of the Swiss banking system due to [[whistle blowing]] and to the stealing and selling to intelligence services of sensitive data by bank personnel, numerous articles featured "human risks" as a major problem in organisations. According to [[:de:Lutz von Rosenstiel]]&lt;ref&gt;von Rosenstiel L., Nerdinger F., Spiess E., Was morgen alles anders läuft, Econ Verlag 1991&lt;/ref&gt; the "lack of meaning" and conflicts between personal and organisational values systems is becoming increasingly a problem; people have not any more the feeling to "belong" to an organization if every relation is to be seen as a commercial interaction. [[Chris Argyris]] sees the same problem from the point of view of learning interactions between the organization and personnel, where the organization expects from its personnel to learn in order to fulfil jobs, but the organization is not prepared to learn from its personnel through [[double-loop learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Argyris C., Organizational Learning II. Theory, Method and Practice, Addison-Wesley Pub. Co, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

To handle these issues, in HSE, the organization is seen as a living system according to [[Living systems#Miller's living systems theory|J.G. Millers theory of open and self organizing systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller J.G., ''Living Systems'', McGraw-Hill, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In HSE, the 3 systemic levels "individual", "group" and "organization" are considered as main entities and targets to influence, whereas the levels "society" and "supranational system" supply the criteria for a positive insertion of the organization in its environment. This approach is intended to help managers to understand the organization as a complex and organic system where functional relations, hierarchy and processes are only the visible and tangible part of the "iceberg". HSE claims the invisible part is as important as the tangible and structural aspects of the organizations. HSE sees the invisible as the unconscious part of both the individual and the organization as a collective entity. [[Fritjof Capra]] describes the subtle interactions between the tangible and the invisible in one of his books.&lt;ref&gt;Capra F., The Hidden Connections: A Science for Sustainable Living,Doubleday 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

From an epistemological point of view HSE refers explicitly to [[Edgar Morin]]'s proposal to link sciences and practices &lt;ref&gt;Morin E., Relier les connaissances – Le défi du XXIe siècle, Ed. Seuil 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Jean Piaget]]'s concept of "[[transdisciplinarity]]".

As a result of the program, human risks and the resources deriving from a positive interaction are now better understood.&lt;ref&gt;Dubouloz C., Le bonheur des collaborateurs est un facteur décisif du succès, in Le Temps, 29.04.2005,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloch E.

Further, 7 cohorts of students who achieved their master's degree "teach the gospel" in and around Switzerland. 

HSE was first launched in French in 2002 at the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland and in 2004 at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in German language.

The program was founded in 2002 by two professors of the university:
* Prof. [[Christa Muth]] PhD,&lt;ref&gt;Dorier R, Muth C., Comment utiliser la complexité – Outils, attitudes et compétences à développer, jobindex media ag, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; who did several years research in organizational psychosociology and was developer of the Leonardo 3.4.5 methodology for strategy analysis in relation with team-members thought patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo345.com Leonardo 3.4.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Muth was the main conceptor of HSE.
* Prof. Marie-France Bourdais, specialist in communication and coaching, joined the team at an early stage and contributed her experience in using [[Neuro-linguistic-programming]] for modelling human and business processes.

Recently [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] started using the term "Human Systems Engineering" in its Engineering Systems Division, putting the focus on how people and organizations, conceive, develop and handle technological systems. Specialised courses focus on topics such as "The Human Side of Technology" or more human risk oriented courses as for example "Managing Nuclear Technology".

A similar program exists in Canada: [[Human Systems Intervention]].

'''''In Search of Excellence''''' is an international bestselling book written by [[Tom Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman, Jr.]].

First published in 1982, it is one of the best selling business books ever, selling 3 million copies in its first four years, and being the most widely held monograph in the United States from 1989 to 2006 ([http://www.oclc.org/research/top1000/monographs97.html WorldCat] data).

The book purports to explore the art and science of [[management]] used by several 1980s companies.

==Background==

''In Search of [[Excellence]]'' did not start out as a book, as [[Tom Peters]] explained when interviewed in 2001 to mark the 20th anniversary of ''In Search of Excellence''. In the same interview, Peters claims that he and Waterman were both consultants on the "margins" of [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]], based in the [[San Francisco]] office.&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"&gt;https://www.fastcompany.com/44077/tom-peterss-true-confessions&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 McKinsey [[Executive director|director]] [[Ron Daniel (businessman)|Ron Daniel]] launched two projects; the first and major one, the Business Strategy project, was allocated to top consultants at McKinsey's [[New York City]] corporate [[Headquarters|HQ]] and was given significant resources, but could not manage to effectively implement strategy.

Peters states that directly after graduating with a PhD from Stanford, and returning to McKinsey, Daniel handed him a "fascinating assignment."&lt;ref name="tompeters.com"&gt;http://tompeters.com/2011/03/a-brief-history-of-the-7-s-mckinsey-7-s-model/&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by the new ideas coming from Bruce Henderson's [[Boston Consulting Group]], Peters "was asked [by Daniel] to look at 'organization effectiveness' and 'implementation issues' in an inconsequential offshoot project nested in McKinsey's rather offbeat San Francisco office."&lt;ref name="tompeters.com"/&gt; While Daniel's first project was focused on Business Strategy, this second project was concerned with Organization, which Peters defined as involving "the structure-and-people side."&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"/&gt; This "Organization" project was seen as less important, according to Peters in a [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] interview.

Despite being described as "marginal," the project "had an infinite travel budget that allowed [Peters] to fly first class and stay at top-notch hotels and a license from McKinsey to talk to as many cool people as [he] could all around the United States and the world."&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"/&gt; Peters admits that "There was no carefully designed work plan. There was no theory that I was out to prove. I went out and talked to genuinely smart, remarkably interesting, first-rate people."&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"/&gt; In addition to [[Karl Weick]] and [[Einar Thorsrud]], Peters notes that [[Douglas McGregor]]'s theory of motivation known as [[Theory X and Theory Y]] was directly influential on the direction of the project.

In a 1978 article, "Symbols, Patterns and Settings," Peters argued that "shifting organizational structure" and "inventing new processes" - structure and system, respectively - were only two tools of organizational change. Peters then outlines eight "mundane" tools that every manager has at their fingertips. He described this article as a "tentative presentation" and "the first public expression of these ideas."&lt;ref name="tompeters.com"/&gt;

In 1979 McKinsey's [[Munich]] office requested Peters to present his findings to Siemens, which provided the spur for Peters to create a 700-slide two-day presentation. Word of the meeting reached the US and Peters was invited to present also to [[PepsiCo]], but unlike the hyper-organised [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], the PepsiCo management required a tighter format than 700 slides, so [[Tom Peters]] consolidated the presentation into eight themes. These eight would form the chapters of ''In Search of Excellence''.

In 1980, Waterman joined Peters, and, along with Waterman's friend [[Tony Athos]] and [[Richard Pascale]] - both academics - came together at a two-day retreat in San Francisco to develop what would become known as the 7-S Framework, the same framework that would organize ''In Search of Excellence''. In June 1980, Peters published an op-ed in the ''Manager's Journal'' section of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' titled "The Planning Fetish."&lt;ref&gt;Peters, T. (1980). The Planning Fetish. Manager's Journal," Wall Street Journal.&lt;/ref&gt; In this article, he "stressed the importance of execution and dismissed the whole idea of strategy."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=kAKZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=%22stressed+the+importance+of+execution+and+dismissed+the+whole+idea+of+strategy.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MUacCLx0MD&amp;sig=tNqvcmnyNdO5IsfJ9cuEFMmx8iU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIiPTpzbiDyQIVw6keCh2v2QyS#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stressed%20the%20importance%20of%20execution%20and%20dismissed%20the%20whole%20idea%20of%20strategy.&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; As strategy was McKinsey's main operation at the time, this was seen as a "frontal assault" on the company, leading [[Mike Bulkin]], the head of the New York office, to demand that Daniel fire Peters.

The primary "innovative" theme that under-girded what would become ''In Search of Excellence'' was that "structure is not organization." This also happened to be the title of a 1980 journal article authored by Bob Waterman, Tom Peters, and [[Julien Phillips]] in which they argue that the "picture of the thing is not the thing...An organizational structure is not an organization."&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, R. H., Peters, T. J., &amp; Phillips, J. R. (1980). Structure is not organization. Business Horizons, 23(3), 14-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This article also introduced what would become the [[McKinsey 7-S Framework]].

In December 1981, Peters left the company, after agreeing to a fifty percent royalty split with McKinsey. Later co-author Waterman stayed at the firm for three more years, but received no royalties from ''In Search of Excellence''

==Companies covered==
[https://www.forbes.com/2002/10/04/1004excellent_print.html A list of companies covered in the book, and their subsequent financial performance.]  This list includes only publicly traded companies.

==Themes==
Peters and Waterman found eight common themes which they argued were responsible for the success of the chosen corporations. The book devotes one chapter to each theme.

# A bias for action, active decision making - 'getting on with it'. Facilitate quick decision making &amp; problem solving tends to avoid bureaucratic control
# Close to the customer - learning from the people served by the business.
# Autonomy and entrepreneurship  - fostering innovation and nurturing 'champions'.
# Productivity through people- treating rank and file employees as a source of quality.
# Hands-on, value-driven  - management philosophy that guides everyday practice - management showing its commitment.
# Stick to the knitting  - stay with the business that you know.
# Simple form, lean staff  - some of the best companies have minimal HQ staff.
# Simultaneous loose-tight properties  - autonomy in shop-floor activities plus centralized values.

==Criticisms==

As early as 1984 it was apparent, to certain analysts, that the book's choice of companies was poor to indifferent. [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Wang Labs]], [[Xerox]] and others did not produce excellent results in their balance sheets in the 1980s.

[[Rick Chapman]] titled his book on high-tech marketing fiascoes, ''In Search of Stupidity'', as a nod to Peters's book and the disasters that befell many of the companies it profiled. He notes that "with only a few exceptions... [the excellent companies were] large firms with dominant positions in markets that were senescent or static."

In an article in ''Fast Company,'' cited below, Peters remarked that the criticism that "If these companies are so excellent, Peters, then why are they doing so badly now," in his opinion "pretty much misses the point."&lt;ref name=faked/&gt;

The research methodology employed by the authors of this book is also severely criticized by Phil Rosenzweigh in his book "The Halo Effect" &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
as the "Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots". Rosenzweigh opines that it was not possible to identify the traits that make a company perform simply by studying already-performing companies which Peters and Waterman did.

==Peters' "confession" of "true data"==

In December, 2001, ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' printed an article, crediting [[Tom Peters]] as author, entitled "Tom Peters's True Confessions". Most of the "confessions" were humorously self-deprecating remarks (''In Search of Excellence'' had been "an afterthought... a hip-pocket project that was never supposed to amount to much"). One of them, however, used the term "faked data:"
:This is pretty small beer, but for what it's worth, okay, I confess: We faked the data. A lot of people suggested it at the time. The big question was, How did you end up viewing these companies as "excellent" companies? A little while later, when a bunch of the "excellent" companies started to have some down years, that also became a huge accusation: If these companies are so excellent, Peters, then why are they doing so badly now? Which I'd say pretty much misses the point.

:''[In] Search [of Excellence]'' started out as a study of 62 companies. How did we come up with them? We went around to McKinsey's partners and to a bunch of other smart people who were deeply involved and seriously engaged in the world of business and asked, Who's cool? Who's doing cool work? Where is there great stuff going on? And which companies genuinely get it? That very direct approach generated a list of 62 companies, which led to interviews with the people at those companies. Then, because McKinsey is McKinsey, we felt that we had to come up with some quantitative measures of performance. Those measures dropped the list from 62 to 43 companies. General Electric, for example, was on the list of 62 companies but didn't make the cut to 43 -- which shows you how "stupid" raw insight is and how "smart" tough-minded metrics can be.

:Were there companies that, in retrospect, didn't belong on the list of 43? I only have one word to say: Atari.

:Was our process fundamentally sound? Absolutely! If you want to go find smart people who are doing cool stuff from which you can learn the most useful, cutting-edge principles, then do what we did with ''Search'': Start by using common sense, by trusting your instincts, and by soliciting the views of "strange" (that is, nonconventional) people. You can always worry about proving the facts later.&lt;ref name=faked&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/44077/tom-peterss-true-confessions|title=Tom Peters's True Confessions|author=Tom Peters|date=November 2001|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[BusinessWeek]]'' ran an article about Fast Company's article. As related by ''BusinessWeek'', the article was actually written by Fast Company founding editor [[Alan M. Webber]], based on a six-hour interview with Peters. Peters reviewed and approved the article prior to publication, but the actual phrase "we faked the data" was Webber's, and Peters had not actually used these words during the interview. ''BusinessWeek'' quoted Peters as saying "Get off my case. We didn't fake the data." According to ''BusinessWeek'', Peters says he was "pissed" when he first saw the cover. "It was his [Webber's] damn word," he says. "I'm not going to take the heat for it."&lt;ref&gt;

All of Residential Properties Trust’s executive officers staff or direct at least one of its external managers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  and they also split their time acting as directors or staff of other Inland vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pgs. 63, 103-106.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] filings, the company disclosed that Residential Properties Trust’s officers will have [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] due to the competing demands for the time they spend between different funds, and that these might lead to them violating their [[fiduciary]] duties. The SEC filings further acknowledge that the Trust’s external managers will face conflicts of interest because of their compensation arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such actions could include purchasing assets that are not in shareholders’ best interests, or negotiating higher purchase prices for assets than they otherwise would if they were not compensated based on the purchase price, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fund Management==
In contrast to most publicly-traded REITs, Residential Properties Trust relies completely on external managers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inlandinvestoralert.org/wp-content/uploads/ResidentialPropertiesTrust_April2015.pdf?preview=true] "Residential Properties Trust:
The latest Inland fee generator?"&lt;/ref&gt; It has no paid staff, and is managed by five executive officers who all staff or direct one or more of the Trust’s fee-based external advisors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151 Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pgs. 22, 63,107]&lt;/ref&gt; The external advisors are owned by The Inland Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151 Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pgs. 22, 111, 112]&lt;/ref&gt; and extract fees or [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s when Residential Properties Trust buys, holds or sells real estate. Due to this setup, the fund has inherent [[conflicts of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inlandinvestoralert.org/wp-content/uploads/ResidentialPropertiesTrust_April2015.pdf?preview=true] "Residential Properties Trust:
The latest Inland fee generator?"&lt;/ref&gt;

The external advisors are tasked with running the business of the Trust, including: selecting potential real estate investments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; negotiating contracts, managing properties&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and advising the [[board of directors]] on asset acquisitions and sales, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  In return, they will earn fees through schedules laid out in agreements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; with Residential Properties Trust.

Residential Properties Trust’s structure is very similar to the initial structure of Inland American.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1307748/000110465905042350/a05-12447_7424b3.htm#OurBusinessManager_112411] Inland American Real Estate Trust Prospectus (Form 424B3), 8/31/05, pg. 2, 3, 82-83; [http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pgs. 22, 63, 103, 105, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  At Inland American, related-party transactions have contributed to litigation and regulatory scrutiny.

==Fees==
The external managers of Residential Properties Trust are compensated through a set of fees charged to investors on a variety of fund transactions.  Because most of the fees are not performance-based, the managers will make money on the Trust’s investments no matter how well – or poorly – they perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inlandinvestoralert.org/wp-content/uploads/ResidentialPropertiesTrust_April2015.pdf?preview=true "Residential Properties Trust: The latest Inland fee generator?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Several fees are structured in a way that could incentivize external managers to act counter to the interests of investors. For example, business management fees&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and mortgage financing fees&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; reward managers, respectively, for holding onto highly valued (or even overvalued) assets for long periods of time and loading up on mortgage debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another fee, called an acquisition fee, is tied only to the amount of money the Trust pays for real estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pgs. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this structure, managers do not benefit by trying to negotiate lower prices for acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition fees have been controversial at a sister Inland product, Inland Real Estate Income Trust (Income Trust).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inlandincometrust.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  Income Trust recently came under fire for its plans to purchase properties that were owned by a different Inland vehicle just months prior.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1528985/000089262614000243/ireit-supp16.htm] Inland Real Estate Income Trust, Supplement 16 dated 9/16/2014 to the Prospectus dated 4/16/14, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Wall Street Journal'' dubbed the transaction a “[https://www.wsj.com/articles/plots-ploys-1410904252 boomerang buy]”.

They could also face a conflict of interest should one Inland vehicle attempt offload assets to another,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.com/IRWebLinkX/file.aspx?iid=4562566&amp;fid=1001195151] Inland Residential Properties Trust, Prospectus dated 2/17/15, pgs. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; like the “boomerang buy” that Income Trust engaged in, as mentioned above.

'''John Arnold Bredenkamp''' (born 11 August 1940) is a Zimbabwean businessman and former rugby player. He is the founder of the [[Casalee Group]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], South Africa, Bredenkamp moved with his family to [[Southern Rhodesia]] while he was still a child. He was orphaned in his mid-teens on his birthday when while he was riding his bike, on return he found his father had shot his mother and sister and then shot himself. His sister survived the shooting. He was educated in Southern Rhodesia at [[Prince Edward School]], [[Harare|Salisbury]]. Of Dutch ancestry, Bredenkamp registered as a Rhodesian citizen in 1958. He is reported to have lost Zimbabwean citizenship "by default" in 1984, but this was restored to him shortly thereafter.

Bredenkamp is reported to hold Zimbabwean, South African and Dutch passports. The matter of his nationality was a matter of dispute with some Zimbabwean officials towards the end of 2006.  

As a Rugby Union international, he captained Rhodesia from 1965 to 1968.

==Early career==
After his graduation, Bredenkamp joined [[Gallaher Limited]], an international tobacco company in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia), as a leaf buyer. In 1968 he was transferred to Niemeyer in the Netherlands, where he rose to the position of leaf director. 

After leaving Gallaher in 1976 Bredenkamp founded the Casalee Group of companies registered in [[Antwerp, Belgium]]. It is believed that the Casalee operation was involved in the sale of Rhodesian tobacco on world markets, through evasion of UN sanctions. Casalee was primarily a leaf tobacco merchanting company but was also engaged in general trading and an active initiator of counter trade and barter deals. The Casalee Group grew over 16 years to become the fifth largest tobacco merchant in the world and the biggest non-US leaf tobacco company. The Group employed 2,500 people and had offices in all the major tobacco growing countries in the world including the USA (Winston-Salem), Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Greece, India, Indonesia, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey and [[Yugoslavia]]. The company owned tobacco-processing factories in the Netherlands, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Brazil.

The Casalee Group of companies was sold in 1993 to Universal Leaf Tobacco, the largest leaf tobacco company in the world. Since then, Bredenkamp has expanded his business interests into many other different areas, mainly through the Zimbabwe registered Breco company.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 9 June 2006: [https://www.theguardian.com/zimbabwe/article/0,,1793719,00.html Tycoon flees Zimbabwe in private jet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Zimbabwe==
Bredenkamp's career took off in earnest during the late 1970s when he became deeply involved in the commercial affairs of the embargoed [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|UDI]] regime in Rhodesia. It has been claimed that he effectively ran the finances of the Rhodesian armed forces during the later stages of the [[Rhodesia|Bush War]].&lt;ref&gt;newzimbabwe.com :[http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/quit12.14272.html financial and political dealings of Bredenkamp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206015906/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/quit12.14272.html |date= 6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he brokered export sales of Rhodesian products (mainly tobacco) and used the proceeds to fund the purchase of munitions and military equipment. His "sanctions busting" deals (often involving complex barter transactions) sustained the UDI regime for far longer than would otherwise have been possible. These deals were entirely legal under Rhodesian law.

After independence in 1980, Bredenkamp left Zimbabwe and moved his base of operations to Belgium. However, he remained involved in commodity trading and defence procurement. He made himself useful in certain quarters. In 1984 he made his peace with the rulers of the new Zimbabwe and was able to return home. Zimbabwe provided a hospitable base for Bredenkamp's dealings with customers in Africa and the Middle East. These dealings made Bredenkamp and his associates very wealthy men. They also helped sustain the Zimbabwean economy in a time of some turbulence.

Bredenkamp gained considerable clout in the political and economic affairs of Zimbabwe. It is known that he played a significant role in the events surrounding Zimbabwe's intervention in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo|DRC]] between 1998 and 2003. This intervention involved using the Zimbabwean army and air force to support the [[Laurent Kabila|Kabila]] government in its war with rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda. There appears to have been some linkage between the intervention and generous mining concessions granted by the DRC to figures in the Zimbabwe political and business elite.&lt;ref&gt;UN report :[http://www.afrol.com/Countries/DRC/documents/un_resources_2002_govt_zim.htm – Zimbabwe involvement in DRC minerals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215131737/http://www.afrol.com/Countries/DRC/documents/un_resources_2002_govt_zim.htm |date=15 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Zimbabwe was subject to EU sanctions from 1999 onwards, the Mugabe regime was able to call on sanctions busting expertise from the UDI era to keep its armed forces supplied.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons, 18 November 2002 :[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021118/text/21118w02.htm debate on Zimbabwe]&lt;/ref&gt;
      
Bredenkamp became something of a power behind the scenes in the ruling ZANU-PF party. It is claimed that he sought to facilitate the early retirement of [[Robert Mugabe|President Mugabe]] in 2004 and his replacement by [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], former Security Minister and Speaker of Parliament. This displeased rival factions in ZANU-PF, and government investigations were started into the affairs of Bredenkamp's Breco trading company concerning tax evasion and exchange control violations. The matters under investigation were transactions between Breco in Zimbabwe and offshore companies controlled by Bredenkamp.

Bredenkamp has been linked to claims to facilitate the retirement of Mugabe in 2000, by the Guardian's investigation into the leaked US embassy cables&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/18/tzvangirai-mdc-wikileaks-mugabe-zanu|title=WikiLeaks cables: UN offered Robert Mugabe a lucrative retirement overseas|last=Doward|first=Jamie|date=2010-12-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2006 Bredenkamp was tried in Zimbabwe on charges that he used a South African passport on international journeys. Zimbabwean citizenship law does not permit dual nationality. Although acquitted, he had to fight a second court case to obtain an order to return his Zimbabwe passport which the clerk of the court had retained. He was ordered to produce documentary evidence of his renunciation of South African citizenship to have his nationality restored permanently.&lt;ref&gt;The Herald, September 2006 :[http://allafrica.com/stories/200609240048.html court returns Bredenkamp’s passport]&lt;/ref&gt; But his passport was returned.

In April 2016, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Bredenkamp has an "estimated £700m fortune from tobacco trading, grey-market arms dealing, sports marketing and diamond mining."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/06/mugabe-zimbabwe-john-bredenkamp-billy-rautenbach-offshore-sanctions-panama-papers|title=Alleged Mugabe cronies kept offshore firms years after UN alert raised|last=Garside|first=Juliette|last2=Pegg|first2=David|date=2016-04-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25|last3=Watt|first3=Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bredenkamp is the subject of US sanctions aimed at people of significant influence within the Zimbabwean government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=2088|title=Sanctions List Search|website=sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Family ===
Fredriksen was born on 10 May 1944 to a welder and his wife, and grew up in Etterstad in the eastern half of [[Oslo]].

Fredriksen is a widower and has two twin daughters: Cecilie and [[Kathrine Fredriksen|Kathrine Astrup Fredriksen]] (both born 1983). Fredriksen's former wife, dentist Inger Astrup Fredriksen (died 2006), originally belonged to one of the Astrup families in Norway. Her father was a professor of psychiatry, and her grand uncle was the painter [[Nikolai Astrup]].

=== Business ===
Fredriksen made his fortune during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in the 1980s, when his tankers picked up oil at great risk and huge profits. As described by his biographer, "he was the lifeline to the [[Ayatollah]]." Fredriksen would later become the world's largest tanker owner, with more than seventy oil tankers and major interests in oil rigs and fish farming. His fleet is dominated by costly double-hulled, environmentally safer tankers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2012/03/21/how-shipping-king-john-fredriksen-found-a-port-in-the-storm/|title=How Shipping King John Fredriksen Found A Port In The Storm|first=Christopher|last=Helman|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Seadrill bought more than 50 percent of [[Smedvig]], gaining control of the company (51.24 percent of the votes and 52.27 percent of the capital). Smedvig is Fredriksen's biggest ever deal. Noble Corp sold its stake to Seadrill in 2009, leaving Seadrill with full control.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Berglund [http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1266407.ece Smedvig now fully under Fredriksen's control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629155723/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1266407.ece |date=29 June 2011}} ''Aftenposten''; 3 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Fredriksen has been the majority owner of [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga I.F.]] for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Fortune ===
The ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]'' has ranked Fredriksen's wealth as £475m (2003), £1.050b (2004) and £1.887b (2005). In 2012, Fredriksen and his family were listed as the 9th richest in Britain with a combined wealth of £6.6bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sunday Times Rich List shows UK's wealthiest defy recession|author=|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17883101|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]|date=28 April 2012|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredriksen owns houses in London, Oslo, Cyprus, and [[Marbella]], Spain. His house [[56 Old Church Street|The Old Rectory]] in London has been estimated to be worth around US$172 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/shipping-magnate-john-fredriksen-sticks-to-his-gut-feeling-invest/2012/09/21/0432903c-00dc-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_story.html|title=Shipping magnate John Fredriksen sticks to his ‘gut feeling’: Invest|first1=Edward|last1=Robinson|first2=Michelle Wiese|last2=Bockmann|date=22 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a collector of classic Norwegian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bornrich.com/john-fredriksen.html|title=John Fredriksen - Bornrich|date=29 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philanthropy ===
Fredriksen supports research projects at [[Norwegian Radium Hospital|Radium Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ous-research.no/dgo/|title=Dept. of Gyn. Oncology - Cancer Medicine - Divisions - Oslo University Hospital Research|website=ous-research.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has donated several hundreds of millions of Norwegian kroner to medical research at hospitals in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradewindsnews.com/weekly/337168/messenger-boy-who-became-a-shipping-billionaire|title=Messenger boy who became a shipping billionaire|date=9 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Gard'' case ===
In 1985, the Norwegian insurance company [[Assuranceforeningen Gard|Gard]] became suspicious about losses of cargo from Fredriksen's tankers. A private investigation was initiated, and a system for the use of heavy oil as bunker fuel was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;«For Oslo-advokatene ble Gisvolds reise slutten på den hemmelige etterforskningen. Man hadde nok, og dessuten var det nå bare et tidsspørsmål før Fredriksen fikk kjennskap til granskningen. Følgelig torde man ikke holde på lenger. Juristene anbefalte Gard å gå til politiet med sine mistanker.», fra Storeulv, side 106&lt;/ref&gt; The case was turned over to the Norwegian police and in June 1986 Fredriksen's offices in Oslo were searched and several of his nearest associates, and after a while also Fredriksen, were placed in detention while the case was investigated.&lt;ref&gt;«Samme morgen ble de seks arresterte fremstilt for Oslo forhørsrett. Siktelsen var grove oljetyverier og forsikringssvindel for cirka en million kroner.», fra Storeulv, side 125&lt;/ref&gt;

After several years of arguments between the various lawyers, the case was settled out of court. Fredriksen had to pay a fine of 2 million NOK&lt;ref&gt;«John Fredriksen måtte i 1990 godta en bot på to millioner kroner for å ha satt mannskapenes liv i fare ved å bruke olje fra lasten som drivstoff.», fra Storeulv, side 168&lt;/ref&gt; for risking his crew's lives, and in addition had to pay the insurance company Gard an amount of over {{US$}}800,000.&lt;ref&gt;«Fredriksen aksepterte å betale Gard 800,000-dollar, pluss halvparten av den Marine Management-konto de hadde tatt beslag i.», fra Storeulv, side 160&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KonZappas.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Portrait of Konstantinos Zappas.]]
'''Konstantinos Zappas''' ({{lang-el| Κωνσταντίνος Ζάππας}}; 1814–1892) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] entrepreneur and national benefactor. Together with his cousin [[Evangelos Zappas]], he played an essential role in the revival of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rühl|2004|pp=3–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappas was born into an [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Jovanovski|first1=Dalibor|last2=Minov|first2=Nikola|year=2017|title=Ioannis Kolettis.

After the death of Evangelis Zappas he became the executor of his cousin’s legacy and the ongoing revival of the Olympic Games. He was appointed manager of the Olympic Committee that organised the so-called [[Zappas Olympics]], a Greek athletic festival held in 1859, 1870 and 1875 and forerunner of the modern international Olympics. 

In 1881, after the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|annexation]] of [[Thessaly]] to Greece, he bought extended estates there and the following years contributed to the building of the [[Zappeion]] building in [[Athens]], which was officially opened on 28 October 1888. Moreover, a number of Greek schools and educational facilities were built with his personal financial support including the female schools in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruches|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in his hometown Labovë, as well as in a number of towns in [[Epirus]] (Tepelene, Delvine) and Thessaly. Many students benefited from his scholarship for post-graduate studies in Western Europe (mostly in the scientific field of agriculture).

He died in 1892 in [[Mantes-la-Jolie]], France. On his death the Romanian government seized all of his assets and capital that were still in Romania causing a noted international law case at that time and his cousin Evangelis Zappas was often incorrectly cited as his brother. There was also land and money in Greece that Konstantinos left to the Greek government. [[Baron Pierre de Coubertin]] together with A. Mercatis, a close friend of Konstantinos, encouraged the Greek government to put in some of that legacy to fund the [[1896 Athens Olympic Games]] in addition to the legacy of Evangelis Zappas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1996|p=117}}; {{harvnb|Martens|1893}}; {{harvnb|Streit|1894}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statues of Konstantinos and his cousin Evangelis Zappas are situated in front of the Zappeion.

==Entrepreneurial career==
In the late 1980s Lynch formed Lynett Systems Ltd, producing designs and audio products for the music recording industry including the first ever sampler for the Atari ST, the Lynex, which was followed by the ADAS sampler for Atari, Mac &amp; PC. This led to the offshoot D2D Systems which produced a software-only hard disk recording system for the Atari Falcon.

In 1991 he set up ''Cambridge Neurodynamics'', which specialized in computer-based finger print recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/seminars/1995/95-11-14.html Security Group Seminar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202211844/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/seminars/1995/95-11-14.html |date=2 December 2012 }} University of Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Lynch co-founded [[Autonomy Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060628201313/http://www.vnunet.com/networkitweek/features/2058993/kindness-strangers The Kindness of Strangers] VNU Net&lt;/ref&gt; and he served Autonomy as CEO.

In October 2011 Autonomy was sold to Hewlett-Packard for $11 billion.&lt;ref name="Profile: Mike Lynch"/&gt;

==Disputes==
Larry Ellison, the CEO of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]],  when dealing with Lynch and his colleagues said : "either Mr Lynch has a very poor memory or he is lying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/09/larry-ellison-of-oracle-calls-autonomy-ceo-lying-liar/|title=Larry Ellison Of Oracle Calls Autonomy CEO Lying Liar|publisher=Gizmodo|date=30 September 2011| accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Lynch was proved right when [[Frank Quattrone]], Autonomy's advisor, confirmed the presentation at the center of the controversy had been his and not given by Lynch as Oracle had asserted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/30/quattrone_says_autonomy_is_right|title=Quattrone blasts Ellison, says Autonomy is right|publisher=The Register|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Hewlett-Packard#Takeover of Autonomy}}
On 20 November 2012, Hewlett-Packard announced a writedown of assets following the Autonomy purchase due to "disclosure failures and outright misrepresentations at Autonomy", which occurred before the acquisition.&lt;ref name= "Open letter from Mike Lynch to the shareholders of Hewlett-Packard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/open-letter-mike-lynch-shareholders-hewlett-packard|title=Open letter from Mike Lynch to the shareholders of Hewlett-Packard|work=Open Letter|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total writedown amounted to $8.8bn of the purchase cost of more than $10bn.

An FT investigation unearthed documents that show that HP was in fact aware of Autonomy's hardware sales. They were booked as hardware and were fully disclosed to Deloitte, the Autonomy auditors.&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4b0e6140-97d3-11e3-8dc3-00144feab7de.html#slide0/|title=HP/Autonomy investigation: Tangled web of hardware and resellers|work=Financial Times|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch wrote an open letter to HP's shareholders, accusing HP of misleading them over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autonomyaccounts.org/open-letter-from-mike-lynch-to-the-shareholders-of-hewlett-packard-2/|title=Open letter from Mike Lynch to the shareholders of Hewlett-Packard|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deloitte have also gone on the record supporting Lynch's opinion.&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt; Lynch and other ex-Autonomy executives have set up AutonomyAccounts.org to provide a platform to voice their rebuttal of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://autonomyaccounts.org/ | title=AutonomyAccounts.org|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, HP did a deal with law firms suing them on behalf of shareholders over the matter. HP would pay them and they would help HP sue Lynch and the former Autonomy CFO for [[fraud]]. HP's deal was objected to by a number of parties and was considered highly suspect as the lawyers were to be paid but not the shareholders. Judge Breyer threw the case out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/03/dealpolitik-more-evidence-of-broken-shareholder-litigation-system|title=Dealpolitik: More Evidence of Broken Shareholder Litigation System|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HP's claims were investigated at HP's request by the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|UK Serious Fraud Office]], however the SFO announced in January 2015 that it was ending its investigation with no action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30883288|title=Autonomy HP sale investigation by Serious Fraud Office closes|date=19 January 2015|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Montgomery Street from Telegraph Hill, San Francisco.jpg|thumb|225px|Looking south down Montgomery Street from Telegraph Hill through the Financial District]]

'''Montgomery Street''' is a north-south thoroughfare in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in the United States.

It runs about 16 blocks from the [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]] neighborhood south through downtown, terminating at [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]]. South of [[Columbus Avenue (San Francisco)|Columbus Avenue]], Montgomery Street runs through the heart of San Francisco's [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]] and contains one of the highest concentrations of financial activity, investment business, and venture capital in the [[United States]] and the world. For this reason, it is known as "the [[Wall Street of the West]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streetcar.org/f-line.html|title=F-Market &amp; Wharves Streetcar Line – Market Street Railway|accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prentice|first=Carol S.|title=1906 San Francisco earthquake centennial field guides|year=2006|publisher=Geological Society of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CwchZE54dWYC&amp;pg=PA17 |accessdate=July 31, 2010|page=17|chapter=Walk 3:Montgomery Street to Jackson Square}}&lt;/ref&gt;  South of Market Street, the street continues as [[New Montgomery Street]] for two more blocks to terminate at Howard Street in the [[South of Market, San Francisco, California|SOMA]] district.

==History==
[[Image:Montgomerystreetsf.jpg|thumb|225px|Looking north from Market Street up Montgomery Street towards the [[Transamerica Pyramid]]. In the foreground is the flagship branch of [[Wells Fargo Bank]].]]

In the 1830s, the land which is now Montgomery Street lay at the edge of [[San Francisco Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/early.html|title=San Francisco – Before the Gold Rush – 1847|accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OHP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=21482|title=Office of Historic Preservation: San Francisco|accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intense [[land speculation]] during the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] created a demand for more usable land in the rapidly growing city, and sandy bluffs near the waterfront were leveled and the shallows filled with sand (and the ruins of many ships) to make new building lots. Between 1849 and 1852, the waterfront advanced about four blocks.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:1853 U.S.C.S. Map of San Francisco, California ^ Vicinity - Geographicus - SanFrancisco3-uscs-1853.jpg|City of San Francisco and its Vicinity California (Map, 1853)]]&lt;/ref&gt; At present, Montgomery Street is about seven blocks from the water.

The corner of Montgomery and Clay is where [[John B. Montgomery]] landed when he came to hoist the [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] after the [[Bear Flag Revolt]] of 1846. In 1853 the [[Montgomery Block]], a center of early San Francisco law and literature, was built at 600 Montgomery, on land currently occupied by the [[Transamerica Pyramid]].&lt;ref name=OHP /&gt;

'''''Mugsy''''' is a strategy and management [[computer game]] for the 48K [[ZX Spectrum]].  It was well-received, mainly due to its innovative graphic style, and was followed two years later by a sequel.

== Gameplay ==

The player takes the role of "Mugsy", an American [[gangster]].  The aim of the game is for Mugsy to become "the most powerful gang leader in the city".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/m/Mugsy.txt|accessdate=26 June 2015|publisher=World of Spectrum|title=Instructions}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In each 'turn' of the game, which represents one year, decisions must be made about how much money should be spent on weapons and ammunition to fight other gangs, how many business from which he should attempt to extract [[protection money]], and how much bribery of local law enforcement should take place.

The game was marketed as a "interactive video comic strip";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-adverts/m/Mugsy.jpg|accessdate=26 June 2015|publisher=Melbourne House|title=Mugsy Advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was highly visual, with graphics (produced using the software house's own title, [[Melbourne Draw]])&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; intended to be similar to [[comic book]] drawings. Information was presented to the player in the form of dialogue between on-screen characters, such as Mugsy himself, and an unnamed assistant.  At each decision point, the player enters text into a 'speech bubble' dialogue box.

There was no real plot or narrative arc within the game as a whole; each year's activities were essentially the same, with the same decisions being required to be made by the player.  However, there was a small [[Action game|arcade]] element, which was triggered in the event that one of Mugsy's rivals orders a [[contract killing]] on him. When this happened, the player controls Mugsy directly, and must shoot the assassins who are sent after him before he being shot too many times himself.

==Release==

The title was heavily publicised in the year of its release, with at least 26 advertisements in the trade press, many of them 2-page spreads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006715|title=Mugsy - World of Spectrum|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The release of the game was preceded by a promotional campaign including actors dressed as gangsters visiting the offices of some computing magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/06/news.htm|title=CRASH 6 - News|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally released in 1984 in the UK, by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]].  It was later re-released in Spain by Iveson Software SA.  It was priced at £6.95 in the UK, and 1900 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] for the Spanish re-released version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006715|title=Mugsy - World of Spectrum|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, it was included in a compilation of titles called 'Off The Hook', aimed at raising money to combat drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/tzers0586.htm|title=T'zers|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2015|author=Maughan, Teresa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

Reviews of the Spectrum edition were very positive; ''[[Your Sinclair]]'''s "Joystick Jury" rated it a "hit", citing its impressive graphics, and a structure that, while logical, provided a high level of replayability, as each game ended differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr08/yr08_59.htm|title=Your Spectrum 08 - Joystick Jury|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also the winner of a ''[[Crash (magazine)|
Crash]]'' Reader's Award for "Best Strategy and Simulation".  The magazine commented positively on the graphics, partly because the visual style was "suited to a game set in the roaring twenties";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/12/awards.htm|title=CRASH 12 - Readers' Awards|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was despite "Mugsy" having to take place before 1919, since that is when its sequel, ''[[Mugsy's Revenge]]'', begins.

==Legacy==
A sequel, ''[[Mugsy's Revenge]]'' was published two years later, and ported to the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]].  Russel Comte, a leading member of the design team, went on to work as an artist on a number of other significant computer game titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,808/|title=Russel Comte Video Game Credits and Biography - MobyGames|work=MobyGames|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas F. Oppenheimer''' (born 8 June 1945) is a South African [[billionaire]] businessman and philanthropist.

==Early life==
Nicholas is the son of Bridget (née McCall) and [[Harry Oppenheimer]], and grandson of [[Ernest Oppenheimer]], founder of [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]] and the first generation of the family to chair (from 1929) the [[De Beers]] diamond mining company in South Africa, established by [[Cecil John Rhodes]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debeersgroup.com/en/our-story/our-history.html De Beers: "Our History"] 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His father was of German Jewish descent. Oppenheimer was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] and took the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Oxford MA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debswana.com/About%20Debswana/Board%20of%20Directors/Pages/Nicky%20Oppenheimer.aspx DEbswana: "Nicky Oppenheimer"] 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Oppenheimer joined the [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]] Corporation in 1968, and was appointed a director in 1974. He became deputy chairman in 1983. He subsequently resigned in 2001 but remained a non-executive director until 2011.

==Philanthropy==
The Oppenheimer family has directed much of its philanthropic efforts towards preserving the heritage and cultural importance of the Southern African region, as well as to broader community upliftment in the areas of education, health, nature conservation and the arts. Nicky Oppenheimer and his son [[Jonathan Oppenheimer]] established the [[Brenthurst Foundation]] in 2005 as a way to contribute to the debate around strategies and policies for strengthening Africa's economic performance and enabling inclusive and [[sustainable development]]. 
The family has also long been involved in environmental and [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tswalu.com/about-us/the-oppenheimer-story|title=The Oppenheimer Story {{!}} Tswalu Kalahari|website=www.tswalu.com|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oppenheimer family partnered with [[De Beers]] to establish the Diamond Route in 2006 to maximise the potential of their properties for conservation, research and environmental awareness purposes. The Diamond Route links 8 sites across northern South Africa, stretching from [[Namaqualand]] on the west coast, to [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], north to Tswalu in the [[Kalahari]], and to the Brenthurst Gardens in [[Johannesburg]], eastwards to Ezemvelo Nature Reserve and northwards to the [[Venetia Limpopo Nature Reserve]] in Limpopo Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diamondroute.com/our-story.htm|title=The Diamond Route Story|last=Mostert|first=© Duncan MacFadyen, © Warwick|website=www.diamondroute.com|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015 Oppenheimer is also a [[Rhodes House|Rhodes Trustee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/about/trustees/|title=Current Trustees|website=Rhodes House|language=en|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Roderick Ian Eddington''' [[Officer of the Order of Australia|AO]] [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering|FTSE]] (born 2 January 1950 in [[Perth, Western Australia]]) is an Australian businessman. He is currently chair of the government body [[Infrastructure Australia]], a director of [[News Corporation]], continuing his long association with that company, and has served in other senior positions including as CEO of [[British Airways]].

==Education and career==
Coming from a country area where there were no high schools, Eddington went to Perth in 1963 to attend [[Christ Church Grammar School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Peter|authorlink=Peter Newman (environmental scientist)|title=Sir Rod Eddington: ‘The infrastructure challenges are real’|url=http://theconversation.com/sir-rod-eddington-the-infrastructure-challenges-are-real-4563|website=theconversation.com|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=6 February 2015|date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards |first1=Peter |last2=Hillman |first2=Wendy |title=A School With A View: a centenary history of Christ Church Grammar School, Perth 1910-2010 |year=2010|publisher=Christ Church Grammar School |location=Claremont |isbn=9780646543734 |at=Appendix 23: Student Register, pp 379–450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rhodes&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.secretariat.uwa.edu.au/home/rhodes?f=192731 | title = Western Australian Rhodes Scholars | accessdate = 2013-12-19 | format = doc | publisher = University of Western Australia | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110407231628/http://www.secretariat.uwa.edu.au/home/rhodes?f=192731 | archivedate = 7 April 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied engineering at the [[University of Western Australia]] and graduated with first class honours in 1972.

Eddington joined the [[Swire Group]] in 1979, working for its subsidiary [[Cathay Pacific]], before being appointed Managing Director in 1992. Continuing his association with the airline industry; News Limited, subsidiary of [[News Corporation]], appointed Eddington Chairman of [[Ansett Australia]] in January 1997, four years before the airline failed. News Corp had taken  control of the airline with [[TNT Air Cargo|TNT]] in 1979. Eddington was appointed Deputy Chairman of News Limited in September 1998. He was further promoted to the News Corporation board in September 1999. In a timely manoeuvre, News Corporation sold off Ansett; the airline eventually became insolvent in 2001 partly as a result of the overall difficulties in the airline industry following the [[9/11]] terror attacks. Eddington managed to escape blame for the poor financial state of the airline, apparently aided by his board membership of News Corporation, as others were loath to criticise him publicly. The blame for the collapse has tended to be worn by the Air New Zealand management, who bought the airline from News Corporation in 2000 without significant experience in managing large point-to-point short and medium haul domestic networks. Prior to Ansett's placement into Administration by the Air New Zealand Management, Eddington had successfully met most targets to turn Ansett's misfortune around and some critics believe the airline was not technically insolvent after all.

===British Airways CEO===
Eddington replaced former BA CEO [[Bob Ayling]] on 2 May 2000. He removed many aspects of Ayling's corporate relaunch in early 2001: the unpopular  [[British Airways ethnic liveries|ethnic-art tailfins]] were changed back to the traditional Union Jack tailfin. He steered the company in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks on [[New York City]] and [[Washington D.C.]] which proved disastrous for many other airlines.

Following a loss of £200m in 2002, Eddington's ''"Future Size and Shape"'' cost-cutting programme allowed BA to report a profit of £135m in 2003, despite a decrease in turnover. Eddington declared: ''"These are good results in one of the toughest years in living memory"'', and while this can be expected from a CEO trying to reassure investors, it was against a climate of the [[Iraq War]] and [[SARS]].

The decision to permanently retire the British Airways Concorde in 2003 was made by Eddington, and his action remains highly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concorde-spirit-tours.com/concorde.htm|title=THE BETRAYAL OF CONCORDE|website=www.concorde-spirit-tours.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddington stood down as Chief Executive Officer of British Airways on 30 September 2005, after more than five years in the position. He then returned to Australia to take up a position as the head of the Victorian Major Events Association, succeeding [[Steve Vizard]].

Eddington was replaced by Willie Walsh in October 2005 after he had followed a six-month shadow position.

Eddington received a [[knighthood]] in 2005 for services to the [[aviation]] industry.

===Career as a company director===
As of February 2006, Eddington was a non-executive board member of:
*[[JPMorgan]] - Non-Executive Chairman For Australia And New Zealand
*News Corporation - non-executive director of publicly listed Delaware, United States, based company
*[[John Swire &amp; Sons Pty Ltd.]] - non-executive director of Australian proprietary subsidiary of Hong Kong-based privately held company, [[John Swire &amp; Sons (H.K.) Ltd.]]
*[[Rio Tinto Group]] - non-executive director of both publicly listed companies in the group

Eddington also served on the board of [[Allco Finance Group]], where he was one of three non-executive directors to approve Allco's ill-fated acquisition of Rubicon Holdings.

A previously-announced plan for Eddington to become Chairman of ANZ Banking Group of Australia and New Zealand was first delayed from February 2009 to February 2010; then finally scuttled on 9 August 2009.  It is possible that his Directorship of scandal-plagued Rio Tinto Group made such a position for him at ANZ untenable, as corporate espionage by Rio Tinto against the Chinese Government is at issue.

In 2012 he was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] (AO) "for distinguished service to business and commerce through roles with a range of national and international economic, trade, infrastructure development and transport organisations",&lt;ref name=AO&gt;[https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1145055&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true EDDINGTON, Roderick Ian - Officer of the Order of Australia (AO)], 26 January 2012, It's an Honour&lt;/ref&gt; and was also elected a [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering]].

==Government reports==

===Transport Study in Britain===
{{main|Eddington Transport Study}}
On 1 December 2006, Eddington published a UK government-sponsored [[Eddington Transport Study|report into the future of Britain's transport infrastructure]].  The Eddington Transport Study set out the case for action to improve road and rail networks, as a "crucial enabler of sustained productivity and competitiveness".  The report's main conclusions were that Britain has transport networks that provide the right connections, in the right places, to support the journeys that matter to economic performance.  But roads in particular were in serious danger of becoming so congested, the economy would suffer.

At the launch of the report Eddington told journalists and transport industry representatives introducing [[road pricing]] to encourage drivers to drive less was an "economic no-brainer".  There was, he said "no attractive alternative".  It would cut congestion by half by 2025, and bring benefits to the British economy totalling £28b.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also called for a programme of improvements to existing road and rail networks, the expansion of key airports, and adoption of the general principle that travellers should pay for the external costs of the pollution and congestion their journeys cause.

===Transport Study in Victoria, Australia===
{{main|Eddington Transport Report, Victoria}}
Eddington has since delivered a report to the Victorian Government of Australia, the East West Link Needs Assessment report, which was met with mixed reactions. Economic commentators criticized the cost-benefit ratios of Eddington's proposals, which on Eddington's own analysis were marginal at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.theage.com.au/business/eddington-report-raises-questions-20080403-23ja.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | first=Malcolm | last=Maiden | title=Eddington report raises questions | date=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4308">Under the [[law of the United Kingdom]], [[whales]] and [[sturgeon]]s are '''royal fish''', and when taken become the [[personal property]] of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch of the United Kingdom]] as part of his or her [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]].

==In England and Wales==
According to [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', the "superior excellence" of whale and sturgeon made them uniquely suited for the monarch's use.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', book I, ch. 8 "Of the King's Revenue", ss. X, p. *280&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]] added [[porpoise]] as one of the royal fish.&lt;ref&gt;Hale ''De Jure Maris'' c.7&lt;/ref&gt; Near the English coast they belong to the monarch immediately upon being caught, while ownership is also transferred to the monarch when a catch from any location is cast up on the shores.  The kings of [[Denmark]] and the [[duke of Normandy|dukes of Normandy]] enjoyed a similar prerogative.

The monarch's right to royal fish was recognized by a statute enacted during the reign of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]].&lt;ref&gt;17 Edw. II c. 11, ''De prærogativa regis''.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Henry de Bracton]], ''de balena vero sufficit ... si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam'': "the king owns the head of the whale, the queen owns the tail".&lt;ref&gt;Bracton, ''[http://140.247.226.46/bracton/Unframed/Latin/v2/340.htm De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliæ]'', book 3. c. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', [[Herman Melville]] quoted the speculations of jurist [[William Prynne]], that the queen received the tail, in order to be supplied with whalebone for her [[corset]]s and stays&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Melville]], ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', ch. [[s:Moby-Dick/Chapter 90|XC]].&lt;/ref&gt; (although as Melville points out, "whalebone" is in fact [[baleen]], from the ''mouths'' of [[Baleen whales|certain whales]]).  

Under current law, the [[Receiver of Wreck]] is the official appointed to take possession of royal fish when they arrive on [[England|English]] shores. The law of royal fish continues to excite some notice and occasional controversy, as evidenced when a fisherman caught and sold a sturgeon in [[Swansea Bay]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3773171.stm Police inquiry over sturgeon sale], June 3, 2004, accessed Oct. 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

KC Caviar, established in [[Yorkshire]] in 2012, has permission granted by the Queen allowing the company to farm the royal sturgeon fish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/26/yorkshire-fish-first-ethical-sturgeon-kc-caviar  Frances Perraudin, "Yorkshire fish-lovers set up first ethical sturgeon caviar firm", ''The Guardian'', 26 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Scotland==
In [[Scotland]], the monarch's property right inheres in those whales too large to be pulled to land by a "wain pulled by six oxen"; in practice, this is interpreted as requiring the whales to be over 25 feet long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1221/0052925.pdf ''Royal Fish: Guidance in Dealing with Stranded Royal Fish]&lt;/ref&gt; Authority to collect them on behalf of the monarch is given to the [[Scottish Government Marine Directorate]].

==In Ireland==
In Ireland the  [[English Crown]],   which held  the [[Lordship of Ireland]], also claimed the prerogative of taking royal fish,  which extended to porpoises and [[dolphin]]s. There is  a record of a dispute between the Crown and [[Christopher St Lawrence, 2nd Baron Howth]]  in about 1440 over the  ownership of an exceptionally large  [[grampus (genus)|grampus]] ([[Risso's Dolphin]]) which had been  stranded on Howth peninsula in [[Dublin Bay]].  The Crown claimed  it as a royal fish, while  Lord Howth claimed it  on foot of the immemorial right of his family to  take possession of every grampus and [[porpoise]] found on the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, F. Elrington ''History of Dublin'' Vol.5 1917:Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Cuban]] made an offer and invested $150,000 for a 30% stake in Aarstol’s company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url= https://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/episode-guide/season-3/09-episode-309|website=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|title=Shark Tank Season 3, Episode 9|date=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, [[Harvard Business School]] professor Thales S.

'''Tabitha Mukami Muigai Karanja''' is a [[Kenya]]n [[businesswoman]], [[entrepreneur]] and [[industrialist]]. She is the founder and current [[Chief Executive Officer]] of '''Keroche Breweries''', the first large brewery in Kenya owned by a non multinational company. Keroche accounts for 20% of Kenya's beer consumption, as of October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ventures-africa.com/2012/10/meet-pioneer-female-brewer-tabitha-karanja/|title=Meet Kenya’s Pioneer Female Brewer, Tabitha Karanja|date=27 October 2012|accessdate=18 October 2014|
first=.|last=Ventures Africa|publisher=Ventures Africa Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Tabitha was born near [[Kijabe]], in central Kenya. After attending Kenyan schools, she took up employment in the Ministry of Tourism as an Accounting Clerk. She met and married her husband, who owned a successful hardware store in Naivasha town. In 1997, the couple closed the hardware store and went into the wine-making business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tabitha Karanja, The CEO of Keroche Breweries: Resilient At 50|date=29 August 2014|accessdate=18 October 2014|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/article/2000133131/tabitha-karanja-the-ceo-of-keroche-breweries-resilient-at-50| first=Peter|last=Muiruri|newspaper=[[The Standard (Kenya)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Beginning in 1997, Tabitha Karanja and her husband, started making fortified wine, targerting the lower end of the market. In 2007, when the government enacted heavy taxes on locally made wines, her product was priced out of the market. She switched to manufacturing ready-to-drink gin and vodka, which her state-of-the-art factory still makes today. In 2008, she added beer to her repertoire of alcoholic drinks, beginning with a brand called "Summit". In 2013, the factory began expansion plans to increase beer production from 60,000 bottles per day to 600,000 bottles per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

first=Macharia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other responsibilities==
Tabitha is married to Joseph Karanja and together, they are the parents of four children; James Karanja, Anerlisa Muigai, Edward Muigai and Tecra Muigai. Joseph Muigai Karanja serves as the [[Chairman]] of Keroche Breweries Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kenyancampos.blogspot.com/2013/04/keroche-breweries-tabitha-karanjas-bold.html|title=Keroche Breweries Tabitha Karanja’s Bold Journey To The Top|date=|accessdate=18 October 2014|

== Newspaper Articles ==

In a newspaper article of the Star Daily, Mrs Karanja penned the following opinion under the headline 
"Local Companies All Equal Under The Law" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/02/08/local-companies-all-equal-under-the-law_c1290531?page=0%2C2&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been six months since the President declared the crack down on illicit brews, which we all supported and applauded.

Nonetheless, we all have different memories of this period. While the exercise initially attracted public goodwill, the ensuing confusion resulted in the destruction of legitimate businesses, property and loss of trust in government agencies to govern with a measure of regularity and predictability. Many businessmen and women are still counting their losses.

I have my memories too.

My saddest memory is an early morning visit to Keroche Breweries by my local MP accompanied by an unruly mob threatening to break in and “inspect” the plant for unspecified ‘second generation’ brews.

His action came barely three months after Industry Cabinet Secretary Aden Mohammed launched our Sh5 billion, state-of-the-art brewing plant, the first of its kind in Africa. In attendance was the said MP, who lauded Keroche’s feat for elevating his constituency to national and global status.

The MP was there to “inspect” an 18-year-old company that had invested in global brands, won international awards, created thousands of jobs, pays billions of shillings to KRA and been touted as Africa’s new entrepreneurial model.

I knew the agenda had changed and we had lost the war. The confusion was clear evidence that the institutions mandated to regulate the liquor industry had failed.

The Kenya Bureau of Standards stands accused. Kebs mandate is to provide standards, which must be consistent for businesses to thrive. In essence, regulatory institutions worldwide stand for what they have built. Kebs cannot certify and approve then one morning claim that a product that has been in the market for 15 years, that is annually inspected, approved and built by them, is now suspect.
To build a brand to international standards takes huge investment, innovation, time, research, hard work and collaborative partnership with mandated institutions such as Kebs.

Legitimate brewing companies have been pleading for a long time for the government to regulate the alcohol industry because it has been in a mess. The benefits of regulation cannot be over-emphasized. It will enhance provision of quality products, level the playing field for all businesses, create more professional jobs, support innovation and remit more revenue to the government. We must do this to restore order and discipline in the industry and be respected worldwide.

Ultimately the big question we should all be asking, six months down the line, is, did we succeed in this war? Are our families and our youth safer from the merchants of death?
We cannot afford to fail as a nation in the fight against illicit brews. Whenever these campaigns fail, we collectively fail as Kenyans. Each one of us knows the pain so many families and homes have endured. We do not need convincing. We need to act.

The war on illicit brews must be a joint effort between government and legitimate businesses that offer innovative alternatives. It must never be used as a decoy to fight turf wars. We must believe in our ability to create relevant local solutions. To brand Kenyan industries as second-generation is the worst form of self-destruction.

It is a false argument that there is first, second, third and fourth generation alcohol when we all know that nothing of the sort exists. The formula to make quality beer, vodka, whisky, spirit, wine, etc., is the same worldwide, whether produced 500 years ago, today or 500 years from now. Whatever falls outside this established formula is illicit. That is what we should focus on. This is not rocket science.

I appreciate the High Court for rising up to the occasion and stating the correct application of the law. Their judgment is clear: the war on illicit brews must continue to the full extent of the law. However, legitimate companies must be protected and supported. The abdication and dereliction of duty by government agencies and the open bias and discrimination against Kenyan-owned manufacturers will not be tolerated.

The decision reached by the High Court a fortnight ago in our case against Kebs must not be interpreted as a reversal of a presidential decree against illicit brews, but a clear message that government agencies must be consistent in their implementation of the law and that ours is a limited government governed by the rule of law.

Africa is rising.
Adherence to the rule of law and support for local enterprises is the only way to create companies that will reduce unemployment, eradicate poverty, create wealth and compete globally.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The writer is the Chief Executive Officer of Keroche Breweries Limited.

'''''The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization''''' {{Harv|Senge|1990}} is a book by [[Peter Senge]] (a senior lecturer at [[MIT]]) focusing on group problem solving using the [[systems thinking]] method in order to convert companies into [[learning organization]]s. The five disciplines represent approaches (theories and methods) for developing three core learning capabilities: fostering aspiration, developing reflective conversation, and understanding [[complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Gharajedaghi | first=Jamshid | author-link = Jamshid Gharajedaghi| year=1999 | title=Systems Thinking: Managing Chaos and Complexity | publisher=Burlington, MA: Butterworth-Heinemann | ISBN=0-7506-7163-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7N-sFxFntakC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Five Disciplines==
The five disciplines of what the book refers to as a "learning organization" discussed in the book are:

# "Personal mastery is a discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively."&lt;ref name="senge-1990"&gt;
{{Citation| last=Senge | first=Peter M. | year=1990 | title=The Fifth Discipline | publisher=Doubleday/Currency | isbn=0-385-26094-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVZqAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "[[Mental models]] are deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures of images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;
# "Building shared vision - a practice of unearthing shared pictures of the future that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;
# "[[Team learning]] starts with 'dialogue', the capacity of members of a team to suspend assumptions and enter into genuine 'thinking together'."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;
# "[[Systems thinking]] - The Fifth Discipline that integrates the other four."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;

Senge describes extensively the role of what it refers to as "mental models," which he says are integral in order to "focus on the openness needed to unearth shortcomings" in perceptions. The book also focuses on "team learning" with the goal of developing "the skills of groups of people to look for the larger picture beyond individual perspectives." In addition to these principles, the author stresses the importance of "personal mastery" to foster "the personal motivation to continually learn how [...] actions affect [the] world."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;

==The Learning Disabilities==
In addition to "disciplines," which Senge suggests are beneficial to what he describes as a "learning organization," Senge also posits several perceived deleterious habits or mindsets, which he refers to as "learning disabilities."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;

# "I am my position."
# "The enemy is out there."
# The Illusion of Taking Charge
# The Fixation on Events
# The Parable of the [[Boiling frog]]
# The Delusion of Learning from Experience
# The Myth of the Management Team

==The 11 Laws of the Fifth Discipline==
# Today's problems come from yesterday's "solutions."
# The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back.
# Behavior grows better before it grows worse.
# The easy way out usually leads back in.
# The cure can be worse than the disease.
# Faster is slower.
# Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space.
# Small changes can produce big results...but the areas of highest leverage are often the least obvious.
# You can [[have one's cake and eat it too|have your cake and eat it too]] ---but not all at once.
# Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants.
# There is no blame.

==Reception==

The '''Women's Development Bank''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Banco Nacional de la Mujer'' or ''Banmujer''), was established in [[Venezuela]] in 2001 to remedy the political, economic, and social disadvantages faced by women. The Bank offers both financial and non-financial services to women. The latter is revolutionary and distinguishes the Bank from other banks.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The first President was [[Nora Castañeda]].

==Financial services==
The bank provides small, low-interest loans, known as [[micro-credit]] loans, ranging from 500,000 to 1,000,000 [[Venezuelan bolívar|bolívares]] (500 to 1000 bolívares fuertes, [[US dollar|US$]]260 to $520) per woman, for the establishment of business ventures.  Loans are not granted to individuals, but rather to groups of five to ten women.  In this manner, the bank is ideologically aligned with [[Venezuelan President|President]] [[Hugo Chávez]], by promoting community solidarity over individualism, which is associated with capitalism.  The bank has provided over 40,000 such loans since its establishment. These loans have been responsible for the creation of more than 70,000 jobs.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The bank also offers financial advice to women, and serves as a consultant in the formation and development of business projects.
 
==Non-financial services==

The Women's Development Bank also offers a number of non-financial services.  The bank provides administrative training for aspiring female entrepreneurs, as well as workshops on personal development, self-esteem, family planning and health. The workshops encourage dialogue within the community and stimulate a greater involvement of women in politics. 

The Bank is distinct from other banks in that it does not have branch offices; rather, it consists of a network of supporters who visit 149 impoverished and over-populated areas on a weekly basis, and offer the bank’s services to women who otherwise would not have access to banking services. Bank members also make house calls.

The Bank attempts to promote self-sufficiency, by minimizing the requirements to receive a loans. The bank offers direction to encourage the success of women’s projects, but does not dictate how their businesses should be run. This presents a challenge to many marginalized women who are illiterate. In instances where women are illiterate or otherwise have difficulty in overseeing a business venture, a female family member or friend will oversee the project until the woman becomes literate. The Bank also directs women to [[Mission Robinson]], a literacy campaign launched by [[Chávez's government]].
