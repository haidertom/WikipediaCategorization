An '''adapter''' or '''adaptor''', or a linker in [[genetic engineering]] is a short, chemically synthesized, single-stranded or double-stranded oligonucleotide that can be ligated to the ends of other DNA or RNA molecules. Double stranded adapters can be synthesized to have blunt ends to both terminals or to have sticky end at one end and blunt end at the other. For instance, a [[Double-stranded DNA|double stranded]] [[DNA]] adapter can be used to link the [[DNA end|ends]] of two other DNA molecules (i.e., ends that do not have "sticky ends", that is complementary protruding single strands by themselves). It may be used to add [[sticky ends]] to [[cDNA]] allowing it to be ligated into the [[plasmid]] much more efficiently. Two adapters could base pair to each other to form [[Pyrimidine dimer|dimers]].
A conversion adapter is used to join a DNA insert cut with one [[restriction enzyme]],  say [[EcoR1|EcoRl]], with a vector opened with another enzyme, [[Bam H1|Bam Hl]]. This adapter can be used to convert the cohesive end produced by Bam Hl to one produced by Eco Rl or vice versa.
One of its applications is ligating cDNA into a plasmid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmad|first=G.I.|date=2014|title=Biosurfactant Production By Bacillus subtilis Using Engine Oil As Substrate|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296425848_BIOSURFACTANT_PRODUCTION_BY_BACILLUS_SUBTILIS_USING_ENGINE_OIL_AS_THE_SUBSTRATE?ev=prf_high|publisher=Department of Biosciences, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other vectors instead of using Terminal deoxynucleotide Transferase enzyme to add poly A to the cDNA fragment.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, B.D (2003).

'''Aminoallyl nucleotide''' is a nucleotide with a modified base containing an [[allylamine]]. They are used in post-labeling of [[nucleic acid]]s by [[fluorescence]] detection in [[microarray]]. They are reactive with [[N-Hydroxysuccinimide]] ester group which helps attach a [[Fluorophore|fluorescent dye]] to the primary amino group on the nucleotide. These nucleotides are known as 5-(3-amino[[allyl]])-nucleotides since the aminoallyl group is usually attached to carbon 5 of the [[pyrimidine]] ring of [[uracil]] or [[cytosine]]. The primary [[amine]] group in the aminoallyl moiety is [[aliphatic]] and thus more reactive compared to the amine groups that are directly attached to the rings ([[aromatic]]) of the bases. Common names of aminoallyl [[nucleosides]] are initially abbreviated with aa- or AA- to indicate aminoallyl. The 5-carbon sugar is indicated with or without the lowercase "d" indicating [[deoxyribose]] if included or [[ribose]] if not. Finally the [[nitrogenous base]] and number of [[phosphates]] are indicated (i.e. aa-UTP = aminoallyl uridine [[triphosphate]]).

==History==
[[File:Heatmap using aminoallyl nucleotide.png|thumb|Hierarchically clustered heat map using aa-dUTPs&lt;ref name=microarraypic&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan|first=Daniel J.|author2=Riordan, Daniel P. |author3=Gerber, André P. |author4=Herschlag, Daniel |author5= Brown, Patrick O. |title=Diverse RNA-Binding Proteins Interact with Functionally Related Sets of RNAs, Suggesting an Extensive Regulatory System|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2008|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e255|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060255|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0060255|accessdate=29 April 2014 |pmid=18959479 |pmc=2573929}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The goal of combining fluorescence and nucleic acids has been to provide a non-[[Isotopic labeling|isotopic]] tag that is detectable to study [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. This type of labeling allows scientists to study DNA or RNA in their structure, function, or formation with other nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kricka|first=LJ|author2=Fortina, P|title=Analytical ancestry: "firsts" in fluorescent labeling of nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids.|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=Apr 2009|volume=55|issue=4|pages=670–83|pmid=19233914|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.116152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first base modification for fluorescent labeling occurred in 1971 with a [[4-thiouridine]] and [[4-thiouracil]].&lt;ref name=Thio&gt;{{cite journal|last=Secrist III|first=John A.|author2=Jorge R. Barrio |author3=Nelson J. Leonard |title=Attachment of a fluorescent label to 4-thiouracil and 4-thiouridine|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|date=3 December 1971|volume=45|issue=5|pages=1262–1270|doi=10.1016/0006-291x(71)90154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research along with others, which included various types of direct and non-direct labeling via: [[Structural analog|analogs]], addition via enzymes, or other methods made labeling of nucleotides much safer for scientist to study DNA.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;

As instrumentation and technologies become more advanced in the field of [[DNA microarray]], better reagents and techniques will be needed to further scientific studies. Fluorescent labeling with [[Cyanine#Cy3 and Cy5|Cy3]] was shown to be more insufficient and skew results; the method of aminoallyl nucleotide incorporation was opted instead. Using aminoallyl nucleotides as indirect fluorescent labeling seemed to nullify the sensitivity issues seen in [[Cyanine#Cy3 and Cy5|cyanine-labeling]].&lt;ref name="RNA methodologies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrell|first=Robert|title=RNA Methodologies: A Laboratory Guide for Isolation and Characterization|page=597|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OG2XubAE2BEC&amp;pg=PA597&amp;lpg=PA597&amp;dq=aminoallyl+nucleotides+beginning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X7KfNkMaKj&amp;sig=TfBMiZdE63UrHriKuBJ-r4q0OgU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9CFFU5zbO6amygHcqIFA&amp;ved=0CHYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aminoallyl%20nucleotides%20beginning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==
Aminoallyl [[nucleosides]] can be [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] via [[Heck coupling]] as shown in the image below.&lt;ref name=Synthesis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reddington|first=Mark|author2=Daniel Cunninghan-Bryant|title=Convenient synthesis of (E)-5-aminoallyl-2′-deoxycytidine and some related derivatives|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|date=12 January 2011|volume=52|issue=2|pages=181–183|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403910019490|accessdate=9 April 2014|doi=10.1016/j.tetlet.2010.10.137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image above, on the left is a modified nucleoside with an [[iodine]] (the iodine is added via [[electrophilic halogenation]]) in the fifth carbon in the pyrimidine ring. Its formation can be associated with a reaction with an allylamine and various reagents via heck coupling are able to remove the [[halogen]] group from the base and add the allylamine to become the aminoallyl nucleoside shown on the right.&lt;ref name=Synthesis /&gt; The product on the right is then used to in [[molecular biology]] in RNA synthesis.&lt;ref name="RNA methodologies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dUTP product information" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Modified Nucleotide catalog" /&gt;

Other reactions include using a [[One-pot synthesis|single pot synthesis]] with other [[halogens]].&lt;ref name=floro_one_pot_syn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kore|first=Anilkumar R.|author2=Bo Yang |author3=Balasubramanian Srinivasan |title=Fluorous-assisted synthesis of (E)-5-[3-Aminoallyl]-uridine-5′-triphosphate|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|date=13 November 2013|volume=54|issue=46|pages=6264–6266|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403913015803|accessdate=9 April 2014|doi=10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.09.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
The primary amine on the aminoallyl nucleotide reacts with amino-reactive dyes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeRisi|first=Joseph|title=Amino-allyl Dye Coupling Protocol|url=http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/data/pdfs/amino-allyl-protocol.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a [[cyanine]] and patented dyes&lt;ref name=hiyte&gt;{{cite web|last=AnaSpec, Inc|title=Hiyte Fluor Brochure|url=http://www.anaspec.com/content/pdfs/c_literature168.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142441/http://www.anaspec.com/content/pdfs/c_literature168.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 April 2014|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Life Tech - multi"&gt;{{cite web|last=life technologies|title=Aminoallyl dUTP|url=http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/references/molecular-probes-the-handbook/nucleic-acid-detection-and-genomics-technology/labeling-oligonucleotides-and-nucleic-acids.html|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contain a reactive leaving group, such as a succinimidyl ester ([[N-Hydroxysuccinimide|NHS]]).The amine groups directly attached to the ring of the base are not affected.

[[File:Tagging modified uridine.jpg|Tagging modified uridine]]

==Uses==
Aminoallyl NTPs are used for indirect DNA labeling in [[PCR]], [[nick translation]], [[primer extension]]s and [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] synthesis.&lt;ref name="Trilink biotechnology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biotechnology|first=Trilink|title=DNA labeling|url=http://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cart/scripts/prodList.asp?idCategory=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; These labeled NTPs are helpful because of their application in molecular biology labs where they do not have the capacity to handle radioactive material. For example, 5-(3-Aminoallyl)-Uridine(AA-UTPs) are more effective for high density labeling of DNA than pre-labeling the DNA. After the enzymatic addition of the NTPs, amine reactant fluorescent dyes can be added for detection of the DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="Modified Nucleotide catalog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biotechnology|first=Trilink|title=Modified Nucleotides|url=http://www.trilinkbiotech.com/work/ntps.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When incorporated into DNA or RNA molecules by DNA/RNA [[polymerase]], 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP provide a reactive group for the addition of other chemical groups. Thus aminoallyl modified DNA or RNA can be labeled with any compound which has an amine-reactive group.
aa-NTPs incorporated into DNA/RNA in combination with a secondary dye coupling reagents can probe for an array analysis.&lt;ref name="dUTP product information"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biosystems|first=Applied|title=Modified Nucleotide 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP|url=http://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/sp_8436.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

cDNA relies on aminoallyl labeling for detection purposes. Although direct labeling of dNTP is the quickest and cheapest method of fluorescent labeling, it is disadvantageous as the sequence allows for only one modified nucleotide for use. Another disadvantage of direct labeling is the bulky nucleotides, however this can be overcome by indirect labeling using aminoallyl modified nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibriel|first=Abdullah|title=Options available for labeling nucleic acid samples in DNA micro-array-based detection methods|journal=BRIEFINGS IN FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS|date=17 April 2012|volume=II|issue=4|pages=311–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easy way to check for labeling success is the color;Good labeling will result in visible blue (Cy5) or red (Cy3) color in the final material.&lt;ref name="A laboratory Manual"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michael|title=Molecular Cloning-A Laboratory Manual|url=http://www.molecularcloning.com/index.php?prt=112|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Process of preparing amino allyl-labelled cDNA.jpg|thumb|Process of preparing amino-allyl labeled cDNA]]

Another process which uses aminoallyl labeling is [[NASBA (molecular biology)|NASBA]] ( Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification), a highly sensitive technique for amplifying RNA. In this specific case, the aaUTP modified RNAs were tagged with fluorescent market Cy3. NASBA combined with aminoallyl-UTP labeling is very useful for many different areas of microbial diagnostics including environmental monitoring, bio threat detection, industrial process monitoring and clinical microbiology.&lt;ref name=NASBA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ott|first=Scheler,|author2=Barry Glynn|title=Fluorescent labeling of NASBA amplified tmRNA molecules for microarray applications|journal=BMC Biotechnology|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA microarray is another method which utilizes specifically AA-NTP's making DNA microarray testing quicker and cheaply.&lt;ref name=Microarray&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiang|first=CC|author2=Kozhich, OA|author3=Chen, M|author4=Inman, JM|author5=Phan, QN|author6=Chen, Y|author7= Brownstein, MJ|title=Amine-modified random primers to label probes for DNA microarrays.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=Jul 2002|volume=20|issue=7|pages=738–42|pmid=12089562|doi=10.1038/nb0702-738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-synthesis labeling avoids the problems found in direct enzymatic incorporation of Cy-labeled dNTPs by generating probes with equal labeling effectiveness. With indirect labeling, amine-modified NTPs are incorporated during [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|reverse transcription]], RNA amplification, or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. Amino allyl-NTPs are incorporated with similar efficiency as unmodified NTPs during polymerization.&lt;ref name="cRNA Better"&gt;{{cite journal|last='t Hoen|first=PA|last2=de Kort |first2=F |last3=van Ommen |first3=GJ |last4=den Dunnen |first4=JT|title=Fluorescent labelling of cRNA for microarray applications.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Mar 1, 2003|volume=31|issue=5|pages=e20|pmid=12595569|accessdate=|doi=10.1093/nar/gng020|pmc=149842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaposi-Novak|first=P|author2=Lee, JS|author3= Mikaelyan, A|author4= Patel, V|author5= Thorgeirsson, SS|title=Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of aminoallyl-labeled cDNA targets from linear RNA amplification.|journal=BioTechniques|date=Oct 2004|volume=37|issue=4|pages=580, 582–6, 588|pmid=15517970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns with labeling:
The amine group, in aminoallyl-modified nucleotide, is reactive with dyes such as the cyanine series, or other patented dyes. A problem arises when the dyes react with [[buffering agents]] which are necessary for the proper storage of the nucleotides. However, a carbonate buffer can be used to overcome this problem.&lt;ref name="concerns with labeling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soundy|first=P|first2=C. |last2=Wheeler |first3=H. |last3=Latham |title=Preparing highly fluorescent, evenly labelled probes for microarray hybridization using the amino allyl method with CyScribe Post-Labelling Kit|journal=Life Science News|volume=9|pages=17–19|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BTO'''&lt;ref name="Gremse2011"&gt;Gremse, M., Chang, A., Schomburg, I., Grote, A., Scheer, M., Ebeling, C., Schomburg, D. (2011): „[http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/suppl_1/D507.long The BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO): the first all-integrating ontology of all organisms for enzyme sources]“, ''Nucleic Acids Res.'', 39 (Database issue): D507–D513&lt;/ref&gt; ('''B'''RENDA '''T'''issue '''O'''ntology) represents a comprehensive structured [[encyclopedia]]. It provides terms, classifications, and definitions of [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], anatomical structures, plant parts, [[cell culture]]s, [[cell type]]s, and [[cell culture|cell lines]] of organisms from all taxonomic groups ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungis]], [[protozoa|protozoon]]) as enzyme sources. The information is connected to the functional data in the [[BRENDA]] ("BRaunschweig ENzyme DAtabase“)&lt;ref name="Schomburg20132"&gt;Schomburg, I., Chang, A., Placzek, S., Söhngen, C., Rother. M., Lang, M., Munaretto, C., Ulas, S., Stelzer, M., Grote, A., Scheer, M., Schomburg, D. (2013): „[http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/D1/D764.long BRENDA in 2013: integrated reactions, kinetic data, enzyme function data, improved disease classification: new options and contents in BRENDA]“, ''Nucleic Acids Res.'', 41 (Database issue): D764–D772&lt;/ref&gt; [[enzyme]] information system.

BTO is one of the first tissue-specific [[ontology|ontologies]] in [[life sciences]], not restricted to a specific organism or a specific organism group providing a user-friendly access to the wide range of tissue and cell-type information. Databases, such as ''Ontology Lookup Service'' or ses, such as ''[[MIRIAM Registry]]'' or  of the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI-EMBL]], the ''TissueDistributionDB'', including the ''Tissue Synonym Library'' of the [[German Cancer Research Center]] (DKFZ) in Heidelberg or the ''Bioportal'' plattform of the [[National Center for Biomedical Ontology]] in Stanford, USA rely on BTO and implement the encyclopedia as an essential repository of information into their respective plattform.

BTO enables users from [[medical research]] and [[pharmaceutical sciences]] to search for the occurrence and [[histology|histological]] detection of disease-related enzymes in tissues, which play an important role in [[diagnosis]], therapies, and [[drug development]]. In [[biochemistry]] and [[biotechnology]] the organism-specific tissue terms linked to enzyme functional data are an important resource for the understanding of the metabolism and regulation in life sciences. Ontologies represent classification systems that provide controlled and structured vocabularies.&lt;ref name="Schomburg2014"&gt;Schomburg, I., Chang, A., Schomburg, D. (2014): „[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213020914000032 Standardization in enzymology—Data integration in the world’s enzyme information system BRENDA]“, ''Perspectives in Science'', 1: 15–23&lt;/ref&gt; They are important tools to illustrate and to link evolutionary correlations.

Development of BTO started in 2003, aimed to connect the biochemical and molecular biological enzyme data of BRENDA with a hierarchical and standardized collection of tissue-specific terms. The functional enzyme data and information in BRENDA have been manually annotated and structured by experts from biochemistry, biology, and chemistry. By August 2014, the BTO contained over 5,500 terms, linked to 4,000 synonyms and 4,500 definitions. The terms are classified under generic categories, rules, and formats of the Gene Ontology Consortium (GO,&lt;ref name="Roncaglia2013"&gt;Roncaglia, P., Martone, M.E., Hill, D.P., Berardini, T.Z., Foulger, R.E., Imam, F.T., Drabkin, H., Mungall, C.J., Lomax, J. (2013): „[http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/4/1/20 The Gene Ontology (GO) Cellular Component Ontology: integration with SAO (Subcellular Anatomy Ontology) and other recent developments]“, ''J. Biomed. Semantics'', 4: 20&lt;/ref&gt;), organized as a [[Directed acyclic graph|directed acyclic graph (DAG)]] created using the [[Open-source software|open-source]] OBO-Edit.&lt;ref name="Smith2010"&gt;Smith, B., Ashburner, M., Rosse, C., Bard, J., Bug, W., Ceusters, W., Goldberg, L.J., Eilbeck, K., Ireland, A., Mungall, C.J.; OBI Consortium, Leontis, N., Rocca-Serra, P., Ruttenberg, A., Sansone, S.A., Scheuermann, R.H., Shah, N., Whetzel,P.L,, Lewis, S. (2010): „[http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v25/n11/full/nbt1346.html The OBO Foundry: coordinated evolution of ontologies to support biomedical data integration]“, ''Nat.
Biotechnol.'', 25: 1251–1255&lt;/ref&gt; All terms from each level are directly connected the enzyme data in BRENDA. BTO is a suitable tool to distinguish between different enzymes which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

== Content and Features ==

BTO draws upon the comprehensive enzyme specific data of the BRENDA enzyme information system. Presently (August 2014) 90,500 enzyme-organism-tissue specific data from more than 11,000 proteins are stored in BRENDA. These entries were manually annotated from more thant 135,000 different literature references. All terms in BTO are evaluated and classified according to the OBO-format, and are connected by specific relationships. Each term is a distinct entry within the ontology and is automatically assigned to  a unique BTO-identifier (BTO-ID). The BTO-IDs serve as stable accession numbers in order to create cross-references to further external biochemical databases. Further tissue und cell-type specific terms from external databases (i.e. [[UniProt]]) are integrated into BTO.

The terms are classified in 4 main categories (subgraphs):

* animal
* plant
* fungus
* other sources

Further levels are defined below the main categories (=nodes), classifiying the “parent”, “child”, and “grandchild” all connected via specific relationships (=edges)

* is_a (e.g. skeletal muscle fibre is_a muscle fibre)
* part_of (e.g. muscle fibre part_of muscle)
* develops/derives_from (e.g.myoma cell develops/derives_from muscle fibre)
* related_to (description of more general relationships between terms which are not covered by the other ones)

Most of the terms are clearly associated with specific organisms, organs, tissues, or cell types. However, there are several  identical designations for tissues both in plants and animals, e.g. “epidermis”. To distinguish between those tissue terms and to classify them correctly into BTO for plant tissues the prefix “plant” is placed before the term, e.g. “plant epidermis”.

More than 80% of the tissue terms have definitions that describe the meaning and context. These definitions are obtained from i.e. medical dictionaries and cell line databases ([[Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary|Webster’s Dictionary]], [[Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen|DSMZ]]).

== Availability ==

The entries in BTO are updated bi-annually as part of the major update of BRENDA. It is available via the BRENDA website in the category “Ontology Explorer”. The enzyme source terms can be searched via the BTO query form. As a result, the user receives a list of EC numbers which are directly connected to  the enzyme information of BRENDA. It is also possible to search via the BRENDA “Source Tissue” search form (“Classic View”). The result page displays all enzymes which are isolated or detected in the searched tissue term, directly linked to BTO.

BTO and BRENDA are freely accessible for academic users. It can be freely downloaded via the “Ontology Explorer” of the BRENDA website or in the OBO format from “Obofoundry”. Commercial users require a license distributed by the ''biobase GmbH''.

'''CIMACT''' is EUROCONTROL's&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurocontrol.int/services/civil-military-atm-co-ordination-tool-cimact EUROCONTROL's]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Civil-Military Air Traffic Management Co-ordination Tool'''.

== Definition ==
CIMACT is a [[EUROCONTROL]] software, that is combining and merging civil and military data sources (mainly [[Radar|surveillance]] and [[flight plan]] data) into a correlated Air Situation Display (also known as [[Recognized Air Picture|Recognised Air Picture]] (RAP) to enhance situational awareness and civil-military coordination. The aim is to ensure and increase safety levels, enhance capacity and efficiency. The software is highly flexible, interfaces to a wide variety of data sources and runs on [[Commercial off-the-shelf|commercial-off-the-shelf]] (COTS) hardware.

== History ==
CIMACT was developed on the basis of [[ADMAR|ADMAR 2000 (Abgesetzte Darstellung Maastricht Radar Daten)]], ADMAR, ADKAR and GAME on the basis of a special Agreement of [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|MOD Germany]] ({{lang|de|BMVg}} – A/13/D/HG/82, April 18, 1983) in cooperation with [[Eurocontrol|EUROCONTROL]]. It has been operational since 1983 and was used by the [[German Air Force]] exclusively. In 2002 the system was re-engineered to run on modern hardware and operating systems,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} and eventually named CIMACT. EUROCONTROL has since then offered the software package to its member states. CIMACT's flexibility and versatility have led to increased use by European countries and [[NATO]] for civil-military coordination, [[air traffic control]] and security-related applications.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Operational use ==
CIMACT is developed as a common co-ordination system to exchange information between civil and military users. CIMACT integrates a wide variety of information to provide the user with a comprehensive overview of the air situation. It contains a set of [[air traffic control]] (ATC) functionalities, filters and collaboration facilities to enable silent coordination between connected systems. CIMACT offers an automated [[Interface (computing)|interface]] with the EUROCONTROL Local And sub-Regional Air space management support system (LARA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lara-eu.org/|title=Local And sub-Regional Airspace Management Support System - LARA - LARA Main Page|author=|date=|website=www.LARA-eu.org|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIMACT is used the following operational scenarios:
* Airspace management (FUA concept)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurocontrol.int/articles/flexible-use-airspace (FUA Concept)]&lt;/ref&gt; – to improve situational awareness and enable coordination of civil and military controllers during the activation and use of areas designated for military training activities or operations.
* Aerodrome and [[Air traffic control|approach control]] – Combined with a radar tracker, the system is used at different military airbases for control of local air traffic.
* Tracking, Recording and Analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/luftwaffe/start/serv/flugbetrieb/fliz/!ut/p/z1/hY9fC4IwFMW_kXcz5p9HLZVAVmFY7iWGDlvYJmNJD334JoFv0n04cM-593e5wOAKTPFJ9txKrfjg-oYFtzQqz6Uf-z7ZEoKSU-bTusxwgUKo4fJvhLkYrVSCoOoENI4RrjIKDBUwYJ3wWq2EndUKZaXT3nCrjTdqY4c5eRnjEk920CC|title=Tracking, Recording and Analysis|author=|date=|website=Luftwaffe.de|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – to monitor and assess air traffic to follow up reports, investigate incidents and potential violations.
* ATM Security&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/articles/atm-security|title=ATM Security - Eurocontrol|author=|date=|website=www.Eurocontrol.int|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – to coordinate efficiently between civil and military units during ATM Security incidents, for more information, see the video on the EUROCONTROL CIMACT Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/services/civil-military-atm-co-ordination-tool-cimact|title=Civil-Military ATM Co-ordination Tool (CIMACT) - Eurocontrol|author=|date=|website=www.Eurocontrol.int|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Communication Association''' ('''CCA'''; or '''Association canadienne de communication''' '''ACC''' in French) is a national, bilingual association of communications researchers, educators, and private and public sector professionals in Canada. Established in 1979, the CCA/ACC "seeks to advance communication research and studies in the belief that a better understanding of communication is crucial to building a vibrant society."&lt;ref name=Annual&gt;{{cite web|title=CCA Annual Meeting|url=http://www.acc-cca.ca/annualmeeting|website=CCA|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ali|first1=Christopher|title=The Canadian Communication Tradition|journal=inMedia: The French Journal of Media Studies|date=2013|volume=4|url=https://inmedia.revues.org/696#tocfrom1n2|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1970s===
The creation of the CCA has been considered to be due in part to research that emerged out of the ''Ontario Royal Commission on Violence in the Communications Industry'' ([[Judy LaMarsh|LaMarsh Commission]]) of 1976. This commission drew together a number of scholars who later met at a conference in the University of Windsor in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Canadian Studies|title=The Ontario Royal Commission on Violence in the Communications Industry: Twenty years later|author-last=Tate|author-first=Eugene|year=1998|volume = 1| issue = 13 | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1979 in Philadelphia where the presentations tended to focus on research that came out of the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Canadian Journal of Communication | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | year = 2000 | author-last = Tate | author-first = Eugene | title = The Beginnings of Communication Studies in Canada: Concluding Comments: Canadian Journal of Communication and the LaMarsh Commission | url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/1144/1063}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this same year, the CCA was established on June 1, 1979 during the ''Learned Societies Conference'' (now the [[Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences|Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences]]) in Saskatoon, Canada.&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=Eugene|date=1979|title=Canadian Communication Association Founded: Reflections on the Saskatoon Meeting|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/221|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.22230/cjc.1979v6n1a221|issn=1499-6642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Homer|first=Joan|date=1980|title=The Spectrum of Communication: Can it survive the politics of association?|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/236/142|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-existing [[Canadian Journal of Communication]] was voted to be the official journal of the association.&lt;ref name=Tate/&gt; However, discussions over this arrangement led to the absence of any legally binding relationship between the two. The journal exists independently of the association and is owned by its subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Gilbert | editor-first1 = John | editor-last2 = Lorimer | editor-first2 = Rowland |editor-last3 = Patrick | editor-first3 = Ruth J | title = Scholarly communication in the next millennium: Selected papers from Canada's Policy Conference | publisher = Canadian Journal of Communication Corporation | location = Vancouver | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780969898320 | page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Part of the activities of the CCA in its early years was to address the combination of unique Canadian perspectives and the burgeoning theories on the nature and definition of communication. Advancing the debate, especially at early CCA meetings and conferences were "pioneers of Canadian communication studies"&lt;ref name=Fouts&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fouts|first=Gregory|date=2000|title=The Beginnings of Communication Studies in Canada: The Canadian Communication Association and the Canadian Journal of Communication: Some Reminiscences and Trends|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/1142|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|issn=1499-6642}}&lt;/ref&gt; including: Earle Beattie, William Gilsdorf, Garth Jowett, Annie Mear, William Melody, Walter Romanow, Paul Rutherford, Liora Salter, Eugene Tate, [[James R. Taylor]], Gaëtan Tremblay,&lt;ref name=Fouts/&gt; Gertrude Robinson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Babe | first = Robert | title = Canadian communication thought : ten foundational writers | publisher = University of Toronto Press | location = Toronto Ont | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780802079497|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Indeed, "[t]he politics of the Canadian Communication Association was grounded in the search for an answer to the very definition of communication."&lt;ref name=Fouts/&gt; The creation of the CCA and has been described as a part of the larger trend to establish the interdisciplinary field of [[communication]] as part of emergent scholarly, professional, and corporate activities in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Graff | first = Harvey | title = Undisciplining knowledge : interdisciplinarity in the twentieth century | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781421417455|page=84;248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Toby | title = Global Media Studies | publisher = Wiley | location = Chicester | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745693064 |page=Table 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Croucher | first = Stephen | title = Understanding communication theory : a beginner's guide | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781317751373|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, news and discussion about the association was communicated by an [[electronic mailing list]] called CCANet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher=Association of Research Libraries, Office of Scientific and Academic Publishing | title=Directory of Electronic Journals, Newsletters, and Academic Discussion Lists| year=1991|volume=1-2|ISSN=1057-1337|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=KmrgAAAAMAAJ|LCCN=92649836|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later half of the 1990s, the 
Association for the Study of Canadian Radio and Television (ASCRT) / Association des études sur la radio-télévision canadienne (AERTC) ended its term as an association and merged with the CCA due to a lack of interest from young scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Bredin | editor-first1 = Marian | editor-last2 = Henderson | editor-first2 = Scott| editor-last3 = Matheson | editor-first3 = Sarah A. |author-first = Mary J. | author-last=Miller | chapter = From Kine to Hi-Def: A personal view of Television Studies in Canada | title = Canadian television : text and context | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | location = Waterloo, Ontario, Canada | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781554583898 | page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Credit Abuse Resistance Education''' (CARE) is a national program founded by the [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]], [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York|WDNY]] and the Bankruptcy Committee of the Monroe County Bar Association.  It was founded in 2002&lt;ref name="uscourts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Abuse Resistance Education|url=http://www.nyeb.uscourts.gov/credit-abuse-resistance-education|website=United States Bankruptcy Court: Eastern District of New York|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Chief Judge John C. Ninfo, II (retired).{{cn|date=April 2015}}

CARE is a free financial literacy initiative that makes experienced members of the Bankruptcy Community available to teach the importance of financial education. These presentations are available to educational establishments. CARE's primary target is high school seniors and college freshmen who are most at risk because they are aggressively marketed by the credit card industry at a time when they carry a very low Financial I.Q.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

CARE has a presence in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9832">The '''Dark Ages Radio Explorer''' ('''DARE''') mission is a proposed concept [[robotic spacecraft|lunar orbiter]] intended to identify [[redshift]]ed emanations from primeval [[hydrogen atom]]s just as the first stars began to emit light. DARE will use the precisely [[redshift]]ed 21-cm transition line from [[neutral hydrogen]] (1420.00&amp;nbsp;MHz emissions) to view and pinpoint the formation of the first illuminations of the universe.

Also, this is the period ending the [[Chronology of the universe#Dark Ages|Dark Ages of the universe]].  The orbiter will explore the universe as it was from around 80 million years to 420 million years after the [[Big Bang]]. The mission will deliver data pertaining to the formation of the first stars, the initial [[black hole]] accretions, and the [[reionization]] of the universe. [[Computer model]]s of [[galaxy formation]] will also be tested.&lt;ref name=burns&gt;

This mission might also add to [[research]] on [[dark matter]] decay. The DARE program will also provide insight for developing and deploying [[lunar surface]] telescopes that add to refined [[exoplanet]] exploration of nearby stars. It is expected to launch in either 2021 or 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Universe's 'Dark Ages' May Come to Light with Moon Orbiter |url=http://www.space.com/31811-universe-dark-ages-dare-moon-orbiter.html |date=5 February 2016 |work=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=19 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The period after [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] occurred but before [[star]]s and [[galaxies]] formed is known as the "dark ages". During this time, the majority of [[matter]] in the universe is neutral hydrogen. This hydrogen has yet to be observed, but there are experiments underway to detect the [[hydrogen line]] produced during this era. The hydrogen line is produced when an [[electron]] in a neutral hydrogen [[atom]] is [[excited state|excited]] to a state where the electron and [[proton]] have aligned [[spin (physics)|spin]]s, or de-excited as the electron and proton spins go from being aligned to anti-aligned. The energy difference between these two [[hyperfine]] states is &lt;math&gt;5.9 \times 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; [[electron volts]], with a [[wavelength]] of 21 centimeters. At times when neutral hydrogen is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with the [[photons]] in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the neutral hydrogen and CMB are said to be "coupled", and the hydrogen line is not observable. It is only when the two temperatures differ, or decoupled, that the hydrogen line can be observed.&lt;ref name=Stiav&gt;

==Theoretical motivation==
The Big Bang produced a hot, dense, nearly [[homogeneous]] universe. As the universe expanded and cooled, [[particles]], then [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], and finally [[atoms]] formed. At a redshift of about 1100, equivalent to about 400,000 years after the [[Big Bang]], when the [[Primordial nucleosynthesis|primordial plasma]] filling the universe cooled sufficiently for [[protons]] and [[electrons]] to combine into neutral hydrogen atoms, the universe became optically thin whereby [[photons]] from this early era no longer interacted with [[matter]]. We detect these photons today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). The CMB shows that the universe was still remarkably smooth and uniform.&lt;ref name=burns/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;
 
After the protons and electrons combined to produce the first hydrogen atoms, the universe consisted of a nearly uniform, almost completely neutral, [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM) for which the dominant matter component was hydrogen gas. With no luminous sources present, these are known as the Dark Ages. Theoretical models predict that, over the next few hundred million years, gravity slowly condensed the gas into denser and denser regions, within which the first stars eventually appeared, marking Cosmic Dawn.&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;
 
As more stars formed, and the first galaxies assembled, they flooded the universe with [[Ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet photons]] capable of ionizing hydrogen gas. A few hundred million years after Cosmic Dawn, the first stars produced enough ultraviolet photons to reionize essentially all the universe’s hydrogen atoms. This Reionization era is the hallmark event of this early generation of galaxies, marking the phase transition of the IGM back to a nearly completely ionized state.&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;
 
The beginning of structural complexity in the universe constituted a remarkable transformation, but one that we have not yet investigated observationally. By pushing even farther back than the [[Hubble telescope]] can see, the truly first structures in the universe can be studied. [[Theoretical model]]s suggest that existing measurements are beginning to probe the tail end of [[Reionization]], but the first stars and galaxies, in the Dark Ages and the Cosmic Dawn, currently lie beyond our reach.&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;
 
DARE will make the first measurements of the birth of the first stars and black holes and will measure the properties of the otherwise invisible stellar populations. Such observations are essential for placing existing measurements in a proper context, and to understand how the first galaxies grew from earlier generations of structures.&lt;ref name=burns/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;

==Mission==
DARE’s approach is to measure the spectral shape of the sky-averaged, redshifted  21-cm signal over a radio bandpass of 40-120&amp;nbsp;MHz, observing the redshift range 11-35, which correlates to 80 - 420 million years after the Big Bang. DARE orbits the Moon for 3 years and takes data above the lunar farside, the only location in the inner Solar System proven to be free of human-generated radio frequency interference and any significant ionosphere.

The science instrument is mounted to a RF quiet spacecraft bus and is composed of a three-element radiometer, including electrically-short, tapered, [[Biconical antenna|biconical dipole antenna]]s, a receiver, and a digital spectrometer. The smooth frequency response of the antennas and the differential spectral calibration approach used for DARE are effective in removing the intense cosmic foregrounds so that the weak cosmic 21-cm signal can be detected.

==Similar projects==
Besides DARE, are other similar projects are proposed to also study this area such as the [[Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization]] (PAPER), [[LOFAR|Low Frequency Array]] (LOFAR), [[Murchison Widefield Array]] (MWA), [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT), and the [[Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages]] (LEDA).

The '''detective dénouement''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|eɪ|ˈ|n|uː|m|ɒ̃|,_|d|ɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|d|eɪ|n|uː|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/denouement?q=D%C3%A9nouement "dénouement"]. ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|denumɑ̃|lang}}) is a variant on the [[literature|literary]] [[dénouement]] common to [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] stories.

==Overview==
Detective dénouement was first popularised by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[novels]], but is present in many stories, such as the works of [[Agatha Christie]] or in [[Ellen Raskin]]'s young adult novel ''[[The Westing Game]]''.

In detective stories, the dénouement is the segment of a mystery novel in which the [[protagonist]] of the story, or a character serving in his or her stead, reveals all of the clues and lays out the conclusion for the other characters. This is usually in an attempt to show the readers how the character came to the conclusion and figured out the mystery. One famous example of the detective dénouement is the explanatory speech given by a [[forensic]] [[psychology|psychologist]] after the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. In the U.S. television series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', the title character ([[Adrian Monk]]) usually uses this method with the words "here's what happened." A [[black-and-white]] montage of the events prior to the murder accompanies his narration.

'''''Did Jesus Exist?''''' is a 1975 book written by the modern German historian [[George Albert Wells]] who speculated  on the evidence of [[Jesus Christ]]. Wells argues there was no historical evidence of Jesus existing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=68 | title=Did Jesus Exist? | publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|date= | first= | last=  | accessdate =2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://jts.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/XXVII/2/447 | title=Review: Did Jesus Exist? | publisher=[[Journal of Theological Studies]]|year=1976  | first=John | last=Robinson  | accessdate =2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised second edition was published in 1986.

Wells has since modified his position, and in 2003 stated that he now disagrees with [[Robert M. Price]] on the information about Jesus being "all mythical".&lt;ref name=WellsTrust49&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells (Nov 26, 2003) {{ISBN|0812695674}} pages 49-50: "In my first books on Jesus, I argued that the gospel Jesus is an entirely mythical expansion of the Jesus of the early epistles. The summary of the argument of ''The Jesus Legend'' (1996) and ''The Jesus Myth'' (199a) given in this section of the present work makes it clear that I no longer maintain this position", page 50 states that Wells does not agree with Price: "My present standpoint is: this complex is not all post-Pauline (Q, or at any rate parts of it, may well be as early as ca. A.D. 50); and if I am right, against Doherty and Price - it is not all mythical."&lt;/ref&gt; Wells now believes that the Jesus of the gospels is obtained by attributing the supernatural traits of the Pauline epistles to the human preacher of [[Q source]].&lt;ref&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells (Nov 26, 2003) {{ISBN|0812695674}} page 43 states: "In the gospels, the two Jesus figures - the human preacher of Q and the supernatural personage of the early epistles who sojourned briefly on Earth as a man and then, rejected, returned to heaven - have been fused into one. The Galilean preacher of Q has been given a salvific death and resurrection."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Bart Ehrman]], in his ''Did Jesus Exist?'' (2012) stated: "The best-known mythicist of modern times — at least among the NT scholars who know of any mythicists at all — is George A. Wells...He has written many books and articles advocating a mythicist position, none more incisive than his 1975 book, ''Did Jesus Exist?''. Wells is certainly one who does the hard legwork to make his case: Although an outsider to NT studies, he speaks the lingo of the field and has read deeply in its scholarship. Although most NT scholars will not (or do not) consider his work either convincing or particularly well argued." (p.&amp;nbsp;19).  Wells, 86, provided an answer to these points in an article in ''Free Inquiry''.&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Wells, "Ehrman on the Historicity of Jesus and Early Christian Thinking", ''Free Inquiry'', June–July 2012, p. 58-62. It is a 5-page, 4,100-word answer to Ehrman's book. [http://www.radikalkritik.de/Wells_Ehrman.htm Excerpts available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053543/http://www.radikalkritik.de/Wells_Ehrman.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}, (1,000 words only).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''extinction risk of global warming''' is the risk of [[species]] becoming [[Extinction|extinct]] due to the [[effects of global warming]]. This may be Earth's [[Mass Extinction|sixth major extinction]], often called the [[Anthropocene]] or [[Holocene extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current projections==
The scientific consensus in the 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] is that {{Quotation|"Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change."
"There is medium confidence that approximately 20-30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5-2.5 °C (relative to 1980-1999). As global average temperature increase exceeds about 3.5 °C, model projections suggest significant extinctions (40-70% of species assessed) around the globe."}}

In one study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2004, between 15 and 37% of 1103 endemic or near-endemic known plant and animal species will be "committed to extinction" by 2050.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomas, C.D. |author2=Cameron, A. |author3=Green, R.E. |author4=Bakkenes, M. |author5=Beaumont, L.J. |author6=Collingham, Y.C. |author7=Erasmus, B.F.N. |author8=Siqueira, M.F.D. |author9=Grainger, A. |author10= Hannah, L.  | year = 2004 | title = Extinction risk from climate change | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 427 | issue = 6970 | pages = 145–148 | doi= 10.1038/nature02121 | url = http://www.mnp.nl/bibliotheek/digitaaldepot/20040108nature.pdf  |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate = 2008-04-15 | pmid = 14712274|bibcode = 2004Natur.427..145T }}&lt;/ref&gt; More properly, changes in habitat by 2050 will put them outside the survival range for the inhabitants, thus committing the species to extinction.

[[Human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] climate change seems set to generate very large numbers of species-level extinctions." On the other hand, Daniel Botkin ''et al.'' state "... global estimates of extinctions due to climate change (Thomas et al. 2004) may have greatly overestimated the probability of extinction..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Botkin |first=Daniel B. |date=March 2007 |title=Forecasting the Effects of Global Warming on Biodiversity |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=227–236 |doi=10.1641/B570306 |url=http://www.imv.dk/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2FFiles%2FFiler%2FIMV%2FPublikationer%2FFagartikler%2F2007%2F050307_Botkin_et_al.pdf |archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071201040536/http://www.imv.dk/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2FFiles%2FFiler%2FIMV%2FPublikationer%2FFagartikler%2F2007%2F050307_Botkin_et_al.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-12-01 |accessdate=2007-11-30 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanistic studies are documenting extinctions due to recent [[climate change]]: McLaughlin ''et al.'' documented two populations of [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] being threatened by [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] change.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin"&gt;{{cite journal |last= McLaughlin |first= John F. |date= 2002-04-30 |title= Climate change hastens population extinctions |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume= 99 |issue= 9 |pages= 6070–6074 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.052131199 |url= http://www.nd.edu/~hellmann/pnas.pdf |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |pmc= 122903 |accessdate= 2007-03-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070604183008/http://www.nd.edu/~hellmann/pnas.pdf |archivedate = 2007-06-04 |pmid=11972020 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.6070M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parmesan states, "Few studies have been conducted at a scale that encompasses an entire species"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Permesan |first= Camille |date= 2006-08-24 |title= Ecological and Evolutionary Responses to Recent Climate Change |journal= [[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]] |volume= 37 |pages= 637–669 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110100 |url= http://cns.utexas.edu/communications/File/AnnRev_CCimpacts2006.pdf |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate= 2007-03-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070105021545/http://cns.utexas.edu/communications/File/AnnRev_CCimpacts2006.pdf |archivedate = 2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and McLaughlin ''et al.'' agreed "few mechanistic studies have linked extinctions to recent climate change."&lt;ref name="McLaughlin" /&gt;

In 2008, the [[Lemur-like Ringtail Possum|white lemuroid possum]] was reported to be the first known [[mammal]] species to be driven extinct by man-made [[global warming]]. However, these reports were based on a misunderstanding. One population of these possums in the mountain forests of [[North Queensland|northern Queensland]] is severely threatened by climate change as the animals cannot survive extended temperatures over 30&amp;nbsp;°C. However, another population 100 kilometres south remains in good health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16875 Rumours of possum's death were greatly exaggerated] March 31, 2009 [[New Scientist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in the January 4, 2012 ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]'' current climate models may be flawed because they overlook two important factors: the differences in how quickly species relocate and competition among species. According to the researchers, led by [[Mark C. Urban]], an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, diversity decreased when they took these factors into account, and that new communities of organisms, which do not exist today, emerged. As a result the rate of extinctions may be higher than previously projected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0106/Climate-change-models-flawed-extinction-rate-likely-higher-than-predicted|title=Climate change models flawed, extinction rate likely higher than predicted|date= January 6, 2012 |publisher=[[csmonitor.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in the 30 May 2014 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]],'' most known species have small ranges, and the numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. According to the research, current rates of extinction are three orders of magnitude higher than the [[background extinction rate]], and future rates, which depend on many factors, are poised to increase. Although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity. In the researchers' view, human activity tends to destroy critical habitats where species live, warms the planet, and tends to move species around the planet to places where they don’t belong and where they can come into conflict with human needs (e.g. causing species to become pests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimm | first1 = S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1584">'''Extrapolation based Molecular Systems Biology''' is the utilization of molecular data from one or many sub-cellular levels to indirectly infer the remaining components of a sub-cellular system via statistical algorithms and priori biological knowledge. The motivation to rebuild remaining components of a system is driven primarily by adopting a systems biologist's view of a biological phenomenon where a pan-omic view is a consistent requirement (... [[Denis Noble]] "The Music of Life"). 

The term "extrapolation" is chosen to provide caution due to a high potential of false positives with high levels of extrapolation. On average, fewer levels (and smaller leaps) of inference and greater levels of observational data is recommended for a statistically significant extrapolated system.  

Sub-cellular levels may include one or more of the following (but not limited to) (see [[Systems Biology]]): 
[[Genomics]], [[Epigenomics]] / [[Epigenetics]], [[Transcriptomics]], [[Interferomics]], [[Translatomics]] / [[Proteomics]], [[Metabolomics]], [[Glycomics]],  [[Lipidomics]], [[Interactomics]], and [[Fluxomics]].

'''Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.''' ('''HSA''') is the largest student-run company in the world, employing more than 500 Harvard undergraduates annually. Founded in 1957, HSA is a multimillion-dollar non-profit that provides [[Harvard University]] students with meaningful opportunities for employment and hands-on business education. Student managers lead all aspects of the operations and strategy behind HSA's 15 businesses, which range from publishing to tutoring to bartending, including [[Let's Go (book series)|Let's Go]] (the leader in student travel), HSA Cleaners (a laundry and dry-cleaning service), and The Harvard Shop (a storefront and web retail business).

HSA is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit, and was founded to help defray rising tuition costs while providing practical business experience for Harvard undergraduates and supplying services to the campus community.

HSA is headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]].

==History==

===Founding===
HSA was founded in 1957 on the ideal of financing education through student employment. With Harvard's tuition on the rise, members of the Financial Aid Office were concerned that the increased cost of higher education would adversely affect the social and economic make-up of those applying to Harvard. At the same time, some ambitious students were running small-scale businesses out of their dorm rooms.  John Munro, Dean of Financial Aid, assigned Dustin M. Burke, Director of Student Employment, to investigate student businesses as a possible source of financial aid and to begin developing the idea that would become Harvard Student Agencies.

Later that spring, a meeting with student managers revealed considerable interest in the idea of a corporation, and more concrete plans began to emerge. With an initial capital investment of $7,000 and the acquisition of the rights to provide the weekly linen service traditionally offered by the university, HSA was equipped to carry its corporate overhead. The remaining pieces quickly fell into place. In August 1957, the papers authorizing a new company were filed. On September 10, the new corporation's first meeting was held. On December 13, 1957, the charter was signed recognizing the six original incorporators: John Munro, Dustin Burke, Greg Stone, John Giannetti, Theodore Elliot, and [[Harold Rosenwald]].&lt;ref name="hsa.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsa.net/history/|title=History|website=Harvard Student Agencies|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the company has grown significantly over the past 6 decades. Let's Go publishing was the leading agency for much of 1980s and 1990s, at one point publishing over 50 titles annually. With the recent decline in publishing travel, however, The Harvard Shop has become the largest operation for the Harvard Student Agencies. With a robust E-commerce presence as well as three physical locations in the square, it aims to serve tourists, locals, and students alike.&lt;ref name="hsa.net"/&gt; The company has expanded organically and through acquiring startups that align with the company's mission. Recent examples include Mount Auburn Productions, created to meet the demand for live event filming and photography on campus, as well as College Copywriters, a startup that was acquired by Harvard Student Agencies in 2015 that connected students to companies needing high quality copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/10/22/hsa-scrutiny-silber/|title=There's an Agency for That - Magazine - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HSA Headquarters: Burke-McCoy Hall==
HSA Headquarters is located at 67 Mount Auburn Street, Cambridge MA, in the former [[Manter Hall School]] building which was built in 1927. Established in 1884, Manter Hall School helped students prepare for Harvard's entrance exams during the 1930s and offered four- and eight-hour review sessions before every major Harvard mid-term and final examination. Although enrollment reached a peak of 250 in the late 1940s, by 1994 only 19 students were registered. At this time, Robert Hall, the owner of the building and manager of the school for 57 years, turned 83 and began talking to Harvard Student Agencies. Mr. Hall came to understand the unique educational opportunities HSA afforded to students and decided to sell the property to HSA in the spring of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1995/2/10/hsa-finds-permanent-location-in-square/|title=HSA Finds Permanent Location In Square - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1995, Robert W. McCoy (Harvard College ‘62, [[Harvard Business School]] ‘65) pledged a substantial lead gift to HSA’s capital campaign. The building was dedicated as Burke-McCoy Hall on February 5, 1997, and the dream of a permanent home for HSA was a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1996/12/11/hsa-lets-go-move-to-67/|title=HSA, Let's Go Move To 67 Mt. Auburn St. - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was named in honor of Dustin M. Burke, the first General Manager of HSA (1957-1970); Hester Bell McCoy, who joined HSA in 1961 as the company’s secretary; and Robert McCoy, Manager of Europe-by-Car, Assistant General Manager to Dusty Burke, and Let’s Go business manager upon his graduation from business school.

HSA currently occupies the top three floors and basement of Burke-McCoy Hall. Bank of America, Boloco (formerly The Wrap) and HSA Cleaners occupy the retail level of Burke-McCoy Hall. Behind the building, enough space exists to accommodate construction of a substantial annex for future expansion. A recent partnership with CS50, the introductory computer science course with one of the largest enrollments at Harvard, has opened the third floor to hosting office hours for students and teaching fellows to meet and congregate. This additional option was created in response to increasing demand for office hours as a result of the size of the course, as well the offer more flexible office hours to fit the wide range of schedules from students taking the class. The partnership also seeks to give students the option to pursue projects related services for students, with room for collaboration with Harvard Student Agencies beyond the one semester course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/9/14/CS50-expands-to-HSA/|title=CS50 Expands Office Hour Locations to HSA - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HSA also has three locations of The Harvard Shop in Harvard Square at 52 JFK Street, 65 Mt. Auburn Street and 34 JFK Street.

[[Candle|Candles]] were used by the early [[Greeks]] to honour the goddess Artemis' birth on the sixth day of every lunar month.

[[Candle|Candles]] were made by the Romans beginning about 500 BC. These were true dipped candles and made from [[tallow]]. Evidence for candles made from [[whale fat]] in China dates back to the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–206 BC).&lt;ref name=telesco&gt;{{cite book | last = Telesco | first = Patricia  | title = Exploring Candle Magick: Candle Spells, Charms, Rituals, and Divinations | publisher = Career Press  | year = 2001 | location =   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ogHORLtm3KAC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=wax+boiling+cinnamon+candle&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=tiI6EMFlQa8qc-8HN8J7qfUXS3k | isbn = 1-56414-522-0| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], wax from boiling [[cinnamon]] was used for temple candles.&lt;ref name=telesco/&gt;

In parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Africa, where lamp oil made from olives was readily available, candle making remained unknown until the early middle-ages.  Candles were primarily made from [[tallow]] and [[beeswax]] in ancient times, but have been made from [[spermaceti]], purified animal fats ([[stearin]]) and [[paraffin wax]] in recent centuries.&lt;ref name= Ullmann/&gt;

The early [[Greeks]] used candles to honour the goddess Artemis' birth on the sixth day of every lunar month.

[[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began making true dipped candles from tallow, beginning around 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/candles2.html |title=Candles, Roman, 500 BCE |website=Smith College Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; While oil lamps were the most widely used source of illumination in Roman Italy, candles were common and regularly given as gifts during [[Saturnalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/how-did-romans-celebrate-%E2%80%98christmas%E2%80%99 |title=How did the Romans celebrate ‘Christmas’? |website=History Extra |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mausoleum of [[Qin Shi Huang]] (259–210 BC), contained candles made from whale fat.  The word zhú was used as candle during the [[Warring States period]] (403&amp;ndash;221 BC); some excavated bronzewares from that era feature a pricket thought to hold a candle.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 79 80"&gt;{{cite book |last=Needham |first=Joseph |date=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 1, Physics |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books Ltd |pages=79&amp;ndash;80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC &amp;ndash; 220 AD) ''Jizhupian'' dictionary of about 40 BC hints at candles being made of beeswax, while the ''[[Book of Jin]]'' (compiled in 648) covering the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265&amp;ndash;420) makes a solid reference to the beeswax candle in regards to its use by the statesman Zhou Yi (d. 322).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 79 80"/&gt; An excavated earthenware bowl from the 4th century AD, located at the [[Luoyang Museum]], has a hollowed socket where traces of wax were found.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 79 80"/&gt; Generally these Chinese candles were molded in paper tubes, using rolled rice paper for the wick, and wax from an indigenous insect{{clarifyme|date=August 2015}} that was combined with seeds{{clarifyme|date=August 2015}}.

There is a fish called the [[eulachon]] or "candlefish", a type of [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] which is found from Oregon to Alaska. During the 1st century AD, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] from this region used oil from this fish for illumination.&lt;ref name=telesco/&gt; A simple candle could be made by putting the dried fish on a forked stick and then lighting it.

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Candles Oberflacht.jpg|thumb|upright|The oldest surviving bees wax candles north of the Alps from the alamannic graveyard of Oberflacht, Germany dating to 6th/7th century A.D.]]
After the collapse of the [[Roman empire]], trading disruptions made [[olive oil]], the most common fuel for oil lamps, unavailable throughout much of Europe. As a consequence, candles became more widely used. By contrast, in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], candle-making remained relatively unknown due to the availability of olive oil.

Candles were commonplace throughout Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. Candle makers (known as [[chandlery|chandler]]s) made candles from fats saved from the kitchen or sold their own candles from within their shops. The trade of the chandler is also recorded by the more picturesque name of "smeremongere", since they oversaw the manufacture of sauces, vinegar, soap and cheese. The popularity of candles is shown by their use in [[Candlemas]] and in [[Saint Lucy]] festivities.

[[Tallow]], fat from cows or sheep, became the standard material used in candles in Europe. The unpleasant smell of tallow candles is due to the glycerine they contain. The smell of the manufacturing process was so unpleasant that it was banned by ordinance in several European cities. [[Beeswax]] was discovered to be an excellent substance for candle production without the unpleasant odour, but remained restricted in usage for the rich and for churches and royal events, due to their great expense.

In [[England]] and [[France]], candle making had become a [[guild|guild craft]] by the 13th century. The [[Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers|Tallow Chandlers Company]] of [[London]] was formed in about 1300 in London, and in 1456 was granted a [[coat of arms]]. The [[Worshipful Company of Wax Chandlers|Wax Chandlers Company]] dating from about 1330, acquired its charter in 1484. By 1415, tallow candles were used in street lighting. The first candle mould comes from the 15th century in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millhousecandles.com/history.php|title=A Short History of Candles|website=Millhouse Candles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
[[File:Colonial candle molds at fruitlands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'Colonial'-style tapered candle molds]]
With the growth of the [[whaling|whaling industry]] in the 18th century, [[spermaceti]], an oil that comes from a cavity in the head of the [[sperm whale]], became a widely used substance for candle making. The spermaceti was obtained by crystallizing the oil from the sperm whale and was the first candle substance to become available in mass quantities. Like beeswax, spermaceti wax did not create a repugnant odor when burned, and produced a significantly brighter light. It was also harder than either tallow or beeswax, so it would not soften or bend in the summer heat. The first "standard candles" were made from spermaceti wax.

By 1800, an even cheaper alternative was discovered. [[Colza oil]], derived from [[Brassica campestris]], and a similar oil derived from [[rapeseed]], yielded candles that produce clear, smokeless flames. The French chemists [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] (1786–1889) and [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] (1778–1850) patented [[stearin]] in 1825. Like tallow, this was derived from animals, but had no glycerine content.

===Industrialization===
[[File:Joseph_Morgan_candle_maker.jpg|thumb|right|Joseph Morgan's candle making machine revolutionized candle making]]
The manufacture of candles became an industrialised mass market in the mid 19th century. In 1834, Joseph Morgan, a pewterer from [[Manchester]], England, patented a machine that revolutionised candle making. It allowed for continuous production of molded candles by using a cylinder with a moveable piston to eject candles as they solidified. This more efficient mechanized production produced about 1,500 candles per hour, (according to his patent ". . with three men and five boys [the machine] will manufacture two tons of candle in twelve hours"). This allowed candles to become an easily affordable commodity for the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Gordon  | title = Seven Centuries of Light: The Tallow Chandlers Company | publisher = Book Production Consultants plc | year = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OWt03_on0qUC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Joseph+Morgan+candles+1834&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=4YXvX0eEdKqze7B13yQiKehrgjs | isbn = 1-85757-064-2 | page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Price's Palmitine Candles00.jpg|left|thumb|[[Price's Candles]] became the largest candle manufacturer in the world by the end of the 19th century]]
At this time, candlemakers also began to fashion wicks out of tightly [[braid]]ed (rather than simply twisted) strands of [[cotton]]. This technique makes wicks curl over as they burn, maintaining the height of the wick and therefore the flame. Because much of the excess wick is incinerated, these are referred to as "self-trimming" or "self-consuming" wicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php |title=A Brief History of Candles |access-date=2013-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318072713/http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php |archive-date=2013-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848 James Young established the world’s first oil refinery at the Alfreton Ironworks in [[Riddings]], [[Derbyshire]]. Two paraffin wax candles were made from the naturally occurring paraffin wax present in the oil and these candles illuminated a lecture at the Royal Institution by Lyon Playfair. In the mid-1850s, [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] succeeded in distilling [[paraffin wax]] from coal and oil shales at [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]] and developed a commercially viable method of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golan | first = Tal  | title = Laws of Men and Laws of Nature: The History of Scientific Expert Testimony in England and America | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2004 | pages = 89–91 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kQhYsAmcj-EC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=james+young+patent+paraffin&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=GVRHQw_E_JpKCMJyDIHh_0mY8uI#PPA90,M1  | isbn = 0-674-01286-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paraffin wax was processed by distilling residue left after [[crude petroleum]] was refined. 

Paraffin could be used to make inexpensive candles of high quality. It was a bluish-white wax, burned cleanly, and left no unpleasant odor, unlike [[tallow]] candles. A drawback to the substance was that early coal- and petroleum-derived paraffin waxes had a very low melting point. The introduction of [[stearin]], discovered by [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], solved this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using stearic acid or stearin in candlemaking|url=http://www.happynews.com/living/create/using-stearic-acid.htm|website=happynews.com|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stearic acid (stearin)|url=http://www.howtomakecandles.info/cm_article.asp?ID=ADDIT0003|website=howtomakecandles.info|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stearin is hard and durable, with a convenient melting range of 54–72.5&amp;nbsp;°C (129.2–162.5&amp;nbsp;°F). By the end of the 19th century, most candles being manufactured consisted of paraffin and stearic acid.

By the late 19th century, [[Price's Candles]], based in London was the largest candle manufacturer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJo7AwAAQBAJ|title=London's Industrial Heritage|author=Geoff Marshall|year=2013|publisher=The History Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company traced its origins back to 1829, when William Wilson invested in 1,000 acres (4&amp;nbsp;km²) of coconut plantation in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ball  | first = Michael  |author2=David Sunderland | title = An Economic History of London, 1800-1914 | publisher = Routledge | year = 2001 | pages = 131–132 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MI6JfTiEcdAC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Prices+Candles+Coconut&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=So7CcAanBJha_PZuwQsHDyhgyeo | isbn = 0-415-24691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aim was to make candles from coconut oil. Later he tried palm oil from palm trees. An accidental discovery swept all his ambitions aside when his son George Wilson, a talented chemist, distilled the first petroleum oil in 1854. George also pioneered the implementation of the technique of steam distillation, and was thus able to manufacture candles from a wide range of raw materials, including skin fat, bone fat, fish oil and industrial greases.

In America, [[Syracuse, New York]] developed into a global center for [[Industry in Syracuse, New York|candle manufacturing]] from the mid-nineteenth century. Manufacturers included Will &amp; Baumer, Mack Miller, Muench Kruezer, and [[Cathedral Candle Company]].

===Decline of the candle industry===
[[File:Birthday candles.jpg|thumb| Candles here are used to celebrate a birthday]]
Despite advances in candle making, the candle industry declined rapidly upon the introduction of superior methods of lighting, including [[kerosene]] and [[Kerosene lamp|lamps]] and the 1879 invention of the [[incandescent light bulb]].

From this point on, candles came to be marketed as more of a decorative item. Candles became available in a broad array of sizes, shapes and colors, and consumer interest in scented candles began to grow. During the 1990s, new types of candle waxes were being developed due to an unusually high demand for candles. Paraffin, a by-product of oil, was quickly replaced by new waxes and wax blends due to rising costs.

Candle manufacturers looked at waxes such as soy, palm and flax-seed oil, often blending them with paraffin in hopes of getting the performance of paraffin with the price benefits of the other waxes. The creation of unique wax blends, now requiring different fragrance chemistries and loads, placed pressure for innovation on the candle wick manufacturing industry to meet performance needs with the often tougher to burn formulations. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atkinsandpearce.com/candle-solutions/new-product-development/ Atkins &amp; Pearce Candle Wick History]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infradian rhythm''' is, in [[chronobiology]] a rhythm with a duration longer than that of a [[circadian rhythm]], i.e. with a frequency less than one cycle in 28 hours,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Frederick M. &amp; Graeber, R. Curtis, eds.  The Rhythmic Aspects of Behavior. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. 1982, (p.462).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[menstrual cycle]], breeding and tidal or seasonal rhythms. [[Ultradian rhythm]]s by contrast, have periods shorter than the period of a circadian rhythm. A number of infradian rhythms are known to be caused by hormone stimulation or exogenous factors for example [[seasonal depression]], linked to the lowering of light levels during [[winter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychteacher.co.uk/biologicalrhythms/infradian_ultradian_rhythms.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Virgngc.jpg|250 px|thumb|The Virgo cluster of galaxies, where the phenomenon known as intergalactic stars was discovered.]]
An '''intergalactic star''', also known as an '''intracluster star''' or a '''rogue star''', is a [[star]] not [[gravitationally bound]] to any [[galaxy]]. Although a source of much discussion in the scientific community during the late 1990s, intergalactic stars are now generally thought to have originated in galaxies, like other stars, but later expelled as the result of either colliding galaxies or of a [[multiple star system]] travelling too close to a [[supermassive black hole]], which are found at the center of many galaxies.

Collectively, intergalactic stars are referred to as the intracluster stellar population, or IC population for short, in the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;See "Confirmation of Hostless Type Ia Supernovae Using Hubble Space Telescope Imaging" for example&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The common belief that stars exist only in galaxies was disproven in 1997 with the discovery of intergalactic stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1997/02 |title=NewsCenter – Hubble Finds Intergalactic Stars (01/14/1997) – Introduction |publisher=[[HubbleSite]] |date=1997-01-14 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first to be discovered were in the [[Virgo cluster]] of galaxies, where some one trillion are now surmised to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1997/02/text/ |title=NewsCenter – Hubble Finds Intergalactic Stars (01/14/1997) – Release Text |publisher=HubbleSite |date=1997-01-14 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:NGC4676.jpg|thumb|250px|Collisions between galaxies are commonly thought to be a source of intergalactic stars.]]
[[File:HE 0437-5439 mechanism.jpg|250px|thumb|Proposed mechanisms for the ejection of intergalactic stars by [[supermassive black hole]]s.]]
The way these stars arise is still a mystery, but several scientifically credible [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] have been suggested and published by astrophysicists.

The most common hypothesis is that the collision of two or more galaxies can toss some stars out into the vast empty regions of [[intergalactic space]]. Although stars normally reside within galaxies, they can be expelled by gravitational forces when galaxies collide. It is commonly believed that intergalactic stars may primarily have originated from extremely small galaxies, since it is easier for stars to escape a smaller galaxy's gravitational pull, than that of a large galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Witze|first1=Alexandra|title=Half of Stars Lurk Outside Galaxies|url=http://www.nature.com/news/half-of-stars-lurk-outside-galaxies-1.16288|website=Nature|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]]|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when large galaxies collide, some of the gravitational disturbances might also produce intergalactic stars in theory. In 2015, a study of supernovae in intergalactic space suggested that the progenitor stars had been expelled from their host galaxies during a galactic collision between two giant ellipticals, as their supermassive black hole centres merged.&lt;ref name="BH merge"&gt;Space.com: [
https://www.space.com/30380-lonely-supernova-exiled-by-black-holes.html Lonely Supernova Likely Exiled by Merging Black Holes] (27 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hypothesis, that is not mutually exclusive to the galactic collisions hypothesis, is that intergalactic stars could have been ejected from their [[galaxy]] of origin by a close encounter with the [[supermassive black hole]] in the galaxy center, should there be one. In such a scenario, it is likely that the intergalactic star(s) was originally part of a multiple star system where the other stars were pulled into the supermassive black hole and the soon-to-be intergalactic star was accelerated and ejected away at very high speeds. Such an event could theoretically accelerate a star to such high speeds that it becomes a [[Stellar kinematics#Hypervelocity stars|hypervelocity star]], thereby [[escape velocity|escaping]] the gravitational well of the entire galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Britt|first1=Robert Roy|title=Exiled stars: Milky Way Boots Members|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2006-01-26-milky-way-exiles_x.htm|website=USATODAY|publisher=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, model calculations (from 1988) predicts the supermassive black hole in the center of our Milky Way galaxy to expel one star every 100,000 years on average.&lt;ref&gt;NASA: [https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/expelled-star.html Hyperfast Star Was Booted From Milky Way] (22 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observation history==
In 1997, the [[Hubble telescope]] discovered a large number of intergalactic stars in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. Later in the 1990s, scientists discovered another group of intergalactic stars in the [[Fornax cluster]] of galaxies.

In 2005, at the Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Warren Brown and his team attempted to measure the speeds of hypervelocity stars using the Doppler Technique, by which light is observed for the similar changes that occur in sound when an object is moving away or toward something. But the speeds found are only estimated minimums, as in reality their speeds may be larger than the speeds found by the researchers. "One of the newfound exiles is moving in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major at about 1.25 million mph with respect to the galaxy. It is 240,000 light-years away. The other is headed toward the constellation Cancer, outbound at 1.43 million miles per hour and 180,000 light-years away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Britt|first1=Robert Roy|title=Exiled Stars: Milky Way Boots Members|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2006-01-26-milky-way-exiles_x.htm|website=USATODAY|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s, a diffuse glow from the intergalactic medium, but of unknown origin, was discovered. In 2012, it was suggested and shown that it might originate from intergalactic stars. Subsequent observations and studies have elaborated on the issue and described the [[diffuse extragalactic background radiation]] in more detail.&lt;ref name=Cooray/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zemcov/&gt;

Some Vanderbilt astronomers report that they have identified more than 675 stars at the edge of the Milky Way, between the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] and the Milky Way. They argue that these stars are hypervelocity (intergalactic) stars that were ejected from the Milky Way's galactic center. These stars are red giants with a high [[metallicity]] (a measure of the proportion of chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium within a star) indicating an inner galactic origin, since stars outside the disks of galaxies tend to have low metallicity and are older.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt University"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Salisbury|first1=David|title=Rogue Stars Ejected From the Galaxy Found in Intergalactic Space|url=http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2012/04/rogue-stars-intergalactic-space/|website=Vanderbilt University|publisher=Vanderbilt University|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recently discovered supernovae have been confirmed to have exploded hundreds of thousands of light years from the nearest star or galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stallard|first1=Brian|title=Between Galaxies: Lonely Supernovae Identified|url=http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15059/20150607/between-galaxies-lonely-supernovae-identified.htm|website=Nature World News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BH merge"/&gt;

==Mass==
Although the precise mass of the intergalactic star population cannot be known exactly, it is estimated that locally they make up 10 percent of the mass of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. This means that, most likely, intergalactic stars in the Virgo cluster would collectively have a larger mass than any particular one of the 2500 galaxies in the cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Detection of intergalactic red-giant-branch stars in the Virgo cluster |author1=Henry C. Ferguson |displayauthors=etal |journal=Nature |year=1998 |volume=391 |pages=461–463 |url= |doi=10.1038/35087 |accessdate=|arxiv = astro-ph/9801228 |bibcode = 1998Natur.391..461F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] revealed a hitherto unknown infrared component in the [[Cosmic infrared background|background from the cosmos]]. Since then, several other [[anisotropy|anisotropies]] at other wavelengths - including blue and x-ray - have been detected with other space telescopes and they are now collectively described as the [[diffuse extragalactic background radiation]]. Several explanations have been discussed by scientists, but in 2012, it was suggested and shown for the first time, that this diffuse radiation might in fact originate from intergalactic stars. If that is the case, intergalactic stars might collectively comprise as much mass as that found in the galaxies. A population of such magnitude was at one point thought to explain the [[photon underproduction crisis]], and may explain a significant part of the [[dark matter]] problem.&lt;ref name=Cooray&gt;{{cite article|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.6031v1.pdf|title=A measurement of the intrahalo light fraction with near-infrared background anisotropies |author=Cooray et.al. |publisher=Nature |date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zemcov&gt;{{cite article|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1411.pdf|title=On the Origin of Near-Infrared Extragalactic Background Light Anisotropy |author=Zemcov et.al. |publisher=Nature |date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colossal Gas Cloud Discovered Around Milky Way|url=http://www.space.com/17734-milky-way-galaxy-giant-gas-halo.html|website=Space|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Charles Q.|title=Lost in Space: Half of All Stars Drifting Free of Galaxies|url=http://www.space.com/27682-rogue-stars-between-galaxies.html|website=Space|publisher=Purch|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known locations==
{{update section|date=July 2017}}
The first intergalactic stars were discovered in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. These stars form a massive group approximately 300,000 [[light year]]s away from the nearest galaxy.

As of 2015, approximately 675 rogue stars have been discovered at the edge of the Milky Way, towards the [[Andromeda galaxy]].&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt University"/&gt;

An '''introduced species''' ('''alien species''', '''exotic species''', '''non-indigenous species''', or '''non-native species''') is a [[species]] living outside its [[indigenous (ecology)|native]] distributional [[range (biology)|range]], but which has arrived there by [[human]] activity, either deliberate or accidental. Non-native species can have various effects on the local ecosystem.  Introduced species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction are called [[invasive species]]. The impact of introduced species is highly variable. Some have a negative effect on a local ecosystem, while other introduced species may have no negative effect or only minor impact. Some species have been introduced intentionally to combat pests. They are called [[biocontrol]]s and may be regarded as beneficial as an alternative to pesticides in agriculture for example. In some instances the potential for being beneficial or detrimental in the long run remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Dov Sax, Aug 2008. [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/suppl.1/11490.full The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706102943/http://www.pnas.org/content/105/suppl.1/11490.full |date=July 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The effects of introduced species on natural environments have gained much scrutiny from scientists, governments, farmers and others.

== Terminology: introduced species and subsets  ==
{{Life timeline}}
The formal definition of an introduced species, from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], is ''A species that has been intentionally or inadvertently brought into a region or area. Also called an exotic or non-native species.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment. September 16, 2003. Introduced species. Web site at [http://search.epa.gov/epasearch/epasearch?typeofsearch=epa&amp;client=new_frontend&amp;epasearch&amp;&amp;filter=sample4filt.hts&amp;fld&amp;url_directory&amp;federated=no&amp;max_results=200&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fmaia%2Fhtml%2Fintro-species.html&amp;result_template=2col.ftl&amp;areaname&amp;areapagehead=epafiles_pagehead&amp;areapagefoot=epafiles_pagefoot&amp;areasidebar=search_sidebar&amp;stylesheet&amp;sort=term_relevancy&amp;faq=true&amp;results_per_page=20&amp;cluster=both&amp;sessionid=A6EA2542B3CE0920A94CACBE45CED381&amp;querytext=introduced%20species&amp;q=introduced%20species%20definition US EPA]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many terms associated with introduced species that represent subsets of introduced species, and the terminology associated with introduced species is now in flux for various reasons. Examples of these terms are ''acclimatized'', ''[[adventive species|adventive]]'', ''naturalized'', and ''immigrant''  species but those terms refer to a subset of introduced species. The term "invasive" is used to describe introduced species when the introduced species causes substantial damage to the area in which it was introduced.

'''Subset descriptions:'''

:Acclimatized species: Introduced species that have changed physically and/or behaviorally in order to adjust to their new environment.  Acclimatized species are not necessarily optimally adjusted to their new environment and may just be physically/behaviorally sufficient for the new environment.

:[[Adventive species]]

:Naturalized species (plants): A naturalized plant species refers to a non-native plant that does not need human help to reproduce and maintain its population in an area that it is not native to.

'''General description of introduced species:'''

In the broadest and most widely used sense, an introduced species is synonymous with ''non-native'' and therefore applies as well to most garden and farm organisms; these adequately fit the basic definition given above. However, some sources add to that basic definition "and are now reproducing in the wild",&lt;ref name="carlton2002"&gt;Carlton, James T. 2002. ''Introduced Species in U.S. Coastal Waters''. Pew Oceans Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; which removes from consideration as ''introduced'' species that were raised or grown in gardens or farms that do not survive without tending by people. With respect to plants, these latter are in this case defined as either ''ornamental'' or ''cultivated'' plants.

===Invasive species===

Introduction of a species outside its native range is all that is required to be qualified as an "introduced species" such that one can distinguish between introduced species that may not occur except in cultivation, under domestication or captivity whereas others become established outside their native range and reproduce without human assistance. Such species might be termed "naturalized", "established", "wild non-native species". If they further spread beyond the place of introduction and cause damage to nearby species, they are called "invasive". The transition from introduction, to establishment and to invasion has been described in the context of plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/ddi/2000/00000006/00000002/art00003= Richardson et al. 2000]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced species are essentially "non-native" species. Invasive species are those introduced species that spreadwidely or quickly and cause harm, be that to the environment,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070303161312/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/publications/policy/invasivesEng.htm biodiversity]&lt;/ref&gt; human health, other valued resources or the economy. There have been calls from scientists to consider a species "invasive" only in terms of their spread and reproduction rather than the harm they may cause.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x A neutral terminology to define ‘invasive’ species - Colautti and MacIsaac 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a practical definition, an [[invasive species]] is one that has been introduced and become a pest in its new location, spreading (invading) by natural means. The term is used to imply both a sense of urgency and actual or potential harm. For example, U.S. Executive Order 13112 (1999) defines "invasive species" as "an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health".&lt;ref&gt;CEQ (1999). Web site page with [http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/eos/eo13112.html Executive Order 13112] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515154626/http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/eos/eo13112.html |date=2008-05-15 }} text.&lt;/ref&gt; The biological definition of invasive species, on the other hand, makes no reference to the harm they may cause, only to the fact that they spread beyond the area of original introduction.

Although some argue that "invasive" is a loaded word and harm is difficult to define,&lt;ref name=carlton2002 /&gt; the fact of the matter is that organisms have and continue to be introduced to areas in which they are not native, sometimes with but usually without much regard to the harm that could result.

From a regulatory perspective, it is neither desirable nor practical to list as undesirable or outright ban all non-native species (although the [[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]] has adopted an approach that comes close to this). Regulations require a definitional distinction between non-natives that are deemed especially onerous and all others. Introduced ''pest species'' that are ''officially listed'' as invasive, best fit the definition of an ''invasive species''.  Early detection and rapid response is the most effective strategy for regulating a pest species and reducing economic and environmental impacts of an introduction &lt;ref&gt;2013. Invasive Species Program. Clemson University – DPI. http://www.clemson.edu/public/regulatory/plant_industry/invasive_exotic_programs/. Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]] prevents the introduction of any animal not naturally occurring in the wild or any of a list of both animals or plants introduced previously and proved to be invasive.

== Nature of introductions ==
By [[invasion biology terminology|definition]], a species is considered "introduced" when its transport into an area outside of its native range is human mediated.  Introductions by humans can be described as either intentional or accidental.  Intentional introductions have been motivated by individuals or groups who either (1) believe that the newly introduced species will be in some way beneficial to humans in its new location or, (2) species are introduced intentionally but with no regard to the potential impact.  Unintentional or accidental introductions are most often a byproduct of human movements, and are thus unbound to human motivations.  Subsequent range expansion of introduced species may or may not involve human activity.

[[File:Wheat-haHula-ISRAEL.JPG|thumb|300px|Wheat ''[[Triticum]]'' introduced worldwide from its place of origin [[Mesopotamia]].]]

=== Intentional introductions ===
Species that humans intentionally transport to new regions can subsequently become successfully established in two ways. In the first case, organisms are purposely released for establishment in the wild. It is sometimes difficult to predict whether a species will become established upon release, and if not initially successful, humans have made repeated introductions to improve the probability that the species will survive and eventually reproduce in the wild.  In these cases it is clear that the introduction is directly facilitated by human desires.
[[Image:Male Silver Pheasant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Male ''Lophura nycthemera'' ([[silver pheasant]]), a native of East Asia that has been introduced into parts of [[Europe]] for ornamental reasons.]]
In the second case, species intentionally transported into a new region may escape from captive or cultivated populations and subsequently establish independent breeding populations. Escaped organisms are included in this category because their initial transport to a new region is human motivated.

==== Motivations for intentional introductions ====

'''Economic:'''  Perhaps the most common motivation for introducing a species into a new place is that of economic gain. Non-native species can become such a common part of an environment, culture, and even diet that little thought is given to their geographic origin. For example, soybeans, kiwi fruit, [[wheat]], [[honey bees]], and all [[livestock]] except the [[American bison]] and the [[wild turkey|turkey]] are non-native species to North America. Collectively, non-native crops and livestock comprise 98% of US food.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Lori Lach, Rodolfo Zuniga, and Doug Morrison, Environmental and Economic Costs Associated with Non-Indigenous Species in the United States, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Cornell University (Ithaca, New York), June 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These and other benefits from non-natives are so vast that, according to the Congressional Research Service, they probably exceed the costs.&lt;ref&gt;Corn; Tim Johnson, "Invasive Species," The Burlington Free Press, November 9, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other examples of species introduced for the purposes of benefiting [[agriculture]], [[aquaculture]] or other economic activities are widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, R.L., S.L. Williams, and D.R. Strong.  2001.  Aquaculture—a gateway for exotic species.  Science 294: 1655–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eurasian carp]] was first introduced to the United States as a potential food source. The [[apple snail]] was released in Southeast Asia with the intent that it be used as a protein source, and subsequently to places like Hawaii to establish a food industry.  In Alaska, foxes were introduced to many islands to create new populations for the fur trade. About twenty species of African and European [[dung beetles]] have established themselves in Australia after deliberate introduction by the [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]] in an effort to reduce the impact of livestock manure. The timber industry promoted the introduction of Monterey pine (''[[Pinus radiata]]'') from California to Australia and New Zealand as a commercial timber crop.  These examples represent only a small subsample of species that have been moved by humans for economic interests.

The rise in the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s has added another potential economic advantage to introducing new/modified species into different environments.  Companies such as [[Monsanto]] that earn much of their profit through the selling of genetically modified seeds has added to the controversy surrounding introduced species.  The effect of genetically modified organisms varies from organism to organism and is still being researched today, however the rise of genetically modified organisms has added complexity to the conversations surrounding introduced species.

==== Human enjoyment ====
Introductions have also been important in supporting recreation activities or otherwise increasing human enjoyment.  Numerous fish and game animals have been introduced for the purposes of sport fishing and hunting ([[earthworms as invasive species]]).  The introduced amphibian (''[[Ambystoma tigrinum]]'') that threatens the endemic California salamander (''[[Ambystoma californiense]]'') was introduced to California as a source of bait for fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, SPD,  H.B. Shaffer, S.R. Voss, B.M. Fitzpatrick.  Hybridization between a rare, native tiger salamander and its introduced congener.  2003. Ecological Applications 13: 1263–1275.&lt;/ref&gt; Pet animals have also been frequently transported into new areas by humans, and their escapes have resulted in several successful introductions, such as those of feral cats and parrots.

Many plants have been introduced with the intent of aesthetically improving public recreation areas or private properties.  The introduced [[Norway maple]] for example occupies a prominent status in many of Canada's parks.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, J. and A. Sandberg.  Friends or foe? Invasive species and public green space in Toronto.  2004.  The Geographical Review 94: 178–198.&lt;/ref&gt; The transport of [[ornamental plants]] for landscaping use has and continues to be a source of many introductions.  Some of these species have escaped horticultural control and become invasive. Notable examples include [[water hyacinth]], [[salt cedar]], and [[purple loosestrife]]

In other cases, species have been translocated for reasons of "cultural nostalgia," which  refers to instances in which humans who have migrated to new regions have intentionally brought with them familiar organisms.  Famous examples include the introduction of [[starling]]s to North America by Englishman [[Eugene Schieffelin]], a lover of the works of Shakespeare and the chairman of the [[American Acclimatization Society]], who, it is rumoured, wanted to introduce all of the birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays into the United States.  He deliberately released eighty starlings into Central Park in New York City in 1890, and another forty in 1891.

Yet another prominent example of an introduced species that became invasive is the [[European rabbit]] in [[Rabbits in Australia|Australia]]. [[Thomas Austin]], a British landowner had rabbits released on his estate in Victoria because he missed hunting them. A more recent example is the introduction of the [[common wall lizard]] to North America by a [[Cincinnati]] boy, George Rau, around 1950 after a family vacation to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Deichsel, G. &amp; Gist, D. H. [http://www.lacerta.de/Themengebiete/Verschleppung%20und%20Aussetzung/Podarcis_muralis_in_Cincinnati.html On the Origin of the Common Wall Lizards Podarcis muralis (Reptilia: Lacertidae) in Cincinnati, Ohio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909153444/http://www.lacerta.de/Themengebiete/Verschleppung%20und%20Aussetzung/Podarcis_muralis_in_Cincinnati.html |date=2009-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Addressing environmental problems ====
Intentional introductions have also been undertaken with the aim of ameliorating environmental problems.  A number of fast spreading plants such as [[kudzu]] have been introduced as a means of [[erosion]] control. Other species have been introduced as [[biological control]] agents to control [[invasive species]] and involves the purposeful introduction of a [[natural enemy]] of the target species with the intention of reducing its numbers or controlling its spread.

A special case of introduction is the reintroduction of a species that has become locally endangered or extinct, done in the interests of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Shirey, P.D. and G.A. Lamberti. 2010. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123196255/PDFSTART Assisted colonization under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.] ''Conservation Letters'' 3(1): 45–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of successful reintroductions include wolves to [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the U.S., and the [[red kite]] to parts of England and Scotland.  Introductions or translocations of species have also been proposed in the interest of [[Conservation genetics|genetic conservation]], which advocates the introduction of new individuals into genetically depauperate populations of endangered or threatened species.&lt;ref&gt;Moritz, Craig. 1999. Conservation units and translocations: Strategies for conserving evolutionary processes.  Hereditas 130: 217–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above examples highlight the intent of humans to introduce species as a means of incurring some benefit. While these benefits have in some cases been realized, introductions have also resulted in unforeseen costs, particularly when introduced species take on characteristics of invasive species.

=== Unintentional introductions ===
Unintentional introductions occur when species are transported by human vectors.  Increasing rates of human travel are providing accelerating opportunities for species to be accidentally transported into areas in which they are not considered native.  For example, three species of [[rat]] (the black, Norway and Polynesian) have spread to most of the world as hitchhikers on ships, and [[arachnids]] such as scorpions and exotic spiders are sometimes transported to areas far beyond their native range by riding in shipments of tropical fruit. There are also numerous examples of marine organisms being transported in [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|ballast water]], one being the [[zebra mussel]].  Over 200 species have been introduced to the [[San Francisco Bay]] in this manner making it the most heavily invaded estuary in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A.N. And J.T. Carlton. 1998.  Accelerating invasion rate in a highly invaded estuary.  Science 279: 555–558.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also the accidental release of the Africanized honey bees (AHB), known colloquially as "killer bees" or [[Africanized bee]] to Brazil in 1957 and the [[Asian carps]] to the United States. The insect commonly known as the [[brown marmorated stink bug]] (''Halyomorpha halys'') was introduced accidentally in Pennsylvania. Another form of unintentional introductions is when an intentionally introduced plant carries a parasite or herbivore with it. Some become invasive, for example the [[Aphis nerii|oleander aphid]], accidentally introduced with the ornamental plant, [[oleander]].

Most accidentally or intentionally introduced species do not become invasive as the ones  mentioned above. For instance Some 179 coccinellid species have been introduced to the U.S. and Canada; about 27 of these non-native species have become established, and only a handful can be considered invasive, including the intentionally introduced ''Harmonia axyridis'', multicolored Asian lady beetle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://biostor.org/reference/56473|title= Field guide to recently introduced species of coccinellidae (Coleoptera) in North America, with a revised key to north American genera of coccinellini }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the small percentage of introduced species that become invasive can produce profound ecological changes. In North America ''Harmonia axyridis'' has become the most abundant lady beetle and probably accounts for more observations than all the native lady beetles put together.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lostladybug.org/summary-page-555.php Lost Ladybug Project&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduced plants ==
[[File:Horse-chestnut_800.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Aesculus|horse chestnut]] tree, ''[[Aesculus hippocastanum]]''. Native to Greece, it has been introduced across most of Europe and parts of North America as an ornamental plant. The horse chestnut tree is an example of a non-invasive introduced species, as while it is foreign it has naturalised and integrated into the ecosystems it was introduced to without apparent negative effects on native species there]]
Many non-native plants have been introduced into new territories, initially as either [[ornamental plant]]s or for [[erosion]] control, stock feed, or forestry.  Whether an exotic will become an [[invasive species]] is seldom understood in the beginning, and many non-native ornamentals languish in the trade for years before suddenly naturalizing and becoming invasive.

Peaches, for example, originated in China, and have been carried to much of the populated world. Tomatoes are native to the Andes. Squash (pumpkins), maize (corn), and tobacco are native to the Americas, but were introduced to the Old World. Many introduced species require continued human intervention to survive in the new environment. Others may become feral, but do not seriously [[interspecific competition|compete]] with natives, but simply increase the biodiversity of the area.

[[Dandelions]] are also introduced species to North America.

A very troublesome marine species in southern Europe is the [[seaweed]] ''[[Caulerpa taxifolia]]''. ''Caulerpa'' was first observed in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in 1984, off the coast of [[Monaco]]. By 1997, it had covered some 50&amp;nbsp;km². It has a strong potential to overgrow natural [[biotope]]s, and represents a major risk for sublittoral [[ecosystem]]s. The origin of the alga in the Mediterranean was thought to be either as a migration through the [[Suez Canal]] from the Red Sea, or as an accidental introduction from an aquarium.

== Introduced animals ==
Bear in mind that most introduced species do not become invasive. Examples of introduced animals that have become invasive include the [[gypsy moth]] in eastern [[North America]], the [[zebra mussel]] and [[alewife]] in the [[Great Lakes]], the [[Canada goose]] and [[Eastern gray squirrel|gray squirrel]] in Europe, the [[muskrat]] in Europe and Asia, the [[cane toad]] and [[red fox]] in Australia, [[Coypu|nutria]] in North America, Eurasia, and [[Africa]], and the [[common brushtail possum]] in [[New Zealand]]. In Taiwan, the success of introduced bird species was related to their native range size and body size; larger species with larger native range sizes were found to have larger introduced range sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Su, S.|author2=Cassey, P. | author3=Dyer, E. E.|author4=Blackburn, T.

One notoriously devastating introduced species is the Small Indian Mongoose (Herpestes Javanicus Auropunctatus). Originating in a region encompassing Iran and India, it was introduced to the West Indies and Hawaii in the late 1800s for pest control. Since it has thrived on prey unequipped to deal with its speed, nearly leading to the local extinction of a variety of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Sarah|title=00 of the world's worst invasive alien species: a selection from the global invasive species database|journal=Auckland: Invasive Species Specialist Group|date=2000|volume=12|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Most commonly introduced species ===

Some species, such as the [[brown rat]], [[house sparrow]], [[common pheasant|ring-necked pheasant]] and [[European starling]], have been introduced very widely. In addition there are some [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[pet]] species that frequently become [[feral]]; these include [[rabbit]]s, [[dog]]s, [[domestic duck|duck]]s, [[goat]]s, [[fish]], [[pig]]s and [[cat]]s.

== Genetics ==
When a new species is introduced, the species could potentially breed with members of native species, producing hybrids.  The effect of the creating of hybrids can range from having little effect, a negative effect, to having devastating effects on native species.  Potential negative effects include hybrids that are less fit for their environment resulting in a population decrease.   This was seen in the Atlantic Salmon population when high levels of escape from Atlantic Salmon farms into the wild populations resulted in hybrids that had reduced survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGinnity|first=Philip|last2=Prodöhl|first2=Paulo|last3=Ferguson|first3=Andy|last4=Hynes|first4=Rosaleen|last5=Maoiléidigh|first5=Niall ó|last6=Baker|first6=Natalie|last7=Cotter|first7=Deirdre|last8=O'Hea|first8=Brendan|last9=Cooke|first9=Declan|date=2003-12-07|title=Fitness reduction and potential extinction of wild populations of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, as a result of interactions with escaped farm salmon|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/1532/2443|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=270|issue=1532|pages=2443–2450|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2520|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1691531|pmid=14667333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential positive effects include adding to the [[genetic diversity]] of the population which can increase the [[adaptation]] ability of the population and increase the number of healthy individuals within a population. This was seen in the introduction of guppies in Trinidad to encourage population growth and introduce new alleles into the population.  The results of this introduction included increased levels of [[heterozygosity]] and a larger population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Sarah W.|last2=Gerberich|first2=Jill C.|last3=Angeloni|first3=Lisa M.|last4=Bailey|first4=Larissa L.|last5=Broder|first5=Emily D.|last6=Torres-Dowdall|first6=Julian|last7=Handelsman|first7=Corey A.|last8=López-Sepulcre|first8=Andrés|last9=Reznick|first9=David N.|date=2016-08-01|title=Gene flow from an adaptively divergent source causes rescue through genetic and demographic factors in two wild populations of Trinidadian guppies|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12356/abstract|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=879–891|doi=10.1111/eva.12356|issn=1752-4571|pmc=4947150|pmid=27468306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korean sculpture''' has a long history.

==Ancient Sculpture==
Korean sculpture was exported abroad, primarily during the [[Baekje]] period, to [[Japan]], where [[Korean Buddhist sculpture]]s from the seventh century still exist. Main Korean sculptures were generally made of wood, then later stone, and then ceramics, with votive sculptures being the greatest in  number. Smaller sculptures were also made using jade, gold and other metals. The greatest Korean sculptures were produced in the time of [[Korean Buddhist art]].

==Modern Sculpture==
A modern sculpture project that can be mentioned is ''[[Greetingman]]'', by [[Yoo Young-ho]].&lt;!-- Please read the article --&gt;

'''''Law's Empire''''' is a 1986 text in legal philosophy by the late Oxford scholar [[Ronald Dworkin]] which continues his criticism of the philosophy of [[legal positivism]] as promoted by [[H.L.A. Hart]] during the middle to late 20th century. The book notably introduces Dworkin's Judge Hercules as an idealized version of a jurist with extraordinary legal skills who is able to challenge various predominating schools of legal interpretation and legal hermeneutics prominent throughout the 20th century. Judge Hercules is eventually challenged by Judge Hermes, another idealized version of a jurist who is affected by an affinity to respecting historical legal meaning arguments which do not affect Judge Hercules in the same manner. Judge Hermes' theory of legal interpretation is found by Dworkin in the end to be inferior to the approach of Judge Hercules.

==Background==
Much of the twentieth century in legal philosophy has been characterized by the confrontation of legal positivism with natural law theory as being among the most prominent legal theories seen in the century. One major proponent of the Anglo-American version of legal positivism was H.L.A. Hart, a professor at Oxford University, who was a teacher of Dworkin's and whom eventually Dworkin would come to strongly disagree with. To challenge the prevailing schools of legal interpretation and legal philosophy in the late twentieth century, Dworkin invented the personage of Judge Hercules to represent a version of legal philosophy which he saw as effectively answering many of the shortcoming he had come to identify with Hart and other legal schools prominent in his time.

Dworkin's approach in the book is to present his argument in ten chapters with one summary chapter added at the end of the book titled, "Law Beyond Law". The book is original in its format compared to conventional approaches to academic studies in the law by introducing the personage of Judge Hercules early in the text to answer many of the legal theories which Dworkin wishes to discuss as to their being insufficient to meet the requirements of late 20th century jurisprudence. In Dworkin's perspective, the prevailing climate of legal theory at the end of the 20th century was understood by him as being represented by the deficiencies of many competing and contradictory legal theories being presented by the legal academy. The ten chapters of the book build their logical argument sequentially and in growing complexity of exposition where each chapter is dependent upon the logical demonstrations made in previous chapters in order to establish the rationale and comprehension at work in the mind of the legal personage represented by Judge Hercules.

==Summary==
The Preface of the book is used by Dworkin to state his primary concern in this volume concerning his approach to the philosophy of law. Dworkin states concisely: "We are subjects of law's empire, liegemen to its methods and ideals, bound in spirit while we debate what we must therefore do." The "empire" of the law is expansive for Dworkin and includes not only the domain of jurisprudence but extends fully into the domain of politics and sociology, including the philosophical domain of morals, ethics and even aesthetics as these affect the lives of all individuals of society.

===Chapter One: What is Law?===
In this chapter, Dworkin tells his readers that there are three types of law with which he is primarily concerned. These three areas of law are outlined as (a) Conventionalism, (b) Pragmatism (semantic theory), and (c) Law as integrity. Dworkin shall make a primary point of defending Law as integrity throughout the subsequent chapters of his text.

===Chapter Two: Interpretive Concepts===
Dworkin introduced his principle of the 'semantic sting' of the semantic philosophy of law. He develops and distinguishes between two forms of skepticism to present his arguments differentiating between "internal skepticism" and "external skepticism", for use in subsequent chapters.

===Chapter Three: Jurisprudence Revisited===
Dworkin informs his readers that the concept of law is the theory of what forms the ground of law. The ground of law is the basis upon which the suppositions for the working and application of law are based and form an unavoidable basis for subsequent discussion of differing concepts of law. The phrase 'concept of law' was used by Hart as the title for an approach to law strongly oriented to Anglo-American reading of positive law to which Dworkin would take exception as to its insufficiency for dealing with issues of jurisprudence encountered throughout the 20th century.

===Chapter Four: Conventionalism===
In this chapter, Dworkin begins his three part, 3-tier assessment of law with his criticism of Conventionalism. He differentiated Conventionalism as falling into two different kinds, which are insufficient, in the end, to the needs of contemporary jurisprudence at the end of the 20th century leading to the start of the 21st century. Dworkin ends the chapter asserting the failure of Conventionalism.

===Chapter Five: Pragmatism and Personification===
Dworkin rejects pragmatism here as insufficient to the requirement of adjudication requirements and legislative principles which he sees as prevailing at the end of the twentieth century. Dworkin begins to stress that contemporary jurisprudence in his view needs to hold in high esteem the values of justice as integrity, fairness and due process.

===Chapter Six: Integrity===
For Dworkin, "Justice is a matter of outcomes: a political decision causes injustice, however fair its procedures that produced it, when it denies people some resource, liberty, or opportunity that the best theories of justice entitle them to have." For Dworkin, the answerability of jurisprudence to political theory and political obligations is central. Poliltical ideals are presented as operating from a base of moral concerns which do influence what is legislated as law.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin. ''Law's Empire''. Harvard University Press. 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1625">In [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] [[rhetoric]], '''topos''', ''pl.'' '''topoi''', (from {{lang-grc|τόπος}} 'place,' elliptical for {{lang-grc|τόπος κοινός}} ''tópos koinós'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Commonplace|volume=6|page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'common place'), in [[Latin language|Latin]] '''''locus''''' (from ''locus communis''), refers  to a method for developing arguments. (See [[Inventio#Topoi|''topoi'' in classical rhetoric]].)

==Meaning and history==
Topos is translated variously as "topic," "line of argument," or "commonplace." [[Ernst Robert Curtius]] studied topoi as "commonplaces," themes common to orators and writers who re-worked them according to occasion, e.g., in classical antiquity the observation that “all must die” was a topos in consolatory oratory, for in facing death the knowledge that death comes even to great men brings comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Robert Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'', trans. from German by Willard R. Trask (New York, NY: Pantheon Books, 1953), 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Curtius also discussed the topoi in the invocation of nature (sky, seas, animals, etc.) for various rhetorical purposes, such as witnessing to an oath, rejoicing or praising God, or mourning with the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'', 92–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Methods engineering''' is a subspecialty of [[industrial engineering]] and [[manufacturing engineering]] concerned with human integration in industrial production processes.&lt;ref name="Methods"&gt;Methods Engineering [https://archive.org/details/MethodsEngineering Reference book]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Alternatively it can be described as the design of the productive process in which a person is involved. The task of the Methods engineer is to decide where humans will be utilized in the process of converting [[raw material]]s to finished products and how workers can most effectively perform their assigned tasks.&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Work Design &amp; Measurement, IE Terminology, 2000 Revised Edition&lt;/ref&gt; The terms operation analysis, work design and simplification, and methods engineering and corporate re-engineering are frequently used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Niebel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Freivalds |first=Andris |first2=Benjamin |last2=Niebel |title=Methods, Standards, and Work Design |edition=Eleventh |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0072468246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowering costs and increasing reliability and productivity are the objectives of methods engineering. These objectives are met in a five step sequence as follows: Project selection,  data acquisition and presentation, data analysis, development of an ideal method based on the data analysis and, finally, presentation and implementation of the method.&lt;ref name="Niebel"/&gt;

== Methods engineering topics ==

=== Project selection ===
Methods engineers typically work on projects involving new product design, products with a high cost of production to profit ratio, and products associated with having poor quality issues. Different methods of project selection include the [[Pareto analysis]], fish diagrams, [[Gantt chart]]s, [[PERT chart]]s, and job/work site analysis guides.

=== Data acquisition and presentation ===
Data that needs to be collected are specification sheets for the product, design drawings, quantity and delivery requirements, and projections as to how the product will perform or has performed in the market. The Gantt process chart can assist in the analysis of the man to machine interaction and it can aid in establishing the optimum number of workers and machines subject to the financial constraints of the operation. A flow diagram is frequently employed to represent the manufacturing process associated with the product.

=== Data analysis ===
Data analysis enables the methods engineer to make decisions about several things, including: purpose of the operation, part design characteristics, specifications and tolerances of parts, materials, manufacturing process design, setup and tooling, working conditions, material handling, plant layout, and workplace design.&lt;ref name="Niebel"/&gt; Knowing the specifics (who, what, when, where, why, and how) of product manufacturing assists in the development of an optimum manufacturing method.

=== Ideal method development ===
Equations of synchronous and random servicing as well as line balancing are used to determine the ideal worker to machine ratio for the process or product chosen. Synchronous servicing is defined as the process where a machine is assigned to more than one operator, and the assigned operators and machine are occupied during the whole operating cycle. Random servicing of a facility, as the name indicates, is defined as a servicing process with a random time of occurrence and need of servicing variables. Line balancing equations determine the ideal number of workers needed on a production line to enable it to work at capacity.

=== Presentation and methods implementation ===
The industrial process or operation can be optimized using a variety of available methods. Each method design has its advantages and disadvantages. The best overall method is chosen using selection criteria and concepts involving [[value engineering]], [[cost-benefit analysis]], crossover charts, and economic analysis. The outcome of the selection process is then presented to the company for implementation at the plant. This last step involves "selling the idea" to the company brass, a skill the methods engineer must develop in addition to the normal engineering qualifications.

'''Noise control''' or '''noise mitigation''' is a set of strategies to reduce [[noise pollution]] or to reduce the impact of that noise, whether outdoors or indoors.

==Overview==
The main areas of noise mitigation or abatement are: [[transportation]] noise control, [[architecture|architectural]] design, [[urban planning]] through [[zoning codes]],&lt;ref&gt;Benz Kotzen, [http://blogs.gre.ac.uk/architecture/2010/10/03/open-lecture-benz-kotzen-noise-is-an-urban-issue/ "Noise is an urban issue"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[industrial noise|occupational noise]] control. [[Roadway noise]] and [[aircraft noise]] are the most pervasive sources of [[environmental noise]]. Social activities may generate noise levels that consistently affect the health of populations residing in or occupying areas, both indoor and outdoor, near entertainment venues that feature amplified sounds and music that present significant challenges for effective noise mitigation strategies.

Multiple techniques have been developed to address interior sound levels, many of which are encouraged by local [[building code]]s; in the best case of project designs, planners are encouraged to work with [[design engineer]]s to examine trade-offs of roadway design and architectural design. These techniques include design of exterior walls, party walls, and floor and ceiling assemblies; moreover, there are a host of specialized means for damping reverberation from special-purpose rooms such as [[auditorium|auditoria]], [[concert hall]]s, entertainment and social venues, dining areas, audio recording rooms, and meeting rooms.

Many of these techniques rely upon materials science applications of constructing [[sound baffle]]s or using sound-absorbing liners for interior spaces. Industrial noise control is a subset of interior architectural control of noise, with emphasis on specific methods of sound isolation from industrial machinery and for protection of workers at their task stations.

[[Sound masking]] is the active addition of noise to reduce the annoyance of certain sounds; the opposite of [[soundproofing]].

&lt;br /&gt;

== Standards and Recommendations ==
Organizations each have their own standards, recommendations, and directives for what levels of noise workers are permitted to be around before noise controls must be put into place.

=== Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ===
OSHA's requirements state that when workers are exposed to noise levels above 90 A-weighted decibels (dBA) in 8-hour time-weighted averages (TWA), administrative controls and/or new engineering controls must be implemented in the workplace. OSHA also requires that impulse noises and impact noises must be controlled to prevent these noises reaching past 140 dB peak sound pressure levels (SPL).&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Health and Safety Administration. (1983). Occupational noise exposure; hearing conservation amendment, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.95. ''Federal Register.'' 48(46): 9738-9785.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mine Safety and Health Organization (MSHA) ===
MSHA requires that administrative and/ or engineering controls must be implemented in the workplace when miners are exposed to levels above 90 dBA TWA. If noise levels exceed 115 dBA, miners are required to wear hearing protection. MSHA, therefore, requires that noise levels be reduced below 115 dB TWA. Measuring noise levels for noise control decision making must integrate all noises from 90dBA to 140 dBA. &lt;ref&gt;Mine Safety and Health Administration. (1999). ''Health Standards for Occupational Noise Exposure: Final Rule'' (30 CFR Part 62, 64 Fed. Reg. 49548-49634, 49636-49637). Arlington, VA: Mine Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Federal Railroad Association (FRA) ===
The FRA recommends that worker exposure to noise should be reduced when their noise exposure exceeds 90 dBA 8-hour TWA. Noise measurements must integrate all noises, including intermittent, continuous, impact, and impulse noises between 80 dBA to 140 dBA.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Railroad Administration (2008). 71 FR 63123, Oct. 27, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 79702, Dec. 30 2008. Part 227. ''Occupational Noise Exposure.'' Washington, DC: Federal Railroad Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) ===
The DoD suggests that noise levels be controlled primarily through engineering controls. The DoD requires that all steady-state noises be reduced to levels below 85 dBA and that impulse noises be reduced below 140 dB peak SPL. Time Weighted Average exposures are not considered for the DoD's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense. (2004). ''Instruction 6055.12. DoD Hearing Conservation Program.'' Washington, DC: Department of Defense.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== European Parliament and Council Directive ===
The European Parliament and Council directive require noise levels to be reduced or eliminated using administrative and engineering controls. This directive requires lower exposure action levels of 80 dBA for 8 hours with 135 dB peak SPL, along with upper exposure action levels of 85 dBA for 8 hours with 137 peak dBSPL. Exposure limits are 87 dBA for 8 hours with peak levels of 140 peak dBSPL.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament and Council. (2003). ''Directive 2003/10/EC on the Minimum Health and Safety Requirements Regarding the Exposure of Workers to the Risks Arising from Physical Agents (Noise).'' Seventeenth individual Directive within the meaning of the Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC). ''Off J Eur Union.'' L42/38/-L42/44. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Approaches to Noise Control ==
An effective model for noise control is the source, path, and receiver model by Bolt and Ingard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Noise Control|last1=Harris|first1=CM|date=1957|publisher=McGraw-Hill:22-31|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazardous noise can be controlled by reducing the noise output at its source, minimizing the noise as it travels along a path to the listener, and providing equipment to the listener or receiver to attenuate the noise.

=== Source ===
A variety of measures aim to reduce hazardous noise at its source. Programs such as [[Buy Quiet]] and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) [[Prevention through design]] promote research and design of quiet equipment and renovation and replacement of older hazardous equipment with modern technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-121/|title=Prevention Through Design: Plan for the National Initiative|website=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical materials, such as foam to absorb sound and walls to provide a sound barrier, modify existing systems to decrease hazardous noise at the source.

=== Path ===
The principle of noise reduction through pathway modifications applies to the alteration of direct and indirect pathways for noise.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hearing Conservation in Occupational, Recreational, Educational, and Home Settings|last1=Rawool|first1=Vishakha|date=2012|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-1-60406-256-4|edition=First|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noise that travels across reflective surfaces such as smooth floors can be hazardous. Pathway alterations include sound dampening enclosures for loud equipment and isolation chambers from which workers can remotely control equipment while removed from noise. These methods prevent sound from traveling along a path to the worker or other listener.

=== Receiver ===
In the industrial or commercial setting, workers must comply with the appropriate [[Hearing conservation program]]. [[Administrative controls]] such as the restriction of personnel in noisy areas prevent unnecessary noise exposure. [[Personal protective equipment]] such as foam [[Earplug|ear plugs]] or [[Earmuffs|ear muffs]] to attenuate sound provide a last line of defense for the listener.

== Basic technologies ==
{{see also|Acoustic quieting}}
* [[Sound insulation]]: prevent the transmission of noise by the introduction of a mass barrier. Common materials have high-density properties such as brick, thick glass, concrete, metal etc.
* [[Sound absorption]]:  a porous material which acts as a ‘noise sponge’ by converting the sound energy into heat within the material. Common sound absorption materials include decoupled lead-based tiles, open cell foams and fiberglass
* [[Vibration damping]]: applicable for large vibrating surfaces. The damping mechanism works by extracting the vibration energy from the thin sheet and dissipating it as heat. A common material is sound deadened steel.
* [[Vibration isolation]]: prevents transmission of vibration energy from a source to a receiver by introducing a flexible element or a physical break. Common vibration isolators are springs, rubber mounts, cork etc.

==Roadways==
{{Main|Noise barrier}}
[[File:Geluidscherm Overschie.jpg|thumb|This noise abatement wall in The Netherlands has a transparent section at the driver's eye-level to reduce the visual impact for road users.]]
Source control in [[roadway noise]] has provided little reduction in vehicle noise, except for the development of the [[hybrid vehicle]]; nevertheless, hybrid use will need to attain a market share of roughly fifty percent to have a major impact on noise source reduction of city streets.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Highway]] noise is today less affected by [[Engine|motor]] type, since the effects in higher speed are [[aerodynamic]] and [[tire]] noise related.  Other contributions to reduction of noise at the source are: improved tire [[tread]] designs for [[truck]]s in the 1970s, better shielding of diesel stacks in the 1980s, and local vehicle regulation of [[muffler|unmuffled]] vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soundcontroltech.com/tire-pavement-noise/|title=Tire-Pavement Noise {{!}} Sound Control|website=soundcontroltech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most fertile areas for roadway noise mitigation are in urban planning decisions, roadway design, [[noise barrier]] design,&lt;ref&gt;Benz Kotzen and Colin English, ''Environmental Noise Barriers: A Guide to Their Visual and Acoustic Design'', Spon Press, United Kingdom (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-419-23180-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; speed control, surface pavement selection and truck restrictions.  Speed control is effective since the lowest sound emissions arise from vehicles moving smoothly at 30 to 60 kilometres per hour.  Above that range, sound emissions double with each five miles per hour of speed. At the lowest speeds, braking and (engine) acceleration noise dominates.

Selection of road surface pavement can make a difference of a factor of two in sound levels, for the speed regime above 30 kilometres per hour.  Quieter pavements are porous with a negative surface texture and use medium to small aggregates; the loudest pavements have a transversely grooved surface, and/or a positive surface texture and use larger aggregates.  Surface friction and roadway safety are important considerations as well for pavement decisions.

When designing new urban freeways or arterials, there are numerous design decisions regarding alignment and roadway geometrics.&lt;ref&gt;Myer Kutz, ''Handbook of Transportation Engineering'',  McGraw-Hill (2004) {{ISBN|978-0-07-139122-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a [[computer model]] to calculate sound levels has become standard practice since the early 1970s. In this way exposure of sensitive receptors to elevated sound levels can be minimized. An analogous process exists for urban [[mass transit]] systems and other rail transportation decisions. Early examples of urban rail systems designed using this technology were: [[Boston]] [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] line expansions (1970s), [[San Francisco]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] system expansion (1981), [[Houston]] [[METRORail]] system (1982), and the [[MAX Light Rail]] system in [[Portland, Oregon]] (1983).

Noise barriers can be applicable for existing or planned surface transportation projects. They are probably the single most effective weapon in retrofitting an existing roadway, and commonly can reduce adjacent land use sound levels by up to ten decibels. A computer model is required to design the barrier since terrain, [[microscale meteorology|micrometeorology]] and other locale specific factors make the endeavor a very complex undertaking. For example, a roadway in cut or strong prevailing winds can produce a setting where atmospheric sound propagation is unfavorable to any noise barrier.

==Aircraft==
{{Main|Aircraft noise}}
[[File:Airbus A321 (British AW) - Aviation noise.jpg|thumb|A [[British Airways]] [[Airbus A321-211|Airbus A321]], on landing approach to London [[Heathrow Airport]], showing proximity to homes.]]

As in the case of roadway noise, little progress has been made in quelling aircraft noise at the source, other than elimination of loud engine designs from the 1960s and earlier.  Because of its velocity and volume, jet turbine engine exhaust noise defies reduction by any simple means.

The most promising forms of aircraft noise abatement are through land planning, flight operations restrictions and residential [[soundproofing]]. Flight restrictions can take the form of preferred runway use, departure flight path and slope, and time-of-day restrictions. These tactics are sometimes controversial since they can impact aircraft safety, flying convenience and airline economics.

In 1979, the [[US Congress]] authorized&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979]] (ASNAA)'', 49 U.S.C. 47501-47510&lt;/ref&gt; the [[FAA]] to devise technology and programs to attempt to insulate homes near airports. While this obviously does not aid the exterior environment, the program has been effective for residential and school interiors. Some of the first airports at which the technology was applied were [[San Francisco International Airport]],&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report for the Aircraft [[Noise Insulation]] Project for [[San Francisco International Airport]]: Phase one Pilot Project'', [[FAA]] funded and prepared for the city of South San Francisco, Earth Metrics Inc., Burlingame, California, July, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]], [[John Wayne International Airport]] and [[San Jose International Airport]]&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan and Ballard George, ''Pilot Noise Residential Insulation Program'', [[San Jose International Airport]] (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; in California.

The underlying technology is a computer model which simulates the propagation of aircraft noise and its penetration into buildings. Variations in aircraft types, flight patterns and local meteorology can be analyzed along with benefits of alternative building [[retrofit]] strategies such as roof upgrading, window [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] improvement, [[fireplace]] baffling, [[caulk]]ing construction seams and other measures. The computer model allows cost effectiveness evaluations of a host of alternative strategies.

In Canada, [[Transport Canada]] prepares noise exposure forecasts (NEF) for each airport, using a computer model similar to that used in the US. Residential land development is discouraged within high impact areas identified by the forecast.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Canada [http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/standards/aerodromeairnav-standards-noise-nef-924.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the flight paths in all of [[Scandinavia]] were changed as the new [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo-Gardermoen Airport]] was opened. These new paths were straighter, reducing fuel use, and disturbing fewer people, however, vociferous protests came from people near the new paths who had not been disturbed before, and they took legal action ([[NIMBY]] effect).

==Architectural solutions==

Architectural acoustics noise control practices include: interior sound reverberation reduction, inter-room noise transfer mitigation and exterior building skin augmentation.

In the case of construction of new (or remodeled) [[apartment]]s, [[condominium]]s, [[hospital]]s, and [[hotel]]s, many states and cities have stringent building codes with requirements of acoustical analysis, in order to protect building occupants.  With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard required for exterior building skin design.  The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 [[A-weighting|dBA]]).  The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] (glass thickness, double pane design etc.), [[perforated metal]] (used internally or externally),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=William|title=Perforated metal systems sound absorbing surfaces|journal=Construction Specifier|date=February 2007|url=http://www.ssaacoustics.com/newspublications/perforated%20metal%20systems%20as%20sound%20absorbative%20surf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  roof material, caulking standards, [[chimney]] baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, [[attic]] [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] ports, and mounting of through-the-wall air conditioners.

Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal types of transmission.  Firstly, airborne sound travels through walls or floor and ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems.  Human activities might include voice, noise from amplified sound systems, or  animal noise.  Mechanical systems are [[elevator]] systems, [[boiler]]s, [[refrigeration]] or [[air conditioning]] systems, [[Electrical generator|generator]]s and trash compactors.  [[Aerodynamic]] sources include fans, pneumatics, and combustion.  Noise control for aerodynamic sources include [[air nozzle|quiet air nozzles]], [[muffler|pneumatic silencers]] and [[Quiet PC#Fans|quiet fan technology]].  Since many mechanical sounds are inherently loud, the principal design element is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards,&lt;ref&gt;Cyril M. Harris, ''Noise Control in Buildings: A Practical Guide for Architects and Engineers'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; (typically [[Sound transmission class]] of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.

The second type of interior sound is called Impact Insulation Class (IIC) transmission.  This effect arises not from [[airborne transmission]], but rather from transmission of sound through the building itself.  The most common perception of IIC noise is from footfall of occupants in living spaces above. Low frequency noise is transferred easily through the ground and buildings. This type of noise is more difficult to abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling on [[resilient channel]].

Both of the transmission effects noted above may emanate either from building occupants or from building [[mechanical system]]s such as elevators, plumbing systems or heating, ventilating and air conditioning units.  In some cases it is merely necessary to specify the best available quieting technology in selecting such building hardware.  In other cases shock mounting of systems to control vibration may be in order.  In the case of plumbing systems there are specific protocols developed, especially for water supply lines, to create isolation clamping of pipes within building walls.  In the case of central air systems, it is important to baffle any ducts that could transmit sound between different building areas.

Designing special-purpose rooms has more exotic challenges, since these rooms may have requirements for unusual features such as [[concert]] performance, [[recording studio|sound studio recording]], lecture halls.  In these cases [[reverberation]] and reflection must be analyzed in order to not only quiet the rooms, but to prevent echo effects from occurring.  In these situations special [[sound baffle]]s and sound absorptive lining materials may be specified to dampen unwanted effects.

===Materials===
Acoustical wall and ceiling panels can be constructed of many different materials and finishes. The ideal acoustical panels are those without a face or finish material that interferes with the acoustical infill or substrate.  Fabric covered panels are one way to maximize the acoustical absorption. The finish material is used to cover over the acoustical substrate. Mineral fiber board, or Micore, is a commonly used acoustical substrate. Finish materials often consist of fabric, wood or metal. Fabric can be wrapped around substrates to create what is referred to as a "pre-fabricated panel" if laid onto a wall, and require no modifications. Such fabrics are generally acoustically 'transparent, meaning that they do not impede a sound wave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technature.ca Technature Inc. | Acoustic Products &amp; Soundproofing Materials&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prefabricated panels are limited to the size of the subas "on-site acoustical wall panels" This is constructed by "framing" the perimeter track into shape, infilling the acoustical substrate and then stretching and tucking the fabric into the perimeter frame system. On-site wall panels can be constructed to work around door frames, baseboard, or any other intrusion. Large panels (generally greater than 50 feet) can be created on walls and ceilings with this method.

Double-glazed and thicker windows can also prevent sound transmission from the outdoors.

==Industrial==
{{Main|Industrial noise}}
Industrial noise is traditionally associated with manufacturing settings where industrial machinery produces intense sound levels,&lt;ref&gt;Randall F Barron and Barron F Barron, ''[[Industrial noise|Industrial Noise]] Control and Acoustics'', Marcel Dekker, New York (2002) {{ISBN|978-0-8247-0701-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; often upwards of 85 decibels.  While this circumstance is the most dramatic, there are many other work environments where sound levels may lie in the range of 70 to 75 decibels, entirely composed of office equipment, music, public address systems, and even exterior noise intrusion. Either type of environment may result in [[noise health effects]] if the sound intensity and exposure time is too great.

In the case of industrial equipment, the most common techniques for noise protection of workers consist of shock mounting source equipment, creation of [[acrylic glass]] or other solid barriers, and provision of [[earplug|ear protection equipment]]. In certain cases the machinery itself can be re-designed to operate in a manner less prone to produce grating, grinding, frictional, or other motions that induce sound emissions. In recent years, [[Buy Quiet]] programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html CDC - Buy Quiet - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of more conventional office environments, the techniques in architectural acoustics discussed above may apply. Other solutions may involve researching the quietest models of office equipment, particularly printers and photocopy machines.  [[Impact printer]]s and other equipment were often fitted with "acoustic hoods", enclosures to reduce emitted noise. One source of annoying, if not loud, sound level emissions are lighting fixtures (notably older fluorescent globes).  These fixtures can be retrofitted or analyzed to see whether [[over-illumination]] is present, a common office environment issue. If over-illumination is occurring, de-lamping or reduced light bank usage may apply. Photographers can quieten noisy still cameras on a film set using [[sound blimp]]s.

==Commercial==
Reductions in cost of technology have allowed noise control technology to be used not only in performance facilities and recording studios, but also in noise-sensitive small businesses such as restaurants.&lt;ref name=SFGate20120513&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/High-tech-system-lets-restaurant-set-noise-level-3554029.php |title=High-tech system lets restaurant set noise level |last=Finz |first=Stacy |date=May 13, 2012 |website=San Francisco Chronicle |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6I9oil12S?url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/High-tech-system-lets-restaurant-set-noise-level-3554029.php |archivedate=July 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acoustically absorbent materials such as fiberglass duct liner, wood fiber panels and recycled denim jeans serve as artwork-bearing canvasses in environments in which aesthetics are important.&lt;ref name=SFGate20120513/&gt;

Using a combination of sound absorption materials, arrays of microphones and speakers, and a digital processor, a restaurant operator can use a tablet computer to selectively control noise levels at different places in the restaurant: the microphone arrays pick up sound and send it to the digital processor, which controls the speakers to output sound signals on command.&lt;ref name=SFGate20120513/&gt;

==Urban planning==
Communities may use zoning codes to isolate noisy urban activities from areas that should be protected from such unhealthy exposures and to establish noise standards in areas that may not be conducive to such isolation strategies. Because low-income neighborhoods are often at greater risk of noise pollution, the establishment of such zoning codes is often an environmental justice issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Identifying the Vulnerable Groups|url = http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/issues/vulnerable-groups.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed use areas present especially difficult conflicts that require special attention to the need to protect people from the harmful effects of noise pollution.  Noise is generally one consideration in an [[environmental impact statement]], if applicable (such as transportation system construction).

==Technologies and practices==
Skilled [[software]] engineers use technologies and practices from a variety of fields to improve their productivity in creating software and to improve the quality of the delivered product.

=== Software applications ===
[[Software]] engineers build [[software]] ([[Application software|applications]], [[operating systems]], [[system software]]) that people use.

Applications influence software engineering by pressuring developers to solve problems in new ways. For example, consumer software emphasizes low cost, medical software emphasizes high quality, and Internet commerce software emphasizes rapid development.

*[[Engineering]] All traditional engineering branches use software extensively. Engineers use spreadsheets, more than they ever used calculators. Engineers use custom software [[tool]]s to design, analyze, and simulate their own projects, like bridges and power lines. These projects resemble software in many respects, because the work exists as [[electronic document]]s and goes through analysis, [[design]], [[implementation]], and testing phases. Software tools for engineers use the tenets of computer science; as well as the tenets of calculus, physics, and chemistry.

'''Painting in Space''' ("Les Peintures dans l`espace" in French) is an [[art movement]] that was invented by [[Yervand Kochar]] in the 1930s in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://armenianweekly.com/2010/11/14/komitas-and-kochar-the-music-and-image-of-undefeated-spirit/|title=Komitas and Kochar: The Music and Image of Undefeated Spirit|date=2010-11-14|work=The Armenian Weekly|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement syntheses all the possibilities of painting, graphic and sculpture. 

== About ==
Painting in Space consists of different metal panels with various paintings. With the help of an engine situated in the base of the figure it is being viewed in slow motion. This way [[Yervand Kochar]] shows how in time separate space elements become one, breaking the boundaries of time and space. It is not a sculpture, but painting in motion. Kochar proposes to expand the possibilities of visual thinking, introducing motion into frozen forms, blending painting with the plasticity of three-dimensional geometric forms.

One work of the Painting in Space works, aptly named ''Les Peintures dans l`espace'', (1934) by [[Yervand Kochar]], is being exhibited and in the permanent collection at [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]] since 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cej9p9e/rgkBe7|title=Collection: Peinture dans l'espace|last=|first=|date=|work=Le Centre Pompidou|access-date=2017-03-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In photosynthesis, '''state transitions''' are rearrangements of the [[photosynthetic apparatus]] which occur on short time-scales (seconds to minutes).  The effect is prominent in cyanobacteria, whereby the [[phycobilisome]] [[light-harvesting complex|light-harvesting antenna]] complexes alter their preference for [[Förster resonance energy transfer|transfer of excitation energy]] between the two [[photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction centers]], [[PS I]] and [[PS II]].&lt;ref name="Biggins1989" /&gt;  This shift helps to minimize [[photoinhibition|photodamage]] caused by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) under stressful conditions such as high light, but may also be used to offset imbalances between the rates of generating [[biological reductant|reductant]] and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

The phenomenon was first discovered in unicellular [[green algae]],&lt;ref name="Bonaventura1969" /&gt; and may also occur in plants.&lt;ref name="Ruban2008" /&gt; However, in these organisms it occurs by a different mechanism, which is not as well understood.  The plant/algal mechanism is considered functionally analogous to the cyanobacterial mechanism but involves completely different components.  The foremost difference is the presence of fundamentally different types of light-harvesting antenna complexes: plants and green algae use an intrinsically-bound membrane complex of chlorophyll a/b binding proteins for their antenna, instead of the soluble phycobilisome complexes used by cyanobacteria (and certain algae).

[[File:Talbruecke-Bruenn-4 2005-08-04.jpg|thumb|Formwork (shuttering) for a pile cap]]
A '''pile cap''' is a thick [[concrete]] mat that rests on concrete or timber piles that have been driven into soft or unstable ground to provide a suitable stable foundation. It usually forms part of the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] of a building, typically a multi-story building, structure or support base for heavy equipment. The cast [[concrete]] pile cap distributes the load of the building into the [[deep foundation|piles]]. A similar structure to a pile cap is a "raft", which is a concrete foundation floor resting directly onto soft soil which may be liable to [[subsidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbe.napier.ac.uk/projects/piledesign/guide/chapter8.htm|title=PILE INSTALLATION METHODS|publisher=School of the Built Environment, Napier University, Edinburgh 15 November 2005|accessdate=15 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030505003515/http://www.sbe.napier.ac.uk/projects/piledesign/guide/chapter8.htm|archivedate=5 May 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The mat is made of concrete which is an aggregate of small rocks and [[cement]]. This mixture has to be supported by a framework to avoid sagging and fracture while setting. This process is known as [[Form work|shuttering]] and [[reinforcing]]. The materials used are long twisted steel bars between the piles held in shape by thinner tie wires. Once this steel mat is laid, timber is attached around the perimeter to contain the wet concrete mixture. Once poured, (usually as a series of small loads), the concrete is stirred to remove any air pockets that might weaken the structure when set. The concrete undergoes a chemical change as it hardens and this produces a lot of heat. Sometimes, if the mass of concrete is very large, pipes carrying [[refrigerant]] [[coolant]] are used in the mass to assist the setting process to prevent the concrete from cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahapwd.com/training/traininghandbook/4.htm|title=EXECUTION OF WORK|publisher=Public works department - various dates|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2209">A '''platform-specific model''' is a model of a software or business system that is linked to a specific technological platform (e.g. a specific [[programming language]], [[operating system]], [[document file format]] or [[database]]). Platform-specific models are indispensable for the actual implementation of a system.

For example, a need to implement an online shop. The system will need to store information regarding users, goods, credit cards, etc. The designer might decide to use for this purpose an [[Oracle database]]. For this to work, the designer will need to express concepts (e.g. the concept of a user) in a [[relational model]] using the [[Oracle database|Oracle]]'s [[SQL]] dialect. This [[Oracle database|Oracle]]'s specific [[relational model]] is an example of a ''Platform-specific model''.

The term ''platform-specific model'' is most frequently used in the context of the [[model-driven architecture|MDA]] approach. This '''MDA''' approach corresponds the [[Object Management Group|OMG]] vision of [[Model Driven Engineering]]. The main idea is that it should be possible to use a [[Model Transformation Language|MTL]] to transform a [[Platform-independent model]] into a Platform-specific model. In order to achieve this transformation, one can use a language compliant to the newly defined [[QVT]] standard. Examples of such languages are [[AndroMDA]], [[VIATRA]] or [[ATLAS Transformation Language|ATL]].

'''Playing''' or '''learning by ear''' is the ability of a performing [[musician]] to reproduce a piece of [[music]] they have heard, without having seen it [[Musical notation|notated]] in any form of [[sheet music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/play+by+ear|title=Play by ear - Idioms by the Free Dictionary|website=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is considered to be a desirable skill among musical performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.musical-u.com/learn/topic/how-to/play-by-ear/|title=Playing By Ear: How to learn to play notes and chords by ear - Musical U|website=Musical U|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many forms of [[List of classical and art music traditions|classical music]] throughout the world are fundamentally rooted in the concept of playing by ear, where musical compositions are passed down from generation to generation. In this respect, playing by ear can be also seen as a music-specific example of [[oral tradition]]. However, there are some examples of musical traditions where greater importance is placed on a tradition of [[Writing|writing down]] the music, in some form of [[musical notation]].

The concept of playing by ear has led to the development of the idiom, to [[wikt:play by ear|play by ear]].

== Method ==
Learning music by ear is done by repeatedly listening to other [[musician]]s, either their live shows or [[sound recording]]s of their songs, and then attempting to recreate what one hears.  [[Audiation]] involves hearing sounds mentally, although on a different level than just "hearing a song in one's head". The skill of reproducing those sounds involves the ability to mentally hear and recognize rhythms, tell the interval between a note and a reference note in a melody, play a specific interval between a melodic note and bass note (typically 1, 3, or 5 intervals below the melodic note), and play the notes of a specific chord based on the a given bass note (e.g., notes at 1, 3, and 5 intervals above the bass note).

== Existence in classical music traditions ==
In most instances, those traditions where learning music from playing by ear is paramount do not use [[musical notation]] in any form. Some examples of this such as by early [[Blues]] guitarists and pianists, [[Romani society and culture|Romani]] [[fiddler]]s and [[folk music]] guitarists.
[[File:A group of musicians, North India, c.1870's.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Hindustani classical music|''Hindustani'']] musicians&lt;br&gt;(c. 1870)]]
One particularly prominent example is of [[Indian classical music]], where the teaching methods of its two major strands ([[Hindustani classical music|''Hindustani'']] and [[Carnatic classical music|''Carnatic'']]) are almost exclusively oral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itcsra.org/Indian-Oral-Tradition|title=ITC Sangeet Research Academy - Indian Oral Tradition|website=www.itcsra.org|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Western classical music ===
Historically, the [[Western Classical Music|Western classical music]] tradition has been based on the process of learning new pieces from [[musical notation]], and hence playing by ear has a lower importance in musical training.

However, many teaching methods in this tradition incorporate playing by ear in some form. Examples include the "[[ear training]]" courses that are a standard part of [[music school|conservatory]] or college music programs (including use of [[Solfège]]), and the [[Suzuki method]], which incorporates a highly developed focus on playing by ear from a very young age.

In the [[western world|West]], learning by ear is also associated with the genres of [[folk music]], [[blues]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[jazz]].

{{Refimprove|date=April 2016}}
In [[Inuit mythology]], '''Silap Inua''' ('possessor of spirit', ᓯᓚᑉ ᐃᓄᐊ) or '''Silla''' ('breath, spirit', ᓯᓪᓚ) is similar to [[mana]] or [[Aether (mythology)|ether]], the primary component of everything that exists; it is also the breath of life and the method of locomotion for any movement or change. Silla was believed to control everything that goes on in one's life.

==Description==

Silla is a spirit of the sky, the wind, and the weather. Though identified as male, he is never depicted, and thought to be formless. There are very few myths in which Silla is a character, because he is not thought to have many personality characteristics. He also represents a concept somewhat akin to the [[Hindu]] idea of [[Paramatman]], or [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]’s idea of the great [[Ralph Waldo Emerson#Literary career|Over soul]]: Silla is also believed to be the substance which [[souls]] are made of. Contrary to the Christian missionaries who have identified [[Nanook]] the [[polar bear]] spirit as the supreme deity of the Inuit, Silla is much closer to this role. However Silla also has a somewhat malevolent aspect: he is known to lure children away from their play off into the tundra, never to be seen again.

Among the many various  [[Eskimo]] cultures, term ''silap inua'' / ''sila'', ''hillap inua'' / ''hilla'' (among [[Inuit]]), ''siḷam iñua'' (among [[Inupiaq]]), ''ellam yua'' / ''ella'' (among [[Yup'ik]]) is used with some diversity.&lt;ref name="Kleivan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleivan|first1=I.|last2=Sonne|first2=B.|title=Eskimos, Greenland and Canada|date=1985|publisher=E.J. Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9004071601|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances it refers “outer space”, “intellect”, “weather”, “sky”, “universe”:&lt;ref name="Kleivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousalimas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mousalimas|first1=S.A.|title=Arctic Ecology and Identity|date=1997|publisher=Akad.

[[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|Shamanhood among Eskimo peoples]] was a diverse phenomenon, just like the various Eskimo cultures themselves. Among [[Copper Inuit]], shamans were believed to obtain their power from this “Wind Indweller”, thus even their helping spirits were termed as ''silap inue''.&lt;ref name="Merkur"/&gt;{{rp|230}}

Among [[Siberian Yupik]], {{IPA-iu|sl̥am juɣwa|}} was depicted as a mighty hunter, catching game just like earthly men, but being capable of controlling whether people paid attention to customs and traditions.&lt;ref name="Diószegi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diószegi|first1=Vilmos|title=Popular Beliefs and Folklore Tradition in Siberia|date=1997|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|isbn=0700703802|page=447|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sireniki Eskimo language]], the word {{IPA-iu|siˈlʲa|}} has meanings “universe”, “outer world”, “space”, “free space”, “weather”.&lt;ref name="Menovshchikov"&gt;{{cite book |last=Menovshchikov |first=G.A. |title=Language of Sirenik Eskimos.

==History==
According to the interpretations of [[anthropologists]], Silla is one of the oldest Inuit deities, but was recently (in the last thousand years) supplanted by [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]], (the goddess of [[sea mammals]]) and the [[Caribou Mother]] (the goddess  of [[caribou]]) when these became the major food sources of the Inuit. Anthropologists believe that the belief is extremely old because of the widespread nature of this deity.

The '''Society for Research on Biological Rhythms''' ('''SRBR''') is an international [[Chronobiology|chronobiological]] research society with three key goals: (1) to promote the advancement and dissemination of basic and applied research in all aspects of biological rhythms; (2) to enhance the education and training of students and researchers in the field; (3) to foster interdisciplinary communication and an international exchange of ideas.The society holds biennial meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/a-blog-around-the-clock/clocks-metabolism-evolution-toward-an-integrative-chronobiology/|title=Clocks, metabolism, evolution - toward an integrative chronobiology|last=Zivkovic|first=Bora|date=May 30, 2013|website=Scientific American|archiveurl=https://archive.is/eNIT4?url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/a-blog-around-the-clock/clocks-metabolism-evolution-toward-an-integrative-chronobiology/|archivedate=May 14, 2017 |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and informal gatherings, and participates in peer-reviewed science and evidence-based policymaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170123094549.htm|title=What is good quality sleep?

The society has its own official journal, the [[Journal of Biological Rhythms]].&lt;ref name="journals.sagepub.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/home/jbr|title=Journal of Biological Rhythms {{!}} SAGE Journals|website=journals.sagepub.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its journal, website, meetings and exchanges the society engages scientists of all backgrounds and nationalities. It advocates the need for funding in research areas in biological rhythms, such as sleep, and supports other research efforts such as the [[National Institutes of Health]] and [[National Science Foundation]].

== Founding and Early History ==
In 1986, Benjamin Rusak founded the ''[[Journal of Biological Rhythms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Circadian Clock|last=Albrecht|first=Urs|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4419-1261-9|location=|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rusak wanted an accompanying society that would hold meetings concerning research on biological rhythms, so he asked [[Fred W. Turek]] to organize the first meeting.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{Citation|last=ClockTool|title=Interview Fred W Turek|date=2017-01-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCwUUZpYGkc&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLsCe0pip0WjKMWbJUdD_D_71u5yj3Iw0m|accessdate=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society was officially founded on November 12, 1986 by Fred Turek, Dave Hudson, [[Joseph Takahashi|Joe Takahashi]], and [[Gene D. Block|Gene Block]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenth Meeting, Society for Research on Biological Rhythms: Program and Abstracts.'' 1st ed. Sandestin: SRBR, 2006. Web. 13. Apr. 2017. https://srbr.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SRBR_2006_Program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The society is sometimes cited as being founded in 1988, as this was when the first meeting occurred.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Colin Pittendrigh]], Turek's Ph.D. adviser, and one of the fathers of the field, was initially opposed to the society, worrying that it would have an isolating effect on the field rather than connecting it to related disciplines. Pittendrigh came around to the idea after the successful first meeting. Turek, however, believed that the field had advanced and diversified enough to justify a meeting that would unify the diverse field. Turek had been involved with the [[Endocrine Society]], a research society that was 70 years old by 1986. He thought about this well established organisation when working in the early phases of SRBR, hoping to create a society with the ability to make a lasting impact.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; The first meeting was held at the Wild Dunes Resort and Conference Center in Charleston, SC, in May 1988. The Plenary Lecture at the first meeting was given by [[Michael Menaker]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''First Meeting, Society for Research on Biological Rhythms: Program and Abstracts.'' 1st ed. Charleston: SRBR, 1988. Web. 13. Apr. 2017. https://srbr.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SRBR_1988_ProgramAbstracts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meetings ==
Meetings for the Society of Research on Biological Rhythms occur once every two years, typically in May or June. The location of the meeting is determined by the President of the SRBR with the help of existing members. Meetings typically last four or five days and are open to all registered members. The meetings serve as a forum to share the latest research in biological rhythms, with hundreds of chronobiologist from around the world presenting at poster sessions and lectures. According to 2016 President Paul Hardin, the meeting is "an exceptional forum for hearing the latest cutting-edge research, reengaging with colleagues from years past, and exchanging ideas that will shape the future of the field with a talented and diverse group of chronobiologists from around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;''SRBR 2016.'' 1st ed. Palm Harbor: SRBR, 2016. Web. 13. Apr. 2017. https://srbr.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SRBR-2016-Program-Book-with-abstracts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The last day of the meeting also features a keynote speaker referred to as the Pittendrigh/Aschoff speaker, named after notable chronobiologist [[Colin Pittendrigh]] and [[Jürgen Aschoff]]. Notable past Pittendrigh/Aschoff speakers include: Fred Turek, Joe Takahashi, and [[Michael W. Young|Michael Young]].

In addition to lectures and poster sessions, the meeting also serves as an opportunity to review the accomplishments of the society and its members over the previous two years, provide updates on the ''Journal for Biological Rhythms'', introduce the incoming administration, and officially transfer the presidency to the president-elect.

== Publications ==

=== Journal of Biological Rhythms ===
The [[Journal of Biological Rhythms]] has been the official journal for the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms since the founding of both in 1986. The JBR publishes scholarly articles, original research, and reviews on a variety of topics all centering around periodicity in organisms. The journal focuses on circadian and seasonal rhythms, but articles about other biological periods are published as well. A variety of approaches are explored by the journal including: genetic, behavioral, modeling, and clinical trials. In 2015 SAGE Publications gave JBR a five-year impact factor of 3.167 and a ranking of 19/86 in biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/journal-of-biological-rhythms/journal200933#description|title=Journal of Biological Rhythms {{!}} SAGE Publications Inc|website=us.sagepub.com |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact rating is a measure of how frequently the average article from the journal is cited. JBR is a member of the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]].&lt;ref name="journals.sagepub.com"/&gt;

=== JBRish ===
[https://srbr.org/publications/jbrish/ JBRish] is a collection of editorials and letters written by Martin Zatz while he was editor of the [[Journal of Biological Rhythms]]. These are not scholarly articles about the science of biological rhythms; instead they focus on various aspects of life in academia and science. Some pieces are comedic or satirical in nature, and others are more serious. The collectors of the pieces, Anna Wirz-Justice and Irving Zucker, describe the selections as, “wistful, others poignant or trenchant, and an occasional one offers advice. They not infrequently document and lampoon trends and human foibles.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://srbr.org/publications/jbrish/|title=JBRish {{!}} SRBR: Society for Research on Biological Rhythms|website=srbr.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newsletter ===
The Society for Research on Biological Rhythms publishes a newsletter two to three times a year. It contains a letter from the President of the society, recent developments in the field, and society business. The society business often includes programs for meetings, recent grants, and newsworthy events involving members. Recent newsletters can be viewed by non-members and can be found on the SRBR's [https://srbr.org/publications/newsletter/ website].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://srbr.org/publications/newsletter/|title=Newsletter {{!}} SRBR: Society for Research on Biological Rhythms|website=srbr.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanley John Sadie''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|d|i}}; 30 October 1930 – 21 March 2005) was an influential and prolific British [[musicology|musicologist]], music critic, and editor. He was editor of the sixth edition of the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (1980), which was published as the first edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''.&lt;ref name="Bio Index" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker's Bio Dict"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker's 20th C Classical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker's opera" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IAML 2015 Mar 26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTs 2005 Mar 23" /&gt;

== Career ==
Born in [[Wembley]], Sadie was educated at [[St Paul's School, London]], and [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], where he read music under [[Thurston Dart]]. Sadie earned [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Music]] degrees in 1953, a [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1957, and a [[PhD]] in 1958. His [[doctoral dissertation]] was on mid-eighteenth-century British [[chamber music]].&lt;ref name="Sadie dissertation 1958" /&gt; After Cambridge, he taught at [[Trinity College of Music]], London (1957–1965).&lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors Rev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Int. Authors" /&gt;

Sadie then turned to music journalism, becoming music critic for ''[[The Times]]'' (1964–1981), and contributing reviews to the ''[[Financial Times]]'' after 1981, when he had to leave his position and ''The Times'' because of his commitments to the ''Grove'' and other scholarly work. He was editor of ''[[The Musical Times]]'' from 1967 until 1987.&lt;ref name="WW in Music, Gaster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Intl WW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;

From 1970 Sadie was editor of what was planned to be the sixth edition of the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (1980). Sadie oversaw major changes to the dictionary, which grew from nine volumes to twenty, and was published as ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (''New Grove''), and is now referred to as the first edition under that name. He was also an important force behind the second edition of ''New Grove'' (2001), which grew further to 29 volumes. Sadie also oversaw a major expansion of the ''Grove'' franchise, editing the one-volume ''Grove Concise Dictionary of Music'' (1988), and several spinoff dictionaries, such as the ''New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments'' (three volumes, 1984), the ''New Grove Dictionary of American Music'', (with H. Wiley Hitchcock, four volumes, 1986), and ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'' (four volumes, 1992). He also edited composer biographies based on the entries in ''Grove''.&lt;ref name="Aughor/Gale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WW St. Martins" /&gt;

Outside his work on the ''Grove'' dictionaries, Sadie edited the ''[[Man and Music]]'' volumes accompanying a television series (1989–1993).&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He was also an accomplished bassoonist.&lt;ref name="Author's &amp; Writer's WW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WW Entmt." /&gt;&lt;ref name="WWIW Marquis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WrDr" /&gt;

Sadie died at his home in [[Cossington, Somerset|Cossington]], Somerset, 21 March 2005, of [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (Lou Gehrig's disease), which had been diagnosed only a few weeks earlier.

{{anchor|Family}}Sadie married twice. His first wife, Adèle Sadie ''(née'' Bloom; 1931–1978) – who he married in 1953 in London, and with whom he had two sons and a daughter – died in 1978. Sadie married Julie Anne Sadie, PhD ''(née'' Vertrees; born 1948), also a musicologist, in 1978. They had a son and a daughter.

==Honours==
In 1982, Sadie was appointed CBE (Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]]). He received an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] from the [[University of Leicester]] in 1982, and was elected honorary [[fellow]] of the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1994 and [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. In 2005, Sadie became a [[Handel Music Prize|Handel Music Prize laureate]].

[[File:Stellarparallax parsec1.svg|thumb|right|Stellar parallax is the basis for the [[parsec]], which is the distance from the [[Sun]] to an [[astronomical object]] that has a [[parallax]] angle of one [[arcsecond]]. (1 [[astronomical unit|AU]] and 1 parsec are not to scale, 1 parsec = ~206265 AU)]]

'''Stellar parallax''' is the apparent shift of position of any nearby star (or other object) against the background of distant objects. Created by the different [[orbital positions of Earth]], the extremely small observed shift is largest at time intervals of about six months, when Earth arrives at exactly opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit, giving a baseline distance of about two [[astronomical unit]]s between observations. The [[parallax]] itself is considered to be half of this maximum, about equivalent to the observational shift that would occur due to the different positions of Earth and the Sun, a baseline of one [[astronomical unit]] (AU).

Stellar parallax is so difficult to detect that its existence was the subject of much debate in astronomy for hundreds of years. It was first observed in [[1806]] by [[Giuseppe Calandrelli]] who reported parallax in α-Lyrae in his work "''Osservazione e riflessione sulla parallasse annua dall’alfa della Lira''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers | isbn = 978-0-387-30400-7 | editor-last = Hockey  | editor-first = Thomas | year = 2007 | publisher = Springer-Verlag New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1838 [[Friedrich Bessel]] made the first successful parallax measurement ever, for the star [[61 Cygni|61&amp;nbsp;Cygni]], using a Fraunhofer [[heliometer]] at [[Königsberg Observatory]].&lt;ref name=ZG44&gt;{{harvnb|Zeilik|Gregory|1998 | page=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hirschgoogle&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CW6tqdhVMJoC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=heliometer+61+cygni#v=onepage&amp;q=heliometer%2061%20cygni&amp;f=false|title=Parallax|isbn=978-0-8050-7133-7|author1=Hirshfeld|first1=Alan W|date=2002-05-01}} Page 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a star's parallax is known, its distance from Earth can be computed [[trigonometry|trigonometrically]]. But the more distant an object is, the smaller its parallax. Even with 21st-century techniques in [[astrometry]], the limits of accurate measurement make distances farther away than about 100 [[parsec]]s (or roughly 300 [[light year]]s) too approximate to be useful when obtained by this technique. This limits the applicability of parallax as a measurement of distance to objects that are relatively close on a galactic scale. Other techniques, such as [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] [[red-shift]], are required to measure the distance of more remote objects.

Stellar parallax measures are given in the tiny units of [[arcsecond]]s, or even in thousandths of arcseconds (milliarcseconds). The distance unit parsec is defined as the length of the [[Cathetus|leg]] of a [[right triangle]] [[Adjacent side (right triangle)|adjacent to]] the angle of one arcsecond at one [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]], where the other leg is 1 AU long. Because stellar parallaxes and distances all involve such [[Skinny triangle|skinny right triangles]], a convenient trigonometric approximation can be used to convert parallaxes (in arcseconds) to distance (in parsecs). The approximate distance is simply the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the parallax: &lt;math&gt;d (\mathrm{pc}) \simeq 1 / p (\mathrm{arcsec}).&lt;/math&gt; For example, [[Proxima Centauri]] (the nearest star to Earth other than the Sun), whose parallax is 0.7687, is 1 / 0.7687 parsecs = {{convert|1.3009|pc|ly}} distant.&lt;ref name="apj118" /&gt;

== Early theory and attempts ==
Stellar parallax is so small (as to be unobservable until the 19th century) that its apparent absence was used as a scientific argument against [[heliocentrism]] during the [[early modern age]]. It is clear from [[Euclid]]'s [[geometry]] that the effect would be undetectable if the stars were far enough away, but for various reasons such gigantic distances involved seemed entirely implausible: it was one of [[Tycho Brahe]]'s principal objections to [[Copernican heliocentrism]] that in order for it to be compatible with the lack of observable stellar parallax, there would have to be an enormous and unlikely void between the orbit of Saturn and the eighth sphere (the fixed stars).&lt;ref&gt;See p.51 in ''The reception of Copernicus' heliocentric theory: proceedings of a symposium organized by the Nicolas Copernicus Committee of the International Union of the History and Philosophy of Science'', Torun, Poland, 1973, ed. Jerzy Dobrzycki, International Union of the History and Philosophy of Science. Nicolas Copernicus Committee; {{ISBN|90-277-0311-6}}, {{ISBN|978-90-277-0311-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Bradley]] first tried to measure stellar parallaxes in 1729. The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his [[telescope]], but he instead discovered the [[aberration of light]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JARaN7Jmm9cC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=Starlight+astronomy+astrometry#v=onepage&amp;q=Starlight%20astronomy%20astrometry&amp;f=false|title=The Sky is Your Laboratory|isbn=978-0-387-73995-3|author1=Buchheim|first1=Robert|date=2007-10-04}} Page 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[astronomical nutation|nutation]] of Earth’s axis, and catalogued 3222 stars.

Stellar parallax is most often measured using ''annual parallax'', defined as the difference in position of a star as seen from Earth and Sun, i.&amp;nbsp;e. the angle subtended at a star by the mean radius of Earth's orbit around the Sun. The [[parsec]] (3.26 [[light-year]]s) is defined as the distance for which the annual parallax is 1&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]. Annual parallax is normally measured by observing the position of a star at different times of the [[year]] as Earth moves through its orbit. Measurement of annual parallax was the first reliable way to determine the distances to the closest stars. The first successful measurements of stellar parallax were made by [[Friedrich Bessel]] in 1838 for the star [[61 Cygni|61&amp;nbsp;Cygni]] using a [[heliometer]].&lt;ref name="ZG44" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bessel, FW, "[http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/gaia/documents/bessel-1838/index.html Bestimmung der Entfernung des 61sten Sterns des Schwans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624220502/http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/gaia/documents/bessel-1838/index.html |date=2007-06-24 }}" (1838) ''[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]'', vol.&amp;nbsp;16, pp.&amp;nbsp;65-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being very difficult to measure, only about 60 stellar parallaxes had been obtained by the end of the 19th century, mostly by use of the [[filar micrometer]].  [[Astrograph]]s using astronomical [[photographic plate]]s sped the process in the early 20th century.  Automated plate-measuring machines&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1107461 CERN paper on plate measuring machine] USNO StarScan&lt;/ref&gt; and more sophisticated computer technology of the 1960s allowed more efficient compilation of [[star catalogue]]s. In the 1980s, [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond.

Stellar parallax remains the standard for calibrating other measurement methods (see [[Cosmic distance ladder]]). Accurate calculations of distance based on stellar parallax require a measurement of the distance from Earth to the Sun, now known to exquisite accuracy based on [[radar]] reflection off the surfaces of planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeilik|Gregory|1998|loc=§&amp;nbsp;22-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The angles involved in these calculations are very small and thus difficult to measure. The nearest star to the Sun (and also the star with the largest parallax), [[Proxima Centauri]], has a parallax of 0.7687&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.0003&amp;nbsp;arcsec.&lt;ref name="apj118"&gt;{{cite journal

In 1989 the satellite [[Hipparcos]] was launched primarily for obtaining parallaxes and [[proper motion]]s of nearby stars, increasing the number of stellar parallaxes measured to milliarcsecond accuracy a thousandfold.  Even so,  Hipparcos is only able to measure parallax angles for stars up to about 1,600 [[light-year]]s away, a little more than one percent of the diameter of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].

The Hubble telescope [[WFC3]] now has a precision of 20 to 40 microarcseconds, enabling reliable distance measurements up to {{convert|3066|parsec|light-year|sigfig=1}} for a small number of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harrington |first1=J.D. |last2=Villard |first2=Ray |title=NASA's Hubble Extends Stellar Tape Measure 10 Times Farther Into Space |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/april/nasas-hubble-extends-stellar-tape-measure-10-times-farther-into-space |date=10 April 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 October 2014 }}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives more accuracy to the [[Cosmic distance ladder]] and improves the knowledge of distances in the Universe, based on the dimensions of the Earth's orbit.

The [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Gaia mission]], launched 19 December 2013, is expected to measure parallax angles to an accuracy of 10 micro[[arcsecond]]s for all moderately bright stars, thus mapping nearby stars (and potentially planets) up to a distance of tens of thousands of light-years from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Henney | first = Paul J. | title = ESA's Gaia Mission to study stars | publisher = Astronomy Today | url = http://www.astronomytoday.com/exploration/gaia.html | accessdate = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Data Release 2 in 2018 claims mean errors for the parallaxes of 15th magnitude and brighter stars of 20 - 40 microarcseconds.&lt;ref name=dr2&gt;{{cite DR2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other baselines ==
===Statistical parallax===
Two related techniques can determine the mean distances of stars by modelling the motions of stars.  Both are referred to as statistical parallaxes, or individual called secular parallaxes and classical statistical parallaxes.

The motion of the Sun through space provides a longer baseline that will increase the accuracy of parallax measurements, known as secular parallax. For stars in the Milky Way disk, this corresponds to a mean baseline of 4 AU per year, whereas for [[halo star]]s the baseline is 40 AU per year. After several decades, the baseline can be orders of magnitude greater than the Earth–Sun baseline used for traditional parallax. However, secular parallax introduces a higher level of uncertainty because the relative velocity of other stars is an additional unknown. When applied to samples of multiple stars, the uncertainty can be reduced; the precision is inversely proportional to the [[square root]] of the sample size.&lt;ref name=popowski&gt;{{cite journal

The mean parallaxes and distances of a large group of stars can be estimated from their [[radial velocities]] and [[proper motion]]s.  This is known as a classical statistical parallax.  The motions of the stars are modelled to statistically reproduce the velocity dispersion based on their distance.&lt;ref name=popowski/&gt;&lt;ref name=layden&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/118167|bibcode=1996AJ....112.2110L|arxiv=astro-ph/9608108|title=The Absolute Magnitude and Kinematics of RR Lyrae Stars Via Statistical Parallax|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=112|pages=2110|year=1996|last1=Layden|first1=Andrew C|last2=Hanson|first2=Robert B|last3=Hawley|first3=Suzanne L|last4=Klemola|first4=Arnold R|last5=Hanley|first5=Christopher J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21631">The traditional [[MBA]] degree (Masters in Business Administration) requires coursework and other study of business from a primarily [[Finance|financial]] standpoint, with some attention to management of people, to conventional economic theory, and to [[business ethics]]. A '''sustainable MBA''' program includes these subjects, and also study of managing for environmental and social [[sustainability]]. These programs are sometimes called "green MBAs".

==Conceptual foundation==

[[Sustainability]] in these programs is generally defined to include economic, environmental, and social sustainability, collectively known as the [[Triple Bottom Line]]. For each of these domains, sustainability means that it will be possible to continue through the foreseeable future, at least, without major breakdowns, such as

* Economic: running out of oil or other natural resources and having nothing to replace them on the scale required
* Environmental: loss of habitat, species, and whole ecologies; [[global warming]]
* Social: [[Overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]] beyond the carrying capacity of the earth; consequences of eliminating poverty within the current economic model

The [[social environment|environmental]] and [[social justice]] movements are sources for many of the issues, arguments, and research on sustainability, but the idea has firm roots in [[classical economics]].

* [[Externalities]]: economically significant effects of manufacturing and trade on those who are not part of the industry or market in question. The classic example of a negative externality is [[pollution]], while the largest current issue is [[global warming]]. The literature has identified many others, and many positive externalities, and has proposed many controversial measures to improve the balance.
* Natural resources: conventional [[accounting]], including national accounts, treats extraction of finite natural resources as income, priced at the cost of extraction, and not as depletion of non-renewable [[natural capital]]. The resources of nature come to us for free. They are of infinite value from the point of view of preserving and sustaining life, but may not be subject to trading in a market, as in the case of air for breathing, for agriculture, or for burning fuels.
* The problem of [[value (economics)|value]]: conventional economics can describe the process of setting prices in a marketplace through the interaction of [[supply and demand]], but cannot adequately explain value. (Though not for lack of trying. See [[Labor Theory of Value]] and [[Util]] for examples.) The most economists generally agree on is that an individual purchaser in a free market will only buy something worth more to that individual than the price, and that the seller values the goods less than the price, so that both sides come out ahead.
* Participation: The [[free market]] is not free to those who have no access to it.

One of the themes of sustainable MBA education is the extent to which environmental and social sustainability can be achieved at a profit, a question by no means answered fully.

Sustainability MBA programs can vary significantly from one school to another, some may stress management, some may stress entrepreneurship, others simply add a few "green" classes to their existing MBA program.  Many advise to look at a program's curriculum, history, vision, mission, and most of all, to go and attend a class before fully enrolling in a program, as transparency is espoused as core to a sustainable MBA.

The longest running fully integrated sustainability graduate school (founded 2003) is [[Presidio Graduate School]] with MBA programs in San Francisco and Seattle.

==Sustainable MBA programs==
The following are some of the current business programs explicitly offering MBA degrees in sustainability. Although many traditional MBA programs have incorporated sustainability-related topics into their curriculum, this list only includes schools offering a specific degree or concentration in sustainability areas: 

;Australia
* [[Monash University]] offers a Corporate Environmental and Sustainability Management stream within its Master of Sustainability

;Canada

==Sustainable MBA rankings==
As interest in sustainability within MBA programs has increased, so has an interest on assessing their quality and different approaches. ''[[Beyond Grey Pinstripes]]'', a biennial ranking and program survey, published by the [[Aspen Institute]] is based on the integration of social, environmental, and ethical stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. The ranking also weights significantly the extent to which students are exposed to these topics throughout their studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|title=Methodology|accessdate=2011-06-18|publisher=Beyond Grey Pinstripes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718165449/http://beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|archive-date=2011-07-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participation in the survey requires US-based schools possess accreditation; international schools must also be accredited or be recognized as leading institutions. The 2009-2010 cycle consisted of 149 participating universities. The top-ranked school with a specialization in sustainability, Schulich, is Canadian.  63% of these schools were based in the US, while the remaining 37% were located throughout 24 countries. Although survey information from all participating schools is made available online, the top participating schools were ranked in the ''Aspen's Global 100'' list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aspen's Global 100|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/pdf/2009-2010BGP_Brochure.pdf|publisher=Aspen Institute Center for Business Education|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2011-2012 survey and ranking again include data from 149 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Judy|title=The Business of Education: Why change-minded MBA candidates turn to the Institute before they pick a business school.|journal=The Aspen Idea|date=Summer 2011|pages=66–67|url=http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712011811/http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a ranking of business programs, [[Net Impact]] annually produces and publishes a graduate program guide titled ''Business as UNusual''. The guide seeks to provide information about what graduate programs offer their students within the realm of corporate responsibility and sustainability. Data for the guide come from surveys completed by graduate student Net Impact chapter leaders and from chapter member surveys. The most recent report contains profiles of 95 business schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business as UNusual: The Student Guide to Graduate Programs 2010|url=http://www.netimpact.org/associations/4342/files/2010_Business_as_UNusual_Guide.pdf|publisher=Net Impact|accessdate=26 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many MBA programs which offer sustainability degrees or concentrations also appear in general business school rankings. ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'', ''[[Business Week]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' all publish [[business school rankings|rankings]] of selected MBA programs. While the methodologies of each differ, most weight ranks heavily by employment and salary statistics, standardized test scores, and surveys of corporate recruiters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/08biz_meth_brief.php|title=Business Methodology|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report.

==Criticism==

Followers of [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago school of economics]] often claim that business has no other duty than profits to shareholders, and that business therefore has a duty not to pursue environmental and social sustainability except where it increases profits. The extent to which such actions are profitable is much disputed. On the other hand, Friedman actually did not say&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman, [[Capitalism and Freedom]]: "There is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud."&lt;/ref&gt; that the duty to shareholders was absolute: corporations also had a duty to obey the law and compete fairly. Friedman's criticism has been debunked by legal scholars (e.g., Stout 2002), who have shown that Friedman had no legal basis for his conclusion.  Corporate executives do not legally need to run the corporation for shareholders and could, in fact, operate the corporation to benefit society and environment.  The fact that Friedman misunderstood corporate governance is no surprise as it was not his area of expertise, and the fact that the NYT Magazine allowed the mistake is not a surprise as it is not a double blind peer reviewed academic journal.

The debate must then turn to the question of what laws may properly be placed on corporate behavior to prevent fraud and other forms of malfeasance, and to ensure open and free competition, with what enforcement mechanisms. Also, whether corporate lobbying for subsidies and other legally-mandated advantages is fair, given that it is economically inefficient and indeed harmful. This question turns in part on the honesty and effectiveness of governments, where results are decidedly mixed. It also turns in part on the honesty and effectiveness of public pressure groups. Results there are also decidedly mixed.

Criticism of sustainable or "green MBAs" has also been heard from environmentalists and social activists. Some complain of corporate [[greenwashing]], that is, of companies pretending to be sustainable or green by hiring graduates of these programs when the companies really are not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinktosustain.com/greenzone/2011/04/green-dialogues-with-giselle-weybrecht-author-the-sustainable-mba/ ThinktoSustain.com Interviews Giselle Weybrecht, Author of "The Sustainable MBA"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024190353/http://thinktosustain.com/greenzone/2011/04/green-dialogues-with-giselle-weybrecht-author-the-sustainable-mba/ |date=2011-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some complain that the programs themselves are not sustainable enough, pointing to weaknesses in their curriculum and core proposition.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Another criticism relates to the sustainability skills gap. A recent [http://www.edie.net/downloads/Preparing-for-the-perfect-storm--Skills-for-a-sustainable-economy/56 study] shows that business schools are too slow to adjust  and the skills gap is broadening, regardless the recent surge of sustainable MBA programs. The report states that "environment and sustainability skills will be essential to plan the adaptations needed to survive and stay competitive", businesses unfortunately are ill prepared for these growing challenges and business schools are failing to offer enough environmental and ecological education, despite the increasing demand from businesses. In line with the IEMA report, [https://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/blog/put-sustainability-first-for-innovative-business-education/ several academics] also criticize business schools emphasizing that the gap will be finally closed by those programs with sustainability at the core, which in most cases are emerging outside the business school world.

'''''The Age of Plastic''''' is the debut studio album by the British [[New wave music|new wave]] duo [[The Buggles]], composed of [[Trevor Horn]] and [[Geoff Downes]]. The name of the record was conceived from the group's intention of being a "plastic group". The album has lyrical themes of nostalgia and anxiety about the possible effects of modern technology. The titular song, "[[Living in the Plastic Age]]", views the experiences of watching media coverage of the [[Vietnam War]], while "Kid Dynamo" follows a child overexposed to media and its resulting effects on him. Described by writers as the first [[synthpop|technopop]] landmark,&lt;ref name ="Ianpeel"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Buggles Rehearsal"/&gt; the record is an electropop new wave album that includes musical elements and influences of [[disco]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[progressive rock]] and 1960s [[pop music]]. In a 1979 interview, Downes defined the album as "science fiction music. It's like modern psychedelic music. It's very futuristic." 

Horn used pre-dated technology for the album to have sounds unlike what was typical in records that were released at the time. The songs were written by The Buggles between 1977 and 1979, with contributions on several tracks from [[Bruce Woolley]]. The backing tracks were recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, while the vocals were recorded and mixed at [[Sarm East Studios]]. Mixing was completed before Christmas 1979.

''The Age of Plastic'' was released by [[Island Records]] in Australia, January 1980, and later in February in the UK. The album's release followed the success of the group's 1979 first single, "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]", which reached number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Most of the songs for the album were written during promotion of the song. Three subsequent singles, "The Plastic Age", "[[Clean, Clean]]" and "[[Elstree (song)|Elstree]]", all released in 1980, followed "Video", and also charted in the UK, reaching number 16, 38 and 55 respectively. In Europe, ''The Age of Plastic'' reached the Top 20 in Italy and the Top 40 in France, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In other continents, the album reached the top 40 most played in Japan and was number 83 on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' albums chart. It has been met with positive critical response, with some critics comparing it to other albums of its genre. There have been two reissues of the album, in 2000 and in 2010. A September 2010 performance of the album by the Buggles, a gig live at the "Ladbroke Grove's Supperclub" in [[Notting Hill, London]], marked the first time the group performed it in its entirety.

In 2016, ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine called ''The Age of Plastic'' the 45th best new wave album of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Josh (8 September 2016). [https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/09/the-best-new-wave-albums.html "The 50 Best New Wave Albums"]. ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''. Retrieved 9 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and production==

[[Geoff Downes]] formed [[The Buggles]] in 1977 in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], South West London with [[Trevor Horn]] and [[Bruce Woolley]].&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"/&gt; The trio had done rough demos of early compositions such as "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]", "[[Clean, Clean]]", and "[[On TV (song)|On TV]]", a track later included on their second album ''[[Adventures in Modern Recording]]''.&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"/&gt; Talking about the formation of the Buggles, Downes said about the demos: 
{{quote|“We’d sort out the songs at my place and do all the arrangements together. Later we’d kick the artist out of the studio and spent most of the studio time just doing different things of our own, using every moment to our best advantage. It was a big experience for both of us and after a couple of years of doing that, we had quite a few songs together... It was at that stage that we decided to become artists. We felt that it was about time that somebody started making good, well-produced pop records again. We wanted to give people something more than they already had.”&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt;}}

The Buggles were signed to [[Island Records]], who gave Horn and Downes recording and publishing contracts, and started recording their upcoming first studio album in the first half of 1979.&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ztt.com/artists/the-buggles/|title=The Buggles|publisher=ZTT.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Woolley was originally intended to be the band's lead vocalist,&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt; he left the group during the sessions to form his own band, The Camera Club, who also did versions of "Clean, Clean" and "Video" that appeared on their album ''English Garden''.&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"/&gt; When "Video Killed the Radio Star" was a huge commercial success, they had realized the problem that they had not finished an album's worth of material yet, so they wrote more during the promotion of the single, while in airport lounges, dressing rooms, rehearsal rooms and studios.&lt;ref name = "Trevor Horn bio"&gt;Whitehouse, K.M.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = "My stuff just sounded weird. I couldn’t make records like Elton John and I hated punk - I thought they were all shit musicians, although I grew to understand it in retrospect. I envied those guys who played with Elton John. They seemed so unassailable. What am I going to ever do that’s going to get close to that? I don’t have a great feel or a great blues voice. Then I heard [[Kraftwerk]]’s ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and I thought, that’s it! A mechanised rhythm section, a band where you’re never old-fashioned, where you don’t have to emote. It sounded so new and exciting, so full of potential."

Unable to make the album sound like what was typical of other records released in the late 1970s, as well as finding it boring, Horn "figured that if I couldn't get records to sound like [[Elton John]], which I couldn't because I couldn't figure out how they did it, then whatever I could do, I'd better exaggerate it." He had also wanted to "perverse things with sound, except that in 1978 and 1979, none of the equipment which would later allow me to do that was available. So I had to pre-date that technology by finding my own ways of achieving certain sounds."&lt;ref name =Guidetoproduction/&gt; ''[[Audio (magazine)|Audio]]'' noted the album's sound to be reminiscent of duo [[Godley &amp; Creme]]'s debut album ''[[Consequences (Godley &amp; Creme album)|Consequences]]''.&lt;ref name = "Audio"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9UnAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=buggles+clean+age+plastic&amp;dq=buggles+clean+age+plastic |title=Audio, Volume 64, Issues 2–6 |publisher=Radio Magazine |page=103|year=1980|date= |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the mixed to negative side, Joseph Stannard, in his review for ''Adventures in Modern Recording'', opined ''The Age of Plastic'' "sounds like unfinished business, a series of good ideas in need of elaboration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stannard|first=Joseph|date=6 April 2010|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/04035-the-buggles-adventures-in-modern-recording-album-reissue-review|title=The Buggles: Adventures In Modern Recording|work=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Marsh]] and John Swenson, writing for ''[[The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'', opined that "aside from the wonderful 'Video Killed the Radio Star' — perhaps the most successful recent example of a single where the production was catchier than the material", the album was "high-tech dreck".&lt;ref name = "Rolling Stone review"&gt;{{cite book | title=The new Rolling stone record guide | publisher=Random House/Rolling Stone Press | author=Dave Marsh, John Swenson| year=1983 | isbn=0394721071|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betty Page from ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' commented that the group "stretches uncomfortably out into the long playing medium like a skein of well-chewed bubblegum."&lt;ref name = "Sounds review"&gt;{{cite web|author=Page, Betty|date=9 February 1980|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/buggles-the-age-of-plastic-island-|title=Buggles: The Age Of Plastic (Island) **|work=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the 1999 reissue of the album, Richard Wallace of ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' wrote that the record "shows how [The Buggles] pioneered the synth-led nonsense which fused much of the decade's pop, but had little creative imagination.

Parts were reprinted in ''The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You to Read'' edited by Tim C. Leedom in 1994, and it was republished in its entirety in 2001.

The book is often used as a source by [[Christ myth theory]] proponents, such as [[Dorothy M. Murdock]],&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? T&amp;T Clark 2014 p21-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truthbeknown.com/beddru.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Harpur]], and [[John G. Jackson (writer)|John G. Jackson]].  Many of the same theories espoused in the book are repeated in the documentaries ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]'', ''[[The Pagan Christ#CBC documentary|The Pagan Christ]]'', ''[[Zeitgeist: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Religulous]]''.

[[American Atheists]] leader [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] was a fan of the book.  While modern-day American historian [[Richard Carrier]] found the book to be incomplete, he appreciated some of its points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/graves.html infidels.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Graves, often citing ''[[Anacalypsis]]'' and other works by [[Godfrey Higgins]] (1772–1833) as his source, asserts in the book that many messiah-like "saviors" were crucified on a cross or tree before ascending into heaven.

"One thing is clear — the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and what are called their early histories are not histories of humankind, but are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines."  (Higgins, ''Anacalypsis'')

Here is Graves' main list, arranged chronologically:

* Thulis of Egypt, 1700 B. C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/PanAfrikanEducation/posts/574398409318086 Graves, p. 125]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book claims that a number of these deities or god-men shared at least some traits of Jesus as described in the New Testament, drawing the strongest similarities with Krishna.  For example, some figures had miraculous or virgin births, were sons of supreme gods, were born on December 25, had stars point to their birthplaces, were visited by shepherds and magi as infants, fled from death as children, exhibited traits of divinity in childhood, spent time in the desert, traveled as they taught, had disciples, performed miracles, were persecuted, were crucified, descended into hell after death, appeared as resurrections or apparitions, or ascended into heaven.  Graves also devotes chapters to the pagan roots of [[baptism]] and the [[eucharist]], and concludes that Jesus was not a real person.

==Quotes==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Here I desire to impress upon the minds of my clerical brethren the important fact, that the gospel histories of Christ were written by men who had formerly been Jews (see Acts xxi. 20), and probably possessing the strong proclivity to imitate and borrow which their bible shows  was characteristic of that nation&amp;nbsp;; and being written many years after Christ's death, according to that standard Christian author, Dr. Lardner, it was impossible, under such circumstances, for them to separate (if they had desired to) the real facts and events of his life from the innumerable fictions and fables then afloat everywhere relative to the heathen Gods who had pre-enacted a similar history. Two reasons are thus furnished for their constructing a history of Christ almost identical with that of other Gods, as shown in chapters XXX., XXXI. and XXXII. of this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Kersey|authorlink=Kersey Graves|title=The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors: Or, Christianity Before Christ, Containing New, Startling, and Extraordinary Revelations in Religious History, which Disclose the Oriental Origin of All the Doctrines, Principles, Precepts, and Miracles of the Christian New Testament, and Furnishing a Key for Unlocking Many of Its Sacred Mysteries, Besides Comprising the History of 16 Heathen Crucified Gods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGAwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA22|year=1875|publisher=Freethought Press|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==

American historian [[Richard Carrier]], a supporter of the [[Christ myth theory]], has written online about his concerns with ''The Sixteen Crucified Saviors''.  For example, Price argues that Graves often omits citations, uses dubious sources, mixes opinions with facts, and draws conclusions beyond the evidence presented. However, according to Carrier, there is no comprehensive rebuttal of the book, and although many of his facts are wrong, others assertions such as a December 25 birthdate among Greco-Roman sun gods are now acknowledged to be correct. Carrier argues there is a better case for the resurrection of Thracian god [[Zalmoxis]] (also called Salmoxis or Gebele'izis) and the crucifixion and resurrection of Sumerian goddess [[Inanna]] (also known as Ishtar), neither of whom are mentioned by Graves.&lt;ref&gt;http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/graves.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the result of a collaboration between over 8,000 scientists from the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission|International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission]] (IUCN SSC), along with the [[Zoological Society of London]].&lt;ref name="zsl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zsl.org/conservation/news/the-100-most-threatened-species,997,NS.html|work=ZSL Living Conservation|publisher=The Zoological Society of London|title=The 100 most threatened species|accessdate=16 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914051800/http://www.zsl.org/conservation/news/the-100-most-threatened-species,997,NS.html|archivedate=14 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was published by the Zoological Society of London in 2012 as the book, ''Priceless or Worthless?''&lt;ref name="PorW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baillie|first=Jonathan E M|author2=Ellen R Butcher|title=Priceless or Worthless?|publisher=ZoolFlyway to wintering grounds in Indiaogical Society of London|year=2012|isbn=978-0-900881-67-1|url=http://static.zsl.org/files/priceless-or-worthless-final-wq-2040-2050.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021004847/http://static.zsl.org/files/priceless-or-worthless-final-wq-2040-2050.pdf|archivedate=2012-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While all the species on the list are threatened with extinction, the scientists who chose them had another criterion: all the species have no obvious benefit for humans and therefore have no vested interests trying to save them. Iconic and charismatic species, such as tigers and pandas—along with economically important species—have many defenders, while these apparently "worthless" species had none. The title of the report, "Priceless or Worthless?", is based on that shared quality of the species.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/11/100-most-endangered-species-listed|title=The expendables? World's 100 most endangered species listed|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|date=10 September 2012|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report's co-author, Ellen Butcher, stated one of the guiding principles of the list, "If we take immediate action we can give them a fighting chance for survival. But this requires society to support the moral and ethical position that all species have an inherent right to exist."&lt;ref name="Globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kew"&gt;''Kew Magazine'' stated that, "A strong and consistent moral and ethical stance needs to be taken, they (the authors of The List) argue, that all species have a right to exist." {{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/news/kew-blogs/kew-magazine/Kew-Magazine-Blog---Every-Species-Counts.htm|title=Every species counts|last=Harrison|first=Christina|work=Kew Magazine Blog|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was released in [[Jeju City|Jeju]], [[South Korea]], on September 11, 2012, at the quadrennial meeting of IUCN, the World Conservation Congress. At the Congress, it was reported that scientists are finding it more and more common to have to justify funding for protection of species by showing what the human benefits would be. Jonathan Baillie, of the Zoological Society of London and co-author of the report, stated that, "The donor community and conservation movement are increasingly leaning towards a 'what can nature do for us?' approach, where species and wild habitats are valued and prioritised according to these services they provided for people. This has made it increasingly difficult for conservationists to protect the most threatened species on the planet."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/11/100-most-endangered-species-listed|title=The expendables?

Some of the threatened species are down to only a handful of surviving members. [[Cavia intermedia|Santa Catarina’s guinea pig]], native to a single island in Brazil, is down to its last 40–60 individuals, reduced by hunting and habitat disturbance. The [[great Indian bustard]] is threatened by habitat loss resulting from agriculture and human development, and is down to the last 50–249 individuals.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/smartnews/2012/09/the-best-argument-for-saving-threatened-species-that-do-not-benefit-humans/|title=The Best Argument for Saving Threatened Species That Do Not Benefit Humans|date=12 September 2012|work=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Elaeocarpus bojeri]]'', a flowering plant found only on the island of [[Mauritius]], has fewer than 10 surviving individuals, because of loss of habitat. The [[Baishan fir]] (''Abies beshanzuensis''), native to China, is down to five surviving mature individuals. ''Priceless or Worthless?'' describes the threats that each species is facing, along with measures that would aid their survival.&lt;ref name="PorW" /&gt;

The '''theory of indispensable attributes''' ('''TIA''') is a theory in the context of [[perceptual organization|perceptual organisation]] which asks for the functional units and elementary features that are relevant for a [[perceptual system]] in the constitution of perceptual objects. Earlier versions of the theory emerged in the context of an application of research on [[Visual system|vision]] to [[Auditory system|audition]], and analogies between vision and audition were emphasised,&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael: Concurrent-Pitch Segregation and the Theory of Indispensable Attributes. In: Kubovy, Michael/Pomeranz, James R. (Eds.): Perceptual Organization, Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1981, 55–98.&lt;/ref&gt;
whereas in more recent writings the necessity of a [[Sensory modality|modality-general]] theory of perceptual organisation and objecthood is stressed.&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael/Valkenburg, D. Van: ''In defense of the theory of indispensable attributes.'' Cognition 87, 2003, pp. 225–233, here: p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of perceptual organisation, and with it TIA, constitute a prime example of how theories of [[Gestalt psychology]]  have been taken up and kept alive in [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael (1999): ''Gestalt Psychology''. In: Robert A. Wilson/Frank C. Keil (Eds.), The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences, pp. 346–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

TIA has been drawn on in the context of music research, in the areas of music philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Charles O. (2007): ''The Musical Representation. Meaning, Ontology, and Emotion'', Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;
and systematic music theory.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Schmidt, Lüder/Schmidt, Silke/Seifert, Uwe/Gernemann, Andreas: ''Perceptual Organization and Systematic Music Theory: Musical Surface, Auditory Objects, and the Theory of Indispensable Attributes.'' In: Proceedings of the APSCOM Conference Seoul 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceptual grouping ==
Since the [[perception]] of objects implies a segregation of some parts of the environment (''figure'') from other parts of the environment (''ground''), a [[perceptual system]] will have to rely on certain features in the environment for the aggregation of what goes together. This aggregation is termed [[Principles of grouping|''perceptual grouping'' (PG)]], and the aim of TIA is the identification of conditions for the occurrence of PG.&lt;ref name="kubovy227"&gt;Kubovy, M./Valkenburg, D. Van: "In defense of the theory of indispensable attributes." ''Cognition'' 87, 2003, pp. 225–233, here: p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

PG is considered as a transformation happening between some input and some output. The input &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is considered a set of discrete elements which are distributed over some medium &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. Media are also termed ''indispensable attributes'' (IA). The output PP is termed a ''phenomenal partition'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; into subsets, or ''blocks'', E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., E&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="kubovy227" /&gt;

The grouping into some block E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in reference to at least one feature F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; from a set of features &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Kubovy and Van Valkenburg (2003) recommend the following expression for the description of a PP: "... the elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; spread over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, are grouped by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;."&lt;ref name="kubovy227" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2527">In [[telecommunication]]s, '''''transparency''''' can refer to: 
#The property of an entity that allows another entity to pass through it without altering either of the entities. 
#The property that allows a [[transmission system]] or [[channel (communications)|channel]] to accept, at its input, unmodified [[user information]], and deliver corresponding user information at its [[Output (computing)|output]], unchanged in form or information content. The user information may be changed internally within the transmission system, but it is restored to its original form prior to the output without the involvement of the user.
#The quality of a [[data]] [[communications system]] or device that uses a [[bit]]-oriented [[link protocol]] that does not depend on the bit [[sequence]] structure used by the data source.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DODDIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some communication systems are not transparent.
Non-transparent communication systems have one or both of the following problems:
* user data may be incorrectly interpreted as internal commands. For example, modems with a [[Time Independent Escape Sequence]] or 20th century [[Signaling System No. 5]] and [[R2 signalling]] telephone systems, which occasionally incorrectly interpreted user data (from a "[[blue box (phreaking)|blue box]]") as commands.
* output "user data" may not always be the same as input user data. For example, many early [[email]] systems were not [[8-bit clean]]; they seemed to transfer typical short text messages properly, but converted "unusual" characters (the [[control character]]s, the "[[high ASCII]]" characters) in an irreversible way into some other "usual" character. Many of these systems also changed user data in other irreversible ways &amp;ndash; such as inserting [[linefeed]]s to make sure each line is less than some maximum length, and inserting a "&gt;" at the beginning of every line that begins with "From ".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.jwz.org/doc/content-length.html "Configuring Netscape Mail On Unix: Why the Content-Length Format is Bad"]
by Jamie Zawinski 1997
&lt;/ref&gt; Until [[8BITMIME]], a variety of [[binary-to-text encoding]] techniques have been overlaid on top of such systems to restore transparency &amp;ndash; to make sure that any possible file can be transferred so that the final output "user data" is actually identical to the original user data.

The '''University of Colombo School of Computing''' (UCSC) is a higher educational institute affiliated to the [[University of Colombo]] in [[Sri Lanka]] providing [[Computer Science]] and [[Information and Communication Technology]] education. The UCSC was formed on 1 September 2002 by bringing together the Department of Computer Science of the Faculty of Science of the University of Colombo and the Institute of Computer Technology and considered as the leading computing higher educational institution in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=p2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ucsc.lk/sites/default/files/UCSC%20UG%20Handbook%20CS2010_0.pdf |title=Undergraduate Handbook University of Colombo School of Computing |page=02 |year=2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106035033/http://ucsc.lk/sites/default/files/UCSC%20UG%20Handbook%20CS2010_0.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Teaching of computing at the University of Colombo first started in 1967 with the setting up of the Statistical Unit as a separate unit of the Department of Mathematics of the Faculty of Science.&lt;ref name=p1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ucsc.lk/sites/default/files/UCSC%20UG%20Handbook%20CS2010_0.pdf |title=Undergraduate Handbook University of Colombo School of Computing |page=01 |year=2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106035033/http://ucsc.lk/sites/default/files/UCSC%20UG%20Handbook%20CS2010_0.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later with the initial guidance of [[Professor]] [[V. K. Samaranayake]], the Statistical Unit was enhanced as the Statistical Consultancy and Data Processing Service Center.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; Starting with this center, in 1985 Samaranayake convinced the university to set up the Department of Statistics and Computer Science (DSCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prof. V. K. Samaranayake - Contributions &amp; Services |url=http://vksamaranayake.org/contributions-services/ |accessdate=20 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213114141/http://vksamaranayake.org/contributions-services/ |archivedate=13 February 2012 |quote=Starting with the Statistical Unit and the Statistical Computing and Data Processing Centre within the Mathematics Department, Prof. Samaranayake...}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered as the starting point of the UCSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prof. Gihan Wikramanayake takes over as Director of the UCSC |date=24 May 2010 |url=http://www.itpro.lk/node/6888 |accessdate=20 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610072050/http://itpro.lk/node/6888 |archivedate=10 June 2010 |quote=UCSC whose roots come from the Department of Statistics and Computer Science celebrates 25 years of...}}&lt;/ref&gt; A batch of 50 students were taken to study computer science, through the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; In 2001, the DSCS separated into the Department of Computer Science (DCS) and the Department of Statistics (DS).&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; Finally, UCSC was formed in 2002 by the merger of the existing Department of Computer Science of Faculty of Science and the Institute of Computer Technology (ICT) both of the University of Colombo.

Samaranayake became the founding director of the UCSC.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; After his retirement, he worked in UCSC as an acting director for a short period. In 2004 Dr. Ruvan Weerasinghe became the director of the UCSC and served for next six years. Then Prof. [[Gihan Wikramanayake]] became the director of the UCSC in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prof. Gihan Wikramanayake Takes Over As Director Of The UCSC (23rd May 2010) |date=28 June 2010  |url=http://ucsc.lk/node/258 |accessdate=20 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829012937/http://ucsc.lk/node/258 |archivedate=29 August 2011 |quote=Prof. Gihan Wikramanayake takes over as Director of the UCSC...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==

The UCSC is situated in the Science Faculty block of University of Colombo. It is surrounded by nationally important landmarks such as of the Prime Minister's Office, Independence Hall, Colombo Town Hall and National Museum, as well as interesting tourists attractions such as Vihara Maha Devi Park, Public Library, Independent Square, Arcade Independence Square, Gallface Green, Gangaramaya Temple and many other churches and mosques, Floating market, BMICH, Nelum pokuna, Planetarium etc.

== Academics ==

The UCSC academic staff is allocated  to the three academic departments based on their specialization and teaching expertise. Following are the three academic departments based on the research interest.

*Department of Communication and Media Technologies
*Department of Computation and Intelligent Systems
*Department of Information Systems Engineering

=== Undergraduate Programs ===

Computing for undergraduates of University of Colombo was first introduced way back in 1967 as part of Applied Mathematics of the Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science. With the establishment of the Department of Statistics and Computer Science at the Faculty of Science in 1985, special degree programs in Computer Science was introduced. Direct intake for Computer Science was introduced in 1998 along with industry placement and accreditation of the degree program. To address the demand for IT graduates and external degree in IT was introduced in 2000. With the establishment of the UCSC in 2002 the direct intake was moved to the UCSC. In 2004 a degree program initially named ICT, but now called IS was introduced.

At now UCSC offers Computer Science and Software Engineering education under the Bachelor of Computer Science and Information Systems under Bachelor of Information Systems intakes through the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] as internal students.

The [[World Wide Web]] has become a major delivery platform for a variety of complex and sophisticated enterprise applications in several domains. In addition to their inherent multifaceted functionality, these Web applications exhibit complex behaviour and place some unique demands on their usability, performance, security, and ability to grow and evolve. However, a vast majority of these applications continue to be developed in an ad-hoc way, contributing to problems of usability, maintainability, quality and reliability.&lt;ref name="ciabe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pressman | first1 = Roger S | year = 1998 | title = Can Internet Applications be Engineered? | url = | journal = IEEE Software | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 104–110 | doi=10.1109/ms.1998.714869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tangled"&gt;Roger S Pressman, "What a Tangled Web we Weave," IEEE Software, Jan/Feb 2001, Vol. 18, No.1, pp 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; While Web development can benefit from established practices from other related disciplines, it has certain distinguishing characteristics that demand special considerations. In recent years, there have been developments towards addressing these considerations.

'''Web engineering''' focuses on the methodologies, techniques, and tools that are the foundation of [[Web application development]] and which support their design, development, evolution, and evaluation. Web application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information system, or computer application development.

Web engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas: [[systems analysis]] and [[systems design|design]], software engineering, hypermedia/hypertext engineering, requirements engineering, human-computer interaction, user interface, information engineering, information indexing and retrieval, testing, modelling and simulation, project management, and graphic design and presentation. Web engineering is neither a clone nor a subset of software engineering, although both involve programming and software development. While Web Engineering uses software engineering principles, it encompasses new approaches, methodologies, tools, techniques, and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of [[Web application|Web-based application]]s.

== As a discipline ==
Proponents of Web engineering supported the establishment of Web engineering as a discipline at an early stage of Web. Major arguments for Web engineering as a new discipline are:

* Web-based Information Systems (WIS) development process is different and unique.&lt;ref&gt;Gerti Kappel, Birgit Proll, Seiegfried, and Werner Retschitzegger, "An Introduction to Web Engineering," in Web Engineering, Gerti Kappel, et al. (eds.) John Wiley and Sons, Heidelberg, Germany, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* Web engineering is multi-disciplinary; no single discipline (such as software engineering) can provide complete theory basis, body of knowledge and practices to guide WIS development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deshpande | first1 = Yogesh | last2 = Hansen | first2 = Steve | year = 2001 | title = Web Engineering: Creating Discipline among Disciplines | url = | journal = IEEE Multimedia | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 81–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Issues of evolution and lifecycle management when compared to more 'traditional' applications.
* Web-based information systems and applications are pervasive and non-trivial. The prospect of Web as a platform will continue to grow and it is worth being treated specifically.

However, it has been controversial, especially for people in other traditional disciplines such as software engineering, to recognize Web engineering as a new field. The issue is how different and independent Web engineering is, compared with other disciplines.

Main topics of Web engineering include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

=== Modeling disciplines ===

* Code Generation for Web Applications
* Software Factories for/on the Web
* Web 2.0, AJAX, E4X, ASP.NET, PHP and Other New Developments
* [[Web Service]]s Development and Deployment

=== Testing disciplines ===
* Testing and Evaluation of Web systems and Applications.
* Testing Automation, Methods, and Tools.

=== Applications categories disciplines ===
* [[Semantic Web]] applications
* Document centric Web sites
* Transactional Web applications
* Interactive Web applications
