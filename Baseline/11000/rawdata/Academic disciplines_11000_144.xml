'''Authentic assessment''' is the measurement of "intellectual accomplishments that are worthwhile, significant, and meaningful,"&lt;ref&gt;Wehlage, Newmann, &amp; Secada, 1996, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; as contrasted to multiple choice [[standardized tests]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.wce.wwu.edu/Resources/CEP/METT/2006/Performance-Based%20Pedagogy%20Assessment%20of%20Teacher%20Candidates%20.pdf#search=%22terry%20bergeson%20reasoning%20rs%22   Performance-Based Pedagogy Assessment of Teacher Candidates] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830001238/http://www.wce.wwu.edu/Resources/CEP/METT/2006/Performance-Based%20Pedagogy%20Assessment%20of%20Teacher%20Candidates%20.pdf#search=%22terry%20bergeson%20reasoning%20rs%22 |date=August 30, 2006 }}'', Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction, June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Authentic assessment can be devised by the teacher, or in collaboration with the student by engaging [[student voice]]. When applying authentic assessment to student learning and achievement, a teacher applies criteria related to “construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and the value of achievement beyond the school.” &lt;ref name="Authentic Intellectual Work in Social Studies: Putting Performance before Pedagogy"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Scheurman, Geoffrey |author2=Fred M. Newman|title=Authentic Intellectual Work in Social Studies: Putting Performance before Pedagogy|journal=Social Education|date=January 1, 1998|issue=62.1|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authentic assessment tends to focus on contextualised tasks, enabling students to demonstrate their competency in a more '[[Verisimilitude|authentic]]' setting. Examples of authentic assessment categories include:
* performance of the skills, or demonstrating use of a particular knowledge
* simulations and role plays
* studio portfolios, strategically selecting items

According to Meg Ormiston, "[[Authentic Learning|Authentic learning]] mirrors the tasks and problem solving that are required in the reality outside of school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ormiston|first=Meg|title=Creating a Digital-Rich Classroom: Teaching &amp; Learning in a Web 2.0 World|year=2011|publisher=Solution Tree Press|isbn=978-1-935249-87-0|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This framework for assessment begins the same way curriculum design begins, with the question: What should students be able to do?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mueller|first=Jon|title=How Do You Create Authentic Assessments?|url=http://jfmueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/howdoyoudoit.htm|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the instructor answers that question, they can then devise a [[rubric (academic)|rubric]] to evaluate how well a student demonstrates the ability to complete the task. Because most authentic assessments require a judgement of the degree of quality, they tend toward the subjective end of the assessment scale. Rubrics are an "attempt to make subjective measurements as objective, clear, consistent, and as defensible as possible by explicitly defining the criteria on which performance or achievement should be judged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rubric - by any other name? |url=http://www.morningside.edu/academics/research/assessment/documents/ARubricbyanyothername.pdf |work=morningside.edu/ |accessdate=6 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529234906/http://www.morningside.edu/academics/research/assessment/documents/ARubricbyanyothername.pdf |archivedate=29 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authentic vs. traditional ==
[[Traditional education|Traditionally]], assessment follows curriculum. Authentic assessment is an example of "backwards design" because the curriculum follows from the assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mueller|first=Jon|title=Traditional Assessment vs. Authentic Assessment|url=http://www.cssvt.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Traditional-vs-Authentic-Assessment.pdf|work=Jon Mueller’s Authentic Assessment Toolbox|publisher=cssvt.org|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

One case study was presented by [[Edutopia]]'s Schools That Work series on New York based institution, School of the Future. This school stresses the process of authentically assessing students rather than focusing solely on test results or term papers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edutopia.org/stw-assessment-school-of-the-future&lt;/ref&gt; The school measures the full range of student ability through formative assessments, presentations, exhibitions, and tests that focus on authentic tasks to assess students' skills and knowledge as they relate to real-world endeavors and skills such as effective group communication and presentation. 98% of students at this school go on to college after graduating.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edutopia.org/stw-assessment&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classroom implementation==

Teachers from The School of The Future in New York utilize authentic assessment in their school and recommend that other teachers can do the same by following the guidelines outlined below:

*Write the assessment before the lesson plan
*Outline learning standards on rubrics to help to ensure rigor
*Warm students up to learning with notecard exercises each morning
*Use in-class pop quizzes to assess student understanding and inform teaching
*Give qualitative feedback 
*Ask students to reflect and assess themselves
*Use online or traditional tools to track a student’s work quality over time
&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"&gt;http://www.edutopia.org/stw-assessment-ten-lessons-get-started&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

A goal of authentic assessment is to determine if student knowledge can be applied outside of the classroom. This means that a physics assessment should involve doing physics by performing experiments and solving problems the same way that a real-life physicist would. An authentic history assessment requires students to ask questions, do independent research, and formulate answers to their questions, just like a real-life historian does.&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"/&gt; 
What else is authentic assessment meant to do?
* It engages students and is based in content or media in which the students actually have a genuine interest.
* It asks students to synthesize information and use critical-thinking skills.
* It is a learning experience in and of itself. 
* It measures not just what students remember but how they think.
* It helps students understand where they are academically and helps teachers know how to best teach them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3980">'''Biosimulation''' is computer-aided mathematical simulation of biological processes and systems and thus is an integral part of [[systems biology]]. Due to the complexity of biological systems simplified models are often used, which should only be as complex as necessary.

The aim of biosimulations is model-based prediction of the behaviour and the dynamics of biological systems e.g. the response of an organ or a single cell towards a chemical. However the quality of model-based predictions strongly depends on the quality of the model, which in turn is defined by the quality of the data and the profoundness of the knowledge.

==Pharmacy==

Biosimulation is becoming increasingly important for [[drug development]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Bertau, E. Mosekilde, H.V. Westerhoff (Edts.): ''Biosimulation in Drug Development.''
1st Edition Wiley-VCH, Weinheim 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Since on average only 11% of all drug candidates
are approved,&lt;ref&gt;I. Kola, J. Landis: ''Can the pharmaceutical industry reduce attrition rates?'' In:''Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.'' Nr. 3, 2004, S.711-715&lt;/ref&gt; it is anticipated that biosimulation may be the tool to predict whether a candidate drug will fail in the development process e.g. in [[clinical trial]]s due to adverse side effects, bad pharmacokinetics or even toxicity. The early prediction if a drug will fail in animals or humans would be a key to reduce both drug development costs and the amount of required animal experiments and clinical trials. The latter is also in line with the so-called "3Rs" which refer to the principle of '''r'''eduction and '''r'''eplacement of animal experiments as well as to the '''r'''efinement of the methodology in cases where animal tests are still necessary.&lt;ref&gt;J. Richmond: ''The 3Rs - Past, Present and Future.'' In:''Scand.J.Lab.Anim.Sci'' Vol. 2(27), 
2000, S. 84-92&lt;/ref&gt; In a future scenario, biosimulation would change the way substances are tested, in which [[in vivo]] and [[in vitro]] tests are substituted by tests [[in silico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/4031248 ''Models that take drugs.'' In:''The Economist (US)'' June 11, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the importance of biosimulation in drug development a number of research projects exist which aim for simulating metabolism, toxicity, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics of a drug candidate. Some of the research projects are listed below:

* [[BioSim]] project; funded by the 6th frame program of the European Union [https://web.archive.org/web/20110307005347/http://biosim-network.eu/]
* NSR Physiome Project [http://www.physiome.org/]
* Hepatosys

Moreover, a few software tools already exist, which aim for predicting the toxicity of a substance or even try to simulate the virtual patient (Entelos). A few of these software tools are listed below:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1642">In [[mathematics]], the '''cake number''', denoted by ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', is the maximum number of regions into which a 3-dimensional cube can be partitioned by exactly ''n'' [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s. The cake number is so-called because one may imagine each partition of the cube by a plane as a slice made by a knife through a cube-shaped [[cake]].

The values of ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for increasing {{nowrap|1=''n'' ≥ 0}} are given by {{nowrap|1=1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 26, 42, 64, 93, &amp;hellip;}}{{OEIS|id=A000125}}

The cake numbers are the 3-dimensional analogue of the 2-dimensional [[lazy caterer's sequence]]; the difference between successive cake numbers also gives the lazy caterer's sequence.

[[File:Cake number with 4 cutting planes.gif|thumb|Animation showing the cutting planes required to cut a cake into 15 pieces with 4 slices (representing the 5th cake number). Fourteen of the pieces would have an external surface, with one tetrahedron cut out of the middle.]]

== General formula ==

If ''n''! denotes the [[factorial]], and we denote the [[binomial coefficient]]s by
:&lt;math&gt;  {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k! \, (n-k)!} , &lt;/math&gt;
and we assume that ''n'' planes are available to partition the cube, then the number is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpaceDivisionbyPlanes.html|title=Space Division by Planes|author=Eric Weisstein|location=MathWorld − A Wolfram Web Resource|accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
C_n = {n \choose 3} + {n \choose 2} + {n \choose 1} + {n \choose 0} = \frac{1}{6}(n^3 + 5n + 6).  &lt;/math&gt;

A '''chronosequence''' (in [[forest sciences]]) is a set of forested sites that share similar attributes but are of different ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Edward Arnold |last=Johnson |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GfyIjLypngIC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22chronosequence%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chronosequence%22&amp;f=false |title=Plant disturbance ecology: the process and the response |isbn=978-0-12-088778-1 |publisher=Academic Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many processes in [[forest ecology]] take a long time (decades or centuries) to develop, chronosequence methods are used to represent and study the time-dependent development of a forest. [[Fieldata|Field data]] from a chronosequence can be collected in a short period of several months. For example, chronosequences are often used to study the changes in plant communities during [[Ecological succession|succession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Knops |first1=Johannes M.H. |author1-link= Johannes M.H. Knops |last2=Tilman |first2=David |author2-link=David Tilman |title=Dynamics of soil nitrogen and carbon accumulation for 61 years after agricultural abandonment |journal=Ecology |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=88–98 |year=2000 |doi=10.2307/177136|jstor=177136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of using '''chronosequences''' to study [[ecological succession]] is in the study of plant and microbial succession in recently deglactiated zones. For example, a study from 2005 used the distance from the nose of a glacier as a proxy for site age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tscherko|first1=Dagmar|last2=Hammesfahr|first2=Ute|last3=Zeltner|first3=Georg|last4=Kandeler|first4=Ellen|last5=Böcker|first5=Reinhard|title=Plant succession and rhizosphere microbial communities in a recently deglaciated alpine terrain|journal=Basic and Applied Ecology|date=5 August 2005|volume=6|issue=4|pages=367–383|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179105000356|doi=10.1016/j.baae.2005.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common assumption in establishing '''chronosequences''' is that no other variable besides age (such as various [[abiotic|abiotic components]] and [[biotic components]]) has changed between sites of interest. Because this assumption cannot always be tested for environmental study sites, the use of chronosequences in field successional studies has recently been debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Edward|last2=Miyanishi|first2=Kiyoko|title=Testing the assumptions of chronosequences in succession|journal=Ecology Letters|date=13 March 2008|volume=11|issue=5|pages=419–431|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01173.x|pmid=18341585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''closed-household economy''' is a society's [[economic system]] in which goods are not traded. Instead, those goods are produced and consumed by the same households. In other words, a closed-household economy is an economy where households are closed to [[Trade|trading]]. This kind of economy is present, for example, in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.

The production and consumption of goods is not separated as in a society with high [[division of labor]].

The closed-household economy contrasts with a [[barter economy]], in which goods are bartered (traded against each other), and a [[monetary economy]], in which goods are traded for money.

The closed-household economy and the barter economy are together referred to as ''non-monetary economies''.

The '''Cygnus Loop''' (radio source W78, or [[Sharpless catalog|Sharpless]] 103) is a large [[supernova remnant]] (SNR) in the [[constellation]] [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]], an emission nebula measuring nearly 3° across.&lt;ref name=Murdin&gt;{{ cite book

==Visual components:  the Veil Nebula==
{{main|Veil Nebula}}

The visual portion of the Cygnus Loop is known as the Veil Nebula, also called the Cirrus Nebula or the Filamentary Nebula. Several components have separate names and identifiers,&lt;ref name="seds-veil"&gt;{{cite web
  | title=SEDS Online NGC Catalog
  | work=Results for Veil Nebula

  | accessdate=2010-12-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the "Western Veil" or "Witch's Broom", the "Eastern Veil", and Pickering's Triangle.

===NGC 6960===
NGC 6960, the ''Western Veil'', is the western part of the remnant, also known as the "Witch's Broom", located at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|45|58.1}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+30|35|43}}.&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6960" /&gt;  As the western-most NGC object in the nebula (first in [[right ascension]]), its number is sometimes used as an NGC identifier for the nebula as a whole.

===NGC 6992, NGC 6995, and IC 1340===
These three luminous areas make up the ''Eastern Veil''.  NGC 6992 is an HI shell located along the north-eastern edge of the loop at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|56|19.0}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+31|44|34}}.&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6992"&gt;{{cite web

  | work=Results for NGC 6992
  | url=http://www.ngcicproject.org/pubdb.htm
  | accessdate=2010-12-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NGC 6995 is located farther south at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|57|10.7}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+31|14|07}},&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6995"&gt;{{cite web

  | url=http://www.ngcicproject.org/pubdb.htm
  | accessdate=2010-12-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and IC 1340 even farther south at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|56|12.0}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+31|04|00}}.&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-ic1340"&gt;{{cite web

  | work=Results for IC 1340
  | url=http://www.ngcicproject.org/pubdb.htm
  | accessdate=2010-12-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pickering's Triangle===
Also known as Pickering's Wedge, or Pickering's Triangular Wisp, this segment of relatively faint nebulosity was discovered photographically in 1904 by [[Williamina Fleming]] at Harvard Observatory, where [[Edward Charles Pickering]] was director at the time.  The Triangle is brightest along the northern side of the loop, though photographs show the nebulosity extending into the central area as well.

===NGC 6974 and NGC 6979===
These two objects are generally identified today (as by the NGC/IC Project and ''Uranometria'') with two brighter knots of nebulosity in a cloud at the northern edge of the loop, to the east of the northern edge of Pickering's Triangle.  NGC 6979 was reported by [[William Herschel]], and while the coordinates he recorded for Veil objects were somewhat imprecise,&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6979" /&gt; his position for this one is tolerably close to the knot at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|50|27.9}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+32|01|33}}.&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6979"&gt;{{cite web
  | title=NGC/IC Project
  | work=Results for NGC 6979
  | url=http://www.ngcicproject.org/pubdb.htm
  | accessdate=2010-12-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identifier ''NGC 6979'' is sometimes taken to refer to Pickering's Triangle,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://cs.astronomy.com/asycs/media/p/447512.aspx this photo] posted by ''Astronomy Magazine'' (accessed 2010-12-01).&lt;/ref&gt; but the Triangle is probably not what Herschel saw or what the Catalogue intended for this entry:  it was discovered only photographically, after the Catalogue was published, and long after Herschel's observation.

NGC 6974 was reported by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]], but the position he gave lies in an empty region inside the main loop.  It was assumed that he recorded the position incorrectly, and the [[New General Catalogue]] gives Rosse's object as the other knot in the northern cloud, located at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|51|04.3}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+31|49|41}}, one degree north of Rosse's position.&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6974"&gt;{{cite web

==Southeastern knot==
The southeastern knot is located at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|56|21.2}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+30|23|59}} on the southeastern rim of the Cygnus Loop. The knot has been identified as an encounter between the blast wave from the supernova and a small isolated cloud.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1086/175651 |display-authors=4 |author=Graham JR |author2=Levenson NA |author3=Hester JJ|author4=Raymond JC |author5=Petre R |title=An X-ray and optical study of the interaction of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant with an interstellar cloud |journal=Astrophys.

==Distance==
Until recently, the distance to the supernova remnant was estimated at about 770 parsecs or 2500 [[light-years]].&lt;ref name="SandT"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent studies, however, have shown that it must be closer.  In 1999, William Blair, assuming that the shock wave should be expanding at the same rate in all directions, compared the angular expansion along the sides of the bubble (visible in [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images) with direct line-of-sight measurements of the radial expansion towards the Earth.&lt;ref name="SandT" /&gt; He concluded that the actual size of the bubble was about 40% smaller than the conventional value, leading to a distance of about 1470 ly.&lt;ref name="SandT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fuse-summary" /&gt;

This revised calculation, though it involved some uncertainty and was met with some resistance,&lt;ref name="fuse-summary" /&gt; has been substantially corroborated by the discovery via the [[Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer]] (FUSE) of a star ''behind'' the Veil.  The star, KPD2055+3111, of [[spectral type]] sdOBwas, was identified as UV-bright in an image from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope,&lt;ref name=Blair&gt;{{ cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and absorption lines in its spectrum indicate that its light is partially intercepted by the supernova remnant.&lt;ref name="fuse-summary" /&gt;  The emission properties of the star indicate that it lies about 1860 ly away,&lt;ref name="fuse-summary" /&gt; giving an upper bound for the distance of the loop and supporting the previous estimate of 1470 ly.

The revised distance in turn yields revised estimates of the size of the remnant (to 90 ly, down from 150 ly previously)&lt;ref name="fuse-summary" /&gt; and for its age (now thought to be between 5000 and 8000 years).&lt;ref name="fuse-summary" /&gt;

The brightest [[Astronomical ultraviolet source|far-ultraviolet sources]] of the Cygnus Loop occur in the north-east edge of the remnant. The first flight of the High Resolution Emission Line Spectrometer (HIRELS), a wide-field, far-ultraviolet nebular spectrometer, tuned to OVI emission lines, was launched aboard a Nike-Black Brant from [[White Sands Missile Range]] to observe the Cygnus Loop, the first observed galactic OVI emission line source.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen&gt;{{ cite journal

==X-ray source==
The X-ray source Cygnus X-5 coincides with SNR G074.0-08.6 (the Cygnus Loop), located at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|51.1}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+30|41}}, observed by [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] at 4U 2046+31. This source also has catalogue numbers 1E 2049.4+3050, 1H 2050+310, and 1M 2051+309, having been observed by the [[Einstein Observatory]], [[HEAO 1]], and [[OSO 7]], respectively.

A '''dendrite''' is a branching projection of the [[cytoplasm]] of a [[cell (biology)|cell]]. While the term is most commonly used to refer to the [[dendrite|branching projections]] of [[neuron]]s, it can also be used to refer to features of other types of cells that, while having a similar appearance, are actually quite distinct structures.

Non-neuronal cells that have dendrites:
*[[Dendritic cell]]s, part of the [[mammal]]ian [[immune system]]
*[[Melanocyte]]s, [[pigment]]-producing cells located in the [[human skin|skin]]
*[[Merkel cell]]s, receptor-cells in the skin associated with the [[sense of touch]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16534">'''Dephosphorylation''' is the removal of a [[phosphate]] (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;) group from an [[organic compound]] by [[hydrolysis]]. It is a reversible [[post-translational modification]]. Dephosphorylation and its counterpart, [[phosphorylation]], activate and deactivate [[enzyme]]s by detaching or attaching phosphoric [[esters]] and [[anhydride]]s. A  notable occurrence of dephosphorylation is the conversion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and inorganic phosphate.

Dephosphorylation employs a type of hydrolytic enzyme, or [[hydrolase]], which cleave ester bonds. The prominent hydrolase subclass used in dephosphorylation is [[phosphatase]]. Phosphatase removes phosphate groups by hydrolysing [[phosphoric acid]] monoesters into a [[phosphate ion]] and a molecule with a free [[hydroxyl]] (-OH) group.

The reversible phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction occurs in every physiological process, making proper function of protein phosphatases necessary for organism viability. Because protein dephosphorylation is a key process involved in cell signalling, protein phosphatases are implicated in conditions such as cardiac disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.

==History==
The discovery of dephosphorylation came from a series of experiments examining the enzyme phosphorylase isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. In 1955, [[Edwin Krebs]] and [[Edmond Fischer]] used radiolabeled ATP to determine that phosphate is added to the serine residue of phosphorylase to convert it from its ''b'' to ''a'' form via phosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=FISCHER|first=EH|author2=KREBS, EG|title=Conversion of phosphorylase b to phosphorylase a in muscle extracts.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Sep 1955|volume=216|issue=1|pages=121–32|pmid=13252012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Krebs and Fischer showed that this phosphorylation is part of a kinase cascade. Finally, after purifying the phosphorylated form of the enzyme, phosphorylase ''a'', from rabbit liver, ion exchange chromatography was used to identify phosphoprotein phosphatase I and II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khandelwal|first=RL|author2=Vandenheede, JR |author3=Krebs, EG |title=Purification, properties, and substrate specificities of phosphoprotein phosphatase(s) from rabbit liver.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Aug 25, 1976|volume=251|issue=16|pages=4850–8|pmid=8449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the discovery of these dephosphorylating proteins, the reversible nature of  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation has been associated with a broad range of functional proteins, primarily enzymatic, but also including nonenzymatic proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid38740"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krebs EG, Beavo JA |title=Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of enzymes |journal=Annu.

Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of hydroxyl groups belonging to neutral but polar [[amino acids]] such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine within specific target proteins is a fundamental part of the regulation of every physiologic process. Phosphorylation involves the covalent modification of the hydroxyl with a phosphate group through the nucleophilic attack of the alpha phosphate in ATP by the oxygen in the hydroxyl. Dephosphorylation involves removal of the phosphate group through a hydration reaction by addition of a molecule of water and release of the original phosphate group, regenerating the hydroxyl. Both processes are reversible and either mechanism can be used to activate or deactivate a protein. Phosphorylation of a protein produces many biochemical effects, such as changing its conformation to alter its binding to a specific ligand to increase or reduce its activity. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can be used on all types of substrates, such as structural proteins, enzymes, membrane channels, signaling molecules, and other [[kinases]] and phosphatases. The sum of these processes is referred to as phosphoregulation.&lt;ref name="pmid19547744"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beltrao P, Trinidad JC, Fiedler D |title=Evolution of phosphoregulation: comparison of phosphorylation patterns across yeast species |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=e1000134 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19547744 |pmc=2691599 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000134 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deregulation of phosphorylation can lead to disease.&lt;ref name="pmid21904669"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bononi A, Agnoletto C, De Marchi E |title=Protein kinases and phosphatases in the control of cell fate |journal=Enzyme Res |volume=2011 |issue= |pages=329098 |year=2011 |pmid=21904669 |pmc=3166778 |doi=10.4061/2011/329098 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-translational modification===
During the synthesis of proteins, polypeptide chains, which are created by ribosomes translating mRNA, must be processed before assuming a mature conformation. The dephosphorylation of proteins is a mechanism for modifying behavior of a protein, often by activating or inactivating an [[enzyme]]. Components of the protein synthetic apparatus also undergo phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and thus regulate the rates of protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="pmid2349232"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Celis JE, Madsen P, Ryazanov AG |title=Increased phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 during mitosis in transformed human amnion cells correlates with a decreased rate of protein synthesis |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=87 |issue=11 |pages=4231–5 |date=June 1990 |pmid=2349232 |pmc=54082 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.87.11.4231|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of postranslational modifications, phosphate groups may be removed from serine, threonine, or tyrosine. As such, pathways of intracellular signal transduction depend on sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a wide variety of proteins.

===ATP===
{{Main|adenosine triphosphate}}
{{See also|#Role of dephosphorylation in disease|l1=Role of dephosphorylation in disease}}

: ATP&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⟶ ADP&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; + HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Adenosine triphosphate]], or ATP, acts as a free energy "currency" in all living organisms. In a spontaneous dephosphorylation reaction 30.5 kJ/mol is released, which is harnessed to drive cellular reactions. Overall, nonspontaneous reactions coupled to the dephosphorylation of ATP are spontaneous, due to the negative free energy change of the coupled reaction. This is important in driving oxidative phosphorylation. ATP is dephosphorylated to ADP and inorganic phosphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casiday|first=Rachel|title=Energy for the Body: Oxidative Phosphorylation|url=http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/LabTutorials/Cytochromes/cytochromes.html|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the cellular level, the dephosphorylation of ATPases determines the flow of ions into and out of the cell. Proton pump inhibitors are a class of drug that acts directly on ATPases of the gastrointestinal tract.

===Dephosphorylation in other reactions===
Other molecules besides ATP undergo dephosphorylation as part of other biological systems. Different compounds produce different free energy changes as a result of dephosphorylation.&lt;ref name="Ox phosphorylation site"&gt;{{cite web|last=Casiday|first=Rachel|title=Oxidation-Reduction Reactions Experiment|url=http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/LabTutorials/Cytochromes/cytochromes.html|work=Energy for the Body: Oxidative Phosphorylation|publisher=Department of Chemistry, Washington University|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psilocybin also relies on dephosphorylation to be metabolized into psilocin and further eliminated. No information on psilocybin's effect on the change in free energy is currently available.

===Importance of Dephosphorylation in Photosystem II===
The first protein complex of the [[photosynthesis]] component [[light-dependent reactions]] is referred to as [[photosystem II]]. The complex utilizes an enzyme to capture photons of light, providing the greater photosynthesis process with all of the electrons needed to produce ATP. Photosystem II is particularly temperature sensitive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamauchi|first=Yasuo|title=Plants switch photosystem at high temperature to protect photosystem II|journal=Nature Precedings|date=29 July 2011|url=http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6168/version/1/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and desphosphorylation has been implicated as a driver of plasticity in responding to varied temperature. Accelerated protein dephosphorylation in photosynthetic thylakoid membranes occurs at elevated temperatures, directly impacting the desphosphorylation of key proteins within the photosystem II complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rokka|first=A|author2=Aro, EM |author3=Herrmann, RG |author4=Andersson, B |author5= Vener, AV |title=Dephosphorylation of photosystem II reaction center proteins in plant photosynthetic membranes as an immediate response to abrupt elevation of temperature.|journal=Plant Physiology|date=Aug 2000|volume=123|issue=4|pages=1525–36|pmid=10938368|doi=10.1104/pp.123.4.1525 |pmc=59108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of dephosphorylation in disease==

===Pathology===

Excessive dephosphorylation of the membrane ATPases and proton pumps in the gastrointestinal tract leads to higher secretory rates of caustic peptic acids. These result in heartburn and esophagitis. In combination with ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection, peptic ulcer disease is caused by the elevated pH dephosphorylation elicits.&lt;ref name="Robinson 709-15"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=M|title=Proton pump inhibitors: update on their role in acid-related gastrointestinal diseases.|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|date=Jun 2005|volume=59|issue=6|pages=709–15|pmid=15924600|doi=10.1111/j.1368-5031.2005.00517.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The microtubule-associated protein [[tau]] is abnormally hyperphosphorylated when isolated from the brain of patients who suffer from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. This is due to the dysfunction of dephosphorylation mechanisms at specific amino acids on the tau protein. Tau dephosphorylation is catalysed by protein phosphatase-2A and phosphatase-2B. Deficiency or modification of one or both proteins may be involved in abnormal phosphorylation of tau in Alzheimer's disease&lt;ref name="pmid7838376"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gong CX, Grundke-Iqbal I, Iqbal K |title=Dephosphorylation of Alzheimer's disease abnormally phosphorylated tau by protein phosphatase-2A |journal=Neuroscience |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=765–72 |date=August 1994 |pmid=7838376 |doi= 10.1016/0306-4522(94)90400-6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dephosphorylation has also been linked to [[cardiac disease]], particularly the alteration of actin-myosin interactions that are key for providing the underlying force of a heartbeat. Dephosphorylation is a key part of the myosin cycling kinetics that directly control the actin-myosin interactions. When the dephosphorylation process is interrupted,  calcium dependent cardiac contraction is impaired or fully disabled.&lt;ref name="pmid22426213"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sheikh F, Ouyang K, Campbell SG |title=Mouse and computational models link Mlc2v dephosphorylation to altered myosin kinetics in early cardiac disease |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=1209–21 |date=April 2012 |pmid=22426213 |pmc=3314469 |doi=10.1172/JCI61134 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also suggested that modifications to dephosphorylation impact physiological processes implicated in [[Diabetes mellitus]]. The kinetics of dephosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1/2, Akt, and ERK1/2, phosphoproteins are shown to be involved in insulin receptor signaling, and ''in vitro'' models demonstrate that changes to dephosphorylation kinetics impact upstream and downstream insulin stimulation.&lt;ref name="pmid17068339"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhande R, Zhang W, Zheng Y |title=Dephosphorylation by default, a potential mechanism for regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1/2, Akt, and ERK1/2 |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=281 |issue=51 |pages=39071–80 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17068339 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M605251200 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatments===
Inhibition of proton pumps&lt;ref name="Robinson 709-15"/&gt; significantly decreases the acidity of the gastrointestinal tract, reducing the symptoms of acid-related diseases. The resulting change in pH decreases survival of the bacteria ''H.pylori'', a major cause of peptic ulcer disease. Once the proton pump inhibitor eradicates this bacteria within the gut, reversing erosive reflux.
Treating heart disease has improved with the use of drugs that inhibit [[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMPK]] via dephosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=DS|author2=Summers, RJ |author3=Bengtsson, T |title=Regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase activity by G-protein coupled receptors: potential utility in treatment of diabetes and heart disease.|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|date=Sep 2008|volume=119|issue=3|pages=291–310|pmid=18606183|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2008.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In the treatment of diabetes, [[sulfonylurea]] drugs are able to stimulate dephosphorylation of the glucose transporter [[GLUT4]], decreasing insulin resistance and increasing and glucose utilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Müller|first=G|author2=Wied, S|title=The sulfonylurea drug, glimepiride, stimulates glucose transport, glucose transporter translocation, and dephosphorylation in insulin-resistant rat adipocytes in vitro.|journal=Diabetes|date=Dec 1993|volume=42|issue=12|pages=1852–67|pmid=8243832|doi=10.2337/diabetes.42.12.1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research applications==
Dephosphorylation can play a key role in molecular biology, particularly [[Molecular cloning|cloning]] using [[restriction enzymes]]. The cut ends of a [[Cloning vector|vector]] may re-ligate during a ligation step due to phosphorylation. By using a desphosphorylating phosphatase, re-ligation can be avoided.&lt;ref name="Cloning manual"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sambrook|first=J|title=Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual|year=1989|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|edition=2nd|author2=Fritsch, E.F.|author3=Maniatis, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alkaline phosphatases are often sourced naturally, most commonly from calf intestine, and are abbreviated as [[Calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase|CIP]].&lt;ref name="pmid19838171"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Makovets S, Blackburn EH |title=DNA damage signalling prevents deleterious telomere addition at DNA breaks |journal=Nat.

'''Digital pathology''' is an image-based information environment which is enabled by computer technology that allows for the management of information generated from a digital slide. Digital pathology is enabled in part by [[virtual microscopy]], which is the practice of converting glass slides into digital slides that can be viewed, managed, shared and analyzed on a computer monitor. With the advent of Whole-Slide Imaging, the field of digital pathology has exploded and is currently regarded as one of the most promising avenues of diagnostic medicine in order to achieve even better, faster and cheaper  diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of cancer and other important diseases.

==Potential==

In pathology, trained pathologists look at tissue slides under a microscope.  The tissue on those slides may be subjected to [[staining]] to highlight structures.  When those slides are digitized, they then have the potential to be shared (tele-pathology) and numerically analyzed using computer algorithms.  Algorithms can be used to automate the manual counting of structures, or for classifying the condition of tissue such as is used in grading tumors. This could reduce human error and improve accuracy of diagnoses.  Digital slides are also, by nature, easier to share than physical slides.  This increases potential for using data for education and consultations between two or more experts.

==Challenges==

Digital pathology has been approved by the FDA for primary diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm552742.htm | title=FDA allows marketing of first whole slide imaging system for digital pathology
 |accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approval was based on a multi-center study of 1,992 cases in which whole-slide imaging was shown to be non-inferior to microscopy across a wide range of surgical pathology specimens, sample types and stains &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000948 | title = Whole slide imaging versus microscopy for primary diagnosis in surgical pathology: a multicenter randomized blinded noninferiority study of 1992 cases (pivotal study). | journal = American Journal of Surgical Pathology | volume = Epub ahead of print | year = 2017 | last1 = Mukhopadhyay | first1 = Sanjay | last2 = Feldman | first2 = Michael | last3 = Abels | first3 = Esther|pmid=28961557 | pmc=5737464 | pages=39–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; But unlike digital radiology where the elimination of film made return on investment (ROI) clear, the ROI on digital pathology equipment is less obvious.  The strongest ROI justification includes improved quality of healthcare, increased efficiency for pathologists, and reduced costs in handling glass slides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sectra.com/medical/pathology/resources/articles/How_to_build_digital_pathology_business_case.html|publisher=Sectra Medical Systems| title = How to  Build a Business Case to Justify the Investment in Digital Pathology |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The roots of digital pathology go back to the 1960s, when first telepathology experiments took place. Later in the 1990s the principle of virtual microscopy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1997 |last1=Ferreira |first1=R |last2=Moon |first2=J |last3=Humphries |first3=J |last4=Sussman |first4=A 
| first5 = J | last5 = Saltz | first6 = R   | last6 = Miller  | first7 = A  | last7 = Demarzo | title=The virtual microscope |volume=45 |pages=449–453 | journal=Romanian journal of morphology and embryology | pmc=2233368 | pmid=9357666}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in several life science research areas. At the turn of the century the scientific community more and more agreed on the term ”digital pathology” to denote digitization efforts in pathology. However in 2000 the technical requirements (scanner, storage, network) were still a limited factor for a broad dissemination of digital pathology concepts. Over the last 5 years this changed as new powerful and affordable scanner technology as well as mass / cloud storage technologies appeared on the market. The field of Radiology has undergone the digital transformation almost 15 years ago, not because radiology is more advanced, but there are fundamental differences between digital images in radiology and digital pathology: The image source in radiology is the (alive) patient, and today in most cases the image is even primarily captured in digital format. In pathology the scanning is done from preserved and processed specimens, for retrospective studies even from slides stored in a biobank. Besides this difference in pre-analytics and metadata content, the required storage in digital pathology is two to three orders of magnitude higher than in radiology. However, the advantages anticipated through digital pathology are similar to those in radiology:

* Capability to transmit digital slides over distances quickly, which enables telepathology scenarios.
* Capability to access past specimen from the same patients and/or similar cases for comparison and review, with much less effort then retrieving slides from the archive shelfs.

* Capability to compare different areas of multiple slides simultaneously (slide by slide mode) with the help of a virtual microscope.
* Capability to annotate areas directly in the slide and share this for teaching and research.

Digital pathology is today widely used for educational purposes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0463.2011.02869.x  |year=2012 |last1=Hamilton |first1=Peter W. |last2=Wang |first2=Yinhai |last3=McCullough |first3=Stephen J. | last4=Sussman | title=Virtual microscopy and digital pathology in training and education|volume=45 |pages=305–315 | journal=Apmis, 120(4) | pmid=22429213}} &lt;/ref&gt; in telepathology and teleconsultation as well as in research projects.  Digital pathology allows to share and annotate slides in a much easier way and to download annotated lecture sets generates new opportunities for e-learning and knowledge sharing in pathology. Digital pathology in diagnostics is an emerging and upcoming field. 

== Environment ==

===Scan===

Digital slides are created from glass slides using a scanning device.  Digital pathology requires high quality scans free of dust, scratches, and other obstructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flagship Biosciences|title=How to Improve Whole Slide Scanning in Digital Pathology|url=http://flagshipbio.com/therapeutics/neurology/it-all-starts-with-a-quality-scan/|publisher=Flagship Biosciences LLC|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===View===

Digital slides are accessible for viewing via a computer monitor and viewing software either locally or remotely via the Internet.

Example: [http://host.simagis.com/live/public/15e4111b-bd03-4570-92a0-3e5b01ff3820 digital pathology tissue slide] stained with [[Her2/neu]] biomarker used for diagnosis of [[breast cancer]].

===Manage===

Digital slides are maintained in an information management system that allows for archival and intelligent retrieval.

===Network===

Digital slides are often stored and delivered over the Internet or private networks, for viewing and consultation.

===Analyze===

Image analysis tools are used to derive objective quantification measures from digital slides.  Image segmentation and classification algorithms are used to identify medically significant regions and objects on digital slides. Recent developments in machine learning using deep learning methods are very promising and allow to make information hidden in integrated pathological data (images, patient history and *omics data) in arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces accessible and quantifiable, thereby generating a novel source of information which is not yet available to the expert and not exploited in current Digital Pathology settings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/978-3-319-69775-8_2 | title = Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction in Digital Pathology needs an integrative approach.

===Integrate===

Digital pathology workflow is integrated into the institution's overall operational environment.

===Sharing===

Digital pathology also allows internet information sharing for education, diagnostics, publication and research.

[[File:Dioptra-principe.jpg|right|thumb|384px|Three stages in the evolution of the dioptra, from a simple horizontal sight, to a multi-angle measuring tool]]
A '''dioptra''' (sometimes also named '''dioptre''' or '''diopter''' from {{lang-el|διόπτρα}}) is a [[Hellenistic civilization|classical]] astronomical and [[surveying instrument]], dating from the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century BCE. The '''dioptra''' was a sighting tube or, alternatively, a rod with a sight at both ends, attached to a stand. If fitted with [[protractor]]s, it could be used to measure [[angle]]s.

==Use==
[[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomers]] used the dioptra to [[astrometry|measure the positions of stars]]; both [[Euclid]] and [[Geminus]] refer to the dioptra in their astronomical works. By the time of [[Ptolemy]] (2nd&amp;nbsp;century CE), it was obsolete as an astronomical instrument, having been replaced by the [[armillary sphere]].

It continued in use as an effective [[surveying]] tool. Adapted to surveying, the dioptra is similar to the [[theodolite]], or surveyor's transit, which dates to the sixteenth century. It is a more accurate version of the [[Groma surveying|groma]].

The dioptra may have been sophisticated enough, for example, to construct a tunnel through two opposite points in a mountain. There is some speculation that it may have been used to build the [[Eupalinian aqueduct]]. Called "one of the greatest engineering achievements of ancient times," it is a tunnel 1,036&amp;nbsp;meters (4,000&amp;nbsp;ft) long, "excavated through [[Mount Kastro]] on the Greek island of [[Samos Island|Samos]], in the 6th century BCE" during the reign of [[Polycrates]].  Scholars disagree whether the dioptra was available that early.&lt;ref name=Apostol&gt;{{cite web|last=Apostol|first=Tom M.|title=The Tunnel of Samos|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4106/1/Samos.pdf|publisher=caltech.edu|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An entire book about the construction and surveying usage of the dioptra is credited to [[Hero of Alexandria]] (also known as Heron; a brief description of the book is available online; see Lahanas link, below). Hero was "one of history’s most ingenious [[engineer]]s and applied [[mathematician]]s."

The dioptra was used extensively on [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] building projects. Screw turns on several different parts of the instrument made it easy to calibrate for very precise measurements

The dioptra was replaced as a surveying instrument by the [[theodolite]].

[[File:Types of current.svg|thumb|250px|Direct Current (red line). The vertical axis shows current or voltage and the horizontal 't' axis measures time and shows the zero value.]]
'''Direct current''' ('''DC''') is the unidirectional flow of [[electric charge]]. A [[battery (electrical)|battery]] is a good example of a DC power supply. Direct current may flow in a [[conductor (material)|conductor]] such as a wire, but can also flow through [[semiconductor]]s, [[electrical insulation|insulator]]s, or even through a [[vacuum]] as in [[electron beam|electron or ion beams]]. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from [[alternating current]] (AC). A [[archaism|term formerly used]] for this type of current was '''galvanic current'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Clinical Electrophysiology: Electrotherapy and Electrophysiologic Testing |author=Andrew J. Robinson, Lynn Snyder-Mackler|edition=3rd|year=2007 |publisher= [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|isbn= 978-0-7817-4484-3|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2-9bcIjPBsC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22galvanic+current%22+%22direct+current%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22galvanic%20current%22%20%22direct%20current%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviations ''AC'' and ''DC'' are often used to mean simply ''alternating'' and ''direct'', as when they modify ''[[Electric current|current]]'' or ''[[voltage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

Direct current may be obtained from an alternating current supply by use of a [[rectifier]], which contains [[Electronics|electronic]] elements (usually) or electromechanical elements (historically) that allow current to flow only in one direction. Direct current may be converted into alternating current with an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] or a motor-generator set.

Direct current is used to charge batteries and as a power supply for electronic systems. Very large quantities of direct-current power are used in production of [[aluminum]] and other [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] processes. It is also used for some [[Railway electrification system#Direct current|railways]], especially in urban areas. [[High-voltage direct current]] is used to transmit large amounts of power from remote generation sites or to interconnect alternating current power grids.

Direct current was produced in 1800 by Italian physicist [[Alessandro Volta]]'s battery, his [[Voltaic pile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.hhp.coe.uh.edu/clayne/HistoryofMC/HistoryMC/VoltaII.htm Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta – grants.hhp.coe.uh.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of how current flowed was not understood. French physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]] conjectured that current travelled in one direction from positive to negative.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Breithaupt, Physics, Palgrave Macmillan – 2010, page 175&lt;/ref&gt; When French instrument maker [[Hippolyte Pixii]] built the first [[Dynamo|dynamo electric generator]] in 1832, he found that as the magnet used passed the loops of wire each half turn, it caused the flow of electricity to reverse, generating an [[alternating current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/java/pixiimachine/index.html |title=Pixii Machine invented by Hippolyte Pixii, National High Magnetic Field Laboratory |access-date=2008-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907092008/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/java/pixiimachine/index.html |archive-date=2008-09-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Ampère's suggestion, Pixii later added a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]], a type of "switch" where contacts on the shaft work with "brush" contacts to produce direct current.

The late 1870s and early 1880s saw electricity starting to be generated at [[power stations]]. These were initially set up to power [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] (a popular type of street lighting) running on very high voltage (usually higher than 3000 volt) direct current or alternating current.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edisontechcenter.org/ArcLamps.html The First Form of Electric Light History of the Carbon Arc Lamp (1800 – 1980s)]&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the wide spread use of low voltage direct current for indoor electric lighting in business and homes after inventor [[Thomas Edison]] launched his incandescent bulb based electric "[[Public utility|utility]]" in 1882. Because of the significant advantages of alternating current over direct current in using [[transformer]]s to raise and lower voltages to allow much longer transmission distances, direct current was replaced over the next few decades by alternating current in power delivery. In the mid-1950s, [[high-voltage direct current]] transmission was developed, and is now an option instead of long-distance high voltage alternating current systems. For long distance underseas cables (e.g. between countries, such as [[NorNed]]), this DC option is the only technically feasible option. For applications requiring direct current, such as [[third rail]] power systems, alternating current is distributed to a substation, which utilizes a [[rectifier]] to convert the power to direct current.

==Various definitions==
[[File:Current rectification diagram.svg|right|250px|thumb|Types of direct current]] The term ''DC'' is used to refer to power systems that use only one polarity of voltage or current, and to refer to the constant, zero-frequency, or slowly varying local mean value of a voltage or current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Newnes Dictionary of Electronic | author = Roger S. Amos, Geoffrey William Arnold Dummer | publisher = Newnes |edition=4th| year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7506-4331-5 |page=83| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c4qHqtC9JkgC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=dc+zero-frequency#PPA83,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the voltage across a DC [[voltage source]] is constant as is the current through a DC [[current source]]. The DC solution of an [[electric circuit]] is the solution where all voltages and currents are constant. It can be shown that any [[stationary process|stationary]] voltage or current waveform can be decomposed into a sum of a DC component and a zero-mean time-varying component; the DC component is defined to be the expected value, or the average value of the voltage or current over all time.

Although DC stands for "direct current", DC often refers to "constant polarity". Under this definition, DC voltages can vary in time, as seen in the raw output of a rectifier or the fluctuating voice signal on a telephone line.

Some forms of DC (such as that produced by a [[voltage regulator]]) have almost no variations in [[voltage]], but may still have variations in output [[electric power|power]] and current.

==Circuits==
A direct current circuit is an [[electrical circuit]] that consists of any combination of constant [[voltage]] sources, constant [[current (electricity)|current]] sources, and [[resistor]]s. In this case, the circuit voltages and currents are independent of time. A particular circuit voltage or current does not depend on the past value of any circuit voltage or current. This implies that the system of equations that represent a DC circuit do not involve integrals or derivatives with respect to time.

If a [[capacitor]] or [[inductor]] is added to a DC circuit, the resulting circuit is not, strictly speaking, a DC circuit. However, most such circuits have a DC solution. This solution gives the circuit voltages and currents when the circuit is in [[DC steady state]]. Such a circuit is represented by a system of [[differential equations]]. The solution to these equations usually contain a time varying or [[Transient state|transient]] part as well as constant or steady state part. It is this steady state part that is the DC solution. There are some circuits that do not have a DC solution. Two simple examples are a constant current source connected to a capacitor and a constant voltage source connected to an inductor.

In electronics, it is common to refer to a circuit that is powered by a DC voltage source such as a battery or the output of a DC power supply as a DC circuit even though what is meant is that the circuit is DC powered.

==Applications==
===Domestic===
[[File:Direct current symbol.svg|right|200px|thumb|This symbol which can be represented with [[Unicode]] character {{U+|2393}} (&amp;#8203;⎓&amp;#8203;) is found on many electronic devices that either require or produce direct current.]]
DC is commonly found in many [[extra-low voltage]] applications and some [[low voltage|low-voltage]] applications, especially where these are powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] or [[solar power]] systems (since both can produce only DC).

Most [[electronics|electronic]] circuits require a DC [[power supply]].

Domestic DC installations usually have different types of [[Jack (connector)|sockets]], [[DC connector|connectors]], [[switch]]es, and [[Light fixture|fixture]]s from those suitable for alternating current. This is mostly due to the lower voltages used, resulting in higher currents to produce the same amount of [[Watt|power]].

It is usually important with a DC appliance to observe polarity, unless the device has a [[diode bridge]] to correct for this.

===Automotive===
Most automotive applications use DC. An [[automotive battery]] provides power for engine starting, lighting, and ignition system.  The [[alternator]] is an AC device which uses a [[rectifier]] to produce DC for battery charging.  Most highway passenger vehicles use nominally  12&amp;nbsp;[[volt|V]] systems.  Many heavy trucks, farm equipment,  or earthmoving equipment with [[Diesel engine]]s use 24 volt systems. In some older vehicles, 6&amp;nbsp;V was used, such as in the original [[Volkswagen Beetle|classic VW Beetle]]. At one point a [[42&amp;nbsp;V electrical system]] was considered for automobiles, but this found little use. To save weight and wire, often the metal frame of the vehicle is connected to one pole of the battery and used as the return conductor in a circuit.  Often the negative pole is the chassis "ground" connection, but positive ground may be used in some wheeled or marine vehicles. 

===Telecommunication===
[[Telephone exchange]] communication equipment uses standard −48&amp;nbsp;V DC power supply. The negative polarity is achieved by [[ground (electricity)|grounding]] the positive terminal of power supply system and the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] bank. This is done to prevent [[electrolysis]] depositions. Telephone installations have a battery system to ensure power is maintained for subscriber lines during power interruptions. 

Other devices may be powered from the telecommunications DC system using a [[DC-DC converter]] to provide any convenient voltage. 

Many [[telephone]]s connect to a [[twisted pair]] of wires, and use a [[bias tee]] to internally separate the AC component of the voltage between the two wires (the audio signal) from the DC component of the voltage between the two wires (used to power the phone).

===High-voltage power transmission===
{{main|High-voltage direct current}}
High-voltage direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission systems use DC for the bulk transmission of electrical power, in contrast with the more common alternating current systems. For long-distance transmission, HVDC systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses.

===Other===
Applications using [[fuel cells]] (mixing hydrogen and oxygen together with a catalyst to produce electricity and water as byproducts) also produce only DC.

Light aircraft electrical systems are typically 12&amp;nbsp;V or 24&amp;nbsp;V DC similar to automobiles.

An '''embryo''' is an early stage of [[embryogenesis|development]] of a [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] [[ploidy|diploid]] [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organism. In general, in [[organism]]s that [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], an embryo develops from a [[zygote]], the single cell resulting from the [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] of the female [[egg cell]] by the male [[sperm]] cell. The zygote possesses half the [[DNA]] from each of its two parents. In [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and some [[protist]]s, the zygote will begin to divide by [[mitosis]] to produce a multicellular organism. The result of this process is an embryo.

In [[pregnancy|human pregnancy]], a [[prenatal development|developing fetus]] is considered as an embryo until the ninth week, [[Human fertilization#Fertilization age|fertilization age]], or eleventh-week [[gestational age]]. After this time the embryo is referred to as a [[fetus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=embryo|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302|website=Mayo|accessdate=21 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220102352/http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302|archivedate=20 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

==Development==
{{see also|Human embryogenesis|Prenatal development}}
[[File:Embryonic development of a salamander, filmed in the 1920s.ogv|thumb|Embryonic development of salamander, circa the 1920s]]
[[File:Wrinkledfrog embryos.jpg|thumb|Embryos (and one [[tadpole]]) of the wrinkled frog (''Rana rugosa'')]]
In animals, the development of the zygote into an embryo proceeds through specific recognizable stages of [[blastula]], [[gastrulation|gastrula]], and [[organogenesis]]. The blastula stage typically features a fluid-filled cavity, the [[Coelom|blastocoel]], surrounded by a sphere or sheet of cells, also called [[blastomere]]s. In a [[eutheria|placental mammal]], an ovum is fertilized in a [[fallopian tube]] through which it travels into the uterus. An embryo is called a fetus at a more advanced stage of development and up until [[childbirth|birth]] or hatching. In humans, this is from the eleventh week of [[gestation]]. However, animals which develop in eggs outside the mother's body, are usually referred to as embryos throughout development; e.g. one would refer to a [[bird|chick]] embryo, not a "chick fetus", even at later stages.

During [[gastrulation]] the cells of the blastula undergo coordinated processes of cell division, invasion, and/or migration to form two ([[diploblasty|diploblastic]]) or three ([[triploblasty|triploblastic]]) tissue layers. In triploblastic organisms, the three [[germ layer]]s are called [[endoderm]], [[ectoderm]], and [[mesoderm]]. The position and arrangement of the germ layers are highly species-specific, however, depending on the type of embryo produced. In [[vertebrate]]s, a special population of embryonic cells called the [[neural crest]] has been proposed as a "fourth germ layer", and is thought to have been an important novelty in the evolution of head structures.

During organogenesis, molecular and cellular interactions between germ layers, combined with the cells' developmental potential, or [[competence (biology)|competence]] to respond, prompt the further differentiation of organ-specific cell types.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} For example, in [[neurogenesis]], a subpopulation of ectoderm cells is set aside to become the [[brain]], [[spinal cord]], and [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]]. Modern developmental biology is extensively probing the molecular basis for every type of organogenesis, including [[angiogenesis]] (formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones), [[chondrogenesis]] (cartilage), [[myogenesis]] (muscle), [[Osteoblast|osteogenesis]] (bone), and many others.

===Plant embryos===
{{further|Sporophyte}}
[[File:Ginkgo embryo and gametophyte.jpg|thumb|The inside of a ''[[Ginkgo]]'' seed, showing the embryo]]
In [[botany]], a [[Spermatophyte|seed plant]] ''embryo'' is part of a [[seed]], consisting of precursor tissues for the leaves, stem (see '''[[hypocotyl]]'''), and root (see '''[[radicle]]'''), as well as one or more '''[[cotyledon]]s'''. Once the embryo begins to [[germination|germinate]]—grow out from the seed—it is called a '''seedling''' (plantlet).

[[Bryophyte]]s and [[fern]]s also produce an embryo, but do not produce seeds. In these plants, the embryo begins its existence attached to the inside of the [[archegonium]] on a parental [[gametophyte]] from which the egg cell was generated. The inner wall of the archegonium lies in close contact with the "foot" of the developing embryo; this "foot" consists of a bulbous mass of cells at the base of the embryo which may receive nutrition from its parent gametophyte. The structure and development of the rest of the embryo varies by group of plants. Once the embryo has expanded beyond the enclosing archegonium, it is no longer termed an embryo.

==Research and technology==
Embryos are used in various fields of research and in techniques of [[assisted reproductive technology]]. An egg may be fertilized in vitro and the resulting embryo may be [[Cryopreservation#Embryos|frozen]] for later use.
The potential of embryonic [[stem cell]] research, reproductive [[cloning]], and [[germline engineering]] are currently being explored. [[Prenatal testing|Prenatal diagnosis]] or [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|preimplantation diagnosis]] enables testing embryos for diseases or conditions.

[[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] is a practice in which animal germplasms, such as embryos are collected and stored at low temperatures with the intent of conserving the genetic material.

The embryos of ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' have been used as a model to understand gene activation, patterning, and organogenesis of seed plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Boscá | first1=S | last2=Knauer | first2=S | last3=Laux | first3=T | year=2011 | title=Embryonic development in Arabidopsis thaliana: from the zygote division to the shoot meristem | journal=Frontiers in Plant Science | doi=10.3389/fpls.2011.00093 | PMID=22639618 | pmc=3355580 | volume=2 | pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from MERLN Institute and the [[Hubrecht Institute]] in the Netherlands managed to grow samples of synthetic rodent embryos, combining certain types of [[stem cells]]. This method will help scientists to more deeply study the very first moments of the process of the birth of a new life, which, in turn, can lead to the emergence of new effective methods to combat [[infertility]] and other [[Genetic disorder|genetic diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://newatlas.com/model-mouse-embryos-grown-stem-cells/54484/ "Scientists grow synthetic mouse embryos from stem cells"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508185235/https://newatlas.com/model-mouse-embryos-grown-stem-cells/54484/ |date=2018-05-08 }} New Atlas, May 4, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossilized embryos===

{{Main|Fossil embryos}}
Fossilized animal embryos are known from the [[Precambrian]], and are found in great numbers during the [[Cambrian]] period.

In species which produce multiple embryos at the same time, miscarriage or abortion of some embryos can provide the remaining embryos with a greater share of maternal resources. This can also disturb the pregnancy, causing harm to the second embryo. Genetic strains which miscarry their embryos are the source of commercial seedless fruits.

Abortion is the process of artificially (non-naturally) removing the embryo through deliberate pharmaceutical or surgical methods.

[[Image:E-test Ngono.jpg|thumb|Etest]]

'''Etest''', (previously known as '''Epsilometer test''') manufactured by bioMérieux, is a manual ''in vitro'' diagnostic device used by laboratories to determine the [[Minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]] (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and whether or not a specific strain of [[bacterium]] or [[fungus]] is susceptible to the action of a specific antimicrobial. This type of test is most commonly used in healthcare settings to help guiding physicians in treatment of patients by indicating what concentration of antimicrobial would successfully treat an infection.

==History==

The Etest strip was first described in 1988 and was introduced commercially in 1991 by AB BIODISK. bioMérieux acquired AB BIODISK in 2008 and continues to manufacture and market this product range under the mark Etest.

During the 1950s, Hans Ericsson (Professor of microbiology at the Karolinska Hospital and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm), the scientific founder of AB BIODISK, developed a method to standardize the disc diffusion method and to improve its reproducibility and reliability for clinical susceptibility predictions.  The inhibition zone sizes from disc test results were compared to [[Minimum inhibitory concentration|Minimum Inhibitory Concentration]] (MIC) values based on the reference [[agar dilution]] procedure.  The correlation between zone sizes and MIC values was then assessed using regression analysis and regression lines were used for extrapolating zone interpretive limits that corresponded to the MIC breakpoint values that defined susceptible, intermediate and resistant categorical results.

Etest was first presented at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in Los Angeles in 1988 as a novel gradient concept for MIC determinations. In September 1991, Etest was launched globally as a MIC product after receiving the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance.

Etest  applications include many groups of fastidious organisms, fungi (yeast and mould) and mycobacteria as well as detecting various mechanisms of resistance and MIC testing of key antibiotics with critical specimens e.g. blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).

==Intended use==

Etest is a quantitative technique for determining the antimicrobial susceptibility (AST) and MIC (in µg/mL) of Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, ''Pseudomonas'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Enterococcus'' species and fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, ''N. gonorrhoeae'', ''S. pneumoniae'', ''Streptococcus'' and ''Haemophilius'' species.

==Principle==

Etest is a ‘ready-to-use’ , inert and non poreus plastic reagent strip with a predefined gradient of antibiotic, covering a continuous concentration range, for the determination of precise MIC values of a wide range of antimicrobial agents against different organism groups.

When Etest is applied to the surface of an agar plate inoculated with the test strain, there is an instantaneous release of the antimicrobial gradient from the plastic carrier to the agar to form a stable and continuous gradient beneath and in the immediate vicinity of the strip.

Etest incubation and reading times have been determined based on the intrinsic growth characteristics of the organism, and the specific incubation conditions.  Therefore, for reliable and reproducible results, the stability of the gradient must be maintained for many hours. The predefined Etest gradient remains stable for at least 18 to 24 hours; that is, a period that covers the critical times of many species of fastidious and non-fastidious organisms.

When the Etest strip is placed on an agar surface, the antibiotic gradient on the strip is simply transferred to the agar matrix creating an imprint of the gradient on the strip in the agar.   The bacterial growth becomes visible after incubation and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip is seen. The MIC value is read from the scale in terms of µg/mL where the ellipse edge intersects the strip.

==Choice of agar medium==

Etest can be used with many different kinds of AST agar medium as long as the medium supports good growth of the test organism and does not interfere with the activity of the antimicrobial agent. However, to maximise reproducibility, the medium chosen should fulfil the basic requirements for a susceptibility test medium.  The following AST mediums are recommended for use with Etest:

* Aerobes: Mueller Hinton agar such as MHE (bioMérieux)
* Anaerobes:  Brucella blood agar with appropriate supplements

These media may require supplemental nutrients to obtain enhanced growth of nutritionally fastidious organisms such as pneumococci, streptococci, Abiotrophia, Haemophilus, gonococci, meningococci and Campylobacter. In general, media recommendations from the [[Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute|CLSI]] (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) and the EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) are considered appropriate for Etest.

==Result interpretation==

After the required incubation period, and only when an even lawn of growth is distinctly visible, the MIC value can be read where the edge of the inhibition ellipse intersects the side of the strip.  The plate should not be read if the culture appears mixed or if the lawn of growth is too light or too heavy.
Etest MIC endpoints are usually clear-cut although different growth/inhibition patterns may be seen.

==Availability==

Etest products for more than 100 antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics, antifungal agents and antimycobacterial agents are available. In addition, specific Etest products are available for the detection of specific resistance mechanisms [e.g. ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase), MBL (Metallo Beta-Lactamase), AmpC Beta-Lactamase and VISA/h VISA].

Etest has been FDA cleared and CE marked for many organisms by comparing to conventional broth/agar dilution reference methods and shown to have excellent correlation.  This is a partial list of organisms and antibiotics for which the test has been FDA cleared and CE marked.

==Etest equipment==

The Etest family of instruments is designed to simplify the daily use of Etest. Simplex C76, Nema C88, and Retro C80 are easy to use, reducing operator fatigue, saving time and improving the quality of results by increasing reproducibility. Etest and related instruments offer one of the most efficient methods for generating on-scale MIC values across 15 doubling dilutions for susceptibility testing of a wide range of drug-bug combinations, including fastidious organisms.
* '''Simplex C76''' automates the placement of 1 to 6 different Etest strips to simplify the setup of MIC panels.  Application of up to 6 strips for large agar plates or up to 2 strips on small plates takes &lt;12 seconds.
* '''Retro C80''' is a rota-plater that simplifies and standardizes the inoculation of small and large agar plates making Etest® easier to read when compared to manual streaking.
* '''Nema C88''' is a vacuum pen that simplifies the application of Etest® strips. The applicator is held like a pen and the evacuation hole is covered with the fingertip to create suction.  The suction cup is placed on the strip to lift it up and then position onto the agar surface. The strip is released by removing the finger tip from the evacuation hole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15227">{{short description|Any cause that reduces reproductive success in a proportion of a population}}
{{evolutionary biology}}
Any cause that reduces reproductive success in a portion of a population potentially exerts '''evolutionary pressure''', '''selective pressure''' or '''selection pressure''', driving [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Natural selection"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_25|title=Natural selection|website=evolution.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With sufficient pressure, inherited traits that mitigate its effects—even if they would be deleterious in other circumstances—can become widely spread through a population. It is a quantitative description of the amount of change occurring in processes investigated by [[evolutionary biology]], but the formal concept is often extended to other areas of research.

In [[population genetics]], selection pressure is usually expressed as a [[selection coefficient]].

== Amino acids selective pressure ==
It has been shown that putting an [[amino acid]] bio-synthesizing gene like ''HIS4'' gene under amino acid selective pressure in [[yeast]] causes enhancement of expression of [[adjacent gene]]s which is due to the transcriptional co-regulation of two adjacent genes in [[Eukaryota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/afpuc.2015.62.issue-2/afpuc-2015-0031/afpuc-2015-0031.xml?format=INT | title=Increased expression and secretion of recombinant hIFNγ through amino acid starvation-induced selective pressure on the adjacent HIS4 gene in Pichia pastoris | author=Ali Razaghi|author2=Roger Huerlimann|author3=Leigh Owens|author4=Kirsten Heimann | journal=European Pharmaceutical Journal | year=2015 | volume=62 | issue=2 | pages=43–50 | doi=10.1515/afpuc-2015-0031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antibiotic resistance ==
[[Drug resistance]] in bacteria is an example of an outcome of [[natural selection]].
When a drug is used on a species of bacteria, those that cannot resist die and do not produce offspring, while those that survive potentially pass on the resistance gene to the next generation (vertical gene transmission). The resistance gene can also be passed on to one bacterium by another of a different species (horizontal gene transmission). Because of this, the drug resistance increases over generations. For example, in hospitals, environments are created where pathogens such as ''C''. ''difficile'' have developed a resistance to antibiotics.&lt;ref name="Dawson"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dawson L.F., Valiente E., Wren B.W. | year = 2009 | title = Clostridium'' ''difficile''—A continually evolving and problematic pathogen. Infections | url = | journal = Genetics and Evolution | volume = 9 | issue = 6| pages = 1410–1417 | doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2009.06.005| pmid = 19539054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotic resistance is made worse by the misuse of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is encouraged when antibiotics are used to treat non-bacterial diseases, and when antibiotics are not used for the prescribed amount of time or in the prescribed dose.&lt;ref name="Brown 1999 385–399"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Joel S.|last2=Laundré|first2=John W.|last3=Gurung|first3=Mahesh|date=1999|title=The Ecology of Fear: Optimal Foraging, Game Theory, and Trophic Interactions|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=80|issue=2|pages=385–399|doi=10.2307/1383287|jstor=1383287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotic resistance may arise out of standing genetic variation in a population or de novo mutations in the population. Either pathway could lead to antibiotic resistance, which may be a form of [[evolutionary rescue]].

===Nosocomial infections===
''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'', [[gram-positive bacteria]] species that inhabits the gut of mammals, exemplifies one type of bacteria that is a major cause of death by nosocomial infections.&lt;ref name="Dawson"/&gt;

When symbiotic [[gut flora]] populations are disrupted (e.g., by [[antibiotics]]), one becomes more vulnerable to pathogens. The rapid evolution of [[antibiotic resistance]] places an enormous selective pressure on the advantageous alleles of resistance passed down to future generations.  The [[Red Queen hypothesis]] shows that the evolutionary arms race between pathogenic bacteria and humans is a constant battle for evolutionary advantages in outcompeting each other. The evolutionary arms race between the rapidly evolving virulence factors of the bacteria and the treatment practices of modern medicine requires evolutionary biologists to understand the mechanisms of resistance in these pathogenic bacteria, especially considering the growing number of infected hospitalized patients. The evolved virulence factors pose a threat to patients in hospitals, who are immunocompromised from illness or antibiotic treatment. Virulence factors are the characteristics that the evolved bacteria have developed to increase pathogenicity. One of the virulence factors of ''C''. ''difficile'' that largely constitutes its resistance to antibiotics is its toxins: enterotoxin TcdA and cytotoxin TcdB.&lt;ref name="Terrier"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Terrier M. C. Z., Simonet M. L., Bichard P., Frossard J.

== Natural selection in humans ==
The [[Malaria]] parasite can exert a selective pressure on populations. This pressure has led to [[natural selection]] for [[erythrocytes]] carrying the [[sickle cell]] [[hemoglobin]] [[gene]] [[mutation]] ([[Hemoglobin|Hb]] S)—causing [[sickle cell anaemia]]—in areas where [[malaria]] is a major health concern, because the condition grants some resistance to this infectious disease.&lt;ref name="Parker 697–708"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Heidi G.|last2=Dreger|first2=Dayna L.|last3=Rimbault|first3=Maud|last4=Davis|first4=Brian W.|last5=Mullen|first5=Alexandra B.|last6=Carpintero-Ramirez|first6=Gretchen|last7=Ostrander|first7=Elaine A.|date=2017-04-25|title=Genomic Analyses Reveal the Influence of Geographic Origin, Migration, and Hybridization on Modern Dog Breed Development|url=http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(17)30456-4|journal=Cell Reports|language=English|volume=19|issue=4|pages=697–708|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.079|pmid=28445722|pmc=5492993|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance to herbicides and pesticides ==
{{Further|Pesticide resistance}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}

Just as with the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, resistance to pesticides and herbicides has begun to appear with commonly used agricultural chemicals. For example:
* In the US, studies have shown that fruit flies that infest orange groves were becoming resistant to [[malathion]], a pesticide used to kill them.
* In Hawaii and Japan, the [[diamondback moth]] developed a resistance to ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', which is used in several commercial crops including [[Bt corn]], about three years after it began to be used heavily.
* In England, rats in certain areas have developed such a strong resistance to rat poison that they can consume up to five times as much of it as normal rats without dying.
* [[DDT]] is no longer effective in controlling [[mosquito]]es that transmit [[malaria]] in some places, a fact that contributed to a resurgence of the disease.
* In the southern United States, the weed ''[[Amaranthus palmeri]]'', which interferes with production of cotton, has developed widespread resistance to the herbicide [[glyphosate]].
* In the [[Baltic Sea]], decreases in salinity has encouraged the emergence of a new species of brown seaweed, ''[[Fucus radicans]]''.&lt;ref name="Lindblad-Toh 803–819"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindblad-Toh|first=Kerstin|last2=members|first2=Broad Sequencing Platform|last3=Wade|first3=Claire M|last4=Mikkelsen|first4=Tarjei S.|last5=Karlsson|first5=Elinor K.|last6=Jaffe|first6=David B.|last7=Kamal|first7=Michael|last8=Clamp|first8=Michele|last9=Chang|first9=Jean L.|date=December 2005|title=Genome sequence, comparative analysis and haplotype structure of the domestic dog|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04338|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=438|issue=7069|pages=803–819|doi=10.1038/nature04338|pmid=16341006|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humans exerting evolutionary pressure ==
Human activity can lead to unintended changes in the environment. The human activity will have a possible negative effect on a certain population, causing many individuals from said population to die due to not being adapted to this new pressure. The individuals that are better adapted to this new pressure will survive and reproduce at a higher rate than those who are at a disadvantage. This occurs over many generations until the population as a whole is better adapted to the pressure.&lt;ref name="Natural selection"/&gt; This is natural selection at work, but the pressure is coming from man-made activity such as building roads or hunting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Charles R.|last2=Bomberger Brown|first2=Mary|date=2013-03-18|title=Where has all the road kill gone?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213001942|journal=Current Biology|volume=23|issue=6|pages=R233–R234|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.02.023|pmid=23518051}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen in the below examples of cliff swallows and elk. However, not all human activity that causes an evolutionary pressure happens unintentionally. This is demonstrated in dog domestication and the subsequent [[selective breeding]] that resulted in the various breeds known today.

=== Cliff swallows ===
Populations of cliff swallows in Nebraska have displayed [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] changes in their wings after many years of living next to roads.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Collecting data for over 30 years, researchers noticed a decline in wingspan of living swallow populations, while also noting a decrease in the number of cliff swallows killed by passing cars. Those cliff swallows that were killed by passing cars showed a larger wingspan than the population as a whole. Confounding effects such as road usage, car size, and population size were shown to have no impact on the study.

=== Elk ===
Evolutionary pressure imposed by humans is also seen in elk populations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciuti|first=Simone|last2=Muhly|first2=Tyler B.|last3=Paton|first3=Dale G.|last4=McDevitt|first4=Allan D.|last5=Musiani|first5=Marco|last6=Boyce|first6=Mark S.|date=2012-11-07|title=Human selection of elk behavioural traits in a landscape of fear|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1746/4407|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=279|issue=1746|pages=4407–4416|doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.1483|issn=0962-8452|pmid=22951744|pmc=3479801}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies do not look at morphological differences, but behavioral differences. Faster and more mobile male elk were shown to be more likely to fall prey to hunters. The hunters create an environment where the more active animals are more likely to succumb to [[predation]] than less active animals.&lt;ref name="Brown 1999 385–399"/&gt; Female elk who survived past two years, would decrease their activity as each year passed, leaving more shy female elk that were more likely to survive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Female elk in a separate study also showed behavioral differences, with older females displaying the timid behavior that one would expect from this selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thurfjell|first=Henrik|last2=Ciuti|first2=Simone|last3=Boyce|first3=Mark S.|date=2017-06-14|title=Learning from the mistakes of others: How female elk (Cervus elaphus) adjust behaviour with age to avoid hunters|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=6|pages=e0178082|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0178082|pmid=28614406|pmc=5470680|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dog domestication ===
Since the domestication of dogs, they have evolved alongside humans due to pressure from humans and the environment.&lt;ref name="Wang 1860"/&gt; This began by humans and wolves sharing the same area, with a pressure to coexist eventually leading to their domestication. Evolutionary pressure from humans led to many different breeds that paralleled the needs of the time, whether it was a need for protecting livestock or assisting in the hunt.&lt;ref name="Ostrander 117–124"/&gt; Hunting and herding were a couple of the first reasons for humans artificially selecting for traits they deemed beneficial.&lt;ref name="Parker 697–708"/&gt; This selective breeding does not stop there, but extends to humans selecting for certain traits deemed desirable in their domesticated dogs, such as size and color, even if they are not necessarily beneficial to the human in a tangible way.&lt;ref name="Lindblad-Toh 803–819"/&gt; An unintended consequence of this selection is that domesticated dogs also tend to have [[Heritability|heritable]] diseases depending on what specific breed they encompass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sargan|first=David R.|date=2004-06-01|title=IDID: Inherited Diseases in Dogs: Web-based information for canine inherited disease genetics|journal=Mammalian Genome|language=en|volume=15|issue=6|pages=503–506|doi=10.1007/s00335-004-3047-z|pmid=15181542|issn=0938-8990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:fmrockc.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An element of rock under stress]]

'''Fault mechanics''' is a field of study that investigates the behavior of [[geologic fault]]s.

Behind every good [[earthquake]] is some weak rock.  Whether the rock remains weak becomes an important point in determining the potential for bigger earthquakes.

On a small scale, fractured rock behaves essentially the same throughout the world, in that the [[angle of friction]] is more or less uniform (see [[Fault friction]]).  A small element of rock in a larger mass responds to [[stress (physics)|stress]] changes in a well defined manner:  if it is squeezed by differential stresses greater than its strength, it is capable of large deformations.  A band of weak, fractured rock in a competent mass can deform to resemble a classic [[geologic fault]].  Using [[seismometer]]s and [[earthquake location]], the requisite pattern of micro-earthquakes can be observed.

[[Image:fmcracks.jpg|Penny|left|thumb|200px|Penny-shape cracks in rock]]

For earthquakes, it all starts with an embedded [[penny]]-shaped crack as first envisioned by Brune.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1987/A1987J040600001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  As illustrated, an earthquake zone may start as a single crack, growing to form many individual cracks and collections of cracks along a fault.  The key to fault growth is the concept of a "following force", as conveniently provided for [[interplate earthquake]]s, by the motion of tectonic plates.  Under a following force, the seismic displacements eventually form a topographic feature, such as a mountain range.

[[File:Fault mechanics creating a ridge.jpg|ridge|right|thumb|200px|Following forces forming a mountain range]]

[[Intraplate earthquakes]] do not have a following force, and are not associated with mountain building.  Thus, there is the puzzling question of how long any interior active zone has to live.  For, in a solid stressed plate, every seismic displacement acts to relieve (reduce) stress; the fault zone should come to equilibrium; and all seismic activity cease.  One can see this type of arching "lockup" in many natural processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/adventure/arches.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the [[seismic zone]] (such as the [[New Madrid Fault Zone]]) is ensured eternal life by the action of water.  As shown, if we add the equivalent of a giant funnel to the crack, it becomes the beneficiary of stress corrosion (the progressive weakening of the crack edge by water).&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20051217222420/http://www.nire.go.jp/annual/1998/28.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  If there is a continuing supply of new water, the system does not come to equilibrium, but continues to grow, ever relieving stress from a larger and larger volume.

[[Image:fmwater.jpg|water|left|thumb|200px| Fresh water continually being injected]]

Thus the prerequisite for a continuing seismically active interior zone is the presence of water, the ability of the water to get down to the fault source (high [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]]), and the usual high horizontal interior stresses of the rock mass.  All small earthquake zones have the potential to grow to resemble New Madrid or [[Charlevoix]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Ginger Finger for Figging.jpg|thumb|Pared finger of [[ginger]] root]]

'''Figging''' is the practice of inserting a piece of skinned [[ginger]] root into the human [[Human anus|anus]] or the [[vagina]] in order to generate an acute burning sensation. Historically this was a method of punishment, but has since been adopted as a practice of [[BDSM]]. The term "figging" comes from the 19th-century word "[[Gingering|feaguing]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feague (Grose 1811 Dictionary)|url=http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Grose-VulgarTongue/f/feague.html|website=www.fromoldbooks.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{slavery}}
This method of physical [[punishment]] was first used as a form of [[discipline]] on female slaves in [[Ancient Greece]], and during the [[Victorian era]] it was unofficially used by the [[Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire]] as a method of [[discipline|disciplinary]] action or [[corporal punishment]] for female prisoners.&lt;ref name=Torture&gt;''Torture and Democracy'' by Darius Rejali. p. 213f.&lt;/ref&gt; The detainee was [[physical restraint|restrained]] to varying degrees in order to restrict mobility while the sensation grew from uncomfortable to extreme.&lt;ref name="trist"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taormino|first=Tristan|authorlink=Tristan Taormino|title=The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bG8XqRO6rRQC|year=2006|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-57344-522-1|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Figging, die Kunst des Ingwerwurzel-Spiels"&gt;www.studio-arcades.com: ''[http://www.studio-arcades.com/cms/index.php/behandlungen/92-figging-die-kunst-des-ingwerwurzel-spiels.html].'' 10. June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
The ginger, which is skinned and often carved into the shape of a [[butt plug]], causes an intense burning sensation, and often intolerable discomfort to the subject. The effect reaches climax within two to five minutes after insertion, and persists for around thirty minutes before gradually easing. The ginger, after use, can be further skinned, and used to extend the experience; each fresh application of [[ginger]] root refreshes the duration of the sensations in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

If the person being figged tightens the muscles of the anus, the sensation becomes more intense.&lt;ref name="trist"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason it is often used in [[caning]] to prevent clenching of the buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scony.com/articles/figging/ |title=Figging}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global resources dividend''' (GRD) is a method of tackling [[global poverty]] advanced by the philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]].&lt;ref name=PoggeGRD/&gt; He presents it as an alternative to the current global economic order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas W.|title=Eradicating Systemic Poverty: Brief for a global resources dividend|journal=Journal of Human Development|date=January 2001|volume=2|issue=1|pages=59–77|doi=10.1080/14649880120050246|url=http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/global-resources-dividend/|accessdate=6 April 2015|issn=1464-9888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the scheme, nations would pay a dividend (tax) on  any resources that they use or sell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casal|first1=Paula|title=Global Taxes on Natural Resources|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|date=1 October 2011|volume=8|issue=3|pages=307–327|url=http://www.icrea.cat/Web/GetFile.asmx/Download?idFile=bIujBBG01Ac%3D|accessdate=6 April 2015|doi=10.1163/174552411X591339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Widdows, N. Smith (2011) ''Global Social Justice'', Routlege:  New York, p 74&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a sort of "tax on consumption"&lt;ref name = PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; Pogge's scheme is motivated by the positive duty to alleviate poverty, but also on the negative responsibility of the rich not to use institutions that perpetuate [[economic inequality]]. Pogge estimates that a dividend of just 1% could raise $300 billion each year; this would equal $250 for each individual in the worlds poorest quintile.

Implementing some version of the GRD [[logical consequence|entails]] not only discussions about practicality, but presumably, an affirmation of what is right. As Pogge puts it "Our task as philosophers requires that we try to imagine new, better political structures and different, better moral sentiments. We must be realistic, but not to the point of presenting to the parties in the [[original position]] the essentials of the status quo as unalterable facts."&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

==Rights of the disadvantaged==
{{quotebox|quoted=1|source=Thomas Pogge's hypothetical speech to the global poor; he says we should give that speech if we decide that international cooperation is unrealistic, and not worth attempting.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;|align=right|width=40%|quote= We care deeply about equality, and we would very much like it to be the case that you are not so much worse off than we are. But, unfortunately, it is not realistic to expect that we would actually comply with more egalitarian global institutions. Since no one would benefit from a futile attempt to maintain impracticable institutions, we should all just rest content with the global inequalities of the status quo.}}
Pogge's main justification is that, even if the idea of GRD would be refined over time, and would be difficult to implement, it is nevertheless the right of those who are the worst off. The 1% dividend tax is not seen as a donation, but a responsibility.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

Pogge believes that the idea of the GRD may be a natural extension of [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], although Rawls himself has express disagreement with this. To Pogge, the world order currently violates the first principle of justice (equal opportunity), as well as the second principle (equal access to offices, but also the idea that inequalities should favour the poorest individuals).&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

Rawls thought that certain individuals may be permitted to various non-liberal views, provided they harmonize with a liberal government. Similarly, Pogge says that we may permit certain nations to operate according to hierarchical, non-liberal systems; but on a global scale, only systems that harmonize with a grander liberal philosophy can be tolerated. Liberals cannot avoid taking sides completely; they must reject [[totalitarianism]], for instance.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; This has implications for the validity of actions that might be taken to promote a GRD.

Under the scheme of a GRD, states do not have full property rights in the resources within their sovereign territory. Although the GRD allows states to use resources as they see fit, the scheme implies that the global poor have an 'inalienable stake in all scarce resources' (see implementation, below).&lt;ref&gt;Haubrich. Dirk (2004) Global Distributive Justice and the Taxation of Natural Resources – Who Should Pick Up the Tab?,''Contemporary Political Theory'', 3: 52&lt;/ref&gt; Pogge argues that national borders are morally arbitrary in the first place, and are born from a history of coercion and violence. He sets these issues aside, however, and focuses on the following claim: any conception of global justice (even if we accept existing national borders as they are) must acknowledge international inequalities.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; Pogge thinks it becomes difficult to justify why a person born to rich parents in Canada should be entitled to so much more than one who is born to poor family in [[Sierra Leone]]. Equally difficult to justify might be the assumption that every person has a right to absolute control over the resources they happen to have within their borders.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

==Implementing a GRD==
Each nation or "peoples" would be given full freedom of what to do with their own resources. They would not be required to extract them, or allow others to extract them. If people decide to use a natural resource, they would pay a dividend. This includes oil, but also the various uses of reusable resources (e.g. polluting water). The dividend results in higher costs for natural resources, and thus amounts to a "tax on consumption".&lt;ref name= PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

The funds garnered from the GRD would be spent by an international organization; a [[world government]] is not ''necessary''. The organization would follow rules established by lawyers, economists, and other professionals from around the world. GRD payments would be used to provide [[basic rights]] to developing nations. Governments who collect the funds and invest them in luxuries for their elite would be completely or partially forbidden from receiving them. In such cases, funding [[NGO]]s may still be an important way of using the GRD to help the poor.&lt;ref name= PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

[[File:Gini Coefficient World CIA Report 2009-1.png|thumb|right|350px|There are different inequalities between, but also (pictured above) within countries. As the system around the GRD becomes more sophisticated, it could accommodate such issues.]]
The lowest level of the dividend (1%) is still likely to have a big impact on international development goals&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; (e.g. the [[Millennium Development Goals]]). Supporters of the Global Resources Dividend argue that it would also have an environmental benefit by reducing demand for non-renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name=PoggeGRD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Risse|first1=Mathias|title=What We Owe to the Global Poor: Political Philosophy Meets Development Economics|date=1 August 2003|publisher=Harvard University|pages=52|url=https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=1599|accessdate=6 April 2015|ref=risse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogge imagines that there may be dissent between and within nations. Again, he does not think a world government is necessary. Those countries that fail to pay their required GRD could be taxed by all the other countries doing trade with it. If a majority of countries are paying their GRD, these taxes would help deter dissenters.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; The idea is that there would be added pressure on each country to enforce the gathering of GRD funds within its borders.

Primary products or 'raw materials' are often refined into more expensive secondary products. As such it can be argued that the GRD is applied too early in the manufacturing process and does not take account of the environmental costs of manufacturing products beyond the extraction of raw materials. As the GRD evolves over time, this could be one of many improvements.

== Criticism ==
Richard Reichel states that it is unlikely that a Global resources dividend will work. He argues that increased financial flows could hurt an under developed economy and that an internal distribution with GRD is not resolved.&lt;ref name=Reichel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reichel|first1=Richard|title=Internationaler Handel, Tauschgerechtigkeit und die globale Rohstoffdividende|journal=Analyse und Kritik|date=1997|volume=19|issue=3|pages=229–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Hayward argues multiple reasons against the Global resources dividend. For one he uses [[Joseph Heath]]'s argument that the distributive effects could harm the poor nations that are not resource rich. Hayward states that because Pogge does not include the cultivation of basic commodities because poor people would be under economic pressure to produce cash crops instead of food crops.&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayward|first1=Tim|title=Thomas Pogge’s Global Resources Dividend: A Critique and an Alternative|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|date=1 November 2005|volume=2|issue=3|pages=317–332|doi=10.1177/1740468105058157|url=https://www.academia.edu/7038440/Thomas_Pogges_Global_Resources_Dividend_a_critique_and_an_alternative|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms '''human–animal hybrid''' and '''animal–human hybrid''' refer to an entity that incorporates elements from both humans and non-human animals.&lt;ref name=arts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Columbus&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Alan|date=November 15, 2012|title=Human-animal mix might become illegal|publisher=''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]''|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/national_world/2012/11/15/human-animal-mix-might-become-illegal.html|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fone/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;&lt;ref name=wet/&gt;

==Description==
For thousands of years, these [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] have been one of the most common themes in [[storytelling]] about animals throughout the world. The lack of a strong divide between humanity and animal nature in multiple traditional and ancient cultures has provided the underlying historical context for the popularity of tales where humans and animals have mingling relationships, such as in which one turns into the other or in which some mixed being goes through a journey.&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt; [[Interspecies friendships]] within the animal kingdom, as well as between humans and their pets, additionally provides an underlying root for the popularity of such beings.&lt;ref name=arts/&gt;

In various mythologies throughout history, many particularly famous hybrids have existed, including as a part of Egyptian and Indian spirituality.&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt; The entities have also been characters in fictional media more recently in history such as in [[H. G. Wells]]' work ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', adapted into the popular [[1932 in film|1932 film]] ''[[Island of Lost Souls (1932 film)|Island of Lost Souls]]''.&lt;ref name=fone/&gt; In legendary terms, the hybrids have played varying roles from that of trickster and/or villain to serving as divine heroes in very different contexts, depending on the given culture.&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt;

For example, [[Pan (god)|Pan]] is a deity in [[Greek mythology]] that rules over and symbolizes the untamed wild, being worshiped by hunters, fishermen, and shepherds in particular. The mischievous yet cheerful character is a [[Satyr]] who has the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat while otherwise being essentially human in appearance, with stories of his encounters with different gods, humans, and others being retold for centuries on after the days of early Greece by groups such as the [[Delphian Society]].&lt;ref name=delphian&gt;{{cite book|title=Hebrew literature. Greek mythology, life and art|pages=169–171|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKIOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=%22pan,+oh,+great+god+Pan%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pan%2C%20oh%2C%20great%20god%20Pan%22&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Delphian Society]]|date=1913|editor=Rev. J.K. Brennan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the human-animal hybrid has appeared in acclaimed works of art by figures such as [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref name=wet&gt;{{cite book|pages=12.3|title=Wetwares: Experiments in Postvital Living|first=Richard|last=Doyle|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A0FPKNU7mrUC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=%22just+you+watch!%22+pan#v=onepage&amp;q=%22just%20you%20watch!%22%20pan&amp;f=false|date=2003|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|isbn=9781452905846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional famous mythological hybrids include the Egyptian [[Psychopomp|god of death]], named [[Anubis]], and the fox-like Japanese beings that are called [[Kitsune]].&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt;

When looked at scientifically, outside of a fictional and/or mythical context, the real-life creation of human-animal hybrids has served as a subject of legal, moral, and technological debate in the context of recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Defined by the magazine ''[[Humanity+#H.2B Magazine|H+]]'' as "genetic alterations that are blendings [sic] of animal and human forms", such hybrids may be referred by other names occasionally such as "para-humans".&lt;ref name=arts&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts: The Parahuman Sculpture of Patricia Piccinini, Posthumanity and What It Really Means to be Human|publisher=''[[Humanity+#H.2B Magazine|H+]]''|date=October 11, 2013|accessdate=August 6, 2015|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2013/10/11/arts-the-parahuman-sculpture-of-patricia-piccinini-posthumanity-and-what-it-really-means-to-be-human/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt; They may additionally may be called "humanized animals".&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Technically speaking, they are also related to "cybrids" ([[cytoplasmic hybrids]]), with "cybrid" cells featuring foreign human [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] inside of them being a topic of interest. Possibly, a real-world human-animal hybrid may be an entity formed from either a [[Egg cell|human egg]] fertilized by a nonhuman [[sperm]] or a nonhuman egg fertilized by a human sperm.&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt; While at first being a concept in the likes of legends and [[thought experiment]]s, the first stable human-animal [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s (not hybrids but related) to actually exist were first created by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine|Shanghai Second Medical University]] scientists in 2003, the result of having fused human cells with rabbit eggs.&lt;ref name=Mott&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0125_050125_chimeras.html|first=Mott|last=Maryann|date=January 25, 2005|title=Animal-Human Hybrids Spark Controversy|publisher=''[[National Geographic News]]''|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, a [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. patent]] has notably been granted for a mouse chimera with a human [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

In terms of [[Bioethics|scientific ethics]], restrictions on the creation of human–animal hybrids have proved a controversial matter in multiple countries. While the state of [[Arizona]] banned the practice altogether in 2010, a proposal on the subject that sparked some interest in the [[United States Senate]] from 2011 to 2012 ended up going nowhere. Although the two concepts are not strictly related, discussions of experimentation into blended human and animal creatures has paralleled the discussions around [[Embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem-cell research]] (the '[[stem cell controversy]]').&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt; The creation of [[genetically modified organism]]s for a multitude of purposes has taken place in the modern world for decades, examples being specifically designed foodstuffs made to have features such as higher crop yields through better disease resistance.&lt;ref name=foods&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Caroline|date=February 2, 2014|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/builtlean/diet-and-nutrition_b_4323937.html|title=7 Most Common Genetically Modified Foods|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the legal and moral controversy over the possible real-life making of such beings,&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; then President [[George W. Bush]] even speaking on the subject in his [[2006 State of the Union Address|2006 State of the Union]],&lt;ref name=Bush/&gt; the concept of humanoid creatures with hybrid characteristics from animals, played in a dramatic and [[Sensationalism|sensationalized]] fashion, has continued to be a popular element of fictional media in the digital age. Examples include ''[[Splice (film)|Splice]]'', a [[2009 in film|2009 movie]] about experimental genetic research,&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt; and ''[[The Evil Within]]'', a [[survival horror]] video game released in 2014 in which the [[protagonist]] fights grotesque hybrid creatures among other enemies.&lt;ref name=evil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/21/the-evil-within-review|title=Despite occasional brilliance, 'Evil Within' falls short of its horror game predecessors|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|first=Jonathon|last=Dornbush|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary historical and mythological human-animal hybrids==

Beings displaying a mixture of human and animal traits while also having a similarly blended appearance have played a vast and varied role in multiple traditions around the world.&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt; Artist and scholar [[Pietro Gaietto]] has written that "representations of human-animal hybrids always have their origins in religion". In "successive traditions they may change in meaning but they still remain within spiritual culture", Gaietto has argued, when looking back in an [[evolution]]-minded point of view. The beings show up in both [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], with various elements of [[ancient Egyptian]] society ebbing and flowing into those cultures in particular. Prominent examples in [[ancient Egyptian religion]], featuring some of the earliest such hybrid beings, include the [[Canidae|canine]]-like [[Psychopomp|god of death]] known as [[Anubis]] and the lion-like [[Sphinx]].&lt;ref name=beauty&gt;{{cite book|pages=190–192|title=Phylogensesis of Beauty|author=[[Pietro Gaietto]]|isbn=9781291842951|publisher=Lulu Press Inc|date=2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u8uwBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=Pietro+Gaietto+human-animal#v=onepage&amp;q=Pietro%20Gaietto%20human-animal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Self-published book|date=July 2018}} Other instances of these types of characters include figures within both [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]] and [[Japanese mythology]].&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mair/&gt; The observation of [[interspecies friendships]] within the animal kingdom, as well as the bonds existing between humans and their pets, have been a source of the appeal in such stories.&lt;ref name=arts/&gt;

A prominent hybrid figure that's internationally known is the [[Greek mythology|mythological Greek]] figure of Pan. A deity that rules over and symbolizes the untamed wild, he helps express the inherent beauty of the natural world as the Greeks saw things. He specifically received reverence by ancient [[hunter]]s, fishermen, shepherds, and other groups with a close connection to nature. Pan is a Satyr who possesses the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat while otherwise being essentially human in appearance; stories of his encounters with different gods, humans, and others have been [[Pan in popular culture|a part of popular culture]] in several different cultures for many years.&lt;ref name=delphian/&gt; The human-animal hybrid has appeared in acclaimed works of art by figures such as [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref name=wet/&gt; also being mentioned in [[Poetry|poetic pieces]] such as in [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher's]] writings.&lt;ref name=delphian/&gt;

In [[Chinese mythology]], the figure of [[Zhu Bajie|Chu Pa-chieh]] undergoes a personal journey in which he gives up wickedness for virtue. After causing a disturbance in heaven from his licentious actions, he is exiled to Earth. By mistake, he enters the womb of a sow and ends up being born as a half-man/half-pig entity. With the head and ears of a pig coupled with a human body, his already animal-like sense of selfishness from his past life remains. [[Matricide|Killing and eating his mother]] as well as [[Fratricide|devouring his brothers]], he makes his way to a mountain hideout, spending his days preying on unwary travelers unlucky enough to cross his path. However, the exhortations of the kind [[goddess]] [[Guanyin|Kuan Yin]], journeying in China, persuade him to seek a nobler path, and his life's journey and the side of goodness proceeds on such that he even is ordained a priest by the goddess herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[E.T.C. Werner]]|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15250/15250-h/15250-h.htm|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]|accessdate=August 6, 2015|title=Myths &amp; Legends of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remarking on the character's role in the religious novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', where the being first appears, professor [[Victor H. Mair]] has commented that "[p]ig-human hybrids represent descent and the grotesque, a capitulation to the basest appetites" rather than "self-improvement".&lt;ref name=Mair&gt;{{cite book|title=The Columbia History of Chinese Literature|author=[[Victor H. Mair]]|date=2013|pages=129|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231528511|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n2DfEmr2g0YC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Chu++pig-human+hybrid#v=onepage&amp;q=Chu%20%20pig-human%20hybrid&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tanuki-statues.jpg|thumb|This image depicts a set of [[Japanese raccoon dog|Tanuki]] statues on the side of a Japanese road.]]

Several hybrid entities have long played a major role in Japanese media and in traditional beliefs within the country. For example, a warrior god known as Amida received worship as a part of [[Japanese mythology]] for many years; he possessed a generally humanoid appearance while having a canine-like head. However, the god's devotional popularity fell in about the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=beauty/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Self-published book|date=July 2018}} A [[Japanese raccoon dog|Tanuki]] resembles a [[raccoon]] or [[badger]], but its [[shape-shifting]] talents allow it to turn into humans for the purposes of trickery, such as impersonating [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s. The fox-like creatures known as [[Kitsune]] also possess similar powers, and stories abound of them tricking human men into marriage by turning into seductive women.&lt;ref name=Margo&gt;{{cite book|title=Animals and Society: An Introduction to Human-Animal Studies|first=Margo|last=DeMello|pages=301–211|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oSzMwRG98YMC&amp;pg=PT324&amp;dq=%22human-animal+hybrid%22+Margo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22human-animal%20hybrid%22%20Margo&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|date=2012|isbn=9780231152952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include characters in ancient [[Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. The latter region has had the tradition of a malevolent human-animal hybrid deity in [[Pazuzu]], the [[demon]] featuring a humanoid shape yet having grotesque features such as sharp [[Claw#Birds|talons]].&lt;ref name=beauty/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Self-published book|date=July 2018}} The character picked up revived attention when [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|an interpretation of it]] appeared in [[William Peter Blatty]]'s [[1971 in literature|1971 novel]] ''[[The Exorcist (novel)|The Exorcist]]'' and the [[Academy Award]] winning [[The Exorcist (film)|1973 film adaption of the same name]], with the demon possessing the body of an innocent young girl. The movie, regarded as [[List of films regarded as the best|one of the greatest horror films of all time]], has a prologue in which co-protagonist [[Father Merrin]] ([[Max von Sydow]]) visits an [[archaeological dig]] in Iraq and ominously discovers an old statue of the monstrous being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Holtzclaw|accessdate=August 8, 2015|url=http://www.dailypress.com/entertainment/blog/dp-popcorn-the-exorcist-1024-story.html|title=The sound and fury of 'The Exorcist'|date=October 24, 2014|publisher=''[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=August 8, 2015|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2013/12/26/the-exorcist-facts/|title='The Exorcist': 25 Things You Didn't Know About the Terrifying Horror Classic|date=December 26, 2013|first=Gary|last=Susman|publisher=[[moviefone.com|news.moviefone.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==More modern portrayals of fictional hybrids==

Many prominent pieces of children's literature over the past two centuries have featured humanized animal characters, often as [[protagonists]] in the stories. In the opinion of popular educator [[Lucy Sprague Mitchell]], the appeal of such mythical and fantastic beings comes from how children desire "direct" language "told in terms of images— visual, auditory, tactile, muscle images". Another author has remarked that an "animal costume" provides "a way to emphasize or even exaggerate a particular characteristic". The [[anthropomorphic]] characters in the seminal works by English writer [[Beatrix Potter]] in particular live an ambiguous situation, having human dress yet displaying many instinctive animal traits. Writing on the popularity of [[Peter Rabbit]], a later author commented that in "balancing humanized domesticity against wild rabbit foraging, Potter subverted parental authority and its built in hypocrisy" in Potter's child-centered books. Writer Lisa Fraustino has cited on the subject [[R. M. Lockley|R.M. Lockley]]'s tongue-in-cheek observation: "Rabbits are so human. Or is it the other way around— humans are so rabbit?"&lt;ref name=rabbit&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and Children's Literature

Writer [[H. G. Wells]] created his famous work ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', featuring a mixture of [[Horror literature|horror]] and [[Science fiction literature|science fiction]] elements, to promote the anti-[[vivisection]] cause as a part of his long-time advocacy for [[animal rights]]. Wells' story describes a man stuck on an island ruled over by the titular Dr. Moreau, a morally depraved scientist who has created several human-animal hybrids even by combining parts of other animals. The story has been adapted into film several times, with varying success.  The most acclaimed version is the 1932 [[black-and-white]] treatment called ''[[Island of Lost Souls (1932 film)|Island of Lost Souls]]''.&lt;ref name=fone&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2013/09/06/leonardo-dicaprio-island-of-dr-moreau/

Wells himself wrote that "this story was the response of an imaginative mind to the reminder that humanity is but animal rough-hewn to a reasonable shape and in perpetual internal conflict between instinct and injunction," with the scandals surrounding [[Oscar Wilde]] being the impetus for the English writer's treatment of themes such as ethics and psychology. Challenging the [[Victorian era]] viewpoints of its time, the [[1896 in literature|1896 work]] presents a complex situation in which enhancing animals into hybrids involves both terrifying violence and pain as well as appears essentially futile, given the power of raw instinct. A pessimistic view towards the ability of human civilization to live by [[Rule of law|law-abiding]], [[Morality|moral standards]] for long thus follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=187–212|title=Compassion: The Culture and Politics of an Emotion|editor=Lauren Gail Berlant|author=Neville Hoad|date=2004|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YnkJYokNO2sC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22response+of+an+imaginative+mind+to+the+reminder+that+humanity+is%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22response%20of%20an%20imaginative%20mind%20to%20the%20reminder%20that%20humanity%20is%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780415970525|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kemonomimi mouse.png|thumb|right|The [[Kemonomimi]] art style, widely popularized since the latter part of the 20th century, involves humanoid characters with stylized animal features, such as this mouse girl.]]
The 1986 [[horror film]] ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' features a deformed and monstrous human-animal hybrid, played by actor [[Jeff Goldblum]].&lt;ref name=arts/&gt; His character, scientist Seth Brundle, undergoes a [[teleportation]] experiment that goes awry and fuses him at a fundamental genetic level with a [[Housefly|common fly]] caught besides him. Brundle experiences drastic mutations as a result that horrify him. Movie critic Gerardo Valero has written that the famous horror work, "released at the dawn of the [[AIDS epidemic]]", "was seen by many as a metaphor for the disease" while also playing on bodily fears about [[dismemberment]] and coming apart that human beings inherently share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Valero|first=Gerardo|date=January 13, 2014|title=David Cronenberg's "The Fly"|publisher=[[rogerebert.com]]|accessdate=August 6, 2015|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/far-flung-correspondents/the-fly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[science fiction film]] ''[[Splice (film)|Splice]]'', released 2009, shows scientists mixing together human and animal [[DNA]] in the hopes of advancing medical research at the pharmaceutical company that they work at. Calamitous results occur.&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;

The [[H.P. Lovecraft]] inspired movie ''[[Dagon (film)|Dagon]]'', released in 2001, additionally features grotesque hybrid beings. In terms of [[comic book]]s, examples of fictional human-animal hybrids include the characters in [[Charles Burns (cartoonist)|Charles Burns]]' ''[[Black Hole (comics)|Black Hole]]'' series. In those comics, a set of teenagers in a 1970s era town become afflicted by a bizarre disease; the [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted affliction]] mutates them into monstrous forms.&lt;ref name=arts/&gt;

Multiple video games have featured human-animal hybrids as enemies for the protagonist(s) to defeat, including powerful [[Boss (video game)|boss characters]]. For instance, the 2014 [[survival horror]] release ''[[The Evil Within]]'' includes grotesque hybrid beings, looking like the [[undead]], attacking main character Detective Sebastian Castellanos. With partners Joseph Oda and Julie Kidman, the protagonist attempts investigate a multiple homicide at a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] yet discovers a mysterious figure who turns the world around them into a living nightmare, Castellanos having to find the truth about the criminal [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;

[[Hero|Heroic character]] examples of human-animal anthropomorphic characters include the two protagonists of the [[2002 in film|2002 movie]] ''[[The Cat Returns]]'' ([[Japanese language|Japanese title]]: 猫の恩返し), with the [[Animation|animated film]] featuring a young girl (named "Haru") being transformed against her will into a [[Felidae|feline]]-human hybrid and fighting a villainous king of the cats with the help of a dashing male cat companion (known as the "Baron") at her side. The English language version of the film features [[Anne Hathaway]] and [[Cary Elwes]] in the main roles, respectively.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;{{cite web|date=September 23, 2005|url=http://movie-gazette.com/1423|title=The Cat Returns|publisher=movie-gazette.com|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TVGuide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/cat-returns/review/284368/|first=Robert|last=Pardi|title=The Cat Returns|publisher=[[TVGuide.com]]|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critically acclaimed movie, with a score of 89% from [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_cat_returns/ |title=The Cat Returns |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=September 1, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901080606/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_cat_returns |archivedate=September 1, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was directed by [[Hiroyuki Morita]].&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt;&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt; In one notable moment, the once-again human Haru confesses to having [[Romance (love)|romantic feelings]] for the Baron, who responds in an ambiguous manner before leaving (vowing to be there for her again when needed).

===Background and technological analyses===
{{see also|History of genetic engineering}}

[[File:Bluetomato.jpg|thumb|right|upright|These [[Blue tomato|blue-colored tomatoes]] are an example of a [[genetically modified food]].]]

Broadly speaking, a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] being has one cell line throughout its entire body and came originally from a mix of entities, with different species involved to make a new genetic combination. For instance, a [[liger]] has a lion father and a [[tigress]] mother, such a creature only existing in [[Captivity (animal)|captivity]]. Such hybridization has frequently caused difficult health problems that caregivers for the captive animals struggle with.&lt;ref name=zonkey&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Roxanne|date=July 25, 2013|title=Zonkey, Wholphin, Liger, Tigon: Fascinating Animal Hybrids|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/zonkey-wholphin-liger-tigon-fascinating-animal-hybrids-photos-1359907|publisher=''[[International Business Times]]''|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[chimera (biology)|chimera]] is not the same thing as a hybrid because it is a being composed of two or more genetically distinct cell lines in one entity. The entity does not exist as a member of a separate species but has differing elements inside of it. An animal that has experienced an [[organ transplant]] or related surgery involving tissues from a different species is an example.&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;

Throughout past [[human evolution]], hybridization occurred in many different instances, such as cross-breeding between [[Neanderthal]]s and ancient versions of what are now modern humans. Some scientists have believed that particular genes of the Neanderthal may have been key to ancient humans' adapting to the harsh [[climate]]s they faced [[Recent African origin of modern humans|when they left Africa]]. However, mixing between species in the wild both now and through natural history have generally resulted in [[Infertility|sterile offspring]], thus being a kind of dead end in reproductive terms.&lt;ref name=zonkey/&gt;

For much of modern history, the creation of [[genetically modified organism]]s in general was a topic rooted in fiction rather than practical research. This has changed significantly over the past few decades such that a number of plants and animals are commonly subject to [[genetic engineering]] for commercial purposes. For example, as of 2013 about 85% of the corn grown in the US as well as about 90% of its [[canola]] crops have been genetically modified.&lt;ref name=foods/&gt; As well, many Americans that have had cardiovascular surgery have had heart valves initially from pigs used in their procedures.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19781-2005Feb12.html|last=Weiss|first=Rick|date=February 13, 2005|title=U.S. Denies Patent for a Too-Human Hybrid|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues relating to possible human-animal hybrids outside of a fictional, historical, or mythic context but as real, engineered beings received major international attention in 2003, after some Chinese scientists at the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine|Shanghai Second Medical University]] managed to successfully fuse human cells with rabbit eggs. The embryos formed reportedly were the first stable human-animal chimeras in existence. Research in similar areas continued into 2004 and 2005, with the topic picking up coverage from publications such as ''[[National Geographic News]]''. The [[National Academy of Sciences]] soon began to look into the ethical questions involved.&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt; The [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] additionally stirred interest into the topic by granting a patent request for a genetically modified mouse with a human [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Scientists announced in 2017 that they successfully created the first human-animal chimeric embryo. The embryo consisted mostly pig cells and some human cells.  Scientists stated that they hope to use this technology to address the shortage of donor organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/human-pig-hybrid-embryo-chimera-organs-health-science/|title=Human-Pig Hybrid Created in the Lab—Here Are the Facts|date=2017-01-26|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and moral discussions===
[[File:20080618 Bush Kempthorne oil exploration speech.jpg|thumb|right|[[POTUS|President]] [[George W. Bush]], pictured here in 2008 with then [[U.S. Interior Secretary|Interior Secretary]] [[Dirk Kempthorne]] to his side, has advocated for increased [[regulation of genetic engineering]], including on research mixing animal and human elements.]]

{{see also|Bioethics|Regulation of genetic engineering}}

Advances in [[genetic engineering]] have generally caused a large amount of debates and discussion in the fields related to [[bioethics]], and research relating to the hypothetical creation of human-animal hybrids in the future has been no exception. The technical analyses of intermingling human-based and animal-based genetic material are ongoing; the ethical, moral, and legal issues arising from actual research using chimeras (rather than hybrids per se) at the moment also touch more speculative concerns as well. While laws against the creation of hybrid beings have been proposed in U.S. states and in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], several scientists have argued that legal barriers might go too far and prohibit medically beneficial studies into human modification.&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Although the two topics are not strictly related, the debates involving the creation of human-animal hybrids have paralleled that of the debates around the stem-cell research controversy.&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;

The question of what line exists between a 'human' being and a 'non-human' being has been a difficult one for many researchers to answer. While animals having one percent or less of their cells originally coming from humans may clearly appear to be in the same boat as other animals, no consensus exists on how to think about beings in a genetic middle ground that have something like an even mix. "I don't think anyone knows in terms of crude percentages how to differentiate between humans and nonhumans," [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. patent office]] official John Doll has stated.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Critics of increased government restrictions include scientists such as Dr. Douglas Kniss, head of the Laboratory of PeriNatal Research at [[Ohio State University]], who has remarked that formal laws aren't the best option since the "notion of animal–human hybrids is very complex." He's also argued that their creation is inherently "not the kind of thing we support" in his kind of research since scientists should "want to respect human life".&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt; "There are chimeras out there that serve very valuable purposes in medical research, such as mice that make human antibodies," Michael Werner, the chief of policy for the [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]], has commented.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

In contrast, notable socio-economic theorist [[Jeremy Rifkin]] has expressed opposition to research that creates beings crossing species boundaries, arguing that it interferes with the fundamental 'right to exist' possessed by each animal species. "One doesn't have to be religious or into animal rights to think this doesn't make sense," he has argued when expressing support for anti-chimera and anti-hybrid legislation. As well, William Cheshire, associate professor of neurology at the [[Mayo Clinic]]'s Florida branch, has called the issue "unexplored biologic territory" and advocated for a "moral threshold of human neural development" to restrict the destroying a human embryo to obtain cell material and/or the creation of an organism that's partly human and partly animal." He has said, "We must be cautious not to violate the integrity of humanity or of animal life over which we have a stewardship responsibility".&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;

In the U.S., efforts into creating a hybrid entity appeared to be legal when the topic first came up. The developmental biologist [[Stuart Newman]], a professor at [[New York Medical College]] in [[Valhalla, N.Y.]], applied for a patent on a human-animal chimera in 1997 as a challenge to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], motivated by his moral and scientific opposition to the notion that living things can be patented at all. Prior legal precedent had established that genetically engineered entities in general could be patented, even if they were based on beings occurring in nature.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

After a seven-year process, Newman's patent finally received a flat rejection. The legal process had created a paper trail of arguments, giving Newman what he considered a victory. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran an article on the controversy that stated that it had raised "profound questions about the differences-- and similarities-- between humans and other animals, and the limits of treating animals as property."&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; President [[George W. Bush]] brought up the topic in his [[2006 State of the Union Address]], in which he called for the prohibition of "human cloning in all its forms", "creating or implanting embryos for experiments", "creating ''human-animal hybrids''", and also "buying, selling, or patenting human embryos". He argued, "A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life." He also stated that humanity "should never be discarded, devalued or put up for sale."&lt;ref name=Bush&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/31/AR2006013101468.html|title=President Bush's State of the Union Address – CQ Transcripts Wire|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=August 8, 2015|date=January 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 appropriations bill passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Bush contained specific wording forbidding any patents on humans or human embryos.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; In terms of outright bans on hybrid research in the first place, a measure came up in the [[110th Congress]] entitled the ''Human-Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2008''. Politician [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]], [[New Jersey's 4th congressional district|NJ-4]]) introduced it on April 24, 2008. The text of the proposed act stated that "human dignity and the integrity of the human species are compromised" if such hybrids exist and set up a punishment of imprisonment for up to ten years as well as a fine of over one million dollars. Though attracting support from many co-sponsors such as then [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] [[Mary Fallin]], [[Duncan Hunter]], [[Joseph R. Pitts]], and [[Rick Renzi]] among others, the Act failed to get through Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 5910 (110th): Human-Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2008|publisher=[[GovTrack]]|accessdate=August 8, 2015|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr5910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related proposal had come up in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] the prior year, the ''Human–Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2007'', and it also had failed. That effort was proposed by then Senator [[Sam Brownback]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]], [[Kansas|KS]]) on November 15, 2007. Featuring the same language as the later measure in the House, its bipartisan group of cosponsors included then Senators [[Tom Coburn]], [[Jim DeMint]], and [[Mary Landrieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2358 (110th): Human–Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2007|publisher=[[GovTrack]]|accessdate=August 8, 2015|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/s2358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A localized measure designed to ban the creation of hybrid entities came up in the state of [[Arizona]] in 2010. The proposal was signed into law by then [[List of Governors of Arizona|Governor]] [[Jan Brewer]]. Its sponsor stated that it was needed to clarify important "ethical boundaries" in research.&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;

The '''Incunabula Short Title Catalogue''' (ISTC) is an electronic [[bibliography|bibliographic]] [[database]] maintained by the [[British Library]] which seeks to catalogue all known [[incunabula]]. The database lists books by individual editions, recording standard bibliographic details for each edition as well as giving a brief census of known copies, organised by location. It currently holds records of over 30,000 editions.&lt;ref name="bl1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html|title=Incunabula Short Title Catalogue|work=bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Previous efforts to comprehensively catalog 15th century printing include [[Georg Wolfgang Panzer]]'s ''Annales Typographici ab Artis Inventae Origine ad Annum MD'' (1793–97) and [[Ludwig Hain]]'s ''Repertorium Bibliographicum'' (1822).  Hain's work was later supplemented by Copinger's ''Supplement'' and Reichling's ''Appendices'', which would pave the way for the ''[[Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke]]'' (1925).  The ''Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke'' (''GW'') was the most comprehensive catalog of incunables to date (and still offers more in-depth information than ISTC),&lt;ref name="pn2"&gt;Needham, Paul (1993), "Incunable catalogs,"  ''Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America'' 87:1, p. 371-372.&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent decades work on the catalog has slowed to such a degree that the goal of cataloging all extant incunables under the ''GW'''s system is indefinitely far-off.&lt;ref name="pn1"&gt;Needham, Paul (1998), "Counting incunables: The IISTC CD-ROM," ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 61:3/4, p. 456-529.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISTC was created to establish a system of incunable cataloging that was simple enough to be expanded quickly, bringing the goal of a complete incunable catalog back into focus. Furthermore, the ISTC would use standardized entries that could be entered into a machine-searchable database.

Work on the ISTC began in 1980 under the leadership of the British Library's Lotte Hellinga. [[Frederick R. Goff]]'s ''Incunabula in American Libraries'' (1973) was the first pre-existing catalog to be keyed into ISTC's database. Besides providing the catalog's first 12,900 entries, Goff's system for classifying information about incunables formed the basis for the structure of ISTC's records. Entries for all of the incunables in British Library and the Italian [[union catalog]] (IGI) were added next, followed by other national incunable catalogs.&lt;ref name="b15"&gt;Hellinga, Lotte, and Goldfinch, John (eds) (1987), ''Bibliography and the study of 15th-century civilisation: Papers presented at a colloquium at the British Library 26–28 September 1984'' (London: British Library).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Records ==
ISTC records retain many characteristics of the records from Goff's census. Each record represents one [[edition (book)|edition]] of a work.  Information such as [[author]], [[title]], [[Printer (publisher)|printer]], place of printing, year of printing, language, and format is entered into discrete fields to make the records searchable by a computer. Catalogue entries are reduced to a standard form, for ease of indexing and access, which includes the use of standard names for authors and printers—a major issue in an era where the use of [[List of Latinised names|Latinised names]] and vernacular ones interchangeably was common—and contemporary English names for places. Dates are reduced to conventional years where possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://138.253.81.72/~cheshire/istc/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

The ISTC has recorded 29,777 editions to date, although some of the records included in that number are actually 16th-century works that were included in previous incunable catalogs in error, so the number of true incunabula recorded is 27,460.&lt;ref name="bl2"&gt;http://www.bl.uk/collections/hoinc.html&lt;/ref&gt; The number of extant incunabula is estimated to be approximately 28,000 editions, which puts ISTC extraordinarily close to completing its goal of total coverage.  Documenting these last few hundred editions is a tremendous undertaking, as the works are scattered in unknown locations in many countries, leaving bibliographers with no organized way to search for them except to "look everywhere".&lt;ref name="pn1"/&gt;

While the ISTC is unsurpassed in coverage, it does not offer the same level of detail as the ''Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke'' or the numerous [[collection catalog]]s that are available. Rather, the ISTC complements these resources by providing a searchable [[Bibliographic index|index]] of editions, referring to other catalogs and bibliographies for further detail. ISTC does not include information about individual copies of a work as standard, though a brief census of confirmed locations is provided, and may contain brief notes.&lt;ref name="pn2"/&gt;

In general, the ISTC only covers extant editions, although records exist for some works that were sufficiently well-documented before being lost to fire or other calamities.

An illustrated edition of the ISTC was made available on [[CD-ROM]] in 1998. The addition of illustrations offers important information about a book's layout, format, and printing type. The images represent samples of each text rather than the full text.&lt;ref name="bl2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26187">'''[[Infanticide (zoology)|Infanticide]] in non-human [[primate]]s''' occurs when an individual kills its own or another individual's dependent young. Five hypotheses have been proposed to explain infanticide in non-human primates: [[Exploitation competition|exploitation]], resource [[Competition (biology)|competition]], parental manipulation, [[sexual selection]], and social pathology.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Hypotheses for infanticide  ==

=== Exploitation ===
[[File:Cebus albifrons edit3.jpg|thumb|A white fronted capuchin sits in a tree. Cases of infantidice in white fronted capuchins have been attributed to resource competition.]]
Infanticide in non-human primates occurs as a result of exploitation when the individuals enacting the infanticide directly benefit from consumption or use of their victim.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The individual can become a resource: food ([[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]]), protective buffer against aggression, or a prop to obtain maternal experience.

The form of exploitation in non-human primates most attributable to adult females is when non-lactating females take an infant from its mother ([[allomothering]]) and forcibly retain it until starvation. This is known as the "aunting to death" phenomena; these non-lactating female primates gain mothering-like experience, yet lack the resources to feed the infant.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Resource Competition ===
Resource competition results when there are too few resources in a particular area to support the existing population. In primates, resource competition is a prime motivator for infanticide. Infanticide motivated by resource competition can occur both outside of and within familial groups. Dominant, high ranking, female chimpanzees have been shown to more often aggress towards a lower ranking female and her infant due to resource competition.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pusey|first=Anne E.|last2=Schroepfer-Walker|first2=Kara|date=2013-12-05|title=Female competition in chimpanzees|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=368|issue=1631|pages=|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0077|issn=0962-8436|pmc=3826206|pmid=24167307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primates from outside of familial groups might infiltrate areas and kill infants from other groups to eliminate [[Competition (biology)|competition]] for resources. When resources are limited, infants are  easier to eliminate from the competition pool than other group members because they are the most defenseless and thus become targets of infanticide. Primate infanticide motivated by resource competition can also involve [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalizing]] the infant as a source of nutrition.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hrdy|first=Sarah|year=1979|title=Infanticide among animals: A review, classification, and examination of the implications for the reproductive strategies of females|url=http://www.ehbonline.org/article/0162-3095(79)90004-9/abstract|journal=Evolution &amp; Human Behavior|volume=1|pages=13–40|via=|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(79)90004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resource competition is also a primary motivator in inter-species infanticide, or the killing of infants from one species by another species. Through eliminating infants of another species in the same environment, the probability that the aggressor and their own infants will obtain more resources increases. This behavior has been an observed consequence of multiple primate inter-species conflicts. In these cases, instances of direct aggression toward inter-specific infants in addition to infanticide have also been observed. In these instances of direct aggression, the aggressor was the previous target of intra-species aggression directed towards them. Therefore, the direct aggression and infanticide carried out by these aggressors could be attributed to re-directed aggression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rimbach|first=Rebecca|last2=Pardo-Martinez|first2=Alejandra|last3=Montes-Rojas|first3=Andres|last4=Di Fiore|first4=Anthony|last5=Link|first5=Andres|date=2012-11-01|title=Interspecific Infanticide and Infant-Directed Aggression by Spider Monkeys (Ateles hybridus) in a Fragmented Forest in Colombia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.22052/abstract|journal=American Journal of Primatology|language=en|volume=74|issue=11|pages=990–997|doi=10.1002/ajp.22052|issn=1098-2345|pmc=3470929|pmid=22767357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parental Manipulation ===

==== Maternal Infanticide ====
Maternal Infanticide, the killing of dependent young by the mother, is rare in non-human primates and has been reported only a handful of times. Maternal infanticide has been reported once in brown mantled tamarins, ''[[Brown-mantled tamarin|Saguinus fuscicollis]],'' once in black fronted titis, ''[[Black-fronted titi|Callicebus nigrifrons]],'' and four times in mustached tamarins, ''[[Moustached tamarin|Saguinus mystax]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culot|first=Laurence|last2=Lledo-Ferrer|first2=Yvan|last3=Hoelscher|first3=Oda|last4=Lazo|first4=Fernando J.

This may allow the mother to invest more in her current offspring or future offspring, leading to a greater net reproductive fitness in the mother.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[File:Callicebus nigrifrons Minas Gerais.jpg|thumb|''Callicebus nigrifrons'' perched in the trees. Maternal infanticide due to resource competition has been reported in ''C. nigifrons.'']]

In the instances of maternal infanticide in tamarins, there were multiple breeding females.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The parental manipulation hypothesis proposes that maternal infanticide occurs more frequently when the group has a poor capacity to raise offspring, multiple breeding females, birth intervals shorter than three months, and low infant survival probability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Maternal infanticide differs from other varieties of infanticide in that the resource competition and sexual selection hypotheses (see other sections) must be rejected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Resource competition and sexual selection are ruled out because it is the mother that is performing the infanticide, not another female.

In one case of maternal infanticide in wild black-fronted titi monkeys (''[[Black-fronted titi|Callicebus nigrifrons]]''), the observed deceased infant was clinically healthy with no signs of health abnormalities. Therefore, infanticide did not appear to occur due to low viability of infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cäsar|first=Cristiane|last2=Franco|first2=Eduardo Silva|last3=Soares|first3=Gabriela de Castro Nogueira|last4=Young|first4=Robert John|date=2008-04-01|title=Observed case of maternal infanticide in a wild group of black-fronted titi monkeys (Callicebus nigrifrons)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-007-0067-9|journal=Primates|language=en|volume=49|issue=2|pages=143–145|doi=10.1007/s10329-007-0067-9|issn=0032-8332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, overcrowding or feeding competition were not factors in infanticide. In this case, there were no clear functions of the infanticide; the reason for infanticide in black-fronted titi monkeys is currently unknown.

=== Sexual Selection ===

==== Sexual Competition ====
Infanticide increases a male's reproductive success when he takes over a new troop of females. This behavior has been observed in [[Colobinae|langurs]] who live in single male breeding groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hrdy|first=S. B.|date=1974-01-01|title=Male-male competition and infanticide among the langurs (Presbytis entellus) of Abu, Rajasthan|journal=Folia Primatologica; International Journal of Primatology|volume=22|issue=1|pages=19–58|doi=10.1159/000155616|issn=0015-5713|pmid=4215710}}&lt;/ref&gt; The females whose infants were killed exhibited estrous behavior and copulated with the new leader. These effects result from acceleration of the termination of [[lactational amenorrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altmann|first=J.|last2=Altmann|first2=S.

Infanticide by females other than the mother have been observed in wild groups of [[common marmoset]]s (''[[Common marmoset|Callithrix jacchus]]'').&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-0293-1_7|title=The Smallest Anthropoids|last=Digby|first=Leslie|last2=Saltzman|first2=Wendy|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781441902924|editor-last=Ford|editor-first=Susan M.|series=Developments in Primatology: Progress and Prospects|pages=135–153|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0293-1_7|editor-last2=Porter|editor-first2=Leila M.|editor-last3=Davis|editor-first3=Lesa C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cases of such behavior have been attributed to the resource competition hypothesis, in which females can gain more access to resources for herself and for her young by killing unrelated infants. Although commonly used in the context of food or shelter, the resource competition model can be applied to other limited resources, such as breeding opportunities or access to helpers. Most callitrichids have restrictive breeding patterns, which would be compatible with the model, but this infanticide behavior has only been documented in wild groups of common marmosets and not in wild groups of other callitrichid species. The higher frequency in common marmosets may be due to a variety of social, reproductive, and ecological characteristics - including higher likelihood for overlapping pregnancies and births (due to short intervals between births), habitat saturation, and lower costs of infant care compared to other callitrichids - that increase the chance of two breeding females inhabiting the same group, leading to more intense competition. In most observed cases in common marmosets, the socially dominant breeding females killed the infants of a subordinate female, allowing them to maintain their dominance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Paternal Infanticide ====
Paternal infanticide is rarely observed in non-human primates. In an extensive study of wild Japanese macaques which tracked instances of infanticide, DNA analysis revealed that males would not attack their own offspring or offspring of a female with whom they mated. Further, females in the study were found to be motivated to form social bonds with males in order to protect them from infanticide.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Social Pathology: Role of Social Organization ===
In mammals, interaction between the sexes is usually limited to the female [[Estrous cycle|estrous]] or copulation. However, in non-human primates, these male-female bonds persist past the estrous. Social relationships between males and females in primates are hypothesized to serve as protection against male infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palombit|first=Ryne A.|date=1999-01-01|title=Infanticide and the evolution of pair bonds in nonhuman primates|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(1999)7:43.0.CO;2-O/abstract|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=117–129|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(1999)7:43.0.CO;2-O|issn=1520-6505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Year-round association serves to lower the probability of infanticide by other males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Schaik|first=C P|last2=Kappeler|first2=P M|date=1997-11-22|year=|title=Infanticide risk and the evolution of male-female association in primates.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=264|issue=1388|pages=1687–1694|doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0234|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1688726|pmid=9404030|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many primates live in multi-female groups, and it has been proposed that these females live together to reduce the risk of infanticide through paternity confusion or [[concealed ovulation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kappeler|first=Peter M.|last2=Schaik|first2=Carel P. van|title=Evolution of Primate Social Systems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015520830318|journal=International Journal of Primatology|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=707–740|doi=10.1023/A:1015520830318|issn=0164-0291}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, complex interactions can arise when females have different social rankings and when resource availability is threatened. Most often, dominant females opportunistically kill the young of a less dominant female when competition arises.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Adaptive Counter Adaptations to Infanticide ==

Many primate species have developed counter adaptations to reduce the likelihood of infanticide. These strategies include physical defense, paternity confusion, reproduction suppression, and accelerated development.

=== Physical Defense ===

The most immediate and obvious form of protection against infanticide is physical defense wherein mothers either directly prevent aggressive acts toward their offspring or recruit other individuals for assistance. Female primates have been observed to actively defend territory from potentially infanticidal females, as seen in [[chimpanzee]]s.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agrell|first1=Jep|last2=Wolff|first2=Jerry O.|last3=Ylönen|first3=Hannu|title=Counter-Strategies to Infanticide in Mammals: Costs and Consequences|journal=Oikos|date=1 January 1998|volume=83|issue=3|pages=507–517|doi=10.2307/3546678|jstor=3546678}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reruit the non-parental assistance in defense, female [[chacma baboon]]s utilize "friendships" with males, wherein the male forms a bond with the infant until weaning, that may serve to protect their offspring from aggression by higher ranking males or females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Seyfarth|first2=Robert M|last3=Cheney|first3=Dorothy L|date=September 1997|title=The adaptive value of ‘friendships’ to female baboons: experimental and observational evidence|url=|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=54|issue=3|pages=599–614|doi=10.1006/anbe.1996.0457|last1=Palombit|first1=Ryne A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanuman Langur feeding child by N. A. Naseer.jpg|thumb|A Hanuman langur mother feeding an infant. Female Hanuman langurs are known to utilize paternity confusion through concealed ovulation.]]

To protect their young from infanticide, many species of primate mothers will form [[Social monogamy|social monogamous pairs]] to prevent paternal infanticide. In these pairs, the males will mate with other females but live exclusively with one female as a socially monogamous pair. Forming this socially monogamous pair causes the males to form parental relationships and social bonds with the female's offspring. These bonds motivate males to defend their offspring against infanticide from unrelated individuals and to never commit infanticide against their own offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opie|first=Christopher|last2=Atkinson|first2=Quentin D.|last3=Dunbar|first3=Robin I.

P.|last2=Dunbar|first2=R. I.

One study demonstrated that for [[gorillas]], living in [[Harem (zoology)|harem]]-style groups reduces a female’s risk of infanticide more than if she mated with multiple males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harcourt|first1=A.H.|last2=Greenberg|first2=J.|title=Do gorilla females join males to avoid infanticide? A quantitative model|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=November 2001|volume=62|issue=5|pages=905–915|doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female gorilla benefits more from protection by the silverback male, despite the fact that mating with only one male increased paternity certainty and thus increases the number of males in the population that would benefit reproductively from infanticide. However, it is likely that antipredation is also a closely linked motivation to the formation of gorilla social units.

=== Paternity Confusion ===

Females utilize paternity confusion to reduce the likelihood that a male she has mated with will kill her offspring. There are several ways this is accomplished including [[concealed ovulation]]. Female [[Catarrhini|catarrhine]] primates such as [[Gray langur|Hanuman langurs]] have evolved an extended estrous state with variable ovulation in order to conceal the paternity of the fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hestermann|first1=M.|last2=Ziegler|first2=T.|last3=van Schaik|first3=C.

This also allows sneak copulations in which non-dominant males sire offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henzi|first1=S. P.|last2=Clarke|first2=P. M. R.|last3=van Schaik|first3=C.

But there is some evidence to suggest that female synchrony serves to increase competition pressures and thus aggression in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrell, J., Wolff, J, &amp;Ylonen, H.|first=|year=1998|title=Counter-Strategies to Infanticide in Mammals: Costs and Consequences|jstor=3546678|journal=Oikos|volume=83|pages=507–517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction Suppression ===

Females may also avoid the costs of continued reproductive investment when infanticide is likely. One such occurrence is known as the Bruce Effect, in which female primates may abort the pregnancy when presented with a new male. This has been observed in wild [[gelada]]s, where a majority of females abort pregnancies following the displacement of a dominant male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Eila K.|last2=Lu|first2=Amy|last3=Bergman|first3=Thore J.|last4=Beehner|first4=Jacinta C.|date=2012-03-09|title=A Bruce Effect in Wild Geladas|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6073/1222|journal=Science|language=en|volume=335|issue=6073|pages=1222–1225|doi=10.1126/science.1213600|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22362878}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feticide]] is a related but distinct phenomenon by which physical or psychological trauma mediated by male behavior results in fetal loss. For example, in baboons at [[Amboseli Baboon Research Project|Amboseli]], rates of fetal loss increase following the immigration of aggressive males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zipple|first=Matthew N.|last2=Grady|first2=Jackson H.|last3=Gordon|first3=Jacob B.|last4=Chow|first4=Lydia D.|last5=Archie|first5=Elizabeth A.|last6=Altmann|first6=Jeanne|last7=Alberts|first7=Susan C.|date=2017-01-25|title=Conditional fetal and infant killing by male baboons|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1847/20162561|journal=Proc.

In some social systems, lower-ranking primate females may delay reproduction to avoid infanticide by dominant females, as seen in common [[marmosets]]. In one instance, the dominant marmoset female killed the offspring of a subordinate female. This phenomenon of reproduction suppression is also well observed in [[tamarins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Digby|first1=Leslie|title=Infant Care, Infanticide, and Female Reproductive Strategies in Polygynous Groups of Common Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1 January 1995|volume=37|issue=1|pages=51–61|jstor=4601105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accelerated Development ===

In order to reduce the amount of time that infants are particularly vulnerable to infanticide, females have been shown to wean infants earlier when risk of infanticide is high.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao, Borries, Pan|first=Qing, Carola, Wenshi|year=2011|title=Male takeover, infanticide, and female countertactics in white-headed leaf monkeys (Trachypithecus leucocephalus)|jstor=41414614|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=65|pages=1535–1547}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, female white-headed leaf monkeys were observed to wean their infants significantly more quickly during male takeovers as compared to socially stable periods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Females with infants too young to be weaned left with the old males and returned after their offspring had fully weaned, again after a significantly shorter weaning period than during stable times.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''International Whores' Day''' or '''International Sex Workers Day''' is observed annually on June 2 of each year, honours sex workers and recognises their often exploited working conditions. The event commemorates the occupation of [[Église Saint-Nizier]] in [[Lyon]] by more than a hundred sex workers on 2 June 1975 to draw attention to their inhumane working conditions.&lt;ref name="diewelt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article3878794/Kirche-soll-Prostituierte-nicht-ausgrenzen.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag – Kirche soll Prostituierte nicht ausgrenzen (International Whores' Day: The church shouldn't exclude the prostitutes) |date=2009-06-07 |language=German |publisher=Die Welt - Online |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been celebrated annually since 1976. In German, it is known as ''Hurentag'' (Whore's Day). In Spanish-speaking countries, it is the ''Día Internacional de la Trabajadora Sexual'', the International Day of the Sex Worker.

== Background ==
[[File:Sex worker statue Oudekerksplein Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Bronze statue ''Belle'' in front of the [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] in the [[De Wallen]] red-light district in [[Amsterdam]]. It was unveiled in March 2007 with the inscription "Respect sex workers all over the world."]]
In the 1970s, French police kept sex workers under increasing pressure. The police reprisals&lt;ref name="diewelt"/&gt; forced sex workers to work increasingly in secret. As a result, protection of sex workers decreased and led to more violence against them. After two murders and the unwillingness of the government to improve the situation, [[sex worker]]s in Lyon occupied the Saint-Nizier church in rue de Brest and went on strike. The striking workers sang political chants and demanded decent working conditions and an end to stigma.

The police cleared the church after eight days.&lt;ref name="bszonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiv.bszonline.de/index.php/24-archiv/urbi-et-orbi/2392-829-1-2.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag in Bochum (International Whores' Day in Bochum) |date=2010-05-17 |language=German |publisher=Bochumer Stadt- und Studierendenzeitung (bsz) |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event marks the starting point of an international movement of sex workers for [[sex workers' rights]].&lt;ref name="meritt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexclusivitaeten.de/herstory_leselust_09.html |title=Sag mir, wer die Huren sind (Tell me, where are the whores?) |date= |language=German |publisher=Sexclusivitäten - Laura Méritt |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurt Nikolai Zoege von Manteuffel''' (8 August 1881 – 10 January 1941) was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] [[art history|art historian]].

Kurt Zoege von Manteuffel was born in present-day [[Tallinn]], Estonia (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) and spent his childhood in Estonia. His father belonged to the [[Baltic nobility]] and his mother was Danish. He studied in [[Kassel]] and [[Königsberg]] and at the universities in [[Munich]], [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[Berlin]]. In 1909 he earned his doctoral degree; his dissertation was about [[Pisanello]]. He worked 1909-10 at the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]] in [[Aachen]] and the following three years as a member of the editorial board of an art encyclopaedia. Later he worked at the [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]], but volunteered to fight in [[World War I]] and was severely wounded in 1918. The following year he took up work in [[Dresden]] and in 1924 he became director of the [[Kupferstich-Kabinett, Dresden|Kupferstich-Kabinett]] there. He died in 1941 in [[Chojnice]].&lt;ref name="BBL"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://bbld.de/0000000110230254/query/Manteuffel-Kurt-Nikolai/|title= Zoege v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39496">In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''method of Lagrange multipliers''' (named after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]&lt;ref&gt;Mécanique Analytique sect. IV, 2 vols. Paris, 1811 https://archive.org/details/mcaniqueanalyt01lagr&lt;/ref&gt;) is a strategy for finding the local [[maxima and minima]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] subject to [[constraint (mathematics)|equality constraints]] (i.e., subject to the condition that one or more [[equation]]s have to be satisfied exactly by the chosen values of the variables). The great advantage of this method is that it allows the optimization to be solved without explicit [[parameterization]] in terms of the constraints. As a result, the method of Lagrange multipliers is widely used to solve challenging constrained optimization problems.

The method can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bramanti|first1=Marco|title=Matematica: Calcolo Infinitesimale e Algebra Lineare|date=2004|publisher=Zanichelli|location=Bologna|isbn=978-88-08-07547-5|pages=462–468|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# isolate any possible [[Singular point of an algebraic variety|singular point]] of the solution set of the constraining equations,
# find all the [[stationary point]]s of the ''Lagrange function'',
# establish which of those stationary points and singular points are global maxima (or minima, in case of minimization problems) of the objective function.

== Single constraint ==
[[Image:LagrangeMultipliers2D.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1: The red curve shows the constraint &lt;span style="color: DarkRed"&gt;{{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''c''}}&lt;/span&gt;. The blue curves are contours of &lt;span style="color:DarkSlateBlue"&gt;{{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}&lt;/span&gt;. The point where the red constraint tangentially touches a blue contour is the maximum of &lt;span style="color:DarkSlateBlue"&gt;{{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}&lt;/span&gt; along the constraint, since {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.]]

For the case of only one constraint and only two choice variables (as exemplified in Figure 1), consider the [[optimization problem]]

:maximize  {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}
:subject to {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}}.

(Sometimes an additive constant is shown separately rather than being included in ''g'', in which case the constraint is written {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''c''}}, as in Figure 1.) We assume that both {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} have continuous first [[partial derivative]]s.  We introduce a new variable ({{mvar|λ}}) called a '''Lagrange multiplier''' and study the '''Lagrange function''' (or '''Lagrangian''' or '''Lagrangian expression''') defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}(x,y,\lambda) = f(x,y) - \lambda \cdot g(x,y),&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{mvar|λ}} term may be either added or subtracted. If {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a maximum of {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} for the original constrained problem, then there exists {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a [[stationary point]] for the Lagrange function (stationary points are those points where the first partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; are zero). However, not all stationary points yield a solution of the original problem, as the method of Lagrange multipliers yields only a [[necessary condition]] for optimality in constrained problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bertsekas|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{springer | id=Lagrange_multipliers | title=Lagrange multipliers| first=I.B. | last=Vapnyarskii }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lasdon|1970|pages=xi+523}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiriart-Urruty|Lemaréchal|1993|pages=136–193 (and Bibliographical comments on pp.&amp;nbsp;334–335)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Computational combinatorial optimization: Papers from the Spring School held in Schloß Dagstuhl, May&amp;nbsp;15–19,&amp;nbsp;2000 |last=Lemaréchal |first=Claude |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2001 |isbn=3-540-42877-1 |editor-last=Jünger |editor-first=Michael |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=2241 |location=Berlin |pages=112–156 |chapter=Lagrangian relaxation |doi=10.1007/3-540-45586-8_4 |mr=1900016 |author-link=Claude Lemaréchal |editor-last2=Naddef |editor-first2=Denis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient conditions for a minimum or maximum [[Bordered Hessian|also exist]], but if a particular [[candidate solution]] satisfies the sufficient conditions, it is only guaranteed that that solution is the best one ''locally'' – that is, it is better than any permissible nearby points. The ''global'' optimum can be found by comparing the values of the original objective function at the points satisfying the necessary and locally sufficient conditions.

The method of Lagrange multipliers relies on the intuition that at a maximum, {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} cannot be increasing in the direction of any neighboring point where {{math|''g'' {{=}} 0}}. If it were, we could walk along {{math|''g'' {{=}} 0}} to get higher, meaning that the starting point wasn't actually the maximum.

We can visualize [[Contour line|contour]]s of {{mvar|f}} given by {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''d''}} for various values of {{mvar|d}}, and the contour of {{mvar|g}} given by {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}}.

Suppose we walk along the contour line with {{math|''g'' {{=}} 0}}. We are interested in finding points where {{mvar|f}} does not change as we walk, since these points might be maxima.

There are two ways this could happen: 

# We could be following a contour line of {{mvar|f}}, since by definition {{mvar|f}} does not change as we walk along its contour lines. This would mean that the contour lines of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are parallel here.
# We have reached a "level" part of {{mvar|f}}, meaning that {{mvar|f}} does not change in any direction.

To check the first possibility (we are following a contour line of {{mvar|f}}), notice that since the [[gradient]] of a function is perpendicular to the contour lines, the contour lines of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}}  are parallel if and only if the gradients of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are parallel. Thus we want points {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} where {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}} and

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{x,y} f = \lambda \nabla_{x,y} g,&lt;/math&gt;

for some {{mvar|λ}}

where

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{x,y} f= \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right), \qquad \nabla_{x,y} g= \left( \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

are the respective gradients. The constant {{mvar|λ}} is required because although the two gradient vectors are parallel, the magnitudes of the gradient vectors are generally not equal. This constant is called the Lagrange multiplier. (In some conventions {{mvar|λ}} is preceded by a minus sign).

Notice that this method also solves the second possibility, that {{mvar|f}} is level: if {{mvar|f}} is level, then its gradient is zero, and setting {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}} is a solution regardless of &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{x,y}g&lt;/math&gt;.

To incorporate these conditions into one equation, we introduce an auxiliary function

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}(x,y,\lambda) = f(x,y) - \lambda \cdot g(x,y), &lt;/math&gt;

and solve

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda)=0. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this amounts to solving three equations in three unknowns. This is the method of Lagrange multipliers. Note that &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda)=0&lt;/math&gt; implies {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}}. To summarize
:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda)=0 \iff 
\begin{cases}
\nabla_{x,y} f(x , y) = \lambda \nabla_{x,y} g(x , y)\\
 g(x,y) = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The method generalizes readily to functions on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{x_1, \dots, x_n,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x_1, \dots, x_n, \lambda)=0&lt;/math&gt;

which amounts to solving &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; equations in &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; unknowns.

The constrained extrema of {{mvar|f}} are ''[[Critical point (mathematics)|critical points]]'' of the Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, but they are not necessarily ''local extrema'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[#Example 2|Example 2]] below).

One may [[Hamiltonian mechanics#As a reformulation of Lagrangian mechanics|reformulate the Lagrangian]] as a [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]], in which case the solutions are local minima for the Hamiltonian. This is done in [[optimal control]] theory, in the form of [[Pontryagin's minimum principle]].

The fact that solutions of the Lagrangian are not necessarily extrema also poses difficulties for numerical optimization. This can be addressed by computing the ''magnitude'' of the gradient, as the zeros of the magnitude are necessarily local minima, as illustrated in the [[#Example 4: Numerical optimization|numerical optimization example]].

== Multiple constraints ==
[[Image:As wiki lgm parab.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2: A paraboloid constrained along two intersecting lines.]]
[[Image:As wiki lgm levelsets.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 3: Contour map of Figure 2.]]
The method of Lagrange multipliers can be extended to solve problems with multiple constraints using a similar argument. Consider a [[paraboloid]] subject to two line constraints that intersect at a single point. As the only feasible solution, this point is obviously a constrained extremum. However, the [[level set]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is clearly not parallel to either constraint at the intersection point (see Figure 3); instead, it is a linear combination of the two constraints' gradients. In the case of multiple constraints, that will be what we seek in general: the method of Lagrange seeks points not at which the gradient of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is multiple of any single constraint's gradient necessarily, but in which it is a linear combination of all the constraints' gradients.

Concretely, suppose we have &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; constraints and are walking along the set of points satisfying &lt;math&gt;g_i(\mathbf{x})=0, i=1, \dots, M&lt;/math&gt;. Every point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; on the contour of a given constraint function &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; has a space of allowable directions: the space of vectors perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\nabla g_i(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of directions that are allowed by all constraints is thus the space of directions perpendicular to all of the constraints' gradients.  Denote this space of allowable moves by &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and denote the span of the constraints' gradients by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;A = S^{\perp}&lt;/math&gt;, the space of vectors perpendicular to every element of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

We are still interested in finding points where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; does not change as we walk, since these points might be (constrained) extrema. We therefore seek &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; such that any allowable direction of movement away from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; (otherwise we could increase &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by moving along that allowable direction).  In other words, &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \in A^{\perp} = S&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus there are scalars {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''λ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^M  \lambda_k \nabla g_k (\mathbf{x})  \quad \iff \quad \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) -  \sum_{k=1}^M {\lambda_k \nabla g_k (\mathbf{x})} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

These scalars are the Lagrange multipliers. We now have &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of them, one for every constraint.

As before, we introduce an auxiliary function

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left( x_1,\ldots , x_n, \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda _M \right) = f\left( x_1, \ldots, x_n \right) - \sum\limits_{k=1}^M {\lambda_k g_k\left( x_1, \ldots , x_n \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

and solve

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{x_1, \ldots , x_n, \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda _M} \mathcal{L}(x_1, \ldots , x_n, \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda _M)=0 \iff 
\begin{cases}
\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) - \sum_{k=1}^M {\lambda_k \, \nabla g_k (\mathbf{x})} = 0\\
 g_1(\mathbf{x}) = \cdots = g_M(\mathbf{x}) = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

which amounts to solving &lt;math&gt;n+M&lt;/math&gt; equations in &lt;math&gt;n+M&lt;/math&gt; unknowns.

The method of Lagrange multipliers is generalized by the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]], which can also take into account inequality constraints of the form {{math|''h''('''x''')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''}}.


==Modern formulation via differentiable manifolds==

The problem of finding the local maxima and minima subject to constraints can be generalized to finding local maxima and minima on a [[differentiable manifold]].

===Single constraint===
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a [[smooth manifold]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that we wish to find the stationary points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of a smooth function &lt;math&gt;f:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; when restricted to the submanifold &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth function for which 0 is a [[regular value]] of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dg&lt;/math&gt; be the [[exterior derivative]]s. Stationarity for the restriction &lt;math&gt;f|_{N}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x\in N&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;d(f|_{N})_x=0&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, the kernel &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}(df_x)&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;T_x N=\operatorname{ker}(dg_x)&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;df_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dg_x&lt;/math&gt; are proportional vectors. For this it is necessary and sufficient that the following system of &lt;math&gt;m(m-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; equations holds:

:&lt;math&gt;df_x \wedge dg_x = 0 \in \Lambda^{2}(T^{*}_{x}M)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[exterior algebra|exterior product]]. The stationary points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are the solutions of the above system of equations plus the constraint &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the &lt;math&gt;m(m-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; equations are not independent, since the left-hand side of the equation belongs to the subvariety of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{2}(T^{*}_{x}M)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of [[exterior algebra|decomposable elements]].

In this formulation, it is not necessary to explicitly find the Lagrange multiplier, a number &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;df_x = \lambda dg_x&lt;/math&gt;.

===Multiple constraints===
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a [[smooth manifold]] embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; with codimension &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a differentiable function that we wish to maximize on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. By an extension of [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]] the local maxima occur at points where the [[exterior derivative]] &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lafontaine|p=[{{google books|id=KNhJCgAAQBAJ|pg=PA70|plainurl=yes}} 70]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, supposing we have a local [[coordinate chart]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi\colon U \to \mathbb{R}^{n-p}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;U \subseteq M&lt;/math&gt;, the extrema of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are a subset of the critical points of the function &lt;math&gt;f_\varphi = f \circ \varphi^{-1}\colon V \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the image of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
However, it is often difficult to compute &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; explicitly. ''The entire method of Lagrange multipliers reduces to the idea of skipping that step and finding the zeros of &lt;math&gt;df_\varphi&lt;/math&gt; directly.''

It remains to show that this notion of critical point is well defined. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; are charts on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; whose domains both contain some point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The chain rule implies that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(y)&lt;/math&gt; is a critical point of &lt;math&gt;f_\varphi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\psi(y)&lt;/math&gt; is a critical point of &lt;math&gt;f_\psi&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed,

:&lt;math&gt;f_\varphi=f\circ\varphi^{-1}=f\circ(\psi^{-1}\circ\psi)\circ\varphi^{-1}=f_\psi\circ(\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

The composition &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Atlas (topology)|transition map]] for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and therefore is a diffeomorphism. It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\varphi(y)}f_\varphi=D_{\psi(y)}f_\psi\circ D_{\varphi(y)}(\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}),&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt;D_{\varphi(y)}f_\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; map if and only if the same is true of &lt;math&gt;D_{\psi(y)}f_\psi&lt;/math&gt;. Formally, we're looking for points &lt;math&gt;y\in M&lt;/math&gt; such that for some (and hence any) chart &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(y)&lt;/math&gt; is a critical point of &lt;math&gt;f_\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jeffrey M. (2009). ''Manifolds and Differential Geometry.'' Providence: American Mathematical Society. p. 23. {{ISBN|978-0-8218-4815-9}}. Lee discusses a property being true specifically for some "and hence any" chart on a manifold.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose the manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is defined by a smooth [[level set]] function &lt;math&gt;g\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;M = \{ x \in\mathbb R^n : g(x) = c \}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g&lt;/math&gt; a [[Submersion (mathematics)|submersion]]. It follows from the construction in the level set theorem that the image of &lt;math&gt;D_x \varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\ker D_{\varphi^{-1}(x)} g \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, where we tacitly identify &lt;math&gt;T_{\varphi^{-1}(x)}M&lt;/math&gt; with a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; via the inclusion map on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt;0 = D_x f_\varphi = D_x (f \circ \varphi^{-1}) = D_{\varphi^{-1}(x)} f \circ D_x \varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\ker D_y g \subseteq \ker D_y f&lt;/math&gt;
writing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Again we can naturally interpret elements of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, particularly &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; itself, as points in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; via the inclusion map on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

By a combination of the first and third [[isomorphism theorems]], the image of &lt;math&gt;D_yf&lt;/math&gt; must be isomorphic to a subspace of the image of &lt;math&gt;D_yg&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that there exists a linear map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\colon\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \circ D_y g = D_y f&lt;/math&gt;. As a linear map, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} (x) = \lambda x&lt;/math&gt; for a fixed &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt;, so finding a critical point of &lt;math&gt;f_\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to solving the system of equations

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda D_y g =  D_y f&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g(y) = c&lt;/math&gt;

in the variables &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt;. This is in general a non-linear system of &lt;math&gt;n+p&lt;/math&gt; equations and &lt;math&gt;n+p&lt;/math&gt; unknowns.

Finding local maxima of a function &lt;math&gt;f: U \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is done by finding all points &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;D_x f = 0&lt;/math&gt; then checking whether all the eigenvalues of the Hessian &lt;math&gt;H_x f&lt;/math&gt; are negative. (Note that the maxima may not exist even if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous because &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is open, and also note that the conditions checked here are sufficient but not necessary for optimality.) Setting &lt;math&gt;D_x f = 0&lt;/math&gt; is a non-linear problem and in general, arbitrarily difficult. After finding the critical points, checking the eigenvalues is a linear problem and thus easy.

==Interpretation of the Lagrange multipliers==
Often the Lagrange multipliers have an interpretation as some quantity of interest.  For example, if the Lagrangian expression is

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \ldots;\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots) \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; f(x_1, x_2, \ldots) + \lambda_1(c_1-g_1(x_1, x_2, \ldots))+\lambda_2(c_2-g_2(x_1, x_2, \dots))+\cdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c_k} = \lambda_k.&lt;/math&gt;

So, {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the rate of change of the quantity being optimized as a function of the constraint parameter.
As examples, in [[Lagrangian mechanics]] the equations of motion are derived by finding stationary points of the [[Action (physics)|action]], the time integral of the difference between kinetic and potential energy.  Thus, the force on a particle due to a scalar potential, {{math|''F'' {{=}} −∇''V''}}, can be interpreted as a Lagrange multiplier determining the change in action (transfer of potential to kinetic energy) following a variation in the particle's constrained trajectory.  
In control theory this is formulated instead as [[costate equations]].

Moreover, by the [[envelope theorem]] the optimal value of a Lagrange multiplier has an interpretation as the marginal effect of the corresponding constraint constant upon the optimal attainable value of the original objective function: if we denote values at the optimum with an asterisk, then it can be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{d} f(x_1^*(c_1, c_2, \dots), x_2^*(c_1, c_2, \dots), \dots)}{\text{d} c_k} = \lambda_k^*.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, in economics the optimal profit to a player is calculated subject to a constrained space of actions, where a Lagrange multiplier is the change in the optimal value of the objective function (profit) due to the relaxation of a given constraint (e.g. through a change in income); in such a context {{math|''λ''*}} is the [[marginal cost]] of the constraint, and is referred to as the [[shadow price]].

==Sufficient conditions==
{{Main|Hessian matrix#Bordered Hessian}}

Sufficient conditions for a constrained local maximum or minimum can be stated in terms of a sequence of principal minors (determinants of upper-left-justified sub-matrices) of the bordered [[Hessian matrix]] of second derivatives of the Lagrangian expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chiang|1984|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Example 1===
[[Image:Lagrange very simple.svg|thumb|right|300px|Illustration of the constrained optimization problem]]

====Example 1a====

Suppose we wish to maximize &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=x+y&lt;/math&gt; subject to the constraint &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=1&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Candidate solution|feasible set]] is the unit circle, and the [[level set]]s of {{mvar|f}} are diagonal lines (with slope −1), so we can see graphically that the maximum occurs at &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and that the minimum occurs at &lt;math&gt;\left(-\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},-\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

For the method of Lagrange multipliers, the constraint is

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,y)=x^2+y^2-1,&lt;/math&gt;

hence

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) &amp;= f(x,y) + \lambda \cdot g(x,y) \\[4pt]
&amp;= x+y +  \lambda (x^2 + y^2 - 1).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can calculate the gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda) &amp;= \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} \right ) \\[4pt]
&amp;= \left ( 1  + 2 \lambda x, 1 + 2 \lambda y, x^2 + y^2 -1 \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda)=0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \begin{cases} 1 + 2 \lambda x = 0 \\ 1 + 2 \lambda y = 0 \\ x^2 + y^2 -1  = 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the last equation is the original constraint.

The first two equations yield

:&lt;math&gt;x= y = - \frac{1}{2\lambda}, \qquad \lambda \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting into the last equation we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4\lambda^2}+\frac{1}{4\lambda^2} - 1=0, &lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

which implies that the stationary points of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right), \qquad \left(-\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the objective function {{mvar|f}} at these points yields

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=\sqrt{2}, \qquad  f\left(-\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=-\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the constrained maximum is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the constrained minimum is &lt;math&gt;-\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Example 1b====

Now we modify the objective function of Example 1a so that we minimize &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=(x+y)^2&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=x+y,&lt;/math&gt; again along the circle &lt;math&gt;g(x,y)=x^2+y^2-1=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Now the level sets of ''f'' are still lines of slope −1, and the points on the circle tangent to these level sets are again &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{2}/2,\sqrt{2}/2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-\sqrt{2}/2,-\sqrt{2}/2)&lt;/math&gt;. These tangency points are maxima of&amp;nbsp;''f''.

On the other hand, the minima occur on the level set for ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (since by its construction ''f'' cannot take negative values), at &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{2}/2,-\sqrt{2}/2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (-\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2)&lt;/math&gt;, where the level curves of ''f'' are not tangent to the constraint. The condition that &lt;math&gt;\nabla f=\lambda\nabla g&lt;/math&gt; correctly identifies all four points as extrema; the minima are characterized in particular by &lt;math&gt;\lambda =0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 2 ===
[[Image:Lagrange simple.svg|thumb|right|300px| Illustration of the constrained optimization problem]]

In this example we will deal with some more strenuous calculations, but it is still a single constraint problem.

Suppose we want to find the maximum values of

:&lt;math&gt; f(x, y) = x^2 y&lt;/math&gt;

with the condition that the {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} coordinates lie on the circle around the origin with radius {{radic|3}}, that is, subject to the constraint

:&lt;math&gt; g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 3 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

As there is just a single constraint, we will use only one multiplier, say {{mvar|λ}}.

The constraint {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'')}} is identically zero on the circle of radius {{radic|3}}. See that any multiple of {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'')}} may be added to {{math|''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')}} leaving {{math|''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')}} unchanged in the region of interest (on the circle where our original constraint is satisfied).

Apply the ordinary Langrange multiplier method. Let:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) &amp;= f(x,y) + \lambda \cdot g(x, y) \\
&amp;= x^2y +  \lambda (x^2 + y^2 - 3)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can calculate the gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda) &amp;= \left ( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} \right ) \\
&amp;= \left ( 2 x y + 2 \lambda x, x^2 + 2 \lambda y, x^2 + y^2 -3 \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

And therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda)=0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \begin{cases} 2 x y + 2 \lambda x = 0 \\ x^2 + 2 \lambda y = 0 \\ x^2 + y^2 - 3 = 0 \end{cases} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \begin{cases} x (y + \lambda) = 0 &amp; (i) \\ x^2 = -2 \lambda y &amp; (ii) \\ x^2 + y^2 = 3 &amp; (iii) \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that (iii) is just the original constraint. (i) implies {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} ''or'' {{math|''λ'' {{=}} −''y''}}. If {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} then &lt;math&gt;y = \pm \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; by (iii) and consequently  {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}} from (ii). If {{math|''λ'' {{=}} −''y''}}, substituting in (ii) we get {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 2''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Substituting this in (iii) and solving for {{mvar|y}} gives {{math|''y'' {{=}} ±1}}. Thus there are six critical points of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; (\sqrt{2},1,-1); \quad (-\sqrt{2},1,-1); \quad (\sqrt{2},-1,1); \quad (-\sqrt{2},-1,1); \quad (0,\sqrt{3}, 0); \quad (0,-\sqrt{3}, 0). &lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the objective at these points, we find that

:&lt;math&gt; f(\pm\sqrt{2},1) = 2; \quad f(\pm\sqrt{2},-1) = -2; \quad f(0,\pm \sqrt{3})=0. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the  objective function attains the [[global maximum]] (subject to the constraints) at &lt;math&gt;(\pm\sqrt{2},1)&lt;/math&gt; and the [[global minimum]] at &lt;math&gt;(\pm\sqrt{2},-1).&lt;/math&gt; The point &lt;math&gt;(0,\sqrt{3})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local minimum]] of ''f'' and &lt;math&gt;(0,-\sqrt{3})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local maximum]] of ''f'', as may be determined by consideration of the [[Hessian (mathematics)#Bordered Hessian|Hessian matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x,y,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that while &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{2}, 1, -1)&lt;/math&gt; is a critical point of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, it is not a local extremum of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}.&lt;/math&gt; We have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \left (\sqrt{2} + \varepsilon, 1, -1 + \delta \right ) = 2 + \delta \left( \varepsilon^2 + \left (2\sqrt{2} \right)\varepsilon \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

Given any neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{2}, 1, -1)&lt;/math&gt;, we can choose a small positive &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and a small &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; of either sign to get &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; values both greater and less than &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. This can also be seen from the fact that the Hessian matrix of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; evaluated at this point (or indeed at any of the critical points) is an [[indefinite matrix]]. Each of the critical points of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[saddle point]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 3: [[Entropy]] ===
Suppose we wish to find the [[Probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete probability distribution]] on the points &lt;math&gt;\{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\}&lt;/math&gt; with maximal [[information entropy]]. This is the same as saying that we wish to find the [[Principle of maximum entropy|least structured]] probability distribution on the points &lt;math&gt;\{p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, we wish to maximize the [[Shannon entropy]] equation:

:&lt;math&gt;f(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n) = -\sum_{j=1}^n p_j\log_2 p_j.&lt;/math&gt;

For this to be a probability distribution the sum of the probabilities &lt;math&gt; p_i &lt;/math&gt; at each point &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; must equal 1, so our constraint is:

:&lt;math&gt;g(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n)=\sum_{j=1}^n p_j = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

We use Lagrange multipliers to find the point of maximum entropy, &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}^{\,*}&lt;/math&gt;, across all discrete probability distributions &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\{x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. We require that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial \vec{p}}(f+\lambda (g-1))\right|_{\vec{p}=\vec{p}^{\,*}}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which gives a system of {{mvar|n}} equations, &lt;math&gt; k = 1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial p_k}\left\{-\left (\sum_{j=1}^n p_j \log_2 p_j \right ) + \lambda \left(\sum_{j=1}^n p_j - 1\right) \right\}\right|_{p_k=p^*_k} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Carrying out the differentiation of these {{mvar|n}} equations, we get

:&lt;math&gt;-\left(\frac{1}{\ln 2}+\log_2 p^*_k \right)  + \lambda = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that all &lt;math&gt;p^*_k&lt;/math&gt; are equal (because they depend on {{mvar|λ}} only). By using the constraint

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_j p_j =1,&lt;/math&gt;

we find

:&lt;math&gt;p^*_k = \frac{1}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the uniform distribution is the distribution with the greatest entropy, among distributions on {{mvar|n}} points.

=== Example 4: Numerical optimization ===
[[Image:lagnum1.png|thumb|right|300px|Lagrange multipliers cause the critical points to occur at saddle points.]]

[[Image:lagnum2.png|thumb|right|300px|The magnitude of the gradient can be used to force the critical points to occur at local minima.]]

The critical points of Lagrangians occur at [[saddle point]]s, rather than at local maxima (or minima).&lt;ref name="Heath2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|2005|p=[{{google books |id=gwBrMAEACAAJ |page=203 |plainurl=yes}} 203]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, many numerical optimization techniques, such as [[hill climbing]], [[gradient descent]], some of the [[quasi-Newton method]]s, among others, are designed to find local maxima (or minima) and not saddle points. For this reason, one must either modify the formulation to ensure that it's a minimization problem (for example, by extremizing the square of the [[gradient]] of the Lagrangian as below), or else use an optimization technique that finds [[stationary points]] (such as [[Newton's method in optimization|Newton's method]] without an extremum seeking [[line search]]) and not necessarily extrema.

As a simple example, consider the problem of finding the value of {{mvar|x}} that minimizes &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, constrained such that &lt;math&gt;x^2=1&lt;/math&gt;. (This problem is somewhat pathological because there are only two values that satisfy this constraint, but it is useful for illustration purposes because the corresponding unconstrained function can be visualized in three dimensions.)

Using Lagrange multipliers, this problem can be converted into an unconstrained optimization problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)=x^2+\lambda(x^2-1).&lt;/math&gt;

The two critical points occur at saddle points where {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} −1}}.

In order to solve this problem with a numerical optimization technique, we must first transform this problem such that the critical points occur at local minima. This is done by computing the magnitude of the gradient of the unconstrained optimization problem.

First, we compute the partial derivative of the unconstrained problem with respect to each variable:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x}=2x+2x\lambda \\[5pt]
&amp; \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda}=x^2-1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If the target function is not easily differentiable, the differential with respect to each variable can be approximated as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x}\approx\frac{\mathcal{L}(x+\varepsilon,\lambda)-\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)}{\varepsilon}, \\[5pt]
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda}\approx\frac{\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda+\varepsilon)-\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)}{\varepsilon},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a small value.

Next, we compute the magnitude of the gradient, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the partial derivatives:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
h(x,\lambda) &amp; = \sqrt{(2x+2x\lambda)^2+(x^2-1)^2} \\[4pt]
&amp; \approx\sqrt{\left(\frac{\mathcal{L}(x+\varepsilon,\lambda)-\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)}{\varepsilon}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda+\varepsilon)-\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)}{\varepsilon}\right)^2}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Since magnitude is always non-negative, optimizing over the squared-magnitude is equivalent to optimizing over the magnitude. Thus, the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;square root" may be omitted from these equations with no expected difference in the results of optimization.)

The critical points of {{mvar|h}} occur at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} −1}}, just as in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;. Unlike the critical points in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, however, the critical points in {{mvar|h}} occur at local minima, so numerical optimization techniques can be used to find them.

==Applications==

===Control theory===
In [[optimal control]] theory, the Lagrange multipliers are interpreted as [[costate]] variables, and Lagrange multipliers are reformulated as the minimization of the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]], in [[Pontryagin's minimum principle]].

===Nonlinear programming===
The Lagrange multiplier method has several generalizations. In [[nonlinear programming]] there are several multiplier rules, ''e.g.'', the Carathéodory–John Multiplier Rule and the Convex Multiplier Rule, for inequality constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pourciau |first=Bruce H. |date=1980 |title=Modern Multiplier Rules |url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/modern-multiplier-rules |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=433–452 |doi=10.2307/2320250 |jstor=2320250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project is being carried out in collaboration with international partners in the [[Parkes Pulsar Timing Array]] in Australia and the [[European Pulsar Timing Array]] as part of the [[International Pulsar Timing Array]].

==Gravitational wave detection using pulsar timing==

[[Gravitational wave]]s are an important prediction from Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]] and expected to result from the bulk motion of matter, fluctuations during the early universe and the dynamics of [[space-time]] itself. [[Pulsars]] are rapidly rotating, highly magnetized [[neutron stars]] formed during the [[supernova]] explosions of massive stars. They act as highly accurate clocks with a wealth of physical applications ranging from celestial mechanics, neutron star seismology, tests of strong-field gravity and Galactic astronomy.

The idea to use pulsars as gravitational wave detectors was originally proposed by Sazhin&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1970s. The idea is to treat the solar system barycenter and a distant pulsar as opposite ends of an imaginary arm in space. The pulsar acts as the reference clock at one end of the arm sending out regular signals which are monitored by an observer on the Earth. The effect of a passing gravitational wave would be to perturb the local space-time metric and cause a change in the observed rotational frequency of the pulsar.

|doi = 10.1086/183954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently extended this idea to an array of pulsars and found that a stochastic background of gravitational waves would produce a correlated signal for different angular separations on the sky. This work was limited in sensitivity by the precision and stability of the pulsar clocks in the array. Following the discovery of the first [[millisecond pulsar]] in 1982, Foster and [[Backer|Donald C. Backer]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the first astronomers to seriously improve the sensitivity to gravitational waves by applying the Hellings-Downs analysis to an array of highly stable millisecond pulsars.

In the past decade, the advent of state-of-the-art digital data acquisition systems, new radio
telescopes and receiver systems and the discoveries of many new pulsars has seen a significant advance in the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array to gravitational waves. The 2010 paper by Hobbs et al.&lt;ref&gt;

==Funding sources==

The research activities of NANOGrav are supported by a combination of single-investigator grants awarded through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council ([[NSERC]]) in Canada, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) and the [[Research Corporation| Research Corporation for Scientific Advancement]] in the USA. The NSF recently awarded a $6.8M dollar grant to researchers within NANOGrav as part of their Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) program. In their recent Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the National Academies of Science named NANOGrav as one of eight mid-scale astrophysics projects recommended as high priorities for funding in the next decade.

The science of '''pattern formation''' deals with the visible, ([[statistically]]) orderly outcomes of [[self-organization]] and the common principles behind similar [[patterns in nature]].

In [[developmental biology]], pattern formation refers to the generation of complex organizations of [[cell fate determination|cell fates]] in space and time. Pattern formation is controlled by [[gene]]s. The role of genes in pattern formation is an aspect of [[morphogenesis]], the creation of diverse [[anatomy|anatomies]] from similar genes, now being explored in the science of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] or evo-devo. The mechanisms involved are well seen in the anterior-posterior patterning of [[embryo]]s from the [[model organism]] ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (a fruit fly), one of the first organisms to have its morphogenesis studied, and in the [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] of butterflies, whose development is a variant of the standard (fruit fly) mechanism.

==Examples==
{{further|Patterns in nature}}
Examples of pattern formation can be found in Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and can readily be simulated with Computer graphics, as described in turn below.

===Biology===
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology|Morphogenetic field}}

Biological patterns such as [[animal markings]], the segmentation of animals, and [[phyllotaxis]] are formed in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 2009. ''Shapes'', pp. 231–252.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[developmental biology]], pattern formation describes the mechanism by which initially equivalent cells in a developing tissue in an [[embryo]] assume complex forms and functions.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 2009. Shapes, pp. 261–290.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Embryogenesis]], such as [[Drosophila embryogenesis|of the fruit fly ''Drosophila'']], involves coordinated [[cell fate determination|control of cell fates]].&lt;ref name=Lai&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eric C.

In this context, a field of cells is the group of cells whose fates are affected by responding to the same set positional information cues. This conceptual model was first described as the [[French flag model]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(69)80016-0 |author=Wolpert L |title=Positional information and the spatial pattern of cellular differentiation |journal=J.

K. |title=Evo-Devo: evolutionary developmental mechanisms |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |date=2003 |volume=47 |issue=7–8 |pages=491–495 |pmid=14756324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible mechanisms of pattern formation in biological systems include the classical [[reaction-diffusion]] model proposed by [[Alan Turing]]&lt;ref&gt;S. Kondo, T. Miura, "Reaction-Diffusion Model as a Framework for Understanding Biological Pattern Formation", Science 24 Sep 2010: Vol. 329, Issue 5999, pp. 1616-1620 DOI: 10.1126/science.1179047&lt;/ref&gt; and the more recently found [[elastic instability]] mechanism which is thought to be responsible for the fold patterns on the [[cerebral cortex]] of higher animals, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Mercker et al. Biology Direct  (2016) 11:22  DOI 10.1186/s13062-016-0124-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tallinen et al. Nature Physics 12, 588–593 (2016) doi:10.1038/nphys3632&lt;/ref&gt;

====Growth of colonies====
Bacterial colonies show a large [[Bacterial patterns|variety of patterns]] formed during colony growth. The resulting shapes depend on the growth conditions. In particular, stresses (hardness of the culture medium, lack of nutrients, etc.) enhance the complexity of the resulting patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 2009. ''Branches'', pp. 52–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms such as [[slime mould]]s display remarkable patterns caused by the dynamics of chemical signalling.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 2009. ''Shapes'', pp. 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vegetation patterns====
{{Main|patterned vegetation}}
[[File:Tiger Bush Niger Corona 1965-12-31.jpg|thumb|[[Tiger bush]] is a [[patterned vegetation|vegetation pattern]] that forms in arid conditions.]]

[[patterned vegetation|Vegetation patterns]] such as [[tiger bush]]&lt;ref name=TigerBush&gt;{{cite book | title=Banded vegetation patterning in arid and semiarid environments | publisher=Springer-Verlag | author=Tongway, D.J., Valentin, C. &amp; Seghieri, J. | year=2001 | location=New York|isbn=978-1461265597}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fir wave]]s&lt;ref name=FirWave&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v1/figure_sets/disturb/disturb_back4.html | title=Fir Waves: Regeneration in New England Conifer Forests | publisher=TIEE | date=22 February 2004 | accessdate=26 May 2012 | author=D'Avanzo, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; form for different reasons. Tiger bush consists of stripes of bushes on arid slopes in countries such as [[Niger]] where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation absorbs rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it.&lt;ref name=TigerBush/&gt; In contrast, fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.&lt;ref name=FirWave/&gt;

Some types of [[Finite state machine|automata]] have been used to generate organic-looking [[Texture (computer graphics)|textures]] for more realistic [[Shader|shading]] of [[3D modeling|3d objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Greg Turk, [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/reaction_diffusion/reaction_diffusion.html Reaction-Diffusion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaction-Diffusion Textures|author1=Andrew Witkin |author2=Michael Kassy |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aw/pdf/texture.pdf|doi=10.1145/122718.122750|journal=Proceedings of the 18th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques|year=1991|pages=299–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular Photoshop plugin, [[Kai's Power Tools|KPT 6]], included a filter called 'KPT reaction'. Reaction produced [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction-diffusion]] style patterns based on the supplied seed image.

A similar effect to the 'KPT reaction' can be achieved with [[convolution]] functions in [[digital image processing]], with a little patience, by repeatedly [[Unsharp masking|sharpening]] and [[Box blur|blurring]] an image in a graphics editor. If other filters are used, such as [[Image embossing|emboss]] or [[edge detection]], different types of effects can be achieved.

Computers are often used to [[Computer simulation|simulate]] the biological, physical or chemical processes that lead to pattern formation, and they can display the results in a realistic way. Calculations using models like [[Reaction-diffusion]] or [[MClone]] are based on the actual mathematical equations designed by the scientists to model the studied phenomena.

[[File:Microbial mat section.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of [[microbial mat]]]]

'''Phototrophic biofilms''' occur on contact surfaces in a range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Phototrophic biofilms can best be described as surface attached microbial communities (see also [[Biofilm]] and [[Chemistry of Biofilm Prevention]]) mainly driven by light as the energy source with [[phototroph]]ic organisms clearly present. Eukaryotic [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] generate energy and reduce carbon dioxide, providing organic substrates and [[oxygen]]. The [[photosynthetic]] activity fuels processes and conversions in the total biofilm community, including the [[heterotrophic]] fraction.

Thick laminated multilayered phototrophic biofilms are usually referred to as [[microbial mat]]s or phototrophic mats (see also [[biofilm]]). Phototrophic biofilms and microbial mats have been described in extreme environments like thermal springs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roeselers G, Norris TB, Castenholz RW |title=Diversity of phototrophic bacteria in microbial mats from Arctic hot springs (Greenland) |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=26–38 |date=Jan 2007 |pmid=17227409 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01103.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; hyper saline ponds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sørensen KB, Canfield DE, Teske AP, Oren A |title=Community composition of a hypersaline endoevaporitic microbial mat |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=71 |issue=11 |pages=7352–65 |date=Nov 2005 |pmid=16269778 |pmc=1287706 |doi=10.1128/AEM.71.11.7352-7365.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; desert soil crusts, and in lake ice covers in Antarctica. The 3.4-billion-year fossil record of [[benthic]] phototrophic communities, such as microbial mats and [[stromatolites]], indicates that these associations represent the Earth's oldest known ecosystems. It is thought that these early ecosystems played a key role in the build-up of [[oxygen]] in the [[Earth’s atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoehler TM, Bebout BM, Des Marais DJ |title=The role of microbial mats in the production of reduced gases on the early Earth |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6844 |pages=324–7 |date=Jul 2001 |pmid=11460161 |doi=10.1038/35085554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing interest in the application of phototrophic biofilms, for instance in wastewater treatment in [[constructed wetlands]], [[bioremediation]], [[aquaculture]], and [[biohydrogen]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roeselers G, van Loosdrecht MC, Muyzer G |title=Phototrophic biofilms and their potential applications |journal=Journal of Applied Phycology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=227–35 |date=Jun 2007 |doi=10.1007/s10811-007-9223-2|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n518x09k16133052/ |pmid=19396356 |pmc=2668646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pop Culture Classroom''', based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], is a nonprofit organization that educates in the areas of literacy and arts through alternative approaches to learning and character development. The organization creates educational programs for underserved youths, schools and communities by using comic books, graphic novels and related media to inspire passion for reading, art, and learning.

==Overview and history==
Pop Culture Classroom was founded in 2010 as Comic Book Classroom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pow! Comic Book Classroom project takes on illiteracy in metro schools|url=http://www.denverpost.com/theater/ci_18562585 |publisher=Denver Post|accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Colorado charitable organization focused on enhancing and improving student’s learning experience through the use of comic book media. At the same time, the founders of Comic Book Classroom also created the [[Denver Comic Con]] event. The Original Founders of Comic Book Classroom and Denver Comic Con are Charlie LaGreca, Frank Romero, David Vinson and Kevin Vinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://popcultureclassroom.org/about/history/|publisher=Pop Culture Classroom|accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2012, the Original Founders were joined by accomplished educators Illya Kowalchuk and Christina Angel, and experienced event organizers Michael Newman and Bruce Macintosh, who became an integral part of organizational development as the foundations of both Comic Book Classroom and Denver Comic Con educational programs were developed simultaneously.

The Classroom program debuted the first version of its “Storytelling Through Comics” curriculum to local area schools, and with the help of hundreds of dedicated volunteers and generous donations, the Denver Comic Con event became a reality on Father’s Day weekend, June 15, 2012. It was an unexpected and overwhelming success. The 2013 and 2014 Denver Comic Con’s built on that success.

Proceeds from Denver Comic Con fund the staffing, supplies and infrastructure of The Classroom program that promotes literacy through the medium of sequential art and storytelling. “Storytelling Through Comics” is a graphic literature creation program that is offered free of charge to schools, teachers and community organizations. The program currently offers students an educational experience that includes instruction in reading &amp; vocabulary, writing stories, and eventually the creation of the students’ own comics. Completed entries are then published in a class collection.

In 2014, the Comic Book Classroom Board of Directors voted to change the name to Pop Culture Classroom (PCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Wrap-Up: Denver Comic Con 2014! (Part 1)|url=http://popcultureclassroom.org/the-classroom/education-wrap-up-denver-comic-con-2014-part-1/|publisher=Pop Culture Classroom|accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change reflects the board’s broader vision for the organization. In addition to expanding the reach of our comic-based curriculum, PCC seeks to use other elements of pop culture to advance our mission of literacy education and to spark the creative spirit within every child.

==Need==
The need for literacy education in Colorado inspired the CBC program. High percentages of elementary and middle school-aged children in Colorado do not have or cannot afford after-school care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Need For After-School |url= http://www.afterschoolallstars.org/programs/need-for-after-school/|publisher=After-School All Stars|website=Afterschoolallstars.org|accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, several studies show that children who receive arts education often outperform children who do not in most educational areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Champions of Change: The Impact on the Art of Learning |url= http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/champions/pdfs/ChampsReport.pdf |publisher=The Arts Education Partnership|accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
Pop Culture Classroom’s “Storytelling Through Comics” curriculum is designed to educate 11- to 14-year-old students (grades 5-8) about literacy and the arts. The common core curriculum enhances students’ writing and reading abilities and artistic skills through an interactive educational experience focused around comic books and graphic novels. It can be offered as an after-school course, a stand-alone unit, or as a complement to an existing language arts curriculum in a classroom.

The six-week program is broken out into a series of distinct lesson modules:

•	The Joy of Reading: Students learn the terms associated with the creation, design and reading of comics and gain an understanding of the enjoyment and personal fulfillment associated with the medium.&lt;br&gt;
•	Visual &amp; Textual Storytelling: Students learn about storytelling arcs and define exposition, event, rising action, crisis, falling action and conclusion. Participants begin drafting their own short comic strip using the storytelling arc as a template.&lt;br&gt;
•	Dialogue: Students are introduced to dialogue as a narrative device and begin scripting their stories.&lt;br&gt;
•	Analyzing Conflict Resolution through Dialogue and Using an Outline: Students learn how dialogue reveals conflict and resolution in comics and learn the technique of reverse outlining to pace their stories.&lt;br&gt;
•	Basic Drawing for Comics: Students learn basic drawing techniques from a guest artist.&lt;br&gt;
•	Creating Comics and the “Author’s Chair” Celebration: Students finish their comic story using techniques taught in previous modules and celebrate their achievement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The CBC curriculum is designed to meet the needs of early and challenged readers as well as students in more advanced stages of literacy. The curriculum includes dialogue around text and image, discussion and use of vocabulary and terminology. 
The larger goals of the curriculum are to teach literacy and arts engagement while fostering identity growth, positive peer relationships, communication skills, and community development among young people.

==Benefits==
Each local graduate receives a customized one-day ticket for themselves and a caregiver to [[Denver Comic Con]]. At the convention, graduates are welcomed as guests of honor. Additionally, they are given the chance to work with industry professionals in the Comic Book Classroom Corral, sell sketches to attendees, and further their understanding that popular culture has a valuable place in society and represents a viable career path. Graduates also receive a graduate package that includes the Denver Comic Con pass as well as a graduation certificate, custom CBC pencil, button, and sketchpad.

In addition, [[Denver Comic Con]] offers free admission to 200 educators annually during its Educator’s Day on Friday.

==Programming==
Pop Culture Classroom’s programming includes:

'''In-schools programs'''
*Trained volunteers facilitate the program in local schools as an after-school program, a stand-alone unit or as a complement to existing language arts classes or programs.

'''Online Resources'''
*Pop Culture Classroom offers a variety of downloadable resources that parents and teachers can use to integrate sequential arts education into their own educational efforts or classroom programs.
*The CBC website offers “Rowrr Recommends” reviews of age-appropriate comic books and graphic literature for children and their parents.
Comic Book Classroom Kids’ Corral

The focal point of the annual [[Denver Comic Con]] is the Comic Book Classroom Kids’ Corral, which is designed to spotlight the CBC program, its students, and graduates. The 5000-square foot activity center provides educational youth-based programming and activities for younger attendees and families. In addition, many Denver Comic Con guests have donated their time and talents to working with students in the CBC Kids’ Corral.

Programming is conducted by volunteers, many of whom are trained arts educator or comic industry professionals. In addition to actively teaching in classrooms and after-school programs, volunteers provide administrative support, curriculum/assessment development, comic and literature reviews, outreach, website development, fundraising and event planning.

==Influence==
Since the first Pop Culture Classroom program was conducted at Force Elementary School (Denver Public Schools) in the spring of 2010, Pop Culture Classroom has impacted over 400 students in the Denver metro region. The organization has conducted programs at over a dozen elementary and middle schools in the Denver area as well as community organizations such as the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Metro Denver and the [[WOW! Children's Museum]] of Lafayette, Colorado.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3869">A '''practical engineer''' (Senior Technician)({{lang-he|הנדסאי}}) is a professional degree awarded by [[List of Israeli universities and colleges#Colleges|technological college]]s in [[Israel]] and validated by the National Institute for Technological Training of the [[Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry|Ministry of Industry, Trade &amp; Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moital.gov.il/NR/exeres/B0B48981-357D-446F-AFAC-91A358E93C87.htm Ministry of Industry, Trade &amp; Labor (State of Israel)] Retrieved on 15 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It is a unique qualification that combines theoretical study with practical training, and is currently available only in Israel. It normally takes up to 3 academic years to obtain a Practical Engineer's degree, depending on the taught discipline.

== Professional regulation ==
Practical Engineers are used to mediate between professional engineers and engineering technicians.  While most of the decision making process is performed by professional engineers and most of the practical work is done by technicians, practical engineers are taught to be able to follow instructions and re-adapt concepts designed by professional engineers.

In Israel, practical engineers are an integral part of the [[hi-tech]] industry and form an important work-force.

Practical Engineers are licensed to lead and hold responsible for engineering projects up to a certain level. For example, in Israel, architectural practical engineers are permitted to design constructions of up to four stories high with 2 dimensional static scheme and spans up to 6 meters, while for larger scale projects a full engineering degree is required.

== Education, training &amp; skills ==
Practical engineers receive formal education that meets with criteria published by the National Institute for Technological Training.
In sum over 2100 frontal academic hours are taught over a period of two to three years.

From an academic point of view, the main things differentiating engineers from practical engineers are the level and magnitude of foundation subjects, such as mathematics and physics.

Practical Engineers are taught foundations but only to the extent required by their profession, hence making their study shorter and more focused.

As part of the certification process, practical engineers are also required to undertake national certification tests, and to complete and defend a final project in their field of study or to participate in an [[internship]] program.

== Equivalent qualifications ==
There are some international qualifications equivalent to the Practical Engineer's degree. In Spain, the title of Ingeniero Técnico (Spanish for Technical Engineer) bears many similarities to its Israeli equivalent. Also, although not exactly the same, Practical Engineers are often thought of as [[Engineering Technician|Engineering technicians]], [[Associate degree|Associate Engineers]] or Jr. Engineers in some English speaking countries. The French [[Brevet de Technicien Supérieur]] is similar.

Although not an academic degree in its traditional sense, practical engineers are normally awarded some academic credit when pursuing further study at a [[Bachelor's degree]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1549">'''Ringing out''' is a process in [[audio engineering]] used to prevent [[audio feedback]] between on-stage microphones and loudspeakers, and to maximize volume before feedback occurs. Depending on the acoustics of a venue, certain frequencies may be [[Acoustic_resonance|resonant]], and will be more prone to feedback. To ring out a room, a sound technician will raise the gain or fader controls on a mixing desk to induce an audio system to feedback. Once feedback occurs, the technician uses an equalizer, usually a [[graphic equalizer]] to reduce the gain on the appropriate band (or frequency). The frequency of the feedback can be identified using a spectrum analyzer. This is repeated until feedback is sufficiently reduced without compromising the quality of the sound.

Ringing out is particularly important when mixing [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitors]], or foldback. As the performer or musician is usually behind the main PA system, the monitors are so they can hear themselves. As such, a microphone is much more likely to feedback through the monitor loudspeakers than the main PA. Ringing out can become quite complex when working with a large number of microphones and monitors. Indeed, with larger touring acts, one of the major advantages of the rise in use of [[in-ear monitor]]s is the minimal ringing out that needs to be done.

Hardware exists that can perform many of the same functions that ringing out provides, such as feedback suppression and room optimization.

In this particular diagram, the Red sample occupies 9 bits, the Green sample occupies 7 bits and the Blue sample occupies 8 bits, totaling 24 bits per pixel. Note that the samples do not have to be equal size and not all samples are mandatory in a pixel.

Also, a pixel can consist of more than 3 samples (e.g. 4 samples of the [[RGBA color space]]).

A sample is related to a [[Pixel#Subpixels|subpixel]] on a physical display.

Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the natural sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.

In social simulation, computers support human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as [[complex system|complex non-linear systems]], which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models. [[Robert Axelrod]] regards social simulation as a third way of doing science, differing from both the deductive and inductive approach; generating data that can be analysed inductively, but coming from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than from direct measurement of the real world. Thus, simulating a phenomenon is akin to generating it—constructing artificial societies. These ambitious aims have encountered [[#Criticisms|several criticisms]].

The social simulation approach to the social sciences is promoted and coordinated by three regional associations, [[European Social Simulation Association|ESSA]] for Europe, North America (reorganizing under the new CSSS name), and PAAA [https://archive.is/20130413115754/http://www.paaa.econ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ Pacific Asia].

==History and development==

The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Self-replicating machine|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproducing itself. The device [[von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then improved by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up&amp;mdash;creating the first of devices later termed [[cellular automata]].

Another improvement was brought by mathematician, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike the von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

The birth of the agent-based model as a model for social systems was primarily brought about by a computer scientist, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as the [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] developed the first large scale agent model, the [[Sugarscape]], to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, transmission of disease, and even culture.

[[Kathleen M. Carley]] published "Computational Organizational Science and Organizational Engineering" defining the movement of simulation into
organizations, established a journal for social simulation applied to organizations and complex socio-technical systems: [[Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory]], and was the founding president of the North American Association of Computational Social and Organizational Systems that morphed into the current CSSSA.

[[Nigel Gilbert]] published with [[Klaus G. Troitzsch]] the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the Social Scientist (1999) and established its most relevant journal: the [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]].

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]] (see {{Harv|Sun|2006}})

==Topics==

Here are some sample topics that have been explored with social simulation:

* '''[[norm (social)|Social norms]]''': [[Robert Axelrod]] has used simulations to investigate the foundation of morality;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Axelrod (1986): [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~axe/Axelrod%20Norms%20APSR%201986%20(2).pdf An Evolutionary Approach to Norms]&lt;/ref&gt; others have modeled the emergence of norms using [[meme]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Felix Flentge, Daniel Polani and Thomas Uthmann (2001) [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/4/3.html Modelling the Emergence of Possession Norms using Memes]&lt;/ref&gt; or how social norms and emotions can regulate each other.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Staller and Paolo Petta (2001): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/1/2.html Introducing Emotions into the Computational Study of Social Norms: A First Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Neumann (2008): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/11/4/6.html Homo Socionicus: a Case Study of Simulation Models of Norms] for an overview of the recent (as of 2008) research.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Institutions]]''': by investigating under what conditions agents manage to coordinate,&lt;ref&gt;José Castro Caldas and Helder Coelho (1999): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/2/2/1.html The Origin of Institutions: socio-economic processes, choice, norms and conventions]&lt;/ref&gt; or by modeling the works of [[Robert Putnam]] on civic traditions&lt;ref&gt;Dan Miodownik, Britt Cartrite and Ravi Bhavnani (2010): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/13/3/1.html Between Replication and Docking: "Adaptive Agents, Political Institutions, and Civic Traditions" Revisited]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Reputation]]''', for example by making agents with a model of reputation from [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (image, social esteem, and prestige) and observing their behavior in a virtual marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Hahn, Bettina Fley, Michael Florian, Daniela Spresny and Klaus Fischer (2007) : [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/10/1/2.html Social Reputation: a Mechanism for Flexible Self-Regulation of Multiagent Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Knowledge transmission''' and the social process of science: there is a special section on that topic in the [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/14/4/contents.html JASSS vol. 14: Special section: Simulating the Social Processes of Science]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Elections]]''': Kim (2011) has modeled a psychological model of judgement from previous research (notably featuring [[motivated reasoning]]), and compared the statistical regularities of the simulation with empirical observations of voter behavior;&lt;ref&gt;Sung-youn Kim (2011): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/14/2/3.html A Model of Political Judgment: An Agent-Based Simulation of Candidate Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt; others have compared delegation methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ramzi Suleiman and Ilan Fischer (2000) [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/3/4/1.html When One Decides for Many: The Effect of Delegation Methods on Cooperation in Simulated Inter-group Conflicts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Edith Bissey, Mauro Carini and Guido Ortona (2004) [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/7/3/3.html ALEX3, a Simulation Program to Compare Electoral Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Economics''': see [[computational economics]] and [[agent-based computational economics]].

==Types of simulation and modeling==
Social simulation can refer to a general class of strategies for understanding social dynamics using computers to simulate social systems. Social simulation allows for a more systematic way of viewing the possibilities of outcomes.

There are four major types of social simulation: 
#System level simulation.
#System level modeling.
#Agent-based simulation.
#Agent-based modeling.

A social simulation may fall within the rubric of [[computational sociology]] which is a recently developed branch of [[sociology]] that uses [[computation]] to analyze social phenomena. The basic premise of computational sociology is to take advantage of [[computer simulation]]s {{Harv|Polhill|Edmonds|2007}} in the construction of social theories. It involves the understanding of [[social agent]]s, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate.  Although the subject matter and methodologies in [[social science]] differ from those in [[natural science]] or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary social [[simulation]] originated from fields such as [[physics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

===System level simulation===
System Level Simulation (SLS) is the oldest level of social simulation. System level simulation looks at the situation as a whole. This theoretical outlook on social situations uses a wide range of information to determine what should happen to society and its members if certain variables are present. Therefore, with specific variables presented, society and its members should have a certain response to the new situation. Navigating through this theoretical simulation will allow researchers to develop educated ideas of what will happen under some specific variables.

For example, if [[NASA]] were to conduct a system level simulation it would benefit the organization by providing a cost effective research method to navigate through the simulation. This allows the researcher to steer through the virtual possibilities of the given simulation and develop [[safety]] procedures, and to produce proven facts about how a certain situation will play out. {{Harv|National Research|2006}}

===System level modeling===

System level modeling (SLM) aims to specifically predict (unlike system level simulation's generalization in prediction) and convey any number of actions, behaviors, or other theoretical possibilities of nearly any person, object, construct et cetera within a system using a large set of mathematical equations and computer programming in the form of models.

A model is a representation of a specific thing ranging from objects and people to structures and products created through mathematical equations and are designed, using computers, in such a way that they are able to stand-in as the aforementioned things in a study. Models can be either simplistic or complex, depending on the need for either; however, models are intended to be simpler than what they are representing while remaining realistically similar in order to be used accurately. They are built using a collection of data that is translated into computing languages that allow them to represent the system in question. These models, much like simulations, are used to help us better understand specific roles and actions of different things so as to predict behavior and the like.

===Agent-based simulation===

[[Agent-based social simulation]] (ABSS) consists of modeling different societies after artificial agents, (varying on scale) and placing them in a computer simulated society to observe the behaviors of the agents.  From this data it is possible to learn about the reactions of the artificial agents and translate them into the results of non-artificial agents and simulations.  Three main fields in ABSS are agent-based computing, social science, and computer simulation.

Agent-based computing is the design of the model and agents, while the computer simulation is the part of the simulation of the agents in the model and the outcomes.  The social science is a mixture of sciences and social part of the model.  It is where the social phenomena is developed and theorized. The main purpose of ABSS is to provide models and tools for agent-based simulation of social phenomena.  With ABSS we can explore different outcomes for phenomena where we might not be able to view the outcome in real life.  It can provide us valuable information on society and the outcomes of social events or phenomena.

===Agent-based modeling===

[[Agent-based modeling]] (ABM) is a system in which a collection of agents independently interact on networks. Each individual agent is responsible for different behaviors that result in collective behaviors. These behaviors as a whole help to define the workings of the network. ABM focuses on human social interactions and how people work together and communicate with one another without having one, single "group mind". This essentially means that it tends to focus on the consequences of interactions between people (the agents) in a population. Researchers are better able to understand this type of modeling by modeling these dynamics on a smaller, more localized level. Essentially, ABM helps to better understand interactions between people (agents) who, in turn, influence one another (in response to these influences). Simple individual rules or actions can result in coherent [[group behavior]]. Changes in these individual acts can affect the collective group in any given population.

Agent-based modeling is an experimental tool for theoretical research. It enables one to deal with more complex individual behaviors, such as adaptation. Overall, through this type of modeling, the creator, or researcher, aims to model behavior of agents and the communication between them in order to better understand how these individual interactions impact an entire population. In essence, ABM is a way of modeling and understanding different global patterns.

==Current research==

There are several current research projects that relate directly to modeling and agent-based simulation the following are listed below with a brief overview.

*"Generative e-Social Science for Socio-Spatial Simulation" or (GENESIS) is a research node of the UK National Centre for e-Social Science funded by the UK research council [http://www.esrc.ac.uk ESRC]. For further details please see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20091209031009/http://www.genesis.ucl.ac.uk/ GENESIS Web Page] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20091114023426/http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/genesisblog/ Blog].
*"National e-Infrastructure for Social Simulation" or (NeISS) is a UK-based project funded by [http://www.jisc.ac.uk JISC]. For further details please see: [http://www.neiss.org.uk The NeISS Web Pages].
*"Network Models Governance and R&amp;D collaboration networks" or (N.E.M.O) is a research centre whose main focus is to identify ways to create and to assess desirable network structures for typical functions; (e.g. knowledge, creation, transfer, and distribution.) This research will ultimately aid [[policy-makers]] at all political levels in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of network-based policy instruments at promoting the knowledge economy in Europe.
*"Agent-based Simulations of Market and Consumer Behavior" is another research group that is funded by the Unilever Corporate Research. The current research that is being conducted is investigating the usefulness of agent-based simulations for modeling [[consumer behavior]] and to show the potential value and insights it can add to long-established marketing methods.
*"New and Emergent World Models Through Individual, Evolutionary and Social Learning" or (New Ties) is a three-year project that will ultimately create a virtual society developed by agent-based simulation. The project will develop a simulated society capable of exploring the environment and developing its own image of this environment and the society through interaction. The goal of the research project is for the simulated society to exhibit [[individual learning]], [[evolutionary learning]] and [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]].
*Bruch and Mare's project on neighborhood [[Residential segregation|segregation]]: The purpose of the study is to figure out the reasoning for neighborhood segregation based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and to figure out the [[tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] or when people become uncomfortable with the integration levels into their neighborhood, and decide to flee from the neighborhood. They set up a model using flash cards, and put the agent's house in the middle and put houses of different races surrounding the agent's house. They asked people how comfortable they would feel with different situations; if they were okay with one situation, they asked another until the neighborhood was fully integrated. Bruch and Mare's results showed that the tipping point was at 50%. When a neighborhood became 50% minority and 50% white, people of both races began to become uncomfortable and [[white flight]] began to rise. The use of agent-based modeling showed how useful it can be in the world of sociology, people did not have to answer why they would become uncomfortable, just which situation they were uncomfortable with.
*The MAELIA Program (Multi-Agent Emergent Norms Assessment) is a project dealing with the relationships between the users and managers of a natural resource, in that case water, and the related norms and laws that are to be built within them (conventions) or are imposed to them by other actors (institutions). The purpose of the project is to build a generic multiscale platform which is planned to deal with [[water conflict]]-related issues.
*The [http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/mosi/ Mosi-Agil project] is a four-year program funded by the Autonomous Region of Madrid through the program MOSI-AGIL-CM (grant S2013/ICE-3019, co-funded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER). It aims at creating a body of knowledge and practical tools which are necessary to handle more effectively the behavior of occupants of large facilities. Therefore, the project studies the development of ambient intelligence and intelligent environments supported by the use of Agent-Based Social Simulation.

Agent-based modeling is most useful in providing a bridge between micro and macro levels, which is a large part of what sociology studies. Agent-based models are most appropriate for studying processes that lack central coordination, including the emergence of institutions that, once established, impose order from the top down. The models focus on how simple and predictable local interactions generate familiar but highly detailed global patterns, such as emergence of [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[participation (decision making)|participation]] of collective action. Michael W. Macy and Robert Willer researched a recent survey of applications and found that there were two main problems with agent-based modeling the [[self-organization]] of social structure and the [[emergence]] of [[social order]] {{Harv|Macy|Willer|2002}}. Below is a brief description of each problem Macy and Willer believe there to be;
#"''Emergent structure''. In these models, agents change location or behavior in response to [[social influences]] or selection pressures. Agents may start out undifferentiated and then change location or behavior so as to avoid becoming different or isolated (or in some cases, overcrowded). Rather than producing homogeneity, however, these conformist decisions aggregate to produce global patterns of cultural differentiation, stratification, and homophilic clustering in local networks. Other studies reverse the process, starting with a heterogeneous population and ending in convergence: the coordination, diffusion, and sudden collapse of norms, conventions, innovations, and technological standards."
#"''Emergent social order''. These studies show how [[egotism|egoistic]] adaptation can lead to successful collective action without either altruism or global (top down) imposition of control. A key finding across numerous studies is that the viability of trust, cooperation, and collective action depends decisively on the embeddedness of interaction."

These examples simply show the complexity of our environment and that agent-based models are designed to explore the minimal conditions, the simplest set of assumptions about human behavior, required for a given social phenomenon to emerge at a higher level of organization.

==Criticisms==
Since its creation, computerized social simulation has been the target of some criticism in regard to its practicality and accuracy. Social simulation's simplification of the complex to form models from which we can better understand the latter is sometimes seen as a draw back, as using fairly simple models to simulate real life with computers is not always the best way to predict behavior.

Most of the criticism seems to be aimed at agent-based models and simulation and how they work:

#Simulations, being man-made from mathematical interfaces, predict [[human behavior]] in a far too simple manner in regard to the complexities of humanity and our actions.
#Simulations cannot enlighten researchers as to how people interact or behave in ways not programmed into their models. For this reason, the scope of simulations are limited in that the researchers must already know what they are going to find (to a degree, for they cannot find anything they themselves did not place in the model) at least vaguely, possibly skewing the results.
#Due to the complexities of what is being measured, simulations must be analyzed in unbiased ways; however, with the model running on a pre-made set of instructions coded into it by a modeler, biases exist almost universally.
#It is highly difficult and often impractical to attempt to link the findings from the abstract world the simulation creates and our complex society and all of its variation.

Researchers working in social simulation might respond that the competing theories from the [[social sciences]] are far simpler than those achieved through simulation and therefore suffer the aforementioned drawbacks much more strongly.  Theories in some social science tend to be linear models that are not dynamic, and are generally inferred from small laboratory [[experiment]]s (laboratory tests are most common in psychology but rare in sociology, political science, economics and geography). The behavior of populations of agents under these models is rarely tested or verified against empirical observation.

'''Steiner's problem''', asked and answered by {{harvtxt|Steiner|1850}}, is the problem of finding the [[maxima and minima|maximum]] of the [[function (mathematics)|function]]

: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^{1/x}.\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SteinersProblem.html
| title = Steiner's Problem
| author = Eric W. Weisstein
| publisher = MathWorld
|accessdate=December 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is named after [[Jakob Steiner]].

The maximum is at &lt;math&gt;x=e&lt;/math&gt;, where ''e'' denotes the [[e (mathematical constant)|base of natural logarithms]]. One can determine that by solving the equivalent problem of maximizing 

: &lt;math&gt;g(x)=\ln f(x) = \frac{\ln x}{x}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated to be 

: &lt;math&gt;g'(x)= \frac{1-\ln x}{x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that &lt;math&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is positive for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;x&lt;e&lt;/math&gt; and negative for &lt;math&gt;x&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; (and therefore &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;) increases for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;x&lt;e&lt;/math&gt; and decreases for &lt;math&gt;x&gt;e.&lt;/math&gt; Thus,  &lt;math&gt;x=e&lt;/math&gt; is the unique global maximum of &lt;math&gt;f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Substantive rights''' are basic [[human rights]] possessed by people in an ordered [[society]] and include [[rights]] granted by [[natural law]] as well as the [[substantive law]]. Substantive rights involve a right to the substance of being human (life, liberty, happiness), rather than a right to a procedure to enforce that right, which is defined by [[procedural law]].

Most of the time, the superslow processes lie beyond the scope of investigation due to the reason of their superslowness.  Multiple gaps can be easily detected in [[biology]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[mechanics]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[ecology]], [[gerontology]], etc.&lt;ref name="supersl" /&gt;

Traditional scientific research in this area was focused on the describing some brain reactions.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;See N.A.Aladjanova ({{lang-ru|Н.А. Аладжанова}}, 1979), V.A.Ilyukhina ({{lang-ru|В.А.Илюхина}}, 1982), Z.G.Khabaeva ({{lang-ru|З.Г.Хабаева}}, L.I.Nikitina {{lang-ru|Л.И.Никитина}}, 1986), I.B.Zabolotskih ({{lang-ru|И.Б.Заболотских}}, A.

In 2003, the term ''superslow processes'' was brought to wide attention by Russian mathematician [[Vladimir Miklyukov]] who founded ''Superslow Processes laboratory'' on the base of the [[Volgograd State University]] ([[Russia]]).  Reports of seminar members are published yearly in ''Notes of the Seminar 'Superslow Processes'''.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

In [[mathematics]], when the fluid flows through thin and long tubes it forms [[Stagnation point|stagnation zones]] where the flow becomes almost immobile.  If the ratio of tube length to its diameter is large, then the potential function and stream function are almost invariable on very extended areas.  The situation seems uninteresting, but if we remember that these minor changes occur in the extra-long intervals, we see here a series of first-class tasks that require the development of special mathematical methods.

[[A priori and a posteriori|Apriori]] information regarding the [[Stagnation point|stagnation zones]]  contributes to optimization of the [[computational process]] by replacing the unknown functions with the corresponding constants in such zones.  Sometimes this makes it possible to significantly reduce the amount of computation, for example in approximate calculation of [[conformal map]]ings of strongly elongated rectangles.

The obtained results are particularly useful for applications in [[economic geography]].  In a case where the function describes the intensity of [[Commodity#Commodity trade|commodity trade]], a theorem about its stagnation zones gives us (under appropriate restrictions on the selected  model) [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing|geometric dimensions]] estimates of the stagnation zone of the world-economy (for more information about a ''stagnation zone of the world-economy'', see [[Fernand Braudel]], Les Jeux de L'echange).&lt;ref&gt;[[Fernand Braudel]], ''Civilisation matérielle, économie et capitalisme, XV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;-XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'': ''Les jeux de l'échange'', Civilisation Paris, 1979, {{ISBN|2-253-06456-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the subarc of a domain boundary has zero transparency, and the flow of the [[gradient vector field]] of the function through the rest of the boundary is small enough, then the domain for such function is its stagnation zone.

Stagnation zones [[theorem]]s are closely related to pre-[[Liouville's theorem (disambiguation)|Liouville's theorem]]s about evaluation of solutions fluctuation, which direct consequences are the different versions of the classic [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville theorem]] about conversion of the entire [[doubly periodic function]] into the identical constant.

Identification of what parameters impact the sizes of stagnation zones opens up opportunities for practical recommendations on targeted changes in configuration (reduction or increase) of such zones.

== Levels of plant layout design ==
There are four levels of detail in plant layout design,
#Site layout: shows how the building should be located in a proper way.
#Block layout: shows the sizes of departments in the buildings.
#Detailed layout: shows the arrangements of equipment and workstations in the departments.
#[[Workstation]] layout: shows the locations of every part of the workstation.

The '''Teacher in Space Project''' ('''TISP''') was a [[NASA]] program announced by [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984 designed to inspire students, honor teachers, and spur interest in mathematics, science, and space exploration. The project would carry teachers into space as [[Payload Specialist]]s (non-astronaut civilians), who would return to their classrooms to share the experience with their students. 

NASA cancelled the program in 1990, following the death of its first participant, [[Christa McAuliffe]], in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] ([[STS-51-L]]) on January 28, 1986. NASA replaced Teachers in Space in 1998 with the [[Educator Astronaut Project]], which required its participants to become astronaut [[Mission Specialist|Mission Specialists]]. The first Educator Astronauts were selected as part of NASA Astronaut Group 19 in 2004. 

[[Barbara Morgan]], who was selected as a Mission Specialist as part of [[NASA Astronaut Group 17]] in 1998, has often been incorrectly referred to as an Educator Astronaut. However, she was selected as a Mission Specialist before the Educator Astronaut Project.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Griffin, NASA TV: STS-118 Post-Landing briefing&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA programs==
TISP was announced by President [[Ronald Reagan]] on August 27, 1984. Not members of [[NASA Astronaut Corps|NASA's Astronaut Corps]], the teachers would fly as [[Payload Specialist]]s and return to their classrooms after flight. More than 40,000 applications were mailed to interested teachers while 11,000 teachers sent completed applications to NASA.  Each application included a potential lesson that would be taught from space while on the Space Shuttle.  The applications were sorted and then sent to the various State Departments of Education, who were then responsible for narrowing down their state applicants to a final set of two each.  These applicants were notified of their selections and were gathered together for further selection processes down to ten finalists.  These were then trained for a time, and in 1985 NASA selected [[Christa McAuliffe]] to be the first teacher in space, with [[Barbara Morgan]] as her backup. McAuliffe was a high school social studies teacher from Concord, New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronaut bio S.

McAuliffe died in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] ([[STS-51-L]]) on January 28, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Mission 51-L "Teacher In Space"|url=http://www.challenger.org/about-us/mission-51-l/|publisher=challenger.org|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104173819/http://www.challenger.org/about-us/mission-51-l/|archivedate=4 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twenty-Five Years Later, McAuliffe’s Legacy Endures|url=http://neatoday.org/2011/01/28/twenty-five-years-later-mcauliffe%E2%80%99s-legacy-endures/|publisher=National Education Association|accessdate=3 November 2013|author=Kevin Hart|date=28 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917133555/http://neatoday.org/2011/01/28/twenty-five-years-later-mcauliffe%E2%80%99s-legacy-endures/|archivedate=17 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the accident, Reagan spoke on national television and assured the nation that the Teacher in Space program would continue. "We'll continue our quest in space", he said. "There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ronald | last=Reagan | title=Address to the nation on the Challenger disaster | date=1986-01-28 | publisher=Office of the President | url =http://www.reaganlibrary.com/reagan/speeches/challenger.asp | accessdate = 2007-08-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225128/http://www.reaganlibrary.com/reagan/speeches/challenger.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NASA decided in 1990 that spaceflight was still too dangerous to risk the lives of civilian teachers, and eliminated the Teacher in Space project. Morgan returned to teaching in Idaho and later became a Mission Specialist on [[STS-118]].

===Educator Astronaut Project===
{{Main|Educator Astronaut Project}}

[[File:Morgan giving lecture.png|thumb|Barbara Morgan, Mission Specialist and backup for the Teacher in Space Project, speaks to an audience of students and media during a January 2007 demonstration at Space Center Houston.]]
In January 1998, NASA replaced the Teacher In Space project with the Educator Astronaut Project. Instead of training teachers for five months as [[Payload Specialist]]s who would return to the classroom, the Educator Astronaut program required selectees to give up their teaching careers, move to Houston, and become [[Mission Specialist]]s (full-time NASA astronauts).

The first Educator Astronauts were selected in 2004.  The three selected in 2004 were Joseph Acaba, Richard Arnold, and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger. Astronauts Acaba and Arnold flew on mission STS-119 in 2009, and Metcalf-Lindenburger flew aboard mission STS-131 in 2010. 

Although many sources incorrectly refer to Barbara Morgan as the first Educator Astronaut, in actuality, Morgan was selected as a Mission Specialist six years before the Educator Astronaut Project was put into place.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Griffin, NASA TV: STS-118 Post-Landing briefing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private program==
In the early 21st Century, the Teacher in Space project was revived in the private sector. The development of reusable, suborbital launch vehicles by commercial companies makes it possible for nonprofit groups to contemplate sending large numbers of teachers into space. The new Teachers in Space program began in 2005. In March 2005, Teacher in Space candidate Pam Leestma, a second-grade teacher and cousin of Space Shuttle astronaut [[David Leestma]], completed a training flight aboard a [[MiG-21]] operated by X-Rocket, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Edward | last=Wright | coauthors= | title=Teacher In Space Candidate Completes Proficiency Flight | date=2005-03-31 | publisher=X-rocket | url =http://www.ereleases.com/pr/20050331005.html | accessdate = 2007-08-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020013531/http://www.ereleases.com/pr/20050331005.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Armadillo Aerospace]], [[Masten Space Systems]], [[PlanetSpace]], [[Rocketplane Limited, Inc.]], and [[XCOR Aerospace]] pledged flights to the new Teachers in Space project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=Tumlinson | coauthors= | title=Masten Space Systems Donates Rocket Ride to Teacher | date=2006-10-16 | publisher=Space Frontier Foundation | url =http://www.space-frontier.org/PressReleases/2006/20060918TISMasten.html | accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advisors to the new Teachers in Space project include [[SpaceShipOne]] builder and Ansari X-Prize winner [[Burt Rutan]], X-Prize founder [[Peter Diamandis]], Apollo astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]], and private astronaut and X-Prize sponsor [[Anousheh Ansari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=Tumlinson |title= New Teachers In Space Program Gains Momentum | date=2006-04-21 | publisher=Space Frontier Foundation | url =http://www.space-frontier.org/PressReleases/2006/20060421teachersinspace.html |accessdate = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Rocket Academy partnered with the SFF in 2006, and worked to draft rules for a "pathfinder" competition to select the first Teachers in Space. The rules were announced at the [[Wirefly X PRIZE Cup]] Competition held at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, New Mexico in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=Tumlinson | coauthors= | title=Godspeed Barbara Morgan; Plans for Large Numbers of Teachers in Space | date=2007-08-08 | publisher=Space Frontier Foundation | url =http://www.space-frontier.org/PressReleases/2007/20070808barbaramorgan.html | accessdate = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications were accepted until November 4, 2008. On July 20, 2009, Teachers in Space announced its first group of "Pathfinders": astronaut teacher candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Teachers in Space |date=2009-07-20 |publisher=Teachers in Space |url=http://teachersinspace.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/seven-astronaut-teacher-candidates-announced/ |accessdate=2009-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725220103/http://teachersinspace.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/seven-astronaut-teacher-candidates-announced/ |archivedate=2009-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2013, [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]]’s new Commercial Space Operations degree program, the first of its kind in the world, announced they will sponsor the Teachers in Space summer workshops for the next five years, indicating their intent toward a continuing long term relationship as well as their sharing a vision to "...help students, teachers and organizers collaborate in bringing space education to every level, from K-12 to graduate programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University |title=Embry-Riddle’s New Degree Program in Commercial Space Operations to Sponsor Teachers in Space Summer Workshops |url=http://daytonabeach.erau.edu/news/teachers-in-space.html |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Education |date=August 1, 2012 |title=Weekly Update: NASA Education |url=https://education.jsc.nasa.gov/war/archive/war_roll_up.cfm?&amp;date=20120801&amp;type=month&amp;yr=2012 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Program director Elizabeth Kennick incorporated the Teachers in Space project as an educational nonprofit in New York, spinning it off from the Space Frontier Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacefrontier.org/2014/10/12921/ |title=Space Frontier Foundation Launches Teachers in Space, Inc. &amp;#124; Space Frontier Foundation |website=Spacefrontier.org |date=2014-10-23 |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5 original Pathfinders (James Kuhl, Rachael Manzer, Lanette Oliver, Chantelle Rose, and Michael Schmidt) remain with the program, also Vice President Joe Latrell and several teacher volunteers.  [[Teachers in Space, Inc.]] has now flown two teacher/student designed experiments to International Space Station (ISS), launched and retrieved several high altitude balloons with data sensors, put teachers through astronaut training experiences including hypobaric chamber and centrifuge, and delivered weeklong professional development workshops for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) teachers in California, Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, and Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Space Show |title=Elizabeth (Liz) Kennick, Teachers In Space, Friday, 2-21-14 |url=http://thespaceshow.wordpress.com/tag/teachers-in-space/ |date=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Teachers in Space, Inc. |title=May Teachers in Space Newsletter |url=http://teachers-in-space.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAYTeachersinSpaceNewsletter.pdf |date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It concludes that owners of high-quality used cars will not place their cars on the used car market. A car buyer should only be able to buy low-quality used cars, and will pay accordingly. The market for good used cars does not exist.]]
"'''The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism'''" is a well-known&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/fddde450-2521-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0&lt;/ref&gt; 1970 paper by economist [[George Akerlof]] which examines how the quality of goods traded in a market can degrade in the presence of [[information asymmetry]] between buyers and sellers, leaving only "lemons" behind. In American slang, a [[lemon (automobile)|lemon]] is a car that is found to be defective only after it has been bought.

Suppose buyers cannot distinguish between a high-quality car (a "peach") and a "lemon". Then they are only willing to pay a fixed price for a car that averages the value of a "peach" and "lemon" together (''p''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;). But sellers know whether they hold a peach or a lemon. Given the fixed price at which buyers will buy, sellers will sell only when they hold "lemons" (since ''p''&lt;sub&gt;lemon&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;) and they will leave the market when they hold "peaches" (since ''p''&lt;sub&gt;peach&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;). Eventually, as enough sellers of "peaches" leave the market, the average willingness-to-pay of buyers will decrease (since the average quality of cars on the market decreased), leading to even more sellers of high-quality cars to leave the market through a positive [[feedback loop]].  

Thus the uninformed buyer's price creates an [[adverse selection]] problem that drives the high-quality cars from the market. Adverse selection is a market mechanism that can lead to a market collapse. 

Akerlof's paper shows how prices can determine the quality of goods traded on the market. Low prices drive away sellers of high-quality goods, leaving only lemons behind. In 2001, Akerlof, along with [[Michael Spence]], and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], jointly received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], for their research on issues related to asymmetric information.

==The paper==

===Thesis===
[[File:Kovacs special 1968.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Ernie Kovacs]] in a comedic used car skit]]
Akerlof's paper uses the [[market (economics)|market]] for [[used car]]s as an example of the problem of quality uncertainty. A used car is one in which ownership is transferred from one person to another, after a period of use by its first owner and its inevitable wear and tear. There are good used cars ("peaches") and defective used cars ("lemons"), normally as a consequence of several not-always-traceable variables, such as the owner's driving style, quality and frequency of maintenance, and accident history. Because many important mechanical parts and other elements are hidden from view and not easily accessible for inspection, the buyer of a car does not know beforehand whether it is a peach or a lemon. So the buyer's best guess for a given car is that the car is of average quality; accordingly, he/she will be willing to pay for it only the price of a car of known average quality. This means that the owner of a carefully maintained, never-abused, good used car will be unable to get a high enough price to make selling that car worthwhile.

Therefore, owners of good cars will not place their cars on the used car market. The withdrawal of good cars reduces the average quality of cars on the market, causing buyers to revise downward their expectations for any given car. This, in turn, motivates the owners of moderately good cars not to sell, and so on. The result is that a market in which there is [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]] with respect to quality shows characteristics similar to those described by [[Gresham's Law]]: the bad drives out the good. (Although Gresham's principle applies more specifically to exchange rates, modified analogies can be drawn.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phlips|first1=Louis|title=The Economics of Price Discrimination|date=June 30, 1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521283949|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical abstract of the problem===
Akerlof considers a situation in which demand ''D'' for used cars depends on the cars price ''p'' and quality ''µ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''µ''(''p'') and the supply depends on price alone. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akerlof |first=George A. |authorlink= |year=1970 |title=The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=[http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/akerlof/themarketforlemons.pdf 488–500.]|publisher=The MIT Press |doi=10.2307/1879431}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic equilibrium]] is given by ''S''(''p'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''D''(''p'',''µ'') and there are two groups of traders with utilities given by:

: &lt;math&gt;U_1 = M+\sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U_2 = M+\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{3}{2} x_i&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the consumption of goods other than automobiles, ''x'' the car's quality and ''n'' the number of automobiles. Let ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be income, demand and supply for group&amp;nbsp;''i''. Assuming that utilities are linear, that the traders are [[Von_Neumann–Morgenstern_utility_theorem|Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility]] maximizers and that the price of other ''M'' goods is unitary, the demand ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for cars is ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''p'' if ''μ''/''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, otherwise null. The demand ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''p'' if 3''μ''/''2''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''p'', otherwise null. Market demand is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;D(p,\mu)=\begin{cases} \left( Y_2+Y_1 \right)/p &amp; p &lt; \mu, \\ Y_2/p &amp; \mu &lt; p &lt; 3\mu/2, \\ 0 &amp; p &gt; 3\mu/2, \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Group 1 has ''N'' cars to sell with quality between 0 and 2 and group 2 has no cars to sell, therefore ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''pN''/2 and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. For a given price ''p'', average quality is ''p''/2, and therefore&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The market for used cars collapses when there is asymmetric information.

===Asymmetric information===
The paper by Akerlof describes how the interaction between quality heterogeneity and [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]] can lead to the disappearance of a market where guarantees are indefinite. In this model, as quality is indistinguishable beforehand by the buyer (due to the asymmetry of information), incentives exist for the seller to pass off low-quality goods as higher-quality ones. The buyer, however, takes this incentive into consideration, and takes the quality of the goods to be uncertain. Only the average quality of the goods will be considered, which in turn will have the side effect that goods that are above average in terms of quality will be driven out of the market. This mechanism is repeated until a [[no-trade equilibrium]] is reached.

As a consequence of the mechanism described in this paper, markets may fail to exist altogether in certain situations involving quality uncertainty. Examples given in Akerlof's paper include the market for used cars, the dearth of formal credit markets in developing countries, and the difficulties that the elderly encounter in buying health insurance. However, not all players in a given market will follow the same rules or have the same aptitude of assessing quality. So there will always be a distinct advantage for some vendors to offer low-quality goods to the less-informed segment of a market that, on the whole, appears to be of reasonable quality and have reasonable guarantees of certainty. This is part of the basis for the idiom [[buyer beware]].

This is likely the basis for the idiom that an [[informed consumer]] is a better consumer. An example of this might be the subjective quality of fine food and wine. Individual consumers know best what they prefer to eat, and quality is almost always assessed in fine establishments by smell and taste before they pay. That is, if a customer in a fine establishment orders a lobster and the meat is not fresh, he can send the lobster back to the kitchen and refuse to pay for it. However, a definition of 'highest quality' for food eludes providers. Thus, a large variety of better-quality and higher-priced restaurants are supported.

===Impact on markets===
The article draws some conclusions about the cost of dishonesty in markets in general:

{{cquote|The cost of dishonesty, therefore, lies not only in the amount by which the purchaser is cheated; the cost also must include the loss incurred from driving legitimate business out of existence.}}

==Critical reception==
George E. Hoffer and Michael D. Pratt state that the “economic literature is divided on whether a lemons market actually exists in used vehicles”. The authors’ research supports the hypothesis that “known defects provisions”, used by US states (e.g., Wisconsin) to regulate used car sales, have been ineffectual, because the quality of used vehicles sold in these states is not significantly better than the vehicles in neighboring states without such consumer protection legislation.&lt;ref name="Hoffer1987"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Hoffer | first = George E. | authorlink = |author2=Pratt, Michael D. | year = 1987 | title = Used vehicles, lemons markets, and Used Car Rules: Some empirical evidence | journal = Journal of Consumer Policy | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 409–414 | doi = 10.1007/BF00411482 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the ''[[American Economic Review]]'' and the ''[[Review of Economic Studies]]'' rejected the paper for "triviality", while the reviewers for ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' rejected it as incorrect, arguing that, if this paper were correct, then no goods could be traded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gans |first=Joshua S. |first2=George B. |last2=Shepherd |year=1994 |title=How Are the Mighty Fallen: Rejected Classic Articles by Leading Economists |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=165–179 |doi=10.1257/jep.8.1.165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only on the fourth attempt did the paper get published in ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/akerlof-article.html Writing the &lt;!--sic;the extra "the" is in the source--&gt; “The Market for ‘Lemons’”: A Personal and Interpretive Essay] by George A. Akerlof&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the paper is one of the most-cited papers in modern economic theory and most downloaded economic journal paper of all time in RePEC (more than 8,530 citations in academic papers as of May 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.de/scholar?cites=8622278700871890196&amp;as_sdt=5,24&amp;sciodt=0,24&amp;hl=en&amp;num=100 |title=Citations of Akerlof: The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism |accessdate=2011-05-27 |work=[[Google Scholar]] |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has profoundly influenced virtually every field of economics, from industrial organisation and public finance to macroeconomics and contract theory.

===Criticism===
[[Libertarianism|Libertarians]], like William L. Anderson, oppose the regulatory approach proposed by the authors of the paper, observing that some used-car markets haven't broken down even without lemon legislation and that the lemon problem creates entrepreneurial opportunities for alternative marketplaces or customers' knowledgeable friends.&lt;ref&gt;Lemons and the Nobel Prize http://mises.org/library/lemons-and-nobel-prize&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions for a lemon market==
A lemon market will be produced by the following:

# Asymmetry of information, in which no buyers can accurately assess the value of a product through examination before sale is made and all sellers can more accurately assess the value of a product prior to sale
# An incentive exists for the seller to pass off a low-quality product as a higher-quality one
# Sellers have no credible disclosure technology (sellers with a great car have no way to disclose this credibly to buyers)
# Either a continuum of seller qualities exists or the average seller type is sufficiently low (buyers are sufficiently pessimistic about the seller's quality)
# Deficiency of ''effective'' public quality assurances (by reputation or regulation and/or of ''effective'' guarantees/warranties)

==Laws in the United States==
Five years after Akerlof's paper was published, the United States enacted a federal "lemon law" (the [[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]]) that protects citizens of all states. There are also state laws regarding "lemons" which vary by state and may not necessarily cover used or leased vehicles. The rights afforded to consumers by "lemon laws" may exceed the warranties expressed in purchase contracts. These state laws provide remedies to consumers for automobiles that repeatedly fail to meet certain standards of quality and performance. "Lemon law" is the common nickname for these laws, but each state has different names for the laws and acts, which may also cover more than just automobiles. In California and federal law, "Lemon Laws" cover anything mechanical.

The federal "lemon law" also provides that the warrantor may be obligated to pay the attorney fees of the party prevailng in a lemon {{Not a typo|law suit}}, as do most state lemon laws. If a car has to be repaired for the same defect four or more times and the problem is still occurring, the car may be deemed to be "a lemon". The defect must substantially hinder the vehicle's use, value, or safety. Purchasers who knowingly purchase a car in "as is" condition accept the defects and void their rights under the "lemon law".

'''Thermostability''' is the quality of a substance to resist irreversible change in its [[Chemical structure|chemical]] or physical structure, often by resisting decomposition or polymerization, at a high relative temperature.

Thermostable materials may be used industrially as [[fire retardant]]s. A ''thermostable [[plastic]]'', an uncommon and unconventional term, is likely to refer to a [[thermosetting plastic]] that cannot be reshaped when heated, than to a [[thermoplastic]] that can be remelted and recast.

Thermostability is also a property of some proteins. To be a thermostable protein means to be resistant to changes in  [[protein structure]] due to applied heat.

==Thermostable proteins==
[[File:Process of Denaturation.svg|thumb|As heat is added, this disrupts the intramolecular bonds found in tertiary structure of proteins, causing the protein to unfold and become inactive.]]
Most life-forms on Earth live at temperatures of less than 50&amp;nbsp;°C, commonly from 15 to 50&amp;nbsp;°C. Within these organisms are macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids) which form the three-dimensional structures essential to their enzymatic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kandhari|first=Nitika|last2=Sinha|first2=Somdatta|date=June 26, 2017|title=Complex network analysis of thermostable mutants of Bacillus subtilis Lipase A|url=https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-017-0039-y|journal=Applied Network Science|language=En|volume=2|issue=1|pages=18|doi=10.1007/s41109-017-0039-y|issn=2364-8228|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the native temperature of the organism, thermal energy may cause the [[Protein folding|unfolding]] and [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], as the heat can disrupt the intramolecular bonds in the tertiary and quaternary structure. This unfolding will result in loss in enzymatic activity, which is understandably deleterious to continuing life-functions.  An example of such is the denaturing of proteins in [[Egg white|albumen]] from a clear, nearly colourless liquid to an opaque white, insoluble gel.

Proteins capable of withstanding such high temperatures compared to proteins that cannot, are generally from microorganisms that are hyperthermophiles. Such organisms can withstand above 50&amp;nbsp;°C temperatures as they usually live within environments of 85&amp;nbsp;°C and above.&lt;ref name="pmid8875639"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Danson MJ, Hough DW, Russell RJ, Taylor GL, Pearl L | title = Enzyme thermostability and thermoactivity | journal = Protein Engineering | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 629–30 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8875639 | doi = 10.1093/protein/9.8.629 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Danson/publication/14330539_Enzyme_thermostability_and_thermoactivity/links/0c96051c94743de5cd000000/Enzyme-thermostability-and-thermoactivity.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[thermophile|thermophilic life-forms]] exist which can withstand temperatures above this, and have corresponding adaptations to preserve protein function at these temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takami H, Takaki Y, Chee GJ, Nishi S, Shimamura S, Suzuki H, Matsui S, Uchiyama I | title = Thermoadaptation trait revealed by the genome sequence of thermophilic Geobacillus kaustophilus | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = 21 | pages = 6292–303 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15576355 | pmc = 535678 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkh970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can include altered bulk properties of the cell to stabilize all proteins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neves C, da Costa MS, Santos H | title = Compatible solutes of the hyperthermophile Palaeococcus ferrophilus: osmoadaptation and thermoadaptation in the order thermococcales | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 71 | issue = 12 | pages = 8091–8 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16332790 | pmc = 1317470 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.71.12.8091-8098.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and specific changes to individual proteins. Comparing [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] proteins present in these thermophiles and other organisms reveal some differences in the protein structure. One notable difference is the presence of extra [[hydrogen bond]]s in the thermophile's proteins—meaning that the protein structure is more resistant to unfolding.  Similarly, thermostable proteins are rich in [[Salt bridge (protein)|salt bridges]] or/and extra [[Disulfide|disulfide bridges]] stabilizing the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Das R, Gerstein M | title = The stability of thermophilic proteins: a study based on comprehensive genome comparison | journal = Functional &amp; Integrative Genomics | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–88 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 11793224 | doi = 10.1007/s101420000003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsumura M, Becktel WJ, Levitt M, Matthews BW | title = Stabilization of phage T4 lysozyme by engineered disulfide bonds | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 86 | issue = 17 | pages = 6562–6 | date = September 1989 | pmid = 2671995 | pmc = 297884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors of protein thermostability are compactness of protein structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson MJ, Eisenberg D | title = Transproteomic evidence of a loop-deletion mechanism for enhancing protein thermostability | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 290 | issue = 2 | pages = 595–604 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10390356 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1999.2889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; oligomerization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanaka Y, Tsumoto K, Yasutake Y, Umetsu M, Yao M, Fukada H, Tanaka I, Kumagai I | title = How oligomerization contributes to the thermostability of an archaeon protein.

=== Uses and Applications of Thermostable Proteins ===

==== Polymerase Chain Reactions ====
Thermostable [[enzyme]]s such as [[Taq polymerase]] and [[Pfu DNA polymerase]] are used in [[polymerase chain reaction]]s (PCR) where temperatures of 94&amp;nbsp;°C or over are used to melt apart [[DNA]] strands in the denaturation step of PCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saiki RK, Gelfand DH, Stoffel S, Scharf SJ, Higuchi R, Horn GT, Mullis KB, Erlich HA | title = Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase | journal = Science | volume = 239 | issue = 4839 | pages = 487–91 | date = January 1988 | pmid = 2448875 | doi = 10.1126/science.2448875 | bibcode = 1988Sci...239..487S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resistance to high temperature allows for DNA polymerase to elongate  DNA with a desired sequence of interest with the presence of dNTP's.

==== Protein Purification ====
Knowledge of an enzyme's resistance to high temperatures is especially beneficial in [[protein purification]]. In the procedure of heat denaturation, one can subject a mixture of proteins to high temperatures, which will result in the denaturation of proteins that are not thermostable, and the isolation of the protein that is thermodynamically stable. One notable example of this is found in the purification of [[alkaline phosphatase]] from the hyperthermophile ''[[Pyrococcus abyssi]]''. This enzyme is known for being heat stable at temperatures greater than 95&amp;nbsp;°C, and therefore can be partially purified by heating when heterologously expressed in ''E. coli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zappa S, Rolland JL, Flament D, Gueguen Y, Boudrant J, Dietrich J | title = Characterization of a highly thermostable alkaline phosphatase from the euryarchaeon Pyrococcus abyssi | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 67 | issue = 10 | pages = 4504–11 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11571149 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.67.10.4504-4511.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in temperature causes the ''E. coli'' proteins to precipitate, while the ''P. abyssi'' alkaline phosphatase remains stably in solution.

==== Glycoside Hydrolases ====
Another important group of thermostable enzymes are [[glycoside hydrolases]]. These enzymes are responsible of the degradation of the major fraction of biomass, the polysaccharides present in starch and lignocellulose. Thus, [[glycoside hydrolases]] are gaining great interest in biorefining applications in the future bioeconomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=|year=2014|author1=Linares-Pastén|first1=J. A.|title=Thermostable glycoside hydrolases in biorefinery technologies|journal=Current Biotechnology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=26–44|last2=Andersson|first2=M |last3=Nordberg karlsson|first3=E|doi=10.2174/22115501113026660041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples are the production of monosaccharides for food applications as well as use as carbon source for microbial conversion in fuels (ethanol) and chemical intermediates, production of oligosaccharides for prebiotic applications and production of surfactants alkyl glycoside type. All of these processes often involve thermal treatments to facilitate the polysaccharide hydrolysis, hence give thermostable variants of [[glycoside hydrolases]] an important role in this context.

===Approaches to improve thermostability of proteins===
[[Protein engineering]] can be used to enhance the thermostability of proteins. A number of [[site-directed mutagenesis|site-directed]] and [[Mutagenesis (molecular biology technique)#random mutagenesis|random mutagenesis]] techniques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarkar CA, Dodevski I, Kenig M, Dudli S, Mohr A, Hermans E, Plückthun A | title = Directed evolution of a G protein-coupled receptor for expression, stability, and binding selectivity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 39 | pages = 14808–13 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18812512 | pmc = 2567449 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0803103105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..10514808S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Asial I, Cheng YX, Engman H, Dollhopf M, Wu B, Nordlund P, Cornvik T | title = Engineering protein thermostability using a generic activity-independent biophysical screen inside the cell | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 4 | pages = 2901 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24352381 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms3901 | bibcode = 2013NatCo...4E2901A }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to [[directed evolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoseki J, Yano T, Koyama Y, Kuramitsu S, Kagamiyama H | title = Directed evolution of thermostable kanamycin-resistance gene: a convenient selection marker for Thermus thermophilus | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 126 | issue = 5 | pages = 951–6 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10544290 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022539 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been used to increase the thermostability of target proteins.

These forces include hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, and the presence of disulfide bonds. The overall amount of hydrophobicity present in a particular protein is responsible for its thermostability. Another type of force that is responsible for thermostability of a protein is the electrostatic interactions between molecules. These interactions include salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Salt bridges are unaffected by high temperatures, therefore, are necessary for protein and enzyme stability. A third force used to increase thermosability in proteins and enzymes is the presence of disulfide bonds. They present covalent cross-linkages between the polypeptide chains. These bonds are the strongest because they’re covalent bonds, making them stronger than intermolecular forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tigerström|first=Anna|date=2005|title=Thermostability of Proteins|jstor=4608725|journal=Bios|volume=76|issue=1|pages=22–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermostable toxins==
Certain [[poison]]ous [[Fungus|fungi]] contain thermostable [[toxin]]s, such as [[amatoxin]] found in the [[death cap]] and [[Galerina|autumn skullcap]] [[mushroom]]s and [[patulin]] from molds. Therefore, applying heat to these will not remove the toxicity and is of particular concern for food safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA: Moldy applesauce repackaged by school lunch supplier|url=http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/11/04/8636308-fda-moldy-applesauce-repackaged-by-school-lunch-supplier?lite|website=NBC News|publisher=NBC News|access-date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YASS accepts nucleotide sequences in either plain text or the [[FASTA format]] and the output format includes the [[BLAST]] tabular output. YASS uses several ''transition-constrained'' spaced seed [[k-mer|k-mers]], which allow considerably improved sensitivity. YASS can be used locally on a user's machine, or as [[SaaS]] on the [http://bioinfo.cristal.univ-lille.fr/yass/yass.php YASS web server], which produces a browser based [[Dot plot (bioinformatics)|dot-plot]].
