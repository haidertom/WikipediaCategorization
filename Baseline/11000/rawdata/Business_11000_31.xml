According to ''[[Reuters]]'', in 2013, it became the first Saudi Arabian company to issue an Islamic bond in [[Malaysian ringgit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/saudi-sukuk-ringgit-idINL6N0DB3HS20130424|title=Al Bayan issues first ringgit sukuk from Saudi firm|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=IN|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2012, ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'' informed that [[Abdul Rahman Al Hammad|Dr. Al Hammad]] was operating 20 companies in [[Saudi Arabia]] and in [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.aawsat.com/details.asp?issueno=8800&amp;article=150109#.W6JzwNDhXqD|title=شركة البيان القابضة تطرح استراتيجيات عمل لمؤسسات القطاع الخاص لتحقيق أهدافها,|website=archive.aawsat.com|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including Aloula Geojit Company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aloulageojit.net/page.php?id=7&amp;l=2|title=Aloula Geojit|website=www.aloulageojit.net|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Achievements==
In 2005, ''[[Al Riyadh (newspaper)|Al Riyadh]]'' reported that Al Bayan Holding Group's Chairman [[Abdul Rahman Al Hammad|Dr. Abdul Rahman Al Hammad]] signed a commercial advertising deal with Minister [[Iyad bin Amin Madani]] of [[Ministry of Culture and Information (Saudi Arabia)|Minister of Culture and Information]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alriyadh.com/76316|title=«البيان» تحتكر إعلانات التلفزيون السعودي بـ 228 مليون ريال|work=جريدة الرياض|access-date=2018-10-01|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2012, ''[[Al Riyadh (newspaper)|Al-Riyadh]]'' reported that the administration of [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah Al Saud]] officially granted Al Bayan Holding Group to organize the annual [[Jenadriyah|Al Jenadriyah]] festival in [[Riyadh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alriyadh.com/712144|title=خادم الحرمين يكرم «مجموعة البيان القابضة» لرعايتها مهرجان الجنادرية|work=جريدة الرياض|access-date=2018-09-18|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2013, ''[[Al Jazirah (newspaper)|Al Jazirah]]'' reported that the then Governor of [[Riyadh]], [[Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud|Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]], awarded Dr. Al Hammad for the excellent work done by DNGO Contracting Company, one of the entitites of Al Bayan Holding Group for implementing the project of strengthening of water resources in Riyadh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-jazirah.com/2013/20130430/ln1.htm|title=بمناسبة تكريم سمو أمير الرياض لمجموعة البيان القابضة|website=www.al-jazirah.com|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== Al Hammad as Vice Chairman of Saudi Cooperative Societies Council===
In 2015, ''[[Saudi Gazette]]'' reported that [[Abdul Rahman Al Hammad|Dr. Al Hammad]] was appointed as the new Vice Chairman of [[Cooperative Societies Council|Saudi Cooperative Societies Council]] on 22 November 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/article/145172|title=Al-Hammad urges creation of more Saudi cooperative societies|date=2015-12-24|work=Saudigazette|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Saud Bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud|Prince Saud bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud]]. However, the incumbency of Dr. Al Hammad's position is disputed after the 2017 crisis when [[Malaysia|Malaysia's]] [[RAM Holdings Berhad|RAM]] suspended Al Bayan Holding Group's ratings.

===Major Contracts===
In 2014, [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts]] signed a deal with Al Bayan Holding Group's Dar Al Bayan Real Estate firm in order to launch a hotel in [[Jubail]], [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4051491.html|title=Hilton Worldwide Signs First Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts Property In Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia|last=Net|first=Hospitality|website=Hospitality Net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==2017 Crisis==
In March 2017, [[Malaysia|Malaysia's]] ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' reported that [[Malaysia|Malaysian]] [[RAM Holdings Berhad|RAM Rating Services]] of RAM Holdings Berhad, [[Kuala Lumpur]] suspended the rating of the RM1bil Sukuk Wakalah (2013/2023) issued by Al Bayan Holding Company following the group’s failure to meet certain obligations under RAM’s rating mandate. This resulted the escalation of Al Bayan's financial crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2017/03/07/ram-ratings-suspends-rating-of-al-bayan-rm1b-sukuk/|title=RAM Ratings suspends rating of Al Bayan's RM1b Sukuk - Business News {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
{{quote|“We were unable to contact Al Bayan and seek a satisfactory resolution of outstanding matters.”

 ― RAM}}

After the suspension of RAM ratings, it was reported that many firms started to withdrew their contracts and agreements with Al Bayan Holding Group, indicating that there is a financial crisis undergoing in Al Bayan.

===2017 Anti-Corruption Drive===
It was reported that the [[Government of Saudi Arabia|Saudi government]] arrested co-owners of Al Bayan Holding Group in November 2017, including [[Abdul Rahman Al Hammad|Dr. Abdul Rahman Al Hammad]], following [[Muhammad bin Salman|Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman's]] launch of [[2017 Saudi Arabian purge|2017 Anti-Corruption Drive]]. However, these suspicions and allegations didn't appeared in the local press of [[Saudi Arabia]].

===Social Media Outrage===
In December 2017, an Egyptian expatriate calling himself as an employee of Al Bayan Holding Group uploaded a video on YouTube where he explained about his mental harassment in the firm via the four co-owners. He also requested the arrest of co-owners and clearance of his dues through intervention of [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman Al Saud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Medhat Bogee|title=استغاثة العاملين بشركة مجموعة البيان القابضة بالرياض|date=2017-11-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFPMCereqxI&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;The same person uploaded a video in late December 2017 or early January 2018 where he records a footage through his mobile phone in which he shows a group of stranded employees of DNGO Contracting Company and Nahdaat Al Emaar, the two subsidiaries of Al Bayan Holding Group without their dues and salaries calling for justice&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Medhat Bogee|title=تكملة للاستغاثة للعاملين بشركة مجموعة البيان القابضة دونجو ونهضة الاعمار للمقاولات|date=2017-11-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTP92l44gsI&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In early January 2017, an person informing himself as an engineer assigned at Al Bayan Holding Group recorded a footage via his mobile phone and later uploaded it on [[YouTube]]. In the video, he had shown that employees holding banners are on strike against the firm as some of them didn't receive their dues and salaries from the past 13 months&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Engr.Sherief.Ahmed|title=اعتصام موظفين مجموعة البيان القابضة بادارة الشركة بالعليا والشركة تطلب الشرطة للموظفين|date=2018-01-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=cCq1BJq1THg&amp;app=desktop|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The same engineer uploaded a video in the same month of January where he shows stranded expatriates who didn't received their salaries for more than six months on strike against the firm at the Al Bayan's project site in [['Asir Region]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Engr.Sherief.Ahmed|title=اعتصام عمال مجموعة البيان القابضة مشاريع عسير|date=2018-01-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqBYoqoR5M|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An another expatriate in Al Bayan Holding Group uploaded a video on YouTube in February 2018 requesting justice from [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman Al Saud]] and [[Muhammad bin Salman|Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman Al Saud]] after he didn't received his salary for more than 12 months&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=hamada Mostafa|title=مجموعه البيان القابضه للمقاولات وتأخر رواتب سنه كامله|date=2018-02-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytAbDfOMuso&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Anand was the youngest of twelve children&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/dh/hlpanel/panyarachun-bio.htm Biography of Anand Panyarachun]&lt;/ref&gt; of a wealthy family of [[Mon people|Mon]] heritage on his father's side and Thai-[[Thai Chinese|Chinese]] ([[Hoklo people|Hokkien]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Thailand|author=[[Chris Baker (writer)|Chris Baker]], [[Pasuk Phongpaichit]]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=154 and 280|isbn=0-521-81615-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;) on his mother's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?p=anand+%22chinese+family%22&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;fl=0&amp;fp_ip=SG&amp;x=wrt&amp;meta=0&amp;u=www.anandp.in.th/en_speech/e020005.html&amp;w=anand+%22chinese+family%22&amp;d=ZiSHAvmdOexo&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us PAVING THE WAY]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaowao.org/PROUD%20TO%20BE%20MON%20SAYS%20FORMER%20THAI%20PM.php PROUD TO BE MON SAYS FORMER THAI PM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026140520/http://www.kaowao.org/PROUD%20TO%20BE%20MON%20SAYS%20FORMER%20THAI%20PM.php |date=26 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anand himself, he inherited his Chinese heritage from his maternal grandmother, whose surname was Lau ({{zh|c=刘}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=泰国华侨华人研究|author=[泰国] 洪林, 黎道纲主编|publisher=香港社会科学出版社有限公司|date=April 2006|pages=185|isbn=962-620-127-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Chinese ancestors came to Thailand in the mid-18th century and eventually became one of the country's most prominent Hokkien families. He is distantly related to [[Korn Chatikavanij]] through this branch of his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/King-Taksin-and-Thailands-Chinese-roots-30297153.html King Taksin and Thailand’s Chinese roots]&lt;/ref&gt; Anand attended [[Dulwich College]] and later read laws at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating with honours in 1955.

Anand spent 23 years in the foreign service, serving at times as the Ambassador of Thailand to the [[United Nations]], [[Thai Ambassador to Canada|Canada]], the [[United States]], and [[West Germany]]. In January 1976 he was appointed Permanent Secretary of the foreign ministry, and played a leading role in ensuring the US military withdrawal from Thailand. Following that year's October coup, Anand was branded a communist by the military during the subsequent political witch hunts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Angels and Devils|author=David Murray|publisher=White Orchid Press (1996)}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably for the Foreign Ministry's role in the normalisation of diplomatic relations between Thailand and the People's Republic of China. Although the civil service panel set up to investigate the allegations cleared him of any wrongdoing, Anand was put into relatively unimportant posts and in 1979 left the public sector for the private.&lt;ref&gt;Far Eastern Economic Review, 19 December 1991&lt;/ref&gt; He became the Vice-Chairman of the Saha-Union Group in 1979 and the Chairman of the Board of Directors in 1991. He has been a Director of [[Siam Commercial Bank]] since 1984.&lt;ref name="Anand-Bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.anandp.in.th/en_bio.html|website=Anand Panyarachun|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First administration==
[[File:นายกรัฐมนตรีร่วมงานถวายเลี้ยงพระกระยาหารค่ำแด่สมเด็จพร - Flickr - Abhisit Vejjajiva (34).jpg|thumb|Anand in 2010]]
On 23 February 1991, a military coup led by Generals [[Sunthorn Kongsompong]], supreme commander of the armed forces, and General [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]], the commander-in-chief of the army, imprisoned the leader of the democratically elected administration of [[Chatichai Choonhavan]]. As in previous Thai coups, the military formed a [[National Peace Keeping Council]] (NPKC) to run the country. To shore up its image and gain the trust of King [[Bhumibol]], the NPKC appointed Anand as interim prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The King Never Smiles|author=Paul M. Handley|publisher=Yale University Press (2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anand, closely linked to the palace and held in respect by both the bureaucracy and the business community, proved acceptable to the people and the international community. He was regarded as being astute and disciplined, and had never been associated with any financial scandal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Murray&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon accepting the position of prime minister, Anand was quick to declare that he did not agree with everything the junta had done and that he intended to follow an independent course. He further angered the NPKC by suggesting that the imprisoned Chatichai be released immediately upon a cabinet being appointed.&lt;ref&gt;''Bangkok Post'', 3 March 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
The interim constitution that was promulgated on 1 March reconfirmed the intention of the NKPC to retain substantial control.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', 11 March 1991&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anand was allowed relative freedom to select his own cabinet members. For the entire period of his premiership Anand faced constant pressure from the junta leaders, who tried to influence government decisions in order to gain financial benefits.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Handley&lt;/ref&gt;

Anand filled his cabinet with well-known academics, technocrats, and ex-bureaucrats with proven records. Various commentators, ranging from the president of the prestigious [[Thailand Development Research Institute]] to the mass-circulation newspaper ''[[Thai Rath]]'', described the cabinet as the most impressive Thailand had ever had.&lt;ref&gt;''Bangkok Post'', 7 March 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', 7 March 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The strong guiding hand of privy councillor [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] could be seen.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Amongst those selected by Anand were Prem's previous finance minister and economic advisor. A senior diplomat during the years Prem served as prime minister became foreign minister. The [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] orientation of the cabinet substantially diminished the fears of foreign investors.&lt;ref name=Praagh-1996&gt;{{cite book|title=Thailand's Struggle for Democracy|author=David van Praagh|publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier (1996)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforms===
Anand's administration proved more hard-working than his predecessors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The administration worked on its task of implementing a long list of much-needed reforms. Its emphasis on education, public health, exports, agriculture, industry, environment, and improvement in living conditions, met with widespread approval. In a Bangkok poll in late-July 1991, 61 percent of respondents felt that the Anand government was more honest than previous administrations.&lt;ref&gt;''Bangkok Post'' Weekly Review, 2 August 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the most significant of the reforms was a restructuring of the taxation system, which saw the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) and a reduction in corporate and income taxation. Several measures were taken to free up the flow of funds into and out of the country. Thai nationals were allowed to invest abroad without the approval of the [[Bank of Thailand]]. Regulations were altered for foreign banks to open branches and the ceiling on bank interest rates was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', 16 April 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the process for obtaining official operating licences for factories was greatly simplified, while the method of allocating textile and tapioca quotas was made more apparent. In the energy sector, price control barriers were dismantled.

The government was also able to successfully conclude agreements for a number of large-scale infrastructure projects initiated by the Chatichai administration. A regulatory board to oversee the privatisation and private investment in infrastructure projects was established. The projects themselves were also to be independently approved and monitored by agencies outside the government in order to minimise the opportunities for corruption.

In an attempt to spread the benefits of the country's economic growth, civil servants were given a 23 percent raise in wages, state employers a 20 percent wage rise, and the minimum wage was raised by 15 percent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In addition to this, the Anand government allocated six  billion baht in the 1992 fiscal budget to be distributed to villages for their own discretionary spending.

Key accomplishments of Anand's government include:
* The establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)&lt;ref name="NAR-20181111"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Faulder |first1=Dominic |title=A low-key meeting in 1991 gave rise to the ASEAN Free Trade Area |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-Relations/A-low-key-meeting-in-1991-gave-rise-to-the-ASEAN-Free-Trade-Area |accessdate=2018-11-12 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A highly effective anti-AIDS/HIV policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV and AIDS in Thailand |url=http://www.avert.org/aidsthai.htm |website=AVERT |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Electricity market reform, including the introduction of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and the initiation of a 10-year liberalisation and privatisation plan for [[EGAT]].  Many have noted that Saha-Union Group, which Anand chaired, won a major bid to build a large coal-fired power plant while Anand was in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eprf.ca/probeint/mekong/reports/EGAT.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929033350/http://www.eprf.ca/probeint/mekong/reports/EGAT.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Award of a multi-billion baht concession to Telecom Asia (today known as [[True Corporation|True]]) to build and operate two million telephone lines in Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandp.in.th/en_speech/e020003.html นายอานันท์ ปันยารชุน&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was noted by many that General Suchinda, the coup leader who installed Anand as Prime Minister, was appointed chairman of Telecom Asia after he was toppled from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcita.gov.au/crf/papers98/lewis.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919065617/http://www.dcita.gov.au/crf/papers98/lewis.doc |archivedate=19 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Suspension of the [[Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System|Hopewell]] rail-train airport link project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=50326&amp;usrsess= Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111210822/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=50326&amp;usrsess=|date=11 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
On the international front Anand performed well. Despite international concern over the coup, foreign administrations had sufficient confidence to resume relations quickly. Anand made visits to [[China]] in September 1991 and [[Japan]] in December 1991, and went on to meetings with President [[George H. W. Bush]] in the United States. He was able to shake off the stigma of being a junta-installed prime minister, instead successfully presenting the image of an administration determined to deregulate, cut red tape, and create an environment conductive to free enterprise.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The Anand government's policies to its neighbours followed the lead of his predecessor Chatichai. Relationships with [[Laos]] improved significantly, with Thailand allocating one-half of its 200 million baht aid budget to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;''Bangkok Post'', 20 February 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand under Anand became deeply involved in the [[Modern Cambodia#Peace efforts and the free elections|Cambodian peace process]], while relations with [[Vietnam]] went through a period of fence-mending and confidence-building.

The only foreign relations area where there were serious reasons for criticising Anand's administration was Thailand's soft stance towards the repressive military junta of [[Burma]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Disagreements with the NPKC===
Anand disagreed with the military junta's plans to increase the defence budget. Anand denied the military's request for supplemental funding that would have totalled 53 billion baht.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Junta member Air Chief Marshal [[Kaset Rojananil]] criticised the government for being too "inefficient" and calling for it to resign.&lt;ref&gt;''Bangkok Post'', 2 October 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Suchinda justified the military's request by stating that there were still communist fighters in the Indochina region.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In November and December Anand publicly repeated his views that the country's security did not lie in military might, but in its economic and political development, on one occasion stating, "Military might is no longer a guarantee of national security. No nation can feel secure as long as its citizens are deprived of freedom of political expression and of the opportunities for a better and more meaningful life."&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', 5 November 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Anand also voiced disagreement with the junta's draft constitution, although the constitution was ultimately promulgated. At first, he refused to comment as the Constitution Scrutinising Committee, hand-picked by Sunthorn, made changes to what became the final draft constitution.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Then on 16 November, Anand spoke out against clauses that gave the appointed 360 member Senate the same powers as elected members of the House of Representatives as well as a clause allowing permanent public officials and military officers to hold political posts. Anand suggested that the Senate be reduced in size. The military-dominated Constitution Drafting Assembly refused to accept his suggestions and voted unanimously to pass the draft.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Anand's response was simple: "I'm disappointed".&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', 22 November 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
Anand's refusal to interfere with the junta's actions meant that his administration failed to come to grips with human rights issues. He had a comprehensive environmental bill passed, but it was ignored by the military, which continued to conduct its corrupt activities. Not long after it had taken power, the NPKC announced a huge rural development project that would help solve the problems of rural landlessness and encroachment on protected forests, issues that had for decades occupied the king's attention.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The military had promised to resettle more than 1.2 million people to permanent farmlands, but instead callously evicted villagers from forest reserves, where they had lived in some cases for generations, and transferred the lands to corporate plantations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Occasional Paper No. 21, Indian Ocean Centre for Peace Studies, University of Western Australia&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all cases, the army failed to provide new homes and food supplies. When an activist monk led villagers to protest, he and his followers were attacked and arrested.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In mid-June 1991, the outspoken president of the Labour Congress of Thailand, Thanong Phoarn, mysteriously disappeared. The deputy defence minister, a military man, casually brushed the matter aside, claiming that Thanong had probably fled his wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Bangkok Post'' Weekly Review, 12 July 1991&lt;/ref&gt; He has not been seen since.

With respect to the freedom of information, the Anand administration also disappointed many. With the NPKC in full control of the media, blatant censorship was practised of any issue that was critical of the military. Thus, rallies and demonstrations on a wide range of issues of public concern were kept from the public. The transparency of the denials of censorship by the military-dominated Interior Ministry must have been apparent to Anand, but he chose to do nothing about them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Anand was succeeded by General Suchinda, who was appointed by parliament after general elections.

==Second government==
Suchinda resigned on 24 May 1992, following an intervention by the king that ended the violent military crackdown on massive popular protests against his government. The five coalition parties that made up his administration still attempted to cling to power, however, despite calls for their resignation by the opposition and the press, and nominated Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, leader of the [[Chart Thai]] Party, for the premiership.&lt;ref name="Praagh-1996" /&gt; At the time it looked as if House Speaker Arthit Urairat was set to submit Somboon's name to the king.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Arthit however held back the nomination of Somboon following a meeting with privy councillor Prem, who was thought to have been exerting pressure on behalf of the king.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The House Speaker instead announced that no decision would be made until the constitutional amendments were passed on 10 June, adding that the next prime minister would be a civilian.

On 10 June, Arthit surprised the country by recommending Anand's name instead of Somboon's to the king. The announcement was greeted with almost universal approval and even relief. Only the coalition parties of the previous government were dismayed, turning at first on Arthit, who they saw as having betrayed them.&lt;ref name="Praagh-1996" /&gt;

Four days later Anand announced the formation of his cabinet, which included twenty respected technocrats who had held ministerial portfolios during his previous tenure as prime minister.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The top tasks of Anand's government were the rehabilitation of the economy, the organisation of free and fair elections, and the removal of top armed forces commanders from their posts.

The Internal Peacekeeping Law, which allowed for the use of military force against demonstrators, was abolished on 29 June, and on 1 August, he removed Air Chief Marshal Kaset, General Issarapong, and General Chainarong, the First Regional Army Commander, from their posts.

Anand was succeeded by democratically-elected [[Chuan Leekpai]] later in 1992.

==Post-political career==
Anand rejoined the Saha-Union Group as chairman after the general elections of 1992.  His government had awarded Saha-Union a major [[Independent Power Producer]] concession. He resigned from Saha-Union Group in 2002.

===Constitution Drafting Assembly===
In 1996, Anand was elected as a member of the Constitution Drafting Assembly and was appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee. He oversaw the drafting of what became known as the "Peoples' Constitution" of 1997.  The constitution was abrogated in 2006 after a [[2006 Thai coup d'état|military coup]] against [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] that Anand supported. The People's Constitution instituted several important reforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/Niyom_ThaiUpdate%20Apr03.rtf |title=The 1997 Constitution: the path of reform; A Presentation for the Thai Update 2003 Conference in Canberra |accessdate=4 November 2016 |format=PDF |work= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320082620/http://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/Niyom_ThaiUpdate%20Apr03.rtf |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/804/65/ |title=Unknown |accessdate= |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527170104/http://towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/804/65/ |archivedate=27 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpi.ac.th/kpi/en/democratization.htm |title=Unknown |accessdate= |work=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
* Decentralisation of government, including the establishment of elected Tambon Administrative Organisations (TAOs) and Provincial Administrative Organisations (PAOs).  School administrations were also decentralised, although opposition from teachers delayed implementation of this reform
* Establishment of several independent government agencies, including the Election Commission, the Office of the Auditor-General, and the National Human Rights Commission
* Stipulated that candidates for parliament must have at least a bachelor's degree
* Mechanisms to increase political stability by favouring large parties over small ones, and hence singular governments over coalition governments

===National Reconciliation Commission===
From March 2005, Anand served as chairman of the National Reconciliation Commission, tasked with overseeing that peace was restored to the [[South Thailand insurgency|troubled south]]. A fierce critic of the [[Thaksin Shinawatra|Thaksin]]-government, Anand frequently criticised his handling of the southern unrest, and in particular the State of Emergency Decree. He has been quoted to have said, "The authorities have worked inefficiently.  They have arrested innocent people instead of the real culprits, leading to mistrust among locals. So, giving them broader power may lead to increased violence and eventually a real crisis." Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated from 2005 to 2006, with escalating violence, especially among teachers and civilians.  Despite much criticism of the Thaksin-government's policies, Anand refused to submit the NRC's final report, choosing instead to wait for the results of the 2006 legislative election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangkokpost.net/News/21Mar2006_news14.php |title=Unknown|accessdate= |format= |work=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anand finally submitted the NRC's recommendations on 5 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangkokpost.net/News/06Jun2006_news01.php |title=Unknown|accessdate= |format= |work=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among them were
* Introducing [[Sharia|Islamic law]]
* Making ethnic [[Yawi language|Pattani-Malay (Yawi)]] an official language of the region
* Establishing an unarmed peacekeeping force
* Establishing a Peaceful Strategic Administrative Centre for southern border provinces

The recommendations were rejected by Privy Council President Prem, who stated, "We cannot accept that [proposal] as we are Thai. The country is Thai and the language is Thai... We have to be proud to be Thai and have the Thai language as the sole national language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/25/headlines/headlines_30007268.php |title=Unknown |accessdate= |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605044334/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/25/headlines/headlines_30007268.php |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other positions===
Anand is a member of the [[Trilateral Commission]] and the International Advisory Board of [[American International Group]] (AIG). Anand is a member of the [[Carlyle Group]] and sits on the [[Carlyle Group]]'s advisory board for Asia-Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', [http://members.tripod.com/thanong/03072001.htm Anand outlines ties to group of giants], 7 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as UNICEF Ambassador for Thailand since 1996. During November 2003 and December 2004, Anand was requested by then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to chair the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change [http://www.globalpolicy.org/un-reform/un-reform-initiatives/highlevel-panels/32369.html] [http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/150/32629.html] of the United Nations. The panel of former presidents, prime ministers, and scholars was tasked to prepare recommendations for possible UN reform.

He is also the founding chairman of the [[Kenan Institute Asia]], a social and economic development non-profit serving the development needs of the Greater Mekong Subregion. Under Anand, the institute focused on fostering development partnerships between Thailand and US organisations. Some of the projects under his leadership included recycling steel slag, implementing low cost HIV-diagnostic testing, building a waste water treatment plant, developing sustainable energy by generating energy from [[landfill gas]], and building capacity in development.

==Support for the 2006 military coup==
Anand supported the 2006 military coup that abrogated the People's Constitution and overthrew the government of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].  Anand had been a sharp critic of Thaksin for several years prior to the coup, and he blamed the coup on Thaksin.  He also stated fears that the military junta would fail and that Thaksin could make a comeback.  "When the [Chatichai] government disappeared from the scene [after the 1991 coup] there was no fear it could make a comeback. But over the past five years Thaksin and his party have become too powerful. They have consolidated their hold over the government machinery and certain sectors of the armed forces and parliament. So I think it's a more precarious situation." Anand claimed that the coup was well received by the people and that the military junta's ban against opposition or political activity would not last long.  He also noted surprise at the international community's condemnation to the coup.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/29/politics/politics_30014940.php Our coup is different: Anand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063023/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/29/politics/politics_30014940.php |date=31 October 2006 }}, 29 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn==
In a private meeting with US Ambassador [[Ralph Boyce]], whose post-meeting report was leaked by [[WikiLeaks]], Anand was critical of Crown Prince [[Vajiralongkorn]]. Anand noted that although the Crown Prince would succeed his father according to the law, the kingdom would be better off if other arrangements could be made. However, Anand noted that King Bhumibol would not likely change the succession. Anand also said that the Prince's succession would face "complicating factors" he continued interfering in politics or could not avoid embarrassing financial transactions, and that it was the consensus view among many Thai was that the Crown Prince could not stop either, nor would he be able, at age 57, to rectify his behaviour.  Anand neither confirmed nor denied that he made the statements. Anand's alleged negative opinion of the Crown Prince was repeated by Privy Counsellor [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] and [[Siddhi Savetsila]] in their meetings with the US Ambassador, the reports of which were all leaked by Wikileaks.&lt;ref&gt;FT, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/77990ce8-094b-11e0-ada6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1DiRZ0qhi Cables breach taboo on Thai royal family], 16 December&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticism of the royal family is illegal in Thailand.

'''Andrej Babiš''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈandrɛj ˈbabɪʃ}}; born 2 September 1954) is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] politician of [[Slovak people|Slovak]] origin who has been the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]] since December 2017, and previously served as [[Finance Minister of the Czech Republic|Minister of Finance]] and Deputy Prime Minister for the Economy from January 2013 to May 2017. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and entrepreneur.

Babiš was born in [[Bratislava]] in present-day [[Slovakia]], and moved to the Czech Republic following the [[Velvet Revolution]]. The [[List of Czechs by net worth|second richest man in the Czech Republic]] with an estimated net worth of about $4.04&amp;nbsp;billion according to [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]],&lt;ref name="Bloomberg net worth"/&gt; he is a former CEO and sole owner of the [[Agrofert]] group, which owns two of the largest Czech newspapers, ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]'' and ''[[Lidové noviny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://byznys.ihned.cz/zpravodajstvi/c1-61586990-andrej-babis-konci-ve-vedei-firmy-agrofert|title=Končím ve vedení Agrofertu, tvrdí Babiš. Majitelem ale zůstává, sám si podepsal výpověď|date=20 January 2014|work=[[Hospodářské noviny]]|language=Czech|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babiš has led ANO 2011 since founding it in 2012 as a protest movement against [[The Establishment|established politics]]. He has been a member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (MP) since 2013. Babiš was sacked from the [[Bohuslav Sobotka's Cabinet|government]] by Prime Minister [[Bohuslav Sobotka]] on 24 May 2017 after a month-long [[2017 Czech government crisis|coalition crisis]] triggered by allegations that Babiš avoided paying taxes as CEO of [[Agrofert]] in 2012.

Following the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 legislative election]], which resulted in a [[hung parliament]] with no possible coalitions, Babiš was appointed Prime Minister on 6 December 2017 and a week later formed a [[Andrej Babiš' First Cabinet|minority government]] composed of [[ANO 2011|ANO]] party members and [[Independent politician|independents]]. He became the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic#Statistics|oldest]] and wealthiest person ever to assume the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|premiership]], as well as the first Prime Minister in the history of the Czech Republic to be from a different party than [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]] or [[Czech Social Democratic Party|ČSSD]]. On 16 January 2018, his government lost [[Motion of no confidence|motion of confidence]] vote (78 MPs for while 117 against) in the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] and he resigned the following day. His [[Andrej Babiš' Second Cabinet|second cabinet]], confirmed by the Chamber of Deputies on 12 July 2018, is the first government since the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of Communism in 1989]] to rely on [[confidence and supply|support]] from the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/czech-communists-return-to-government-as-power-brokers|title=Czech communists return to government as power brokers|last=Tait|first=Robert|date=2018-07-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babiš had been under investigation by both [[Police of the Czech Republic|Czech Police]] and [[European Anti-fraud Office|OLAF]] from 2015 to 2017 amid allegations that an anonymous company he controlled unlawfully received €2m [[European Regional Development Fund|subsidy]] from the [[European Union]]. In September 2017, he was stripped his [[parliamentary immunity]] after a police request in connection with the case and Babiš was formally charged on 9 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/czech-election-front-runner-charged-with-subsidy-fraud/|title=Czech election front-runner charged with subsidy fraud|date=9 October 2017|work=POLITICO|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Anti-Fraud Office|OLAF]] concluded its investigation in December 2017 stating it has found irregularities and endorsed the steps taken by the [[Police of the Czech Republic|Czech Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/05/eu-antifraud-office-finds-irregularities-in-payments-allegedly-obtained-by-czech-pm|title=EU antifraud office finds 'irregularities' in payments allegedly obtained by Czech PM|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|date=2018-01-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his re-election in the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 election]] he regained his parliamentary immunity and the Chamber of Deputies voted again to lift it on 19 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-czech-politics/czech-lower-house-votes-to-lift-immunity-of-prime-minister-idUSKBN1F81EH|title=Czech lawmakers lift PM Babis's immunity amid fraud allegations|date=19 January 2018|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as alleged fraud, Babiš is the subject of sustained criticism from political opponents and the media regarding a number of issues, including conflict of interest, his past role in the [[StB|communist secret police]], and allegations of intimidation of opponents. Despite this, Babiš remains one of the most popular politicians in the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/05/29/uk-czech-politics-spying-idUKKBN0OE17820150529?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews|title=Czech court clears ex-PM's aide in scandal that toppled government|date=30 May 2015|agency=Reuters|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/10/21/czech-donald-trump-set-becoming-next-prime-minister/787285001/|title='Czech Donald Trump' set on becoming next prime minister}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/czech-voters-hand-euroskeptic-babis-big-victory/|title='Czech Trump' Babiš claims big victory|date=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/czech-trump-adrej-babis-poised-to-deliver-latest-blow-to-eu-order-20171017-gz2y27.html|title='Czech Trump' Andrej Babis poised to deliver latest blow to EU order|first=Nick|last=Miller|date=18 October 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career ==
Babiš was born on 2 September 1954 to a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] family in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (present-day [[Slovakia]]). His father, a diplomat and member of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], represented [[Czechoslovakia]] during the negotiation of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in [[Geneva]] and as a consultant at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financninoviny.cz/zpravy/e15-cz-miliardar-babis-koupil-ringier-za-ctyri-miliardy-korun/955114|title=E15.cz: Miliardář Babiš koupil Ringier za čtyři miliardy korun|date=24 June 2013|publisher=e15.cz – Finanční noviny (originally [[ČTK]])|language=Czech|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cas.sk/clanok/155805/rebricek-miliardarov-babis-je-medzi-najbohatsimi-ludmi-sveta.html|title=Rebríček miliardárov: Babiš je medzi najbohatšími ľuďmi sveta! |date=12 March 2010|publisher=[[Nový čas]]|language=Slovak|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is nephew of Ervin and [[Viera Scheibner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anobudelip.cz/cs/o-nas/blogy/12512/muj-podrobny-zivotopis|title=Můj příběh|last=Babiš|first=Andrej|publisher=[[Action of Dissatisfied Citizens|ANO 2011]]|language=Czech|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Slavkay, Michal Kaličiak: Významní slovenskí geológovia. Bratislava : Veda, 2000, p. 399. {{ISBN|80-224-0639-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babiš spent part of his childhood abroad, and was educated in Paris and [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name=Politico /&gt; Later, he studied at a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Bratislava and continued to the [[University of Economics in Bratislava|University of Economics]], where he studied [[international trade]]. In 1978, after graduating, he joined the Slovak communist controlled international trade company, ''Chemapol Bratislava'', which later became ''Petrimex''. In 1985 he was appointed as the organisation's representative in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="e15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nazory.euro.e15.cz/profily/zemedelstvi-andrej-babis-ovladl-s-nekolika-akciemi-ovladne-politiku-s-par-tisici-podporovatelu-722171|title=Zemědělství Andrej Babiš ovládl s několika akciemi.

== Business career ==
[[File:Chodovec, Klíčova a Pyšelská, Agrofert.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of Agrofert in [[Chodov (Prague)|Chodov]], Prague.]]
Babiš returned from Morocco to Czechoslovakia in 1991, after the [[Velvet Revolution]],&lt;ref name=Politico /&gt; and settled in the [[Czech Republic]] after the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]]. 

In January 1993, Babiš became managing director of a newly established Petrimex subsidiary operating in the Czech Republic, [[Agrofert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reflex.cz/clanek/zpravy/52406/legenda-o-svatem-andrejovi-reflex-odhaluje-zapomenute-informace-o-babisove-zbohatnuti.html|title=Legenda o svatém Andrejovi.

Petrimex later fired Babiš and sued him, unsuccessfully, for allowing the firm's stake in Agrofert to be diluted.&lt;ref name="respekt"/&gt; Soon thereafter, Babiš emerged as the 100% owner of Agrofert.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bne.eu/content/story/comment-why-next-czech-pm-surrounding-himself-police-and-spooks |title=Why is the next Czech PM surrounding himself with police and spooks? |website=Bne.eu |date=14 November 2014 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the initial financing for Babiš's takeover of Agrofert from Petrimex was still undisclosed as of the start of 2016,&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt; although Babiš has said that the money came from his Swiss former schoolmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2017/10/czech-trump-shoots-power-rise-and-rise-andrej-babi |title=The Czech Trump shoots for power: the rise and rise of Andrej Babiš |last=Anderson |first= Robert|date=21 October 2017 |website=[[New Statesman]] |access-date=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Babiš gradually developed Agrofert into one of the largest companies in the country,&lt;ref name="respekt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.respekt.cz/respekt-in-english/the-richest-czech-keeps-a-secret|first=Jaroslav|last=Spurný|title=The richest Czech keeps a secret|date=13 May 2002|publisher=respekt.cz|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting as a wholesale and trading firm, but later acquiring various agricultural, [[food processing]], and [[Chemical industry|chemical]] companies. In 2011 Agrofert Holding consisted of more than 230 companies,&lt;ref name=ar&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233127/http://www.agrofert.cz/f/?2124%2Fvyrocni-zprava-2011 ]&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in the Czech Republic, [[Slovakia]], and [[Germany]]. It is the [[List of companies of the Czech Republic#Largest by revenue|fourth largest]] company in the Czech Republic by revenue, exceeding [[CZK]] 117&amp;nbsp;billion. The history of Agrofert, detailed in a book by the journalist [[Tomáš Pergler]], is closely linked to its control of the Czech petrochemicals industry. One reviewer of the book said the account "captures much of what has led Czechs to the conviction that they live in a corrupted, clientist country – and (paradoxically) then to vote for the ANO movement."&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt; When Babiš entered politics he resigned as [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], but remained sole owner until February 2017, when he was legally obliged to put his companies in [[Trust law|trust]] in order to remain as [[Finance Minister of the Czech Republic|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref name=ar/&gt;

While Babiš's business activities initially focused mainly on agriculture,&lt;ref name="e15"/&gt; he later acquired a large empire of media companies. In 2013, Agrofert purchased the company [[MAFRA]], publisher of two of the biggest Czech newspapers, ''[[Lidové noviny]]'' and ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]'', and operator of the [[Óčko]] television company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/ekonomika/232763-babis-koupil-mafru-do-obsahu-novin-zasahovat-nebude-rika-jeho-mluvci/|title=Babiš koupil Mafru.

== Political career ==
[[File:Andrej Babis Sebastian Kurz 2015 (16330390570).jpg|thumb|Babiš with Austrian Foreign Minister [[Sebastian Kurz]] in February 2015]]

In the subsequent [[Bohuslav Sobotka's Cabinet|coalition government]], formed of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]], ANO, and the [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party|Christian Democrats]], Babiš served as the [[Finance Minister of the Czech Republic|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/255713-ministerstvo-financi-bude-nakonec-ridit-babis/|title=Ministerstvo financí bude nakonec řídit Babiš|last=Matyášová|first=Veronika |date=22 December 2013|publisher=[[Czech Television]]|language=Czech|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure in this role, Babiš introduced controversial policies such as electronic registration of sales, known as EET, proposed reverse charging of [[value-added tax]], and VAT control statement for companies.

In May 2015, after the government's decision to extend reduced taxation of biofuels (a segment of the fuel market controlled significantly by companies in the Agrofert portfolio), the opposition initiated a [[motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] against the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/312308-opozicni-top-09-ods-a-usvit-navrhnou-vysloveni-neduvery-vlade/|title=Opoziční TOP 09, ODS a Úsvit navrhnou vyslovení nedůvěry vládě|date=21 May 2015|publisher=Czech Television|language=Czech|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 May 2015 while speaking to the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]], Babiš said that he was forced to enter politics because of "corrupted opposition" (referring to the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]]) that "created him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/312823-babis-kalouskovi-ja-si-neznicim-jmeno-pro-nejake-drobne/ |title=Babiš Kalouskovi: "Já si nezničím jméno pro nějaké drobné" |date=26 May 2015 |publisher=Czech Television |language=Czech |accessdate=26 May 2015 |quote=Vy jste zapomněli, že jste mě stvořili – vy, zkorumpovaná pravice.

===2017 government crisis===
Andrej Babiš was sacked from the [[Bohuslav Sobotka's Cabinet|government]] by Prime Minister [[Bohuslav Sobotka]] on 24 May 2017 after a month-long [[2017 Czech government crisis|coalition crisis]] triggered by allegations that Babiš avoided paying taxes as CEO of [[Agrofert]] in 2012.

[[File:V4 leaders Dec17.jpg|thumb|Andrej Babiš during his first full day in office with [[Visegrád Group|Visegrad Group]] leaders on 14 December 2017 at the [[European Council]].]]
Following the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 election]] to the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]], in which [[ANO 2011]] won with 29% of the vote, and won 78 out of 200 seats, President [[Miloš Zeman]] asked Babiš to form a government. The [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] and other parties refused to join a coalition government with Babis, citing the ongoing criminal investigation into alleged EU subsidy fraud and, as a result, on 27 October 2017 Babiš announced that he would try to form a [[minority government]]. [[Freedom and Direct Democracy]] (SPD) and the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]] voiced their willingness to join the government, but were refused by Babiš.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zpravy.idnes.cz/babis-nova-vlada-mensinova-ano-odbornici-zeman-f4y-/domaci.aspx?c=A171027_111406_domaci_kop|title=Babiš navrhne menšinovou vládu ANO doplněnou o nestranické odborníky|date=2017-10-27|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2017, Babiš was appointed the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]]. He assumed the office on 13 December 2017, when his government took full control of the [[Government of the Czech Republic|executive government]]. He is the only incumbent head of government to be charged with a crime by the [[Police of the Czech Republic|Czech police]] and prosecutor, as well as both the oldest and the wealthiest Prime Minister in the country's history, and the first Prime Minister from a party other than [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]] and [[Czech Social Democratic Party|ČSSD]]. 

During his first days in office, he attended the [[European Council]] summit dealing with fiscal responsibilities, [[Brexit]] and [[European migrant crisis|migration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vlada.cz/en/media-centrum/aktualne/premier-babis-discussed-the-future-of-the-euro-area-and-brexit-progress-with-european-statesmen-162296/|title=Premier Babiš discussed the future of the Euro Area and Brexit progress with European statesmen {{!}} Government of the Czech Republic|website=www.vlada.cz|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke on the phone with new Polish Prime Minister [[Mateusz Morawiecki]] regarding the [[Polish Constitutional Court crisis, 2015|invocation of the Article 7]] by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vlada.cz/en/media-centrum/aktualne/premier-babis-spoke-on-the-phone-with-the-polish-prime-minister-morawiecki-162424/|title=Premier Babiš spoke on the phone with the Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki {{!}} Government of the Czech Republic|website=www.vlada.cz|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His government carried out personnel changes at the ministries, [[České dráhy|Czech Railways]] and the [[Správa železniční dopravní cesty|Railway Infrastructure Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/458692-babisova-vlada-bez-duvery-vymenila-vetsinu-ridiciho-vyboru-ceskych-drah.html|title=Babišova vláda bez důvěry vyměnila většinu řídicího výboru Českých drah|work=Novinky.cz|access-date=2018-01-03|language=cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2018, Babiš's cabinet lost a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] by 117 votes to 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muller|first1=Robert|title=Czech PM Babis battles fraud charges as cabinet loses confidence vote|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-czech-government-confidence/czech-pm-babis-battles-fraud-charges-as-cabinet-loses-confidence-vote-idUSKBN1F42QF?il=0|website=Reuters|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, his cabinet approved the [[European Fiscal Compact]] and sent it to the Chamber of Deputies for further approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/ekonomika/2390659-vlada-po-sesti-letech-schvalila-pristoupeni-k-fiskalnimu-paktu-eu-hlasi-se-k|title=Vláda po šesti letech schválila přistoupení k fiskálnímu paktu EU.

[[File:Informal dinner of EU heads of state or government (40347583080).jpg|thumb|Babiš with Bulgarian Prime Minister [[Boyko Borisov]], 16 May 2018]]

After losing the confidence vote, Babiš's administration continued to carry out personnel changes, meeting with criticism from the opposition. Minister of Health [[Adam Vojtěch]] fired [[Svatopluk Němeček]], a former Minister and head of the University Hospital in [[Ostrava]], as well as the director of the [[Bulovka Hospital]]. Minister of Industry and Trade [[Tomáš Hüner]] and Minister of Interior [[Lubomír Metnar]] fired the heads of [[CzechInvest]] and [[Česká pošta|Czech Post]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/2400022-personalni-zmeny-bez-duvery-vlada-ma-na-uctu-uz-nekolik-vysokych-hlav|title=Personální změny bez důvěry.

In March 2018, Babiš ordered three [[Russia]]n diplomats to leave the country in a show of solidarity with the [[United Kingdom]] after a former Russian double agent [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|Sergei Skripal was poisoned]] in [[Salisbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Czech Republic expels three Russian diplomats |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/czech-republic-expels-three-russian-diplomats |work=Radio Prague |date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said that there had been "no moral or political justification" for the post-war [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion of ethnic Germans]] from Czechoslovakia. Babiš responded: "I reject this characterisation – especially when we recall the horrors of [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]], [[Lidice]], [[Ležáky]] and the killing of our paratroopers. I have the feeling that there is some internal political struggle in Germany now, and it is very unfortunate that old wounds are opening because of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Merkel calls Sudeten German expulsion “immoral”, drawing Czech ire |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/merkel-calls-sudeten-german-expulsion-immoral-drawing-czech-ire |work=Czech Radio |date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2018, Babiš reached a coalition agreement with the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]]. The new cabinet took office after winning a confidence vote on 12 July 2018, with support from the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1337401/world|title=Czech government wins confidence vote backed by Communists|date=12 July 2018|work=Arab News|access-date=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== State Security Police (StB) agent ===
According to the documents of the [[National Memory Institute (Slovakia)|National Memory Institute]] in Slovakia, Babiš collaborated with the State Security Police ([[StB]]) of [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|communist Czechoslovakia]], under the [[code name]] agent Bureš. He denies the accusations, and in 2012 sued the institute for [[defamation]]. In January 2018, the Bratislava regional court ruled definitively that Babiš was an StB agent. This final court case may not be appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/svet/2389540-babis-definitivne-prohral-soud-se-slovenskymi-historiky-zda-byl-ve-svazcich-stb|title=Babiš definitivně prohrál soud se slovenskými historiky, zda byl ve svazcích StB oprávněně|work=ČT24|access-date=2018-02-13|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20759872/babis-definitivne-prehral-sud-s-upn-o-tom-ci-ho-moze-evidovat-v-zvazkoch-stb.html|title=Babiš definitívne prehral súd, ÚPN ho eviduje vo zväzkoch ŠTB oprávnene|last=a.s.|first=Petit Press|work=domov.sme.sk|access-date=2018-02-13|language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babiš has also been accused of using his StB background and Communist Party connections to enrich himself.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Babiš has denied that he was a StB collaborator, but his close associates include Czech lawyer Libor Široký, now chairman of Agrofert's supervisory board, who is reportedly also a former member of one of the StB units most closely linked to the Soviet KGB.&lt;ref name=Politico&gt;{{cite web|last=Drda |first=Adam |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/andrej-babis-czech-oligarch/ |title=Andrej Babiš – Czech oligarch – Politico |website=[[politico.eu]] |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{who|date=April 2018}} who accuse him of KGB connections also point to his alleged support for the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014 Russian annexation of Crimea]], and his opposition to international sanctions against Russia.{{cn|date=April 2018}} When a Lebanese arms dealer with alleged Russian connections was released by Czech authorities instead of being extradited to the United States, and it was revealed that every official involved in the release was an ANO party member or was associated with Babis, he was again accused of having an allegiance to Russia.&lt;ref name="dailycaller.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Gabriel|last=Meyr |url=http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/10/czech-prime-minister-defends-release-of-hezbollah-terror-suspect/ |title=Czech Prime Minister Defends Release of Hezbollah Terror Suspect |work=The Daily Caller |date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/1585445|title=Politiky rozhodnutí soudu o Babišovi a StB nepřekvapilo {{!}} ČeskéNoviny.cz|website=www.ceskenoviny.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reflex.cz/clanek/rozhovory/85037/andrej-babis-byl-tajnym-spolupracovnikem-stb-vedome-rika-slovensky-badatel-sivos.html|title=Andrej Babiš byl tajným spolupracovníkem StB vědomě, říká slovenský badatel Sivoš - Reflex.cz|work=Reflex.cz|access-date=2018-02-13|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://domaci.eurozpravy.cz/politika/215517-smutne-premierem-by-nemel-byt-estebak-politici-na-verdikt-o-babisovi-reaguji-dost-drsne/|title=Smutné, premiérem by neměl být estébák.

Novinky. 6 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 [[Anne Applebaum]], a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist specializing in Russian and Eastern European affairs, listed Babiš among several Eastern European leaders who she considered to be agents of influence for Putin's Russia. Writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', she suggested that old labels from Soviet Communist days, such as "useful idiots" and "fellow travelers", were no longer adequate to describe Babis and the other figures she had named. To illustrate her point, she listed several quotes from each leader that sounded very similar to each other and to the arguments broadcast at the same time by official Russian news sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Applebaum |first=Anne |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/neither-agents-of-influence-nor-useful-idiots/2015/10/16/73fdc478-7423-11e5-8248-98e0f5a2e830_story.html |title=Russia's new kind of friends |work=The Washington Post |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babiš responded to Applebaum with a letter to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stating that he had no friends in Russia and was an American ally. US journalist [[Gabriel Meyr]] challenged those claims by citing three examples of actions Babiš has taken that have furthered Russian policy goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gabriel Meyr |url=http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/01/putin-hiding-under-a-czech-candle/ |title=Putin Hiding Under A Czech Candle |work=The Daily Caller |date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a [[Government of the Czech Republic|Czech government]] loan guarantee to a Russian company with a record of defaults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hlidacipes.org/miliardove-ztraty-z-obchodu-s-ruskem-vyresime-slibuje-ceb-i-egap/ |title=Miliardové ztráty z obchodů s Ruskem vyřešíme, slibuje ČEB i EGAP |publisher=HlidaciPes.org |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned by a close friend of [[Vladimir Putin|President Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.e15.cz/byznys/finance-a-bankovnictvi/egap-se-zarucil-za-dvoumiliardovy-uver-na-vyvoz-technologii-do-ruska-1242118 |title=EGAP se zaručil za dvoumiliardový úvěr na vývoz technologií do Ruska &amp;#124; E15.cz |publisher=Zpravy.e15.cz |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the Czech Finance Ministry's continued racing of the thoroughbred horses owned by Chechen President [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], a close ally of Putin, even though he is under international sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russia-insider.com/en/2015/03/11/4312 |title=Czech Officials on Holy Quest to Prevent Chechen Leader from Horse-Profiteering |publisher=Russia-insider.com |date=11 March 2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final example was that Babis had disclosed in 2007 that Agrofert was negotiating to purchase gas from the Czech subsidiary of [[Gazprom]] instead of its German supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alena Adámková |url=http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-20716430-babisuv-agrofert-uvazuje-o-zmene-dodavatele-plynu |title=Babišův Agrofert uvažuje o změně dodavatele plynu &amp;#124; |work=Hospodářské noviny |date=13 March 2007 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, on the day commemorating the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|Communist takeover in 1948]], hundreds of protesters opposed to Babiš gathered in [[Wenceslas Square]] to protest that Babiš was advancing an agenda that would infringe Czech freedoms, described by leaders of the protest as a quiet revolution, happening in gradual steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguemonitor.com/2016/02/26/finmins-opponents-warn-his-creeping-freedom-restriction |title=FinMin's opponents warn of his creeping freedom restriction |publisher=Prague Monitor |date=26 February 2016 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EU subsidies fraud ===

[[File:Čapí hnízdo - Olbramovice. (06).jpg|thumb|An [[equestrian facility]] of the farm resembles [[stork]]'s [[nest]].]]
Babiš was accused of illegally obtaining €2 million in EU subsidies designated for small businesses by concealing his ownership of a farm and a convention center called "Storks Nest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-czech-politics-babis/czech-police-ask-parliament-to-allow-prosecution-of-pm-candidate-babis-idUSKBN1AQ208|title=Czech police ask parliament to allow prosecution of PM candidate Babis|date=10 August 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech police requested that the Lower House lift his parliamentary immunity on two occasions, in September and November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/andrej-babis-czech-police-seek-to-prosecute-prospective-pm-for-alleged-fraud/a-41467109|title=Andrej Babis: Czech police seek to prosecute prospective PM for alleged fraud|date=21 November 2017|website=Deutsche Welle|language=en|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases the Lower House lifted the immunity and the police have initiated criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/online-snemovna/r~332899d2fa1311e7b6830cc47ab5f122/?_ga=2.210628245.1686128042.1516031095-1459700410.1511207770|title=Živě: Poslanci vydali Babiše a Faltýnka policii.

=== Alleged son kidnapping ===
In November 2018, Seznam News television aired an interview with Babiš' son Andrej Babiš Junior (born 1982) in which he alleged he was kidnapped by his father's associate in order to thwart corruption inquiry regarding [[Andrej Babiš#EU subsidies fraud|Stork's Nest Farm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/czech-pm-andrej-babis-accused-of-kidnapping-son-to-avert-corruption-inquiry-60jtxs63v|title=Czech PM Andrej Babis accused of kidnapping son to thwart corruption inquiry|website=thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/13/czech-pm-andrej-babis-future-hangs-in-balance-after-sons-kidnap-claims|title=Czech PM's future hangs in balance after son's kidnap claims|website=theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babiš Junior was quoted as saying he had been held in [[Crimea]], [[Kaliningrad]], [[Moscow]] and [[Kryvyi Rih]] in Ukraine to stop him from giving statement to the police about his involvement in the case. Prime Minister Babiš denied the kidnapping but admitted that his son entered Crimea, among others, while saying that his son suffers from [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46194329|title=Andrej Babis: Czech PM denies son was kidnapped|website=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/prulomove-svedectvi-v-kauze-capi-hnizdo-slonkova-a-kubik-vypatrali-zmizeleho-babisova-syna-60198?utm_source=Seznamzpravy_static&amp;utm_medium=babisuv-syn-doporucene-clanky&amp;utm_campaign=doporucene-clanky-special|title=Průlomové svědectví v kauze Čapí hnízdo.

===Partnership with Zeman===
Babiš has been linked closely to President [[Miloš Zeman]] since at least 2001, when Zeman was [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]], and his business interests are alleged to have benefited from the association. In 2001, Zeman oversaw the sale of [[Unipetrol]], a state-owned chemical company, to Babiš. Babiš pulled out of the sale, but later oversaw the sale of the firm to a Polish company. According to Polish reports, the sale was accompanied by substantial bribery, although Babis denies any bribes were paid.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192124/http://www.wprost.pl/ar/76068/Unipetrol-bez-lapowki-aktl/|title=Unipetrol bez łapówki? aktl. – WPROST|date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unipetrol deal is cited often as evidence of a strong partnership between Babiš and Zeman that persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|trans-title=Zeman and Babiš have bad news for Sobotka.

=== Conflicts of interest ===
[[File:Ing Andrej Babis.png|thumbnail|right|Connections between companies in the AGROFERT portfolio]]
Babis has been criticized by media and opposition politicians for his alleged [[conflict of interest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/325603-kalousek-babis-nebude-na-ministerstvu-ve-stretu-zajmu-jen-na-zachode.html|title=Kalousek: Babiš nebude na ministerstvu ve střetu zájmů jen na záchodě|date=25 January 2014|publisher=[[novinky.cz]]|language=Czech|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/215411030501004/|title=Otázky Václava Moravce|work=Česká televize|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Minister of Finance and the owner of companies subsidized by EU funding programmes. During a visit to the Czech Republic in March 2014, the German [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Ingeborg Gräßle]] expressed concern that someone with such a personal financial interest simultaneously being a leading representative of a state, could not guarantee to the EU that its resources are properly distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/europoslankyne-kritizuje-babisuv-stret-zajmu-flg-/domaci.aspx?c=A140327_141015_domaci_jav|title=Europoslankyně: Babiš je ve vážném střetu zájmů, měl by se vzdát firem|date=27 March 2014|work=[[Mladá fronta DNES]]|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 article in the political newspaper ''[[Politico]]'' commented that "the Czech Republic is now a paradox: a society disgusted with corruption has given huge power to a man whose business interests amount to the biggest conflict of interest in the country’s post-1989 history."&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt;

In May 2015, Babis's alleged financial irregularities and accusations from the public and the opposition that he had promoted his companies in [[Government procurement in the European Union|government procurements]] triggered a [[Czech Republic Government Vote of No Confidence, 2015|vote of no confidence against the Bohuslav Sobotka's government]], called by the opposition parties [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]], [[TOP 09]], and [[Dawn of Direct Democracy|Dawn]]. The motion was defeated by 47-105.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/312883-opozice-s-vyslovenim-neduvery-sobotkove-vlade-neuspela/|title=Opozice s vyslovením nedůvěry Sobotkově vládě neuspěla|date=26 June 2014|publisher=[[ČT24]]|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2015, a retired senior American intelligence officer published an opinion article using Babiš as an example of a corrupt politician with conflicts of interest and probable ties to Russia. In the article, he speculated whether United States government investigations into bribery and corruption in FIFA may herald more aggressive investigation of other corrupt practices. The article mentioned that several investigations had been launched by a team of police and prosecutor, which were questionable cases that did not hold up in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/05/do-fifa-arrests-presage-further-investigations-in-europe/2/|title=Do FIFA Arrests Presage Further Investigations in Europe?|work=The Daily Caller|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intimidation ===
Babiš has a reputation for surrounding himself with senior police officers, security agents, and former Communist informers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In June 2015, Babiš provoked controversy when a member of parliament, Ladislav Šincl of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] (ČSSD), criticised a change in policy from the Finance Ministry on a bill reducing commissions for life insurance mediators in the Chamber of Deputies, and alleged that the benefits to Babiš's business interests may be the cause of the change.&lt;ref name="Čtk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-cssd-wants-finmin-babis-to-apologise-for-stb-like-conduct/1228928|title=Czech CSSD wants FinMin Babis to apologise for "StB-like" conduct|author=ČTK|work=ceskenoviny.cz|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June 2015, Babiš met with Šincl and accused him of corruption and taking bribes from businessman and senator [[Ivo Valenta]], owner of the Synot gambling group. According to witnesses, Babiš brought to the meeting a folder marked with a yellow note labelled ''Šincl'', and started shouting at Šincl that he knew Šincl took bribes from Valenta and was corrupt. He later moved onto his family and Šincl's former jobs.&lt;ref name="ihned.cz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.ihned.cz/c1-64188810-babisovy-metody-pripominaji-stb-stezuje-si-cssd-babis-neomluvim-se-sincl-lze|title=Babiš po jednání koaliční rady: Se Šinclem se sejdu, omlouvat se ale nebudu|work=Hospodářské noviny|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 2015, Babiš admitted he had a folder with Šincl's name, but denied intimidation, saying, "It's not the materials. It's articles from the media. Do the media write lies? I just showed what the media writes, I think they do their job well. When I go to a meeting, I prepare myself so I know who I am dealing with". Babiš's coalition partners [[Czech Social Democratic Party|ČSSD]] (Šincl's party) and [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party|KDU-ČSL]] demanded an apology, but Babiš refused, saying that Šincl had lied about him in the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]]. Prime Minister [[Bohuslav Sobotka]], also the chairman of ČSSD, called a coalition meeting on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/315035-babis-sinclovi-se-neomluvim-informace-o-nem-jsem-cerpal-z-medii/ |title=Babiš: Šinclovi se neomluvím, informace o něm jsem čerpal z médií |date=18 June 2015 |publisher=[[ČT24]] |accessdate=18 June 2015 |quote=Nejsou to materiály.

Šincl described Babiš' tactic, of reading potentially damaging facts about him from a file marked with his name, was reminiscent of StB tactics.&lt;ref name="novinky.cz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Čtk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihned.cz"/&gt; [[Miroslav Kalousek]], the first deputy chairman of the opposition party [[TOP09]], also accused Babiš of using StB practices, which Babiš denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://radio.cz/en/section/news/finance-minister-babis-under-fire-for-sincl-incident|title=Finance Minister Babiš under fire for Šincl incident|date=18 June 2015|publisher=[[Czech Radio]]|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MF Dnes leaked tapes ===
On 1 May 2017, Twitter account @skupinasuman posted a tape of Babiš's private conversations with an unknown number of people, in which he labelled Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Lubomír Zaorálek]] as an "idiot" and attacked investigative journalist Sabina Slonková, among others. On 3 May 2017, a video on YouTube alleged that Andrej Babiš had interfered with the editorial independence of ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]'', the nation's largest quality newspaper by circulation, owned by Babis's trust. In conversation with MF Dnes journalist [[Marek Přibil]] he discusses the date of publication of damaging stories about Minister of Interior [[Milan Chovanec]] and Minister of Health [[Miloslav Ludvík]]. On the tape, Babiš is recorded instructing Přibil to tell František Nachtigall, the director of strategic development, about when and how to publish the stories.

=== Comments about Lety concentration camp ===
On 1 September 2016, while visiting [[Varnsdorf]], a city with large [[Romani people in the Czech Republic|Romani population]], Babiš said: "What those idiots [journalists] write in newspapers, that the [[Lety concentration camp|camp in Lety]] was a concentration camp, that is a lie, it was a [[labor camp]], people who didn't work ended up there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/babis-na-romech-parazituje-pritom-se-o-ne-nikdy-nezajimal-re/r~5e1850de711511e6888a0025900fea04/ |title=Sobotka: Babiš se o Romy nikdy nezajímal, teď na nich parazituje.

Prime Minister [[Bohuslav Sobotka]] condemned the remarks on Facebook, saying that "between [[populism]] and extremism there is a thin line and Babiš crossed it" and asked him to "properly apologize and visit Lety to learn about history of our state."{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;

Minister for Human Rights and Equal Opportunities [[Jiří Dienstbier Jr.|Jiří Dienstbier]] called for Babiš to step down as Finance Minister and First Deputy Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://radio.cz/en/section/news/finance-minister-apologises-for-comments-about-romanies-and-lety-camp|title=Finance Minister apologises for comments about Romanies and Lety camp|date=2 September 2016|publisher=[[Czech Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of both opposition parties, [[Petr Fiala]] from [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]] and [[Miroslav Kalousek]] from [[TOP 09]] also called for Babiš to step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://echo24.cz/a/iuQ75/musi-odejit-zadaji-politici-hlavu-babise-za-zpochybnovani-holocaustu|title=Musí odejít, žádají politici hlavu Babiše za zpochybňování holocaustu

==Media criticism==
''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine gave Babis the nickname ''Babisconi'', a portmaneau of his surname and the surname of former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the subject of numerous political and financial scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/10/now-the-czechs-have-an-oligarch-problem-too-andrej-babis/|title=Now the Czechs Have an Oligarch Problem, Too|date=10 April 2015|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Babiš threatened to sue the magazine, but has never done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/svet/308183-babis-jde-do-boje-s-americkym-listem-snuska-lzi-na-objednavku-z-ceska/|title=Babiš jde do boje s americkým listem: Snůška lží na objednávku z Česka|date=17 April 2015|publisher=[[ČT24]]|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the Swiss weekly ''[[L'Hebdo]]'' published an article entitled: "Why do Czech Oligarchs Buy Unprofitable Media Outlets?" examining the purchase of media companies by several Czech business people, and also their connections with Francophone Switzerland. The article focused much of its attention on Babiš, and his purchase of media outlets in the Czech Republic. The author pointed out that Babiš had claimed to invest in ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]'' only for profit, but had given no answer when told it was an unprofitable investment, and went on to accuse journalists at Babis's newspapers of doing his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hebdo.ch/hebdo/cadrages/detail/oligarques-tch%C3%A8ques-pourquoi-ils-aiment-la-presse-et-la-suisse-romande|title=Oligarques tchèques: pourquoi ils aiment la presse... et la Suisse romande|work=hebdo.ch|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''Politico'', Adam Drda expressed the view that Andrej Babis is associated with the decline of Czech democracy more than any other single person.&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt;

[[File:Monika Babišová a Andrej Babiš 2015.JPG|thumb|Andrej Babiš with his then-partner (now wife) Monika in 2015]]
Andrej Babiš was a winner of the Green Pearl prize for the anti-ecological comment of the year 2013:
"We all gave a shit about democracy once. How to explain that regarding the construction of a new highway, (someone has the right to talk about) a badger, an ecological terrorist and that each mayor wants an exit (to his town)."&lt;ref&gt;https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/ropakem-roku-je-milos-zeman/r~043c4414cbed11e399e0002590604f2e/ Winners of the anti-ecologic prizes (in Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Archibald was born in Glenfield House in Abbey, near [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], the third son of Archibald Barr, a [[yarn]] merchant, and Jeanie Stirrat,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Barr was educated at [[Paisley Grammar School]] and apprenticed as an engineer to A F Craig &amp; Co in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] before attending [[University of Glasgow]] to study engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/local-news-in-renfrewshire/paisley-news/2010/04/19/scientist-archibald-barr-is-celebrated-in-exhibition-at-paisley-museum-87085-26256610/|title=Scientist Archibald Barr is celebrated in exhibition at Paisley Museum|last=Speirs|work=Paisley Daily Express|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885 he married Isabella Young.

Barr first worked as assistant to [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], the [[Regius Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics]] at Glasgow, a post Barr was to attain himself later in his career. He was subsequently appointed to the chair of Civil and Mechanical Engineering at the Yorkshire College (since 1904 the [[University of Leeds]]).

Barr was a motoring enthusiast and as a member of the  Scottish Automobile Club, he participated as an organiser of Scotland’s first motor car reliability trials in 1901.
He also helped to form the Scottish Aeronautical Club in 1909, becoming its president, and was a promoter of Scotland’s first aviation meeting, held at [[Lanark]] in 1910.
He served as President of the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]] in 1910-11. Barr was also a governor of the Royal Scottish National Institution for the care of those with learning difficulties.

He also gifted £8,000 towards the cost of a new organ for [[Paisley Abbey]].

In 1898 he successfully campaigned for a new Chair in Electrical Engineering at [[Glasgow University]]. In 1901 he raised £54,000 to build and equip the James Watt Engineering Building at [[Glasgow University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2060&amp;type=P&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr died at his home, Westerton of [[Mugdock]], near [[Milngavie]], near Glasgow, on 5 August 1931.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8616">'''Arthur T. Gregorian''', (1909 &amp;ndash; January 14, 2003), was a [[Greater Boston]] [[oriental rug]] dealer and author of books on oriental rugs. He is considered by some to be the world's leading collector of rare, inscribed [[Armenians|Armenian]] rugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/17/SouthPinellas/Arthur_T_Gregorian__9.shtml Southpinellas: Arthur T. Gregorian, 93, rug collector&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Film frame greogiran buying rugs 72dpi.jpg|thumb|Arthur T. Gregorian purchasing rugs in Kabul, Afghanistan - 16mm frame]]

==Early life==
Gregorian did not know his birthdate. However, he marked it as November 15, 1909. He was born in [[Reyhanabad, West Azerbaijan|Rahvah]], on the western shore of [[Lake Urmia]], [[West Azerbaijan Province]], [[Iran]], of [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents, and died on January 14, 2003, in [[Concord, Massachusetts]].

In 1919, Gregorian and his family fled the [[Armenian Genocide]] by [[Bullock cart|oxcart]] on a thousand-mile journey with hundreds of thousands of [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[refugees]] from his ancient [[Armenians|Armenian]] homeland near [[Lake Urmia]], over the [[Zagros Mountains]] in southwestern [[Iran]], down to [[Basra]], [[Iraq]]. There, they stayed at a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[refugee]] camp. Gregorian almost died of [[cholera]] and worked as a sidekick to a [[Hakim (title)|hakim]] or herbal doctor to earn food for his family. After traveling by [[steerage]] to [[India]], [[Italy]] and [[France]], he finally reached [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and settled in [[New Britain, Connecticut]]. In high school, Arthur met Phebe Ballou, his future wife. He spent his final year of high school at the [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]], where in later life he became the director of the board of alumni. After high school he worked in a rug shop to get money to go to night school at [[Boston University]], so he could become a doctor.

==Wellesley==
In 1934, Gregorian took his savings of $700.00 and moved to [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], partly to open his own [[oriental rug]] store there and partly to see Phebe who was attending [[Wellesley College]]. The store was tiny and below street level, so he visited his potential buyers in their homes or businesses. He and Phebe were married in 1936. The business flourished and in 1940, Arthur was able to move east across the [[Charles River]] to larger quarters on Washington Street in [[Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts|Newton Lower Falls]].

==Newton Lower Falls==
In his new store in [[Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts]] ({{coord|42|19|34.75|N|71|15|17.10|W|type:landmark}}), Gregorian finally had the space for his customers to come to him to see his rugs. Business continued to be good until [[World War II]] disrupted his importation of rugs as well as reduced the demand for luxury goods. After the war was over, however, the economy of Greater Boston boomed and Arthur's business boomed along with it. He had a store in Newton Lower Falls and another in [[Chatham, Massachusetts]]. In 1948 he bought the old [[Crane Paper Company]] paper mill next door and expanded his showrooms into it. In 1965 and again in 1989, additions were made to the two buildings, which resulted in {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|-3}} of space divided into 10 galleries and over 6,000 rugs on display.

==Personal life==
In 1936, Arthur T. Gregorian married Phebe Ballou (April 14, 1912 &amp;ndash; November 19, 1999). They had three children, Lynda, John and Joyce (1946–1991). Phebe was regional president of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts|Girl Scouts]] and founding Director of the United Nation's Asian Women's Institute.

==St. Petersburg, Florida, interlude==
Arthur and Phebe Gregorian retired to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] in the mid-1970s, but around 1979, Arthur grew tired of retirement and opened an oriental rug store in downtown St. Pete and later exhibited rugs from his collection at local art museums. The Gregorians returned to Massachusetts in 1999. He was a founding member of The Academy of Senior Professionals at Eckerd College.

==Impact on the study of oriental rugs==
Perhaps Greogrian's most important legacy has been in his study, writing, [[filmmaking]], collecting and lectures on oriental rugs. Fluent in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], he spent months at a time in the [[bazaar]]s of [[Afghanistan]], Armenia and Iran buying rugs and filming his [[bargaining]] and travels with a [[16 mm]] [[Bell and Howell]] [[movie camera]].

In the study and erudition of oriental rugs, he will be best remembered for his books, ''Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell'',&lt;ref&gt;Gregorian, Arthur T., ''Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell, 3rd ed, revised and enlarged, Boston: Nimrod Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Armenian Rugs of the Gregorian Collection'', done in collaboration with his daughter, [[Joyce Ballou Gregorian|Joyce Ballou Gregorian Hampshire]] and his grandson, Douglas Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Gregorian, Arthur T. and Hampshire, Joyce Gregorian, with photos by Douglas A. Christian, ''Armenian Rugs from the Gregorian Collection'', Newton Lower Falls: Congraf, paperback, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell'', he divided rugs into three major categories: [[tribal]], [[village]], and city rugs. He observed that it is often difficult for a novice to distinguish between a [[Sarouk Rug|Sarouk]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]] or a [[Tabriz rug|Tabriz]], but it is not difficult for the novice to distinguish between the innate characteristics of a village woven [[Bidjar rug|Bidjar]] and an intricate and highly stylized city woven [[Qum]]. ''Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell'' was a breakthrough in the study of rugs, because it made the study of rugs clear and accessible.

His book on Armenian oriental rugs came out of realization that many rugs labeled as Turkish or Kazakh or something else were in fact [[Armenians|Armenian]] in origin. He was extremely proud of his [[List of Armenian Americans|Armenian heritage]] and spent the last decades of his life collecting and documenting the particular aspects of Armenian oriental rug weaving. His collection of Armenian oriental rugs was shown throughout the world and the majority of it was donated to the [[Armenian Library and Museum of America]], of which he was a founding member and director. He was also president of the Armenian Rugs Society.

He also wrote a book with his wife, Phebe, entitled ''Armenag's Story'', about his own travels by ox-cart from his Armenian home to a British refugee camp in [[Basra]] in present-day [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregorian, Arthur T. &amp; Phebe, ''Armenag's Story'', Newton: Lower Falls Publishing, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other notable achievements==
Gregorian was actively involved in social causes throughout most of his life. He was president of the Newton [[Rotary Club]], as well as a long time active member of the [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] Rotary Club. He was the founding chairman of the board of directors for [[Damavand College]], a women's college located north of [[Tehran]].

In 1953, as President of Morgan Memorial and President of [[Goodwill Industries]], he called his friend and fellow Armenian, [[Stephen P. Mugar]], and asked if he could place a new collection receptacle he had designed in the parking lot of the [[Star Market]] in [[Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts|Wellesley Hills]]. The container was a dumpster painted blue with a rectangular hole cut in the side for shoppers to deposit their extra clothing for the needy. This first Goodwill collection box became such an attraction for grocery shoppers that soon competitors of Star Market were requesting containers of their own.

'''Ayelet Gneezy''' (born August 25, 1966) is an associate professor of marketing at the [[Rady School of Management]], UC San Diego.

==Education and career==
Gneezy obtained her MBA at the [[University of Teesside]] joint with the [[Haagse Hogeschool]]. She went on to manage the strategic planning department in DataPro Proximity (a subsidiary of [[BBDO]]) in Israel, before receiving her PhD in [[marketing]] at the [[University of Chicago Graduate School of Business]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/ayelet-gneezy/&lt;/ref&gt;

Gneezy teaches [[marketing communications]], [[social entrepreneurship]] and [[consumer behavior]] to MBA students at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Research==
Gneezy's research addresses various questions regarding consumer behavior, including social preferences, prosocial behavior, behavioral pricing, and factors influencing quality of life for individuals. She collaborates with both small and large firms and integrates field experiments in order to answer this questions.

In a 2010 study,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5989/325.full&lt;/ref&gt; Gneezy and coauthors worked with [[Disney Research]] to study a behavioral pricing approach called [[pay-what-you-want]] at an amusement park. In a large-scale field experiment, they sold people souvenir photos from a ride at the park under four conditions. In the first of these, the photos were priced at the regular $12.95; about 0.5% (1 in 200) of people bought a photo in this condition. In the second condition, the price stayed the same but consumers were told that half of the proceeds would go to charity, which resulted in about 0.57% of people buying the photos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/jul/29/tp-professor-naming-own-price-can-be-a-success/&lt;/ref&gt; The third condition allowed people to pay what they want for the photos, which resulted in 16 times more sales, but at prices so low that they were unsustainable. In the final condition, Gneezy and her coauthors offered the consumers the option to pay what they want and told them half of the proceeds would go to charity. The results of the final condition were astonishing; the amusement park profited significantly from this condition, along with a considerable amount of money being raised for the charity. This demonstrated what Gneezy and her colleagues refer to as "shared social responsibility" – the idea that involving the consumer in the pricing of goods and the choice of contributions increases the benefit to both the consumers and the company.

The results of this study received widespread media attention and have inspired many more studies and experiments. Gneezy and coauthors are credited for playing a major role as pioneers in pay-what-you-want research. They won the 2012 Society for Personality and Social Psychology Robert B. Cialdini Award for excellence in a published field study.

==Personal life==
Gneezy lives with her husband and three children in [[San Diego]], California.

'''Berthold Beitz''' (26 September 1913 &amp;ndash; 30 July 2013) was a German industrialist.  He was the head of the [[ThyssenKrupp|Krupp]] steel conglomerate beginning in the 1950s.  He was credited with helping to lead the re-industrialization of the [[Ruhr Valley]] and rebuilding [[Germany]] into an industrial power.  He gained acclaim for saving some 250 [[Jew]]ish workers during [[World War II]] by declaring them to be essential workers at an oil facility in [[Poland]].  In 1973, for saving Jews, he received the [[Righteous Among the Nations]] title awarded by the [[Israel]]i [[Yad Vashem]], the highest honor given to a non-Jew.

==Early years==
Beitz was born in 1913 in [[Bentzin|Zemmin]], [[Hither Pomerania]]. He began his career as a banker at the "Pommersche Bank" in [[Stralsund]] and started to work for [[Shell Oil Company]] in [[Hamburg]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Berthold Beitz, German Steel Industrialist Who Saved Jews, Dies at 99|first= Melissa |last= Eddy|date=August 1, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/business/berthold-beitz-german-steel-industrialist-who-saved-jews-dies-at-99.html?ref=obituaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beitz, Eine deutsche Geschichte |language=de |trans-title=Beitz, A German History |first= Norbert F. |last= Pötzl |publisher=Heyne |date=2011 | accessdate= August 3, 2013 |oclc=948635931 |isbn=9783641068110 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6oIpJpM31T8C&amp;pg=PT33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Beitz remained in the employ of Shell Oil when World War II began in 1939.  Following Germany's invasion and occupation of [[Boryslav|Borysław]] in July 1941, Beitz was assigned to supervise the Carpathian Oil Company operating the [[Boryslav|Borysław]] oil fields in what is now [[Ukraine]]. Given the importance of the oil fields to the German war effort, Beitz was able to designate workers as essential to the war effort.&lt;ref name=YV&gt;{{cite web|title=Berthold and Elsa Beitz|publisher=Yad Vashem|accessdate=August 2, 2013|url=http://www.yad-vashem.org.il/yv/en/righteous/stories/beitz.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Borysław area had a large Jewish population, with many Jews holding positions as chemical engineers, laboratory assistants, mechanics, and laborers in the area's oil industry.&lt;ref name=YV/&gt;

After witnessing the "Invaliden-Aktion" in August 1942, an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-led evacuation of a Jewish orphanage in Borysław, Beitz became determined to act to save local Jews.  Having a position of importance, Beitz received advance word of Nazi actions against local Jews and provided warning to the Jewish community.  He also had the opportunity to select suitable workers from Jews who were being held at transfer points for deportation to concentration camps.  In August 1942, he "extricated 250 Jewish men and women from the transport train to the [[Belzec extermination camp]] by claiming them as 'professional workers.'"&lt;ref name=YV/&gt;&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite news |title= Berthold Beitz, ThyssenKrupp patriarch who saved wartime Jews, dies aged 99| publisher= Deutsche Welle| date=31 July 2013|url=http://www.dw.de/berthold-beitz-thyssenkrupp-patriarch-who-saved-wartime-jews-dies-aged-99/a-16990234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beitz recalled, "I should have employed qualified personnel. Instead, I chose tailors, hairdressers and Talmudic scholars and gave them all cards as vital 'petroleum technicians.'"&lt;ref name=Aus/&gt;

Together with his wife Else, Beitz also hid Jews in his home.&lt;ref name=YV/&gt;&lt;ref name=JWN/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=German magnate Berthold Beitz who saved Jews in WWII dies|publisher=BBC|date=July 31, 2013|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23522382}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also issued and signed fake work permits to save other Jews from the death camps.&lt;ref name=JWN&gt;{{cite news|title=Berthold Beitz, savior of hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust, dies at 99|newspaper=Jewish World News|date=August 1, 2013|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.539040}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1943, Beitz's efforts were nearly exposed after two Jewish girls were arrested on a train to [[Hungary]] with forged "Aryan" permits signed by Beitz.  Beitz survived despite a Gestapo investigation into the incident, but he was drafted into the German army in March 1944.&lt;ref name=YV/&gt;  In total, Beitz has been credited with saving the lives of 800 Jews.&lt;ref name=Aus&gt;{{cite web|title=Berthold Beitz|publisher=Auschwitz.com|accessdate=August 2, 2013|url=http://auschwitz.dk/rescuers/id16.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beitz later explained his motivation: "I saw how people were shot, how they were lined up in the night. My motives were not political; they were purely humane, moral motives."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  In another interview, he explained: "It wasn't anti-Fascism, nor was it resistance. We saw from dawn to dusk, as close as could be, what was happening to Boryslav's Jews. When you see a mother holding her children being shot, while you yourself have children, your reaction has to be completely different."&lt;ref name=JWN/&gt;

For his efforts in saving Jewish workers, Beitz received Poland's highest civilian honor.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  In 1973, he was also honored by [[Yad Vashem]], the Israeli Holocaust memorial, as a "Righteous Among the Nations", the organization's highest honor for non-Jews who saved Jews from the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=DW/&gt;  According to Yad Vashem, "The Jews that he rescued from deportation included many unqualified workers, often in poor physical condition, who could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as 'professionals' or indispensable to the oil industry."&lt;ref name=YV/&gt;

==Post-war business career==
After the war, Beitz became the head of Iduna, an insurance company.  His innovative business methods and compensation brought him attention.  In 1953, [[Alfried Krupp]] hired him to become chairman of the [[Friedrich Krupp AG|Krupp]] steel corporation. He remained with the company for 60 years and helped build it into a publicly traded conglomerate, merging the company in the 1990s to form [[ThyssenKrupp]].  Beitz has also been credited with helping to lead the re-industrialization of the [[Ruhr Valley]] where Krupp's operations were based.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

After Alfried Krupp's death in 1967, Beitz served as executor and persuaded the Krupp heirs to establish a charitable foundation known as the [[Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation]].  The foundation still owns 25% of ThyssenKrupp.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Beitz remained active in the foundation and led its effort to fund the creation of the [[Museum Folkwang]] in [[Essen]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

From 1972 to 1988, Beitz was a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and an honorary member until his death.  From 1984 to 1988, he was an IOC vice president and executive board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death of Berthold Beitz, IOC Honorary Member|publisher=Olympic.org |date=July 31, 2013|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/death-of-berthold-beitz-ioc-honorary-member/206954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he received the Leo-Baeck Award, the highest honor bestowed by the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Berthold Beitz: Industrialist who saved hundreds of Jews from the Nazis|newspaper=The Independent|date=August 1, 2013|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/berthold-beitz-industrialist-who-saved-hundreds-of-jews-from-the-nazis-8742688.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Beitz died at age 99 at his holiday home on the island of [[Sylt]] off the northern coast of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thyssen-Krupp-Chef Hiesinger: "Verneige mich" vor Patriarch Beitz|newspaper=Spiegel|date=August 2, 2013|url=http://www.spiegel.de/thema/berthold_beitz/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by his wife Else and three daughters.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Following Beitz's death, [[Ronald Lauder]], president of the [[World Jewish Congress]], called Beitz "one of the great Germans of the past century."&lt;ref name=DW/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2850">The '''Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)''' is a technique for [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] agencies to solicit proposals from outside groups for certain research and development.  The agency will then select proposals to fund as contracts or grants.  BAAs are broad in their subject matter and focus on advancing science rather than acquiring specific products, which are instead covered under a [[Request for proposals]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2035_0.html#wp1085187 FAR 35.016].

BAAs pertains to basic and [[Research|applied research]], and certain early-stage development work.  They are not intended for acquisition "related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement."  It may only be used "when meaningful proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches can reasonably be foreseen."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The technique may be used to acquire "scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding."

'''Carlos Juan Molinari''' is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] businessman and real-estate developer&lt;ref name=perfil&gt;{{cite web| last =Morando| first =Lucas| title =Molinari, el magnate con lazos políticos detrás del escándalo| work =Perfil| date =Apr 21, 2013| url = http://www.perfil.com/politica/Molinari-el-magnate-con-lazos-politicos-detras-del-escandalo-20130421-0001.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who runs a firm called Real Estate Investments (REI) Sociedad Fiduciaria, also known as Rei Fiduciaria. He also runs many other firms in Argentina, the U.S., and elsewhere, and resides in [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Miami]].&lt;ref name=fortuna&gt;{{cite web| title =Carlos Molinari: del barrio cerrado a las viviendas sociales | work =FortunaWeb| url = http://fortunaweb.com.ar/2013-03-29-119045-carlos-molinari-del-barrio-cerrado-a-las-viviendas-sociales/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=avion&gt;{{cite web| title =Molinari, el empresario K que quiere los aviones| work =El Observador| date =Nov 10, 2012| url = http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/234540/molinari-el-empresario-k-que-quiere-los-aviones/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molinari described himself in 2011 during a brief foray into electoral politics as “a businessman who believes in social justice,&lt;ref name=avion/&gt;”. He is a longtime associate of the Kirchner family and a key figure in the so-called K money trail, the 2013 political scandal centering on acts of embezzlement and money laundering by persons connected to the presidential administrations of [[Nestor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner]].

==Career==
Molinari has been described as the “son of a trade unionist” and as being “of humble origins.”&lt;ref name=avion/&gt;

He is president of Real Estate Investments (REI) Sociedad Fiduciaria, which manages real estate in Argentina, including the 68-hectare Hudson Park in Berazategui.&lt;ref name=elentr&gt;{{cite web| title =Millonario K ligado a Concordia | work =El Entrerios| date =May 10, 2013| url = http://www.elentrerios.com/politica/millonario-k-ligado-a-concordia.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hudson Park, “an exclusive gated community,” has been described as Molinari’s “beloved child.” It includes houses, a condo-hotel, and shops, all built at an investment of around $30 million.”&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;

In the U.S., Molinari is the President of Global Development Consultant Inc., based in Miami, Florida, and registered in 2009. He is also a Managing Member of Adg Group Holdings, LLC; The New Langford, LLC.; and La Bahia, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wysk.com/index/florida/miami/8dyyan3/global-development-consultant-inc/profile |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517120341/http://www.wysk.com/index/florida/miami/8dyyan3/global-development-consultant-inc/profile |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he has served as an officer of several now-inactive U.S. entities, such as the Americas Real Estate Investments Inc., American Condo Hotel Group, Miami Wolf Soccer Team Inc., MDJ Housing Industries Corp., Argentinian Construction Group LLC, and National Argentine American Foundation, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;https://opencorporates.com/officers/8100171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizapedia.com/people/CARLOS-MOLINARI.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Hudson Park, Molinari has constructed a hotel-condominium development, La Aldea de Pilar, and a project called “La Mansión,” a complex of “VIP towers” in the historical district of Quilmes.  Noting that all three of these projects are located in areas governed by Kirchernist politicians, a journalist for Perfil observed that “politics often helps one find more and better opportunities.”&lt;ref name=perfil/&gt;

In March 2013 Molinari was described as being currently engaged in “developing a condo-hotel in a historic downtown building” in “most Latin American cities.” At the time, he was planning to initiate such projects shortly in Punta del Este, Pilar, Bernal, Mar del Plata, and Rosario.&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;

Molinari has built low-cost housing in [[Haiti]] out of containers. Molinari explained that this was an ecologically positive activity, given that there are “a lot of unused containers” in ports and that their rusting “causes severe environmental pollution problems.... By using this material, we are recovering a toxic waste.”&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;

Molinari was described in 2013 as a gifted analyst of the real-estate market, who in a 2004 conversation with [[Tomás Pedro Regalado|Tomás Regalado]], later elected mayor of Miami, predicted the mortgage crisis “when nobody was talking about anything but the euphoria of large investments.”&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;

It was reported in March 2013 that Molinari had “recently” started work on a 40-hectare Public Industrial Park in Canelones, [[Uruguay]], an investment of $120 million.&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;

Molinari is a director or shareholder of such Argentinian firms as Land Developer SA, and Sharks Sports SA, ADG Argentinian Developer Group SA, among others.&lt;ref name=eeuu&gt;{{cite web| last =Santoro| first =Daniel| title =Caso Báez: uno de los involucrados, en problemas con la Justicia de EE.UU.| work =Clarin| date =Nov 7, 2013| url = http://www.clarin.com/politica/Caso-Baez-involucrados-Justicia-EEUU_0_953904630.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, it was reported that Molinari wanted “to create a new airline in forty-five days.” He was in negotiations to buy seven aircraft from the defunct Uruguayan airline Pluna, which was in bankruptcy proceedings, and re-employ most of its 700 former employees. He presented Homero Guerrero, secretary to the Uruguayan president, with a plan to purchase the aircraft for close to $130 million and form a Uruguayan-based airline called Alas Sudamericanas, at an initial total investment of $190 million, that would be in the air within 45 days. He even met with President Mujica of Uruguay.  But the plan did not work out. Molinari complained that the issue had been “politicized.” He said, however, that he was carrying out feasibility studies aimed at the creation of his own Uruguayan airline, explaining that Uruguay ”is a strategic point in Latin America.”&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prensa.cancilleria.gov.ar/noticia.php?id%3D26627639 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517124401/http://prensa.cancilleria.gov.ar/noticia.php?id=26627639 |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molinari is a founding member of the regional business platform Developers &amp; Builders Alliance (DBA), which has offices in the U.S. and throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=urug&gt;{{cite web| last =Ladra| first =Antonio| title =Uruguay en la ruta del dinero de los K| work =El Contecer| date =Apr 16, 2013| url = http://www.elacontecer.com.uy/18819-uruguay-en-la-ruta-del-dinero-de-los-k.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
In 2011, Molinari ran as deputy when his friend [[Mario Ishii]] challenged the candidacy of [[Daniel Scioli]] for re-election as governor of the Buenos Aires province. "We are a possible alternative to the management of the current provincial leader,” Molinari told an interviewer. “We are able to see an alternative for the people of Buenos Aires with my practicality and with the ideological capacity of Mario Ishii.” Ishii and Molinari failed to win, despite a reported expenditure by Molinari of 6 million pesos.&lt;ref name=urug/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elembudo.tv/politica/40-politica/1171-la-extrana-historia-de-carlos-molinari-ex-companero-de-formula-de-mario-ishii.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121118/http://www.elembudo.tv/politica/40-politica/1171-la-extrana-historia-de-carlos-molinari-ex-companero-de-formula-de-mario-ishii.html |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latecla.info/3/nota_1.php?noticia_id=46948&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obama connection===
Molinari is friendly with Miami businessman [[Freddy Balsera]], who led the [[Barack Obama]] campaign’s outreach effort to Latinos and is head of the Hispanic Council of the Democratic Party in the U.S. Together, Molinari and Balsera have been involved together in a business venture involving “social housing.”&lt;ref name=avion/&gt;&lt;ref name=urug/&gt;

Molinari visited the White House in 2010 and contributed financially to the reelection campaign of President Obama in 2010.&lt;ref name=eeuu/&gt;  He also attended a 2010 dinner in Miami in support of Obama at the mansion of Gloria and Emilio Estefan, where he spoke to President Obama.&lt;ref name=elentr/&gt;
He has also donated to the [[Democratic Party PAC ActBlue]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.city-data.com/elec2/10/elec-MIAMI-FL-10-part3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===K money trail scandal===
{{Main|The K money trail}}
The scandal erupted as a result of the April 14, 2013, episode of the investigative journalism program ''Periodismo para todos (Journalism for All)'', hosted by [[Jorge Lanata]]. The episode, entitled “The K money trail,” included hidden-camera footage on which [[Leonardo Fariña]], the husband of famous model [[Karina Jelinek]], described in detail the financial maneuvers whereby [[Lázaro Báez]], a businessman close to the Kirchners, managed to transfer about 55 million euros from Argentina to [[Switzerland]]. Fariña had aided in this money-laundering operation, and it was established that the link between Báez and Fariña was Molinari, who was described as the “protector” of Fariña, a childhood friend of his son Martin.&lt;ref name=urug/&gt;

Appearing on the [[Jorge Rial]] radio program later in April, Molinari maintained that he had no involvement in money-laundering; that he had never met Báez; that he had met Fariña in late 2010, when Fariña had approached him with the idea of starting a luxury-car rental agency; and that he had known Federico Elaskar since the latter was 15 years old and a friend of his son, living in the same apartment building as the Molinaris, but that he had never done business with him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarin.com/politica/Molinari-Elaskar-conozco-amigo-hijo_0_906509541.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perfil.com/politica/Hablo-Carlos-Molinari-el-multimillonario-jefe-de-Leo-Faria-20130423-0031.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarin.com/politica/Empresario-blanquear-contactos-Elaskar-Farina_0_907109322.html&lt;/ref&gt; “I'm a businessman,” Molinari said. “I do business.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elliberal.com.ar/ampliada.php?ID=87665&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgente24.com/213356-la-version-de-molinari-el-millonario-protector-de-farina?pagination%3Dshow |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517122549/http://www.urgente24.com/213356-la-version-de-molinari-el-millonario-protector-de-farina?pagination=show |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/68847/&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 2013, Molinari was violently assaulted by five men in the Palermo section of Buenos Aires who took several items from him, including his Audi A7 truck, which was found abandoned shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1576136-asaltan-y-golpean-al-empresario-carlos-molinari&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that the beating and robbery of Molinari were the work of “mobsters” sending a “message.”&lt;ref name=eeuu/&gt;

[[Elisa Carrió]], a member of the Argentinian parliament, described Fariña in April 2013 as being “protected” by Molinari.&lt;ref&gt;http://tn.com.ar/politica/carrio-%E2%80%9Ctodo-lo-que-dice-farina-tiene-respaldo-documental%E2%80%9D_383507&lt;/ref&gt;

Fariña testified in June 2013 that he was an auditor for Austral Construcciones, a firm owned by Báez, and that he worked for Molinari, who paid him a monthly salary of 70,000 pesos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1590774-leonardo-farina-declaro-ante-la-justicia-y-admitio-que-conoce-a-lazaro-baez&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 2013, Maximiliano Acosta told a court that Molinari and his son Mathias had presented themselves to him as project developers and as representatives of Báez and his son.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1589050-el-testigo-de-boda-de-farina-complico-a-perez-gadin&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in July 2013 that Molinari was “in trouble” in the U.S. courts. He was sought in connection with a Miami trial, ''Carlos Germán Díaz vs Global Development Consultant Inc'', in which he was named as a defendant, and with a New York case, brought by Kenneth Welt against Diego Molinari, Deborah Batista, and Amadeo Molinari of [[Moll Systems Corporation]], that involved a payment to a Panamanian firm, [[Tensho Media]].&lt;ref name=eeuu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dockets.justia.com/docket/florida/flsdce/1:2013cv20729/416235&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, federal judge Sebastián Casanello ordered a raid on Molinari’s firm Rei Fiduciaria, in order to determine the legitimacy of Fariña’s claim that his lavish lifestyle could be accounted for by his income from Rei Fudiciaria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1616457-caso-baez-allanan-una-firma-y-carrio-pide-interpelar-a-timerman&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Fariña===
Molinari has been described as the man who “invented” the husband of Karina Jelinek, “since it was he who gave her the famous Ferrari” and paid for the couple’s wedding. Molinari said that Fariña had been recommended to him by a lawyer in La Plata. “He proposed to me the business of high-end car rental, and bought five cars, some on behalf of the company and others in my name,” said Molinari. “The idea was good, because they were cars that were not in Argentina.” At that time Fariña had not yet become involved with Jelinek, and “seemed to be a person with an ordinary life.” Molinari said he paid Fariña “a per diem of six thousand dollars and also had a stake in the [car-rental] company.” After Fariña and Jelinek became a couple, Molinari disliked the negative press that the couple generated and encouraged Fariña to lower his profile and to clarify that his car was company-owned and that he was not a millionaire. Molinari said he had paid for Fariña’s and Jelinek’s wedding, a total outlay of 480,000 pesos, in order to promote the car-rental firm, some of whose wares were on display at the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1591140-farina-dejo-muchas-dudas-ante-el-juez&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lasombradelespectaculo.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/escandalo-farina-rossi-carlos-molinari-el-hombre-que-invento-al-empresario/&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaskar testified that he knew Fariña through Molinari’s son Matías. The elder Molinari, said Elaskar, had given his wife an Audi as a wedding gift.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1590825-caso-baez-farina-y-elaskar-acusaron-a-lanata-ante-el-juez&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Molinari has five sons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perfil.com/politica/Molinari-el-magnate-con-lazos-politicos-detras-del-escandalo-20130421-0001.html&lt;/ref&gt; He had a son with Lucrecia Silva, a former ballet dancer and former TV host and the current owner of a baby-clothing store in Concordia, in which Molinari reportedly invested. Their son’s christening party was held at Club Progreso in 2012.&lt;ref name=elentr/&gt;

Molinari’s luxurious house in Pilar, Buenos Aires, was the subject of a feature in the magazine ''Caras'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urgente24.com/12574-molinari-como-jelinek-en-caras-nunca-trabaje-por-diner{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performing artist [[Marixa Balli]] stated in 2013 that Molinari had been her CD producer and lover in Miami many years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarin.com/politica/Ruta_del_dinero_K-Marixa_Balli-gastos-Carlos_Molinari-Leonarido_Farina_0_907109544.html&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that he had paid for her most recent trip to Miami.&lt;ref name=eeuu/&gt;

'''Carlos Panini''' was a wealthy Mexican businessman of Italian origin, from Mosio di Acquanegra sul Chiese in the province of Mantova in Lombardia region. He is credited with being the first pilot to fly a light plane around the world. In 1927 he had established Mexico's first scheduled airline, which he had sold shortly prior to the race as he was planning to retire.

He was a motorsport enthusiast and participated in numerous competitions.

Panini died when his car crashed during the 1951 [[Carrera Panamericana]] on the second stage from [[Oaxaca]] to [[Puebla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MEXICO: The Great Race |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889372,00.html |work=Time |date=1951-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the registered driver for the race was Carlos' daughter Teresa (Teresita), he was at the wheel of car, despite the fact that he did not have a valid license and was in ill health.  The accident happened when 15-year-old [[Bobby Unser]] was trying to overtake Panini who was travelling at a lower speed and blocked the American for a long stretch.  After several attempts, Unser made his move but Panini tried too late to block him, resulting in the two cars bumping one another.  Unser nearly went off a sheer cliff but was skilled enough to control his Jaguar, while Panini's Alfa Romeo went straight into a wall, killing the driver instantly.  Unser did not stop for fear of being disqualified from the race as the rules explicitly forbade it.  Later, Ricardo Ramirez of Mexico City abandoned the race to rush the Paninis to a hospital in Puebla.  Teresa Panini survived the accident with minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lacarrera2007.blogspot.com/2008/04/bobby-unser-speaks-about-muerte-dead.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Press reaction to his death was strong in condemning the race as his was a part of a series of prominent deaths that year.  At the time of his death newspapers gave his age as 54, but one states his age as 48.

{{tone|date=May 2015}}
A '''culminating project''' (also known as a '''senior project''', '''grad project''' or '''exit project'''), is a project that challenges high school seniors to demonstrate their academic knowledge in an experiential way (in most cases). According to the US Dept of Education&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; State Education Boards typically allow individual [[school district]]s to customize the project, based on basic state guidelines. 

== Confusion about the culminating project ==

People reporting on the culminating project sometimes confuse the terminology with the state [[high school exit exam]]. The state exit exam is a written exam that usually tests student’s math, reading, writing, and science skills, whereas the culminating project is a required project that is usually a learning experience based on a topic chosen by the student. The project is mandatory in order to graduate.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the project is to increase both teaching and learning. High school graduation standards have declined for several decades. [[Education reform|School reform]] or the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/parents/academic/involve/nclbguide/parentsguide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a way to bring value back to the high school diploma as well as support students  as they go out into the world prepared for college, a job, the military, entrepreneurship, internship, or whatever path students decide to follow once they graduate.

== Why a project is required ==
The requirement is an effort to increase the education standards. As [[college admissions]] and the workplace require more from their recruits, nationwide high schools must also.

In an effort to be clear, it is restated that the culminating project is not required by all schools. Again, parents and guardians would have to check with the student’s school official website for graduation requirements.

However, for students that are required to complete a culminating project, this is a chance for the student to explore a topic of personal interest. The project provides an opportunity that student may not have otherwise. By completing the project, students have a [[real life experience]] that can help them in their next adventure in life (college, job, entrepreneurship, military, internship, etc.).

Students gain a number of important skills by participating in the process such as,
* Leadership
* Communication
* Project management
* [[Time management]]
* Group skills
* Negotiation skills
* Meeting deadlines
* Conflict management
* [[Public speaking]]
* Presentation skills
* [[Self motivation]]

== Kinds of projects ==
The high school graduation culminating project format varies from state to state and even school to school within the same state. Parents and guardians will have to check with their students specific school for their requirements. Typically the project consists of choosing a topic of interest, writing a [[Academic publishing|research paper]] on that topic, having an experience directly related to the topic, keeping a journal of artifacts demonstrating your work, followed by the final step which is a presentation (US Dept of Education).

The student usually presents the project to a panel consisting of 2-5 people typically made up of teachers, community members, faculty, and staff. However, some schools have student present to a panel of their peers. Schools and school districts have total discretion to format the process in a way that works best for their students and their school culture.

In some cases, students complete a project on their own with the support of a mentor from their community. Some schools allow group projects and [[Presentation of a group|group presentation]]. For example, it would not be uncommon for the leadership class of a school to raise funds to build a school in Africa. Other requirements include a mandatory social/community aspect related to the project which means the high school graduation project has to benefit someone other than the student.

'''Downtown Los Angeles''' ('''DTLA''') is the [[central business district]] of [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], as well as a diverse [[neighborhood|residential neighborhood]] of some 58,000 people. A 2013 study found that the district is home to over 500,000 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Downtown LA Demographic Study 2013|url=http://www.downtownla.com/survey-2013-results.asp|accessdate=3 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027004505/http://www.downtownla.com/survey-2013-results.asp|archivedate=27 October 2015|website=DowntownLA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also part of [[Central Los Angeles]].

A heritage of the city's founding in 1781, Downtown Los Angeles today is composed of different areas ranging from a [[fashion]] district to [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]]. It is the hub for the city's [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|urban rail transit system]] and the [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] commuter rail system for Southern California.

Banks, [[department stores]], and [[movie palaces]] at one time drew residents and visitors into the area, but the district declined economically and suffered a downturn for decades until its recent renaissance starting in the early 2000s. Old buildings are being modified for new uses, and skyscrapers have been built.

Downtown Los Angeles is known for its government buildings, parks, theaters, and other public places.

==History==
{{refimprove section| date=May 2013}}
{{ further|History of Los Angeles }}

===Early years===
The earliest known settlements in the area of what is now Downtown Los Angeles was by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]], a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people. Later European settlement arrived after Father [[Juan Crespí]], a Spanish missionary charged with exploring sites for [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Spanish missions in California|missions in California]], noted in 1769 that the region had "all the requisites for a large settlement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/la/historic/crespi.html FATHER CRESPI IN LOS ANGELES, USC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707155441/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/la/historic/crespi.html |date=July 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 4, 1781, the city was founded by a group of settlers who trekked north from present-day Mexico.

Land speculation increased in the 1880s, which saw the population of the city explode from 11,000 in 1880 to nearly 100,000 by 1896.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtownla.com/5_05_downtownHistory.asp Downtown History, Downtown Center Business Improvement District] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804025547/http://www.downtownla.com/5_05_downtownHistory.asp |date=August 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructure enhancements and the laying of a street grid eventually brought development south of the original settlement into what is today the [[Civic Center, Los Angeles|Civic Center]] and [[Historic Core, Los Angeles|Historic Core]] neighborhoods.

===Downtown's golden age===
By 1920, the city's private and municipal rail lines were the most far-flung and most comprehensive in the world in mileage, even besting that of [[New York City]]. By this time, a steady influx of residents and aggressive land developers had transformed the city into a large metropolitan area, with DTLA at its center. Rail lines connected four counties with over {{convert|1100|mi|km|sp=us}} of track.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westworld.com/~elson/larail/PE/tunnel.html Westworld. 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503130518/http://www.westworld.com/~elson/larail/PE/tunnel.html |date=May 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early part of the 20th century, banking institutions clustered around South Spring Street, forming the [[Spring Street Financial District]]. Sometimes referred to as the "[[Wall Street of the West]],"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/11/local/me-39908 Wall Street of the West Had Its Peaks, Crashes]", ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; the district held corporate headquarters for financial institutions including [[Bank of America]], [[Farmers and Merchants Bank of Los Angeles|Farmers and Merchants Bank]], the [[Crocker National Bank]], California Bank &amp; Trust, and International Savings &amp; Exchange Bank. The [[Pacific Exchange|Los Angeles Stock Exchange]] was also located on the corridor from 1929 until 1986 before moving into a new building across the [[Interstate 110 (California)|Harbor (110) Freeway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicartinla.com/Downtown/Broadway/stock_exchange.html |title=Salvatore Cartaino Scarpitta, Los Angeles Stock Exchange, bas reliefs |publisher=Publicartinla.com |date=1929-10-29 |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial growth brought with it hotel construction—during this time period several grand hotels, the Alexandria (1906), the Rosslyn (1911), and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore]] (1923), were erected — and also the need for venues to entertain the growing population of Los Angeles. [[Broadway Theater and Commercial District|Broadway]] became the nightlife, shopping and entertainment district of the city, with over a dozen theater and movie palaces built before 1932.

Department stores also opened flagship stores downtown, including [[The Broadway]], Hamburger &amp; Sons, [[May Department Stores|May Company]], [[JW Robinson's]], and [[Bullock's]], serving a wealthy residential population in the [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]] neighborhood. Numerous specialty stores also flourished including those in the jewelry business which gave rise to the Downtown Jewelry District. Among these early jewelers included the Laykin Diamond Company (later becoming Laykin et Cie [http://www.laykinetcie.com]) and [[Harry Winston]] &amp; Co., both of which found their beginnings in the [[Hotel Alexandria]] at Fifth and Spring streets.

The [[Los Angeles Union Station|Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal]] (Union Station) opened in May 1939, unifying passenger service among various local, regional, and long-distance passenger trains. It was built on a grand scale and would be one of the "last of the great railway stations" built in the United States.

===Decline and redevelopment===
[[File:Angels flight los angeles.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Angels Flight]], November 2008]]
Following [[World War II]], [[suburbanization]], the development of the Los Angeles freeway network, and increased automobile ownership led to decreased investment downtown. Many corporate headquarters slowly dispersed to new suburbs or fell to mergers and acquisitions. The once-wealthy [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]] neighborhood became a haven for low-income renters, its stately Victorian mansions turned into [[flophouse]]s.

From about 1930 onward, numerous very old and historic buildings in the plaza area were demolished to make way for street-level parking lots, the high demand for parking making this more profitable than any other option that might have allowed preservation. The drastic reduction in the number of residents in the area further reduced the viability of streetfront businesses that would be able to attract pedestrians. For most Angelenos, downtown became a drive-in, drive-out destination.

In an effort to combat [[Urban decay|blight]] and lure businesses back downtown, the city's [[Community redevelopment agency|Community Redevelopment Agency]] undertook the [[Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project]] in 1955, a massive clearance project that leveled homes and cleared land for future commercial skyscraper development. This period saw the clearing and upzoning of the entire neighborhood, as well as the shuttering of the [[Angels Flight]] funicular railway in 1969. Angels Flight resumed operation in 1996 for a period of five years, shutting down once again after a fatal accident in 2001. On March 15, 2010, the railway once again opened for passenger service following extensive upgrades to brake and safety systems.

With [[Class A office space]] becoming available on Bunker Hill, many of DTLA's remaining financial corporations moved to the newer buildings, leaving the former [[Spring Street Financial District]] devoid of tenants above ground floor. Following the corporate headquarters' moving six blocks west, the large department stores on Broadway shuttered, culminating in the 1980s.

However, the Broadway theaters saw much use as Spanish-language movie houses during this time, beginning with the conversion of the [[Million Dollar Theater]] in the 1950s to a Spanish-language theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laconservancy.org/remaining/remaining_theatres08.php4#million |title=Last Remaining Seats |publisher=Laconservancy.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent years===

[[File:Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Los Angeles Union Station]]]]
In mid-2013, downtown was noted as "a neighborhood with an increasingly [[Hip (slang)|hip]] and [[:wikt:well-heeled|well-heeled]] residential population."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-whole-foods-downtown-20130731,0,2826238.story David Pierson, "Whole Foods to Open Downtown L.A. Store in 2015," ''Los Angeles Times,'' July 31, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the downtown area's office market's migration west to Bunker Hill and the [[Financial District, Los Angeles|Financial District]], many historic office buildings have been left intact, simply used for storage or remaining empty during recent decades. In 1999, the [[Los Angeles City Council]] passed an [[adaptive reuse]] [[Local ordinance|ordinance]], making it easier for developers to convert outmoded, vacant office and commercial buildings into [[loft apartment|renovated lofts]] and luxury apartment and condo complexes.

As of early 2009, 14,561 residential units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownla.com/pdfs/econ_residential/1Q09HousingBook.pdf|title=Downtown LA - Page not found...|website=www.downtownla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created under the adaptive reuse ordinance, leading to an increase in the residential population.  With 28,878 residents in 2006&lt;ref name=DiMassa01&gt;Cara Mia DiMassa, "[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-downtown21feb21,0,4218500.story Downtown L.A. has gained people but lost jobs, report says]", ''Los Angeles Times,'' February 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and 39,537 in 2008,&lt;ref name="downtownla1"&gt;[http://www.downtownla.com/survey/2011/Downtown-LA-Demographic-Study-2011.pdf] DowntownLA.com demographic study&lt;/ref&gt; a 36.9% increase, Downtown Los Angeles is seeing new life and investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-main-street11-2009jun11,0,4047200.story | work=Los Angeles Times | date=2009-06-11 | title=Ordinance brings new life into downtown L.A.'s Main Street}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Staples Center]], which opened in 1999, has contributed immensely to the revitalization plans, adding 250 events and nearly 4 million visitors per year to the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aegworldwide.com/01_venues/staples_center.php |title=Facilities, STAPLES Center |publisher=AEG Worldwide |date= |accessdate=2009-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828062613/http://aegworldwide.com/01_venues/staples_center.php |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the opening of the Staples Center, the adjacent [[L.A.

*[[Los Angeles County Metro Rail]], a rail transit network centered on the downtown area, facilitates access to the city center, especially from the congested West Side.
*[[Real estate developer]]s and investors planned a $1.8 billion revitalization project along Grand Avenue, which included the development of [[Grand Park]], a large city park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/27/worlddispatch.usa |title=Downtown looks up: Dan Glaister reports on ambitious plans to create a brighter, better and shinier heart of LA |last=Glaister |first=Dan |date=27 May 2005 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=19 July 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the construction of major city landmarks, including the [[Frank Gehry]]-designed [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] and contemporary art museum [[The Broad]], which opened in 2015.

The 2000 U.S. census found that just 27,849 residents lived in the 5.84 square miles of downtown—or 4,770 people per square mile, among the lowest densities for the city of Los Angeles but about average for the county. The [[Southern California Association of Governments]] estimates that downtown's daytime population is 207,440.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood/downtown/|title=Downtown|website=Mapping L.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population increased to 34,811 by 2008, according to city estimates.

Downtown Los Angeles is almost evenly balanced among the four major racial and ethnic groups — [[Asian Americans]] (23%), [[African Americans]] (22%), [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] (25%) and [[non-Hispanic whites]] (26%) — according to an analysis of 2010 census data made by [[Loyola Marymount University]] researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trounson|first=Rebecca|title=A multicultural moment: Downtown L.A.'s population evenly split|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/multicultural-moment-downtown-la.html|accessdate=April 13, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the 2000 census showed that downtown was the second–most diverse neighborhood in Los Angeles, its [[diversity index]] being 0.743, outrated only by [[Mid-Wilshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/diversity/neighborhood/list/#downtown] "Diversity," Mapping L.A., ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]], 36.7%; [[African Americans|blacks]], 22.3%; [[Asian Americans|Asians]], 21.3%; [[Non-Hispanic whites|whites]], 16.2%, and others, 3.5%. Mexico (44.7%) and Korea (17%) were the most common places of birth for the 41.9% of the residents who were born abroad, about the same ratio as in the city as a whole.&lt;ref name=MappingLADowntown/&gt;

The median household income in 2008 dollars was $15,003, considered low for both the city and the county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less (57.4%) was the highest in Los Angeles County, followed by University Park (56.6%) and Chinatown (53.6%). The average household size of 1.6 people was relatively low. Renters occupied 93.4% of the housing units, and home or apartment owners the rest.&lt;ref name=MappingLADowntown/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/income/20-or-less/neighborhood/list] "$20,000 or less," Mapping L.A., ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, there were 2,400 military veterans living downtown, or 9.7% of the population, considered a high rate for the city but average for the county overall.&lt;ref name=MappingLADowntown/&gt;

In 2013, a study by Downtown Center Business Improvement District showed that of the 52,400 people resided in Downtown Los Angeles. The demographic breakdown was 52.7% Caucasian, 20.1% Asian, 17.0% Latino, and 6.2% African-American; 52.9% female, 47.1% male; and 74.8% of residents were between the ages of 23-44.The median age for residents was 34. The median household income was $98,700. The median household size was 1.8. In terms of educational attainment, 80.1% of residents had completed at least 4 years of college. The study was a self-selecting sample of 8,841 respondents across the DTLA area. It was not a "census" but rather a comprehensive survey of Downtown LA consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownla.com/survey/2013/results/DTLA-Demo-Study-2013.pdf|title=Downtown LA - Page not found...|website=www.downtownla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Los Angeles County Metro Rail and Metro Liner map.svg|thumb|229x229px|Current [[Los Angeles Metro Rail]] map showing rail and rapid transit lines]]
Downtown Los Angeles is the center of the region's growing rail transit system, with six commuter lines operated by [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]], as well as five rapid-transit rail lines and local and regional bus service operated by [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (Metro).

Major Metro stations in the district include [[Los Angeles Union Station]], [[Civic Center/Grand Park station]], [[Pershing Square station]], [[7th Street/Metro Center station]], [[Pico station]], and [[Little Tokyo/Arts District station]].

*The first leg of the modern [[Los Angeles County Metro Rail|Los Angeles Metro Rail system]], the [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Blue Line]] light rail, debuted in 1990, followed by the [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Red Line]] heavy-rail subway line in 1993, the [[Green Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Green Line]] light rail in 1994, the [[Gold Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Gold Line]] light rail in 2003, and the [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Expo Line]] light rail in 2012.  
*In late 2009, the [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] bus rapid transit project opened, replacing two unconnected bus rapid transit lines with through service at street level through the downtown area.
*In 2006, a portion of the Metro Red Line was rebranded by Metro as the [[Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Purple Line]], a heavy-rail subway line which runs from [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] to [[Wilshire/Western station]] in [[Koreatown, Los Angeles, California|Koreatown]]. A [[Purple Line Extension|westward extension]] of the line to [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]] is currently under construction.
*Metro operates an extensive bus network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/riding_metro/maps/default.htm |title=Metro Maps |publisher=Metro.net |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Metro Local, Metro Express commuter lines, and Metro Rapid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/projects/rapid/ |title=Metro Rapid |publisher=Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; buses with signal priority and limited stops.

===Transit expansion===
[[File:LACMTA-GoldLine.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Gold Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Gold Line light rail at Union Station]]]]

*The [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Expo Line]] was built in two phases and completed in 2016. The first phase of the project connected [[7th St/Metro Center (LACMTA station)|7th Street/Metro Center Station]] downtown with Culver City via the former [[Pacific Electric Railway]] [[Santa Monica Air Line]] right-of-way. The second phase extended the line to [[Santa Monica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://buildexpo.org/phase2_target_schedule.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524191730/http://buildexpo.org/phase2_target_schedule.php |date=May 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Expo Line shares tracks with the [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Blue Line]] north of Washington Boulevard, and shares both the [[Pico (LACMTA station)|Pico Station]] and [[7th St/Metro Center (LACMTA station)|7th Street/Metro Center Station]] with the Blue Line.

==Skyline==
{{Main|List of tallest buildings in Los Angeles}}
[[File:Los Angeles Skyline.jpg|thumb|220px|The modern skyline of Los Angeles resulted from the termination of severe height restrictions in 1957]]
Despite its relative decentralization and comparatively new high-rises (until 1958, the city did not permit any structures taller than the 27-story City Hall building &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentreader.com/la-city-hall/#Building-City-Hall |title=LA City Hall - Student Reader |publisher=StudentReader.com |date=2012-10-24 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Los Angeles has one of the largest skylines in the [[United States]], and its development has continued in recent years.

The skyline has seen rapid growth due to improvements in seismic design standards, which has made certain building types highly earthquake-resistant. Many of the new skyscrapers contain a housing or hotel component.

Some current and upcoming examples of skyscraper construction include:
*705 Ninth Street, a 35-story residential tower, was completed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2009/11/it_turns_out_that_rumor.php|title=MerueloMaddux |publisher=MerueloMaddux |date= |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building height limits: 1904-1957===
[[File:LA Eastern Columbia Building.jpg|thumb|The [[Eastern Columbia Building]]: the Entrance to the [[Historic Core, Los Angeles|Historic Core]] and the "Jewel of Downtown"]]
The first height limit ordinance in Los Angeles was enacted following the completion of the 13-story [[Continental Building]], located at the southeast corner of Fourth and Spring streets. The purpose of the height limit was to limit the density of the city. There was great hostility to skyscrapers in many cities in these years, mainly due to the congestion they could bring to the streets, and height limit ordinances were a common way of dealing with the problem. In 1911, the city passed an updated height limit ordinance, establishing a specific limit of {{convert|150|ft|m}}. Exceptions were granted for decorative towers such as those later built on the [[Eastern Columbia Building]] and United Artists Theatre, as well as the now-demolished [[Richfield Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4wilshire.com|title=The Latest On AXS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1911 ordinance was repealed in 1957. The first private building to exceed the old limit was the 18-story United California Bank Building, located at the southeast corner of Sixth and Spring streets.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Flat Roof Ordinance===
The pattern of buildings in Los Angeles to feature these "flat roofs" was the result of a 1974 fire ordinance which required all tall buildings in the city to include rooftop [[helipad]]s in response to the devastating 1974 [[Joelma Fire]] in [[Sao Paulo, Brazil]], in which helicopters were used to affect rescues from the flat rooftop of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Jeremy (January 16, 2012) [http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/laws-that-shaped-la/laws-that-shaped-la-why-is-the-la-skyline-so-bland.html "Laws That Shaped L.A.: Why is the Los Angeles Skyline So Bland?"] [[KCET]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wilshire Grand Center]] was the first building granted an exception by the [[Los Angeles City Fire Department]] in 2014. However, as the building was under construction, [[Los Angeles City Council|L.A. City Council]] removed the flat roof ordinance as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Glick Kudler, Adrian (February 7, 2013) [http://la.curbed.com/archives/2013/02/new_wilshire_grand_will_be_the_west_coasts_tallest_tower.php "New Wilshire Grand Will Be the West Coast's Tallest Tower"] [[Curbed|CURBED Los Angeles]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''equivalence number method''' is a cost calculation method for co-production in [[cost accounting|cost and activity accounting]]. The resulting costs of the input factors are allocated to the individual products according to a [[weighting]] key, the so-called equivalence numbers.

== Description ==

As with the other cost allocation methods, the conservation of the cost sum applies, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{sum of cost input} = \text{sum of cost output}&lt;/math&gt;

The cost of the main product, usually for the product with the highest physical or economical output, receives for example the equivalence number 1. On the basis of selected indicators (average market prices, physical properties, etc.) other equivalence numbers are formed, using suitable ratios between the different co-products. Multiplying the equivalence numbers by the production or sales figures results in the allocation keys for a specific product type. From this the cost of a co-product can be calculated, both for main and by-products.

== Mathematical background ==

From an one-dimensional input I, a two-dimensional output is assumed with ''O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(I) * I'' and ''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(I) * I''.

Note: One interpretation for ''f'' is a conversion efficiency from the input to the respective output. More than 2 co-products are also conceivable.

The costs ''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the variable costs of the two outputs which need to be determined. ''k&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the known variable costs of the input. ''K&lt;sup&gt;var&lt;/sup&gt;'' denotes the respective sum of the variable costs. ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the allocation factors for the respective output, i.e. they describe the proportion of the input that is assigned to a co-product.

The weighting keys are ''f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;K_1^{var} = a_1 \cdot K_I^{var} = \frac{f_1}{f_1 + f_2} \cdot k_I \cdot I  \quad \text{respectively} \quad K_2^{var}  = a_2 \cdot K_I^{var} = \frac{f_2}{f_1 + f_2} \cdot k_I \cdot I&lt;/math&gt;

This results in specific variable costs ''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;k_1 = \frac{K^{var}_1}{O_1} = \frac{K^{var}_1}{f_1 \cdot I} \quad \text{respectively} \quad k_2 = \frac{K^{var}_2}{O_2} = \frac{K^{var}_2}{f_2 \cdot I}&lt;/math&gt;

According to the introducing relation of the cost allocation, the following applies:

:&lt;math&gt; k_I \cdot I = k_1 \cdot O_1 + k_2 \cdot O_2 \quad \text{or} \quad K_I^{var} = K_1^{var} + K_2^{var}&lt;/math&gt;

== Application examples ==

An [[airline]] can determine the cost of the transportation service by dividing air [[freight]] and [[passengers]] by [[weight]]. The average passenger weight of booked seats is to be compared to the weight of the loaded air cargo containers.

* a&lt;sub&gt;pass&lt;/sub&gt; = m&lt;sub&gt;pass&lt;/sub&gt; / (m&lt;sub&gt;pass&lt;/sub&gt; + m&lt;sub&gt;freight&lt;/sub&gt;)
* a&lt;sub&gt;freight&lt;/sub&gt; =  m&lt;sub&gt;freight&lt;/sub&gt; /  (m&lt;sub&gt;pass&lt;/sub&gt; + m&lt;sub&gt;freight&lt;/sub&gt;)

In a [[refinery]], one can assume the input as [[crude oil]] and as output [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[heavy fuel oil]] as well as (flare) losses. The equivalence number method can use the [[energy]] content of the products as an allocation key. E is the product of energy density and production quantity.

* a&lt;sub&gt;gas&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sub&gt;gas&lt;/sub&gt; / (E&lt;sub&gt;gas&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;diesel&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;HFO&lt;/sub&gt;)
* a&lt;sub&gt;diesel&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sub&gt;diesel&lt;/sub&gt; / (E&lt;sub&gt;gas&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;diesel&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;HFO&lt;/sub&gt;)
* a&lt;sub&gt;HFO&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sub&gt;HFO&lt;/sub&gt; / (E&lt;sub&gt;gas&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;diesel&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;HFO&lt;/sub&gt;)

In the [[cogeneration]] plants, the [[Carnot method]] allocates the fuel to the products useful heat and electrical work as the key to the [[exergy]] content of the beneficial energies.

* a&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt;= η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; / (η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; × η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;)
* a&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;= (η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; x η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;) / (η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; × η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;)

In the alternative generation method, the key is thermal and weighted electrical efficiency, where the weighting factor is the ratio of thermal to electrical reference efficiencies (γ = η&lt;sub&gt;th,ref&lt;/sub&gt;/η&lt;sub&gt;el,ref&lt;/sub&gt;).

* a&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt;= (γ η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt;) / (γ η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;)
* a&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;=  η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; / (γ η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;)

== Criticism ==

Criticism of the equivalence number method is justified by the fact that completely arbitrary and random keys can be chosen. For example, in the case of allocating the potable water bill in a house with only one common meter, the water consumption could be divided according to the number of occupants per apartment or the apartment's net dwelling area in m².

'''Fixed position assembly''' refers to an assembly system or situation in which the product does not move while being assembled, this configuration is usually contrasted in [[operations management]] and [[industrial engineering]] with [[assembly lines]]. Dimensioning this system is very simple: considering CP as [[productive capacity]] and T as average assembly time, then N, number of working stations, is given by N=CP*T.

[[Image:Assembly of Ottoman airplane.jpg|thumb|right|Ottoman [[airplane]] being assembled during WWI. Even thought airplane assembly is often cited as an example of fixed position system, today many airplanes go through assembly lines.]]

==Advantages==

*high system flexibility: both in introducing new products and attaining product customization
*high variability in operations naturally lends itself to introducing [[job enlargement]] (to the benefit of the worker)
*low investment: only "capital" needed are generic worker tools.

==Disadvantages==

*High work in progress
*Significant space occupancy
*Higher labor costs: workers need to know how to perform all operations of the technological cycle and therefore skilled labor needs to be employed (this is in sharp contrast to the [[assembly line]] in which a worker needs almost no training thanks to [[division of labour]] being carried to its extreme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15271">The '''global march against child labor''' came about in 1998, following the significant response concerning the desire to end [[child labor]]. It was a [[grassroot]] movement that motivated many individuals and organizations to come together and fight against child labor and not an annual march.

The main goals of this movement was to:
* "Protect and promote the rights of all children, especially the [[right to education|rights to receive free, meaningful education]]"&lt;ref name=about&gt;http://www.globalmarch.org/aboutus/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* "To be free from [[economic exploitation]] and from performing any work that is likely to be damaging to a child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development". The march was very successful and it achieved its purpose by allowing changes to occur with the policies of [[child labour]] with the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO)&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Overview==
This march began on January 17, 1998 under the leadership of [[Kailash Satyarthi]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crin.org/organisations/viewOrg.asp?ID=1813 CRIN - Child Rights Information Network - Organisations - Global March Against Child Labour&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This event was a global [[conjuncture]] that brought [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), [[trade unions]], teachers, children and individuals together to fight against [[child labour]]. People from all over the world came together. There were people who marched only within their region and there were others who continued to Geneva, Switzerland.  They were called the core marchers.

The marchers united and advanced through Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the U.S.  Their final destination was Geneva, Switzerland where the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) meeting was taking place.  At this conference, the issues of [[child labour]] and implementing new policies in order to prevent it on the global level were discussed.  This march was significant at the ILO convention against the worst forms of child labor otherwise known as [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999|Convention no. 182]], because:
# The marchers' opinions were heavily considered while writing out the draft.
# Also, it became the fastest ratified convention in the history of ILO with 150 countries adopting this draft.

This march was important to children in the work field since the underlying cause was to banish economic exploitation, not only in labor fields, but also through [[human trafficking]] where children are usually sold off for commercial services.

For those students that were not able to physically participate in the march, they were able to participate in an Online March sponsored by the [[Quincy Public Schools|Massachusetts-based Kids Campaign to “Build a School for Iqbal”]].  Over 3,000 classrooms with students published messages on the Global March web page.&lt;ref name=onlinemarch&gt;[http://www.nclnet.org/march.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several goals were created and collectively agreed upon by the delegates of the supporting organizations for the Global March:&lt;ref name="onlinemarch"/&gt;

* Increase attention and consciousness in regards to [[child labor]]
* Encourage the [[ratification]] and implementation of surviving [[child labor]] and education conventions and laws by states
* Assemble the most achievable national and international resources to sustain [[education]] for all children
* Marshal public opinion and engagement against the extensive prejudices contributing to [[child labor]]
* Commanding the urgent eradication of the majority of oppressive forms of child labor
* Endorse constructive actions by consumers and employees
* Guarantee adequate treatments and reincorporation of child laborers

==Organizations that are Involved==
Currently, there are many organizations that supported the cause of the global march:&lt;ref name=aboutthegm&gt;http://www.globalmarch.org/aboutus.aboutthegm.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Education International]]
* [[Oxfam International]]
* [[Action Aid]]
* [[World Vision]]
* [[Social Alert]]
* [[World Confederation of Teachers]]
* [[Save the Children Fund]] (UK)
* [[Public Services International]] (PSI)
* [[Free The Children]]
* [[Mani Tese]]

==International Steering Committee==
An International Steering Committee (membership is pulled from almost every continent) for the Global March against child labor was formed and consisted of:

* African Network for the Prevention and Protection Against Child Abuse and Neglect in [[Kenya]]
* [[Anti-Slavery International]] in the [[United Kingdom]]
* [[Education International]] in [[Belgium]]
* FundaHao ABRINQ in [[Brazil]]
* [[International Labor Rights Forum|International Labor Rights Fund]] in [[United States|United States of America]]
* Network against Child Labour in [[South Africa]]
* Novib in the [[Netherlands]]
* Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights in the United States of America
* [[Bachpan Bachao Andolan|South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude]] in [[India]]
* Terre des Hommes-Suisse in [[Switzerland]]

==Benefits==
This march was important to children because it discourages them to experience [[economic]] exploitation in the labor field such as [[human trafficking]].
The policies that were introduced through this march emphasized highly on [[education]]. When children are educated it helps the economy since they are more likely to get out of their [[poverty]] stricken situation.  By limiting education, it is limiting the prosperity

==Origins of this March==
The march had 140 different countries that participated the act with thousands of partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campaignforeducation.org/resources/Nov2001/OutofShadows.doc&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of events, rallies, foot marches and bus caravans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nclnet.org/marchinf.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The first country that began the march was in Manila, Philippines on January 17, 1998. The marches took place in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the United States. Out of all of those people who participated in the march, only the select few known as the core marchers moved on to Geneva, Switzerland where the ILO were meeting for a possible revision of a new international convention on the most intolerable forms of child labor (Convention no. 182).&lt;ref name=laborrights&gt;http://laborrights.org/press/march050198.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States led their own nationwide march.  It began in Los Angeles, California on May 2, 1998.  The marchers went through all the major cities such as: Dallas, Little Rock, St Louis, Detroit and New York. The last city they visited was Washington, D.C. on May 26, 1998. From there, the core marchers went to Geneva, Switzerland. "The U.S. march has two main goals: to focus attention on domestic child labor problems, particularly those related to sweatshops and migrant agricultural work, and to encourage consumers to demand, retailers to sell and manufacturers to produce child-labor-free goods".&lt;ref name=laborrights/&gt;

Within their nationwide march many organizations got actively involved. These U.S. organizations co-sponsored the Global March against Child Labor.&lt;ref name=usorganizations&gt;http://www.nclnet.org/march.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to Prominence==
The march was a success since the revision of a new international convention on the most intolerable forms of child labor [[Convention No 182]] was changed the following year. Through this march, Convention no. 182 became the fastest ratified law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalmarch.org/aboutus/achievements.php Global March Against Child Labour - From Exploitation to Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This decree became the guideline for governments internationally when creating labor laws.  Currently, over 150 countries have adopted Convention no. 182 in their own nation.

Kailash Satyarthi is largely responsible for taking the initiative of organizing this march.  He had a vision of eliminating child labor everywhere and allowing education to become highly accessible for children. Kailash Satyarthi was the moving force in shifting our attention to child labor as a social issue. Through his tireless efforts, he has “brought political and judiciary machinery into action, and sensitized media in favor of the most oppressed children”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kailashsatyarthi.net/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; His work did not stop after this march instead, he moved on to other projects such as Global Campaign for Education to promote universal education.

==Evolution==
This march initiated other events to come together to fight against child labor.  The march spread the awareness of eliminating child labor in our society and worldwide.  Here are some examples of events that branched off from this march:
* South Asian March against Child Trafficking
* UN announced the Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking
* Global Campaign for Education
* The World Cup Campaign 2002
* Fair Chocolate for the World
* Northern Advocacy Office in Washington D.C.

==The First Children’s World Congress on Child Labour==
The First Children’s World Congress on Child Labour (CWWCL) was held in May 2004 in Florence, [[Italy]].  The event was organized by the Global March against Child Labor and other [[grassroots]] organizations.

Children were invited to the event through selection where at the Congress they were able to interact and communicate their views on the most pertinent concerns connected to their childhood and adolescence.  They disclosed their experiences, dreams and ambitions as well as partake in various activities that lead to the formation of [[Goal|Action Plans]].  The selections for the Congress were made through democratic consultation processes (nominated by other children) at the national and local levels.  Most of the representatives were former [[Child Labour|child laborers]] that got assistance from education and [[Vocational Education|vocational training]] in local [[Civic Society|civic organizations]] or treatment centers; however some were still working so they could pay for their education and some were chosen to represent associations such as [[trade union|Trade Unions]] and Child Rights Organizations.

This Congress was significant because it was the first Congress where children were the focus and were the chief spokespersons, decision makers and recipients.  Approximately 200 children ages 11 to 17 were in attendance.  The children that took part in the Congress came from diverse backgrounds and cultures and represented various regions, countries and organizations

This conference was crucial in understanding child labor and work [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]&lt;ref name=childlabourcongress&gt;Biggeri, Mario, et al. "Children Conceptualizing their Capabilities: Results of a Survey
Conducted during the First Children's World Congress on Child Labour*." Journal of Human Development 7.1 (2006): 59-83. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 9 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts and Statistics==
* 1997: ILO estimated between 100 million and 200 million child laborers in the world&lt;ref name="onlinemarch"/&gt;
* 2004: ILO estimated that there were 218 million child laborers worldwide, with 7 of 10 working in agriculture
* In order to globally abolish child labor, ILO approximates an expense of $38 billion per year for 20 years.
* In 2001, Indian government confessed to having 12.7 million child laborers
* In Brazil in order to convince parents to send their children to school instead of work, the government pays families $4.50  per child a month. Currently, there are more than 1 million participants&lt;ref name=newstatistics&gt;[Stokes, Bruce "When Childhood Is Denied." National Journal (2008): 17. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 9 Nov. 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Guatemala, female child laborers typically work 21 hours a week on domestic responsibilities coupled with a 40-hour working week beyond this.&lt;ref name=guatemala&gt;["Global March Against Child Labour." Women's International Network News 23.4

==Events==
At a match against [[Germany]] on April 17, 2002, the [[Argentine national football team|Argentina National Team]] demonstrated their unity on abolishing child labor.  They lifted a banner that read, “The only work for children should be to go to school"&lt;ref name=events&gt;http://www.cridoc.net/newsletter/july_2004/red_card.php&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2004, the Global March against Child Labor celebrated its 6th anniversary in [[Quezon City]].  The celebration was held at the Occupational Safety and Health Center where more than 5,000 children and their parents marched from [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] to honor the movement.  The ILO, government organizations, churches and other organizations were present at the celebration.

Political candidates were invited in hopes of convincing them to incorporate child labor issue in their platforms.  The candidates were introduced to the issue of [[child labor]] and conversed with the children.

After the traditional signing of the [[Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003|RA 9231]] all participants joined hands in giving appreciation to the strides made and rewards received because of the successes achieved by the Global March movement.  Invited artists and chosen groups of child laborers showcased any talents and artistic skills they possessed in activities such as dancing, singing and playing musical instruments"&lt;ref name=oneevent&gt;http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000000244&lt;/ref&gt;
.

==Recent events==
The next country to encounter the march is Zimbabwe.  The march will take place on December 1–31, 2007.  It will start at Harare and end in Plumtree.  The goal is to combat child labor and to spread education to the children of that country.  Media outlets will be used to promote this event through television, newspaper and radio.  One of the major organizations that are contributing to this march is the New Hope Foundation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16162">'''High-density solids pumps''' are hydrostatically operating machines which displace the medium being pumped and thus create a flow.

==High-density solids and their transport==
High-density solids are mixtures of liquid and solid constituents; examples include farm grain, pulled pork, etc..  Each have their own typical physical and chemical characteristics such as specific weight, solids content, maximum particle size as well as how they behave, for example [[Thixotropy|thixotropically]], abrasively or adhesively.

Typical examples for high-density solids are [[concrete]], [[sludge]]s and [[slurries]].

Within industrial plants many substances with high proportion of solids - such as mechanically dewatered sewage sludges, filter cakes, bituminous coal sludges, waste and process sludges - have to be transported over relatively great distances to landfills or incineration plants.

In principle, long conveying distances can be bridged with mechanical conveying equipment or hydraulic high-density solids pumps.

Types of '''mechanical conveyors''' are [[Conveyor belt|belt]], [[Screw conveyor|screw]] (worm), or [[Conveyor chain#scraper|scraper]]. They are suitable for nearly all types of high-density solids.

'''Hydraulic high-density solids pumps''' move sludges and slurries within an enclosed pipeline. However, not every sludge or slurry is pumpable, depending on:
* Ratio: The mixture of solid and liquid components must be such that it results in a plastically deformable mass.
* Saturation: The volume of pore space in the sludges must be filled with sufficient quantity of liquid matter for particle to be able to rest on particle via a plastically viscous liquid and for the interstices to be filled.
* Gas component: As a consequence of pressure fluctuations, knocking in the pipe may happen. By injection of about 2% air, sludges which do not naturally have a gas component can be brought to a better consistency.

==Types of high-density solids pumps==
Depending on how the displacement principle is implemented, a distinction can be drawn between rotary and reciprocating pumps. The rotary circulation pumps includes eccentric screw pumps, [[centrifugal pump]]s, and squeezed tube (peristaltic) pumps. Reciprocating pumps include plunger, diaphragm, and piston pumps.

The high-density solids pumps which can be used in the widest range of situations is the hydraulically powered piston (or reciprocating) pump. It can be realized as single-cylinder or two-cylinder pump. In the latter case, power is transferred to the material via delivery pistons working in push-pull-mode.While one delivery piston sucks material from the feed hopper into the cylinder, the second piston simultaneously pushes the material in the other delivery cylinder and into the delivery line.

The PUMPMAN series pumps invented in INDIA in 2015-16 are however completely different from the presently available hydraulically operated piston pumps. The PUMPMAN series Pumps have been recently invented which do not use a hydraulic pump and complex hydraulic circuits for their operation. However they use a very simple mechanism which multiplies the reciprocating force several times without using a hydraulic system. These Pumps are protected under multiple patent applications, some of them are already published by the Indian Patent office. They have been invented by Amit &amp; Anand Gokhale.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/small-concrete-pump-pm-25-d-amit-gokhale?trk=hp-feed-article-title-share&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Type: Piston pump with transfer tube (two-cylinder pump)===
[[File:Rohrweichenpumpe Animation.ogv|thumb|300px|Operating principle of piston pump with transfer tube]]

====Construction details====
The most characteristic element of the transfer tube pump is the so-called "S" transfer tube installed inside the feed hopper. The job of the transfer tube is to control the flow of high-density solids - in other words, the pump cylinder which is currently pushing the material is connected to the delivery line by such tube. At (or nearby) the end of each piston stroke the S-shaped tube which is connected to the delivery line is swung over to the other delivery cylinder with the aid of two switch cylinders. A hydraulic circuit is used for synchronizing the position of the transfer tube and the movements of the two delivery pistons.

The S tube should swing over rapidly and not suffer undue wear. This is effected with two large-sized plunger cylinders and a so-called spectacle plate (so named from its shape) including seal rings.

In cross section the S-tube is circular with a diameter which tapers in the direction of flow. This keeps the risk of clogging down. The sealing faces of the spectacle plate and of the seal ring lie parallel with the swivelling movement of the S-tube, so that they cannot be damaged when foreign bodies are cut through or get stuck.

This pump does not need check valves.

====Operating features====
Piston pumps with S-tube are suitable for concrete and mortar, for sludges with a solids content of up to 50% by weight and a fluctuating particle size distribution but also for conveying [[fly ash]], coal or minerals in a suspension.

The large cross section of the holes in the spectacle plate means that with a delivery cylinder diameter of e.g. {{Convert|200|mm|in|3|abbr=on}} it is possible to pump high-density solids with a mean grain size of as much as {{Convert|80|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}. The maximum diameter of individual foreign bodies may be as high as 60% of the diameter of the delivery line - in this example this would be {{Convert|120|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}.

===Type: Piston pump with seat valves (two-cylinder pump)===
[[File:Sitzventilpumpe Animation.ogg|thumb|300px|Operating principle of piston pump with seat valves]]

====Construction details====
The steel housing of the seat valve pump contains four hydraulically controlled seat valves, two suction and two delivery valves for the two hydraulic cylinders. The suction and discharge valves are synchronized with the hydraulics of the delivery pistons - this ensures that the contents of the delivery cylinder is equal at all times to the volume being pumped. Once the "sucking" piston reaches its end position, the corresponding suction or delivery valve is simultaneously closed or opened. If there is overpressure in the delivery line, the suction valve will close first. This prevents the pumped medium from being pushed out of the pressure line back into the hopper.

This pump does not need check valves.

====Operating features====
Seat valve pumps are suitable for an especially even pumping of media with a solids content of up to 50% and for the high-pressure pumping of paste-like industrial media such as sludges. Since valves are used in this two-cylinder pump it is suitable for grain sizes up to 8mm at most.

Which type of valve is selected will depend on the high-density solids to be conveyed. For materials containing grains with a solids content up to 50% a sharp-edged metal valve seat is required. With low-viscosity, rather watery fine sludges the choice would be a large-area elastomeric valve seal.

In one hydraulic control variant the valve is opened passively by the thrust of the medium. In this case the discharge valve has a non-return function which prevents flowback from the pressure line. At the same time the high-densitiy solids are precompacted to close to the line pressure before the discharge valve opens. This means that pipe knocking resulting from pressure pulsations can be avoided.

===Type: Ball-valve pump (two-cylinder pump)===

====Construction details====
During the suction stroke of the delivery piston the medium is sucked in via the open suction ball valve. At the same time the ball valve on the delivery line is pushed into the valve seating by the underpressure resulting from the suction (automatic valves). In parallel with this, the second delivery piston is making the pressure stroke and forces the medium through the discharge ball valve and into the delivery line. The suction ball valve is pushed into its seating by the delivery line pressure and thereby closes off the connection to pump intake.

====Operating features====
The two-cylinder ball valve pump is suitable for in the low to middle pressure range for pumping highly liquid to paste-like media provided these can be sucked in through the valve openings - for example mortars, mineral and sewage sludges.

The ball valve pump is to all intents and purposes insensitive to corrosive and abrasive media since the ball valves do not have to be opened or closed from the outside.

===Type: Single-cylinder piston pump===

====Construction details====
With a single-cylinder piston pump the medium is "stuffed" out of a feed chute into the delivery cylinder and by the cylinder into the delivery line on the forward stroke. Depending on the level of the delivery pressure in the pipe and on the flow properties of the medium, the delivery flange of the pump will be fitted with a flat slide valve or a lamellar non-return valve in order to prevent flowback of the material on the return stroke. Which delivery piston is actually selected will depend on the material which is to be pumped: Free flowing media call for perturbane sealing elements while bulky materials which have to be chopped up during pumping mean that hardened cutting edges are required.

====Operating features====
The single-cylinder pump is suitable for bulk materials with an awkward coarse composition - for example wood chips, organic waste, hazardous waste, or shredded paper. If such unsaturated material is to be conveyed over large distances, one possible approach is the hybrid feed system. Here compressed air is injected into the delivery line. It presses the plug of material into the pipe. As the compressed air expands the material being conveyed is loosened and separated. As distance increases from the air injection point, what was initially a series of plugs gradually turns into a continuous airborne stream. The amount of air required and the appropriate pipe diameter depend on the type and quantity of matter being conveyed.

===Type : Single-cylinder piston pump with an off-center three way rotary gate valve===
The said type of gate valve is having a rotating member inside a rotating valve chamber wherein the center of the valve chamber is off-set with the center line of the pumping cylinder and the pumping cylinder and the delivery pipe are on the same axis. Further the value of the off-set decides the thickness of the rotating member's sealing portion as it is provided a cut section equivalent to the diameter of the pumping cylinder. This invention eliminates the through hole design of the rotary valve and also introduces a replaceable cutting edge for the rotating member. Further this valve ensures that it displaces minimum concrete during its operation and ensures elimination of dead zones. Further the symmetrical design of the rotating member &amp; the valve chamber allow the end user to repair the valve by using conventional means of machining such as a normal lathe machine. This impossible with S-tube valve or rock valve. This valve has been invented by Amit and Anand Gokhale.&lt;ref&gt;http://ipindiaonline.gov.in/patentsearch/GrantedSearch/viewdoc.aspx?id=EaXBWM7XcHGElNLd7sM9BA%3d%3d&amp;loc=vsnutRQWHdTHa1EUofPtPQ%3d%3d&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts of high-density solids piston pumps==
Main parts are:
* feed hopper
* drive cylinder, delivery cylinder and hydraulic system
* seals
* electrical and control equipment
and - depending on the type:
* transfer tube
* valves
as well as peripheral components such as:
* bunker (with / without sliding frames)
* screw conveyors, pre-press equipment
* pipework
* air injection
* boundary layer injection
* systems for pressure (pulsation) damping

==Solids pump selection==
The special kind of medium "high-density solids" and the wide range of applications require different construction principles and hence pump types. Following table permits a pre-selection depending on the media characteristics:

==Applications==
The hydraulic pumping of solids with high solids contents offers a range of possibilities in process engineering. Oil-hydraulically powered two-cylinder piston pumps with S-transfer tube have already been used for many years in civil engineering for transporting concrete. This technology has been transferred to further areas of application in various sectors of industry.

===Sewage treatment plants===
Mechanically dewatered sewage sludge can be pumped directly into furnaces via a pipe network. This avoids direct contact with the sludges and prevents from contamination and odour emission.

===Waste management (Hazardous waste)===
Hazardous and highly flammable substances are processed physically, chemically and biologically in order to reduce the waste materials. With the advantage of pipeline conveyance, high density solids pumps commonly transport such material.

===Mining===
Real tunneling (in other words, not cut-and-cover) has increased palpably in recent years. Conveying [[mine water]], soil and tailings to the tunnel entrance is a need.

==Boundary conditions==

===Transport routes===
Various aspects have to be considered in the planning and processing of conveying installations. This includes the space requirements, the accessibility in case of maintenance or cleaning purposes, as well as horizontal or vertical transport route for material discharge.

===Environmental protection (Noise and odour reduction)===
Due to the nature of the material and the conveying method, odour nuisances is to be expected. Choosing the appropriate conveying method can reduce the environmental pollution

===Energy expenditure===
Three forces have to be overcome when conveying with high density solids pumps:

# The conveying distance (cf. Record held by [[Concrete pump]])
# Friction between material and pipeline, especially in bends and reduction joints.
# Inner frictional force caused by deformation of the material.
Calculation example:
* Conveyance suspension
* Delivery line of {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} diameter (DN200)
* High-density solids with mineral or carbon content as a mixture from coarse and fine grained material.

'''Pauper apprentices''' in [[England]] and [[Wales]] were the children of [[Pauperism|pauper]]s who were bound out by the local parish overseers and churchwardens. Some had to travel long distances to serve in the factories of the [[industrial revolution]], but the majority served their terms within a few miles of their homes.

'''''Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future''''' is a 2016 book by [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer [[Johan Norberg]] (a Senior Fellow of the libertarian [[Cato Institute]]), which promotes [[globalization]], [[free trade]] and the notion of [[Social progress|progress]]. In it, Norberg develops his ideas published previously in ''[[In Defense of Global Capitalism]]'' (2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/2016/09/13/looking-forward-to-the-future|title=Looking Forward to the Future|date=2016-09-13|newspaper=Reason.com|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The book is composed of ten chapters which discuss progress in various spheres of life, including "food, sanitation, life expectancy, poverty, violence, the environment, literacy, freedom, equality, the conditions of childhood".&lt;ref name=kirkus/&gt; Norberg argues that today humanity has reached its highest ever (so far) levels of [[living standards]].&lt;ref name=kirkus/&gt; The author notes that in all areas of our lives, people are, on average, healthier and wealthier than in the past.&lt;ref name=kirkus/&gt; For example, global [[literacy]] improved from about 20% to about 85% by the end of the century, and global [[average life expectancy]] has increased from 31 years in 1900 to 71 by the early 21st century.&lt;ref name=kirkus/&gt; People are more intelligent (the [[Flynn effect]]).&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; Access to modern sanitation tripled over the last thirty years.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; [[Famine]] went from being a universal phenomenon to being an exception affecting only a small fraction of the world.&lt;ref name=thetimes/&gt; Global violence, whether [[homicide]] or war casualties, is in decline.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; He also notes that most people tend be preoccupied with bad news, such as [[terrorism]], which is however much less common than in the past (just reported much more widely thanks to modern media).&lt;ref name=kirkus/&gt;&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;

The book's spirit is summed up by the author, who writes in an article about the book, "we’re living in a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Johan Norberg|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/08/why-cant-we-see-that-were-living-in-a-golden-age/|title=Why can’t we see that we’re living in a golden age?|date=2016-08-20|newspaper=The Spectator|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
The book received positive reviews from ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''.&lt;ref name=kirkus&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/johan-norberg/progress/|title=PROGRESS by Johan Norberg {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21706231-human-life-has-improved-many-ways-both-recently-according-swedish-economic|title=Better and better|date=2016-09-03|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thetimes&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/progress-ten-reasons-to-look-forward-to-the-future-by-johan-norberg-3t2kxf67c|title=Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future by Johan Norberg|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robbie Millen writing for ''The Times'' concludes that "Norberg has a strong case and he makes it with energy and charm".&lt;ref name=thetimes/&gt; ''The Economist''{{'}}s review ends with "This book is a blast of good sense",&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; while the ''Kirkus Reviews'' piece about the book describes it as "brightly written, upbeat... refreshingly rosy assessment of how far many of us have come from the days when life was uniformly nasty, brutish, and short".&lt;ref name=kirkus/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9432">'''SimulTrain''' is a [[Project Management Simulator]] used in [[project management]] training programs. SimulTrain is a simulation of the planning and execution phases of a medium-sized [[project]], that involves all of the events that occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-management-27448701 What Is Project Management?]&lt;/ref&gt;
SimulTrain is a computer-based multimedia tool which allows the participants to learn: 
* to structure a project; 
* to control the progress of a project; 
* to use project management tools.

==Overview==

[[Image: RACIQ_Chart_-_Responsibility_Assignment_Matrix.jpg |thumb| RACI Chart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/responsibility-assignment-matrix-raci-chart-explained What Is Responsibility Assignment Matrix RACI?]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first version of SimulTrain was released in 1996. This [[educational software]] has been constantly improved. The recent version includes an expert system that analyses the managers' behaviour and provides them with detailed feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. Using Business Simulation to Analyse Project Management Decision Making. Proceedings of 45th Conference of the International Simulation and Gaming Association. Dornbirn, Austria, 2014, page 213 - 318  http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/using-business-simulation-to-analyse-project-management-decision-making&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015 the 11th version of SimulTrain was released. It includes Resource Leveling exercise, RACI Matrix, and Risk Register.

[[File: SimulTrain12RiskRegister.JPG|thumb| The example of the Risk Register for a  project that includes 4 steps: Identify, Analyze, Plan Response, Monitor and Control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-risk-management What Is Risk Management?]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The project management simulation SimulTrain is based on Dr. Roland Sauter‘s PhD thesis ''La modélisation des facteurs humains dans la gestion de projets. (1996)''. A model of human factors in project management was validated by a survey of 900 project managers. In 1996 the simulator was developed based on this model.

The first version ran on Macintosh. Since then a new version with numerous new features was released regularly every two years. Version 9 released in October 2012 runs on various operating systems (Windows, Macintosh, Linux) and is available both as online version and desktop version.

By 2015 over 150,000 people across 50 countries, have been trained with SimulTrain. The simulation has been translated into 22 languages.

Resource Leveling exercise is a new feature added in 2013. This is an example of Resource leveling for a mid-size project.&lt;ref&gt;SimulTrain Resource Leveling https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcOD_ViGJYg&lt;/ref&gt; The chart shows the number of people involved in a project and its change with time. 
[[File:SimulTrainResourceLeveling.jpg|thumb|Resource Leveling optimizes histogram of resources usage on a project.]]

==Pedagogic concept==

Training is done in small groups of 4 people in two sessions of 3–4 hours each. Each group has one computer with the simulation program. The participants thus learn how to work and make decisions as a team. The simulator allows the group to work on the progress and execution of the project. It confronts the learners with many situations requiring the ability of making fast decisions and of taking all of the project parameters into account (costs, deadlines as well as human factors). The feedback and consequences of the different decisions are immediately made visible. The simulator involves multimedia technology: the participants receive many phone calls, e-mails and voice-mails, thus immersing them in surrounding them in a realistic project atmosphere.

The trainees have to complete the project within the deadline and budget. Their main tasks as project managers include: 
* setting up the project team, hiring employees with the proper qualifications at the right time 
* showing team members their tasks
* making adequate decisions when facing difficulties, overrunning the budget or failing to meet the deadline
* maintaining a good team dynamic

With the simulation attendees learn in two ways:
* from the reactions of the people involved in the project to the decisions made. (Feedback).
* from the potent interactions that develop in the four-person groups as each person plays a very precise role (such as supervising the schedule, costs, quality, and motivation).

SimulTrain's only requirement is a general knowledge about project management, including the [[Gantt chart]] and the Activity Network. Both online and desktop versions of the simulator are available.

==Scenarios==

===IT service deployment project===

In accordance with the marketing strategy defined at the beginning of the year, the management wishes to provide its customers with an on-line interactive service. This will allow customers to follow up and control orders without the intervention of either the customer service or accounting departments. For this project a tentative schedule has been written with the list of activities, budget and time required. The core-team has been established.

===Production project===

Plastoceram is the leading firm in manufacturing special packages made of composite materials. One of its clients that produces pacemakers cannot find any appropriate solution for the case of its latest ultra-miniature model. A case thus needs to be developed for this client within a very short time. It should be made of a resistant, very thin and easy-to-fashion material.

===Marketing project===

Your company has devised a new all-in-one Smartphone. This high performance appliance includes many innovative features, which makes it very attractive for listeners on the go and consumers who enjoy new technologies. The product conception is almost finished and its launch on the market must now be prepared. For this project tentative specifications have been written with the list of activities, budget and time required. The core-team has been established.

===Organizing a sport event===

The International Lausanne Football Tournament will gather some of the most important European youth football clubs. The National Federation is organizing the event for the first time. An organization specialized in sport events allocates all its resources to the event. The project "ILFT phase B" is a part of the preparation process. The preparation must be finished 2 weeks before the opening day. The core team and budget have been established. Other resources of the Federation are available for the project.

===Agile hybrid software development===

The management wishes to provide our customers with an online interactive service. This will allow customers to follow-up and control orders without the intervention of either the customer service or accounting departments. The customer representative is the Product owner. List of product backlog tasks, budget and time required have been defined. The scenario includes elements of waterfall planning and flexibility of the agile software development.

===Portfolio Management Simulation===

[[File: Net_Present_Value_vs_Payback_time_Portfolio_Management_Simulation.jpg|thumb| The example of the Net Present Value vs Payback Time and Strategic Value for a portfolio of projects.]]

SimulTrain&amp;reg;+ &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-portfolio-management What Is Project Portfolio Management?]&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of the project management simulation to Project Portfolio Management. With the serious game the trainees acquire such skills as prioritizing / balancing a portfolio of projects under resources, funding scarcity. The trainee use such key indicators as Strategic Value, Strategic Objectives, Net Present Value, Payback time, workload, risk, cash credit, and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10510">{{short description|Minimum requirements for a recreational diver to dive in open water under direct supervision }}
'''Supervised diver''' specifies the  and certification for recreational scuba divers in international standard ISO 24801-1 &lt;ref name=" ISO24801-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24801:-1:ed-2:v1:en|title=Recreational diving services — Requirements for the training of recreational scuba divers — Part 1: Level 1 — Supervised diver (ISO&amp;nbsp;24801-1) |publisher=[[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] |access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the equivalent European Standard EN 14153-1. Various diving organizations offer diving training that meets the requirements of the Supervised Diver. A diving certification which corresponds to the Supervised Diver allows for recreational diving under the direct supervision of a [[divemaster]] or recreational [[diving instructor]] in open water. Most diving organizations recommend not to exceed a diving depth of 10 to 12 metres . After the successful completion of a training equivalent to the Supervised diver, training can be extended to the [[Autonomous diver]] certification level (according to ISO 24801-2).

[[File:Scuba_education_levels.svg|thumb|upright=2.2|Scuba diving education levels as used by ISO, PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI]]
Before initial diver training and thereafter at regular intervals, a diver should undergo a [[fitness to dive]] examination by a diving doctor. In some countries, such an examination is required by law and is a prerequisite for any training in many diving schools.

In some parts of the world there is minimum requirement which corresponds to the Autonomous Diver certification and an in-date medical certificate for hiring diving equipment and taking part in recreational diving. In these places a certificate which only corresponds to the Supervised Diver is regarded as insufficient.

==Scope of the standard==
International standard ISO 24801-1 includes:&lt;ref name=" ISO24801-1" /&gt;
*Prerequisites for training, including age and health requirements,
*Required theoretical knowledge regarding scuba and basic diving equipment, the basic physics of diving, medical problems related to diving, the diving environment, scuba diver separation procedure, and the use of nitrox breathing gases,
*Required scuba skills in confined and open water,
*Practical training parameters,
*Evaluation of knowledge and practical skills.

==Training according to ISO 24801-1==
Every year around 1.7 million people are trained according to ISO 24801.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;945 000 annual certification by PADI {{cite web | url=http://www.padi.com/scuba/uploadedFiles/Scuba_--Do_not_use_this_folder_at_al/About_PADI/PADI_Statistics/2012%20WW%20Statistics.pdf | title=Worldwide Corporate Statistics 2013 - Data for 2007-2012 | publisher=PADI| date=February 2013 | access-date=2013-11-01| format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102033307/http://www.padi.com/scuba/uploadedFiles/Scuba_--Do_not_use_this_folder_at_al/About_PADI/PADI_Statistics/2012%20WW%20Statistics.pdf | archive-date=2013-11-02 }} with market share of 56%, {{cite web | url=http://www.divebuddy.com/blog/11295/2013-market-share-scuba-certification-agencies-padi-naui-ssi/ | title=2013 Market Share of Scuba Certification Agencies (PADI, NAUI, SSI) | publisher=DiveBuddy.com | date=2013-07-25 |author=Greg | access-date=2013-11-01}} gives a total of about 1.7 million.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the standardization, the dive courses of individual diving organizations differ considerably in their content, expansion and philosophy. However, the minimum requirements defined in the ISO standard guarantee that a diver can easily convert between training organizations.

The following certifications meet the requirements for Supervised Diver:

===CMAS===
[[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques]] (CMAS) itself does not offer any training which corresponds to the Supervised Diver.&lt;ref name="cmas-map"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cmas.org/sitemap/training-map | title=Training Map |publisher=[[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|CMAS]] International | access-date=2014-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some CMAS affiliates (e.g. VDST or IAC ) that offer such training and certification independently of CMAS. It is usually called Basic Diver or similar. However, the content, regulations and designations of the individual CMAS member organizations can vary considerably.

===NAUI Passport Diver===

The NAUI Passport Diver (PD) is not a diving certification, it is only an entry level experience opportunity for interested amateurs to try out recreational diving. In this course, all the contents required by the standard for the Supervised Diver are taught.&lt;ref name="NAUI-ISO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easydivers.ch/ueber_uns/zertifikat_iso_naui.pdf |title=Certificate | work=Nr. EUF - CB 2007 004 |publisher=European Underwater Federation (EUF) |access-date=2013-12-02 |format=PDF |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Passport Diver training includes two guided dives in limited open water, with a previous theoretical introduction. The Passport Diver experience does not include certification, but can be counted towards a NAUI Scuba Diver course (SD) within six months. The Passport Diver experience does not require prior experience of diving, but normal physical health and fitness are required. Persons who wish to participate in a Passport Diver offer must be at least 12 years old, but a NAUI Junior Passport Diver can be done at the age of eight.&lt;ref name="NAUI-PD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.meintauchplatz.de/naui/passport-diver/ | title=Tauchkurs NAUI Passport Diver | author=Markus vom Scheidt | publisher=meintauchplatz.de | access-date=2014-03-17 | language=de | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223063535/http://meintauchplatz.de/naui/passport-diver/ | archivedate=2013-02-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience for children differs only by a child-oriented presentation of the same contents.

===PADI Scuba Diver===
[[File:PADI-Ausbildungssystem.svg|thumb|upright=2.4|Overview of the PADI training system]]
PADI Scuba Diver (SD) is a basic diver training course where a diver can learn all the content required in the ISO standard for a Supervised Diver. PADI allows SD divers to dive to a depth of 12 meters, accompanied by a PADI [[Divemaster]] or [[Diving instructor|Instructor]] .

The PADI Scuba Diver course includes the first three lessons of the five-part [[Open Water Diver]] course (OWD). Due to the modular design, Open Water Diver training can be divided into two courses, of which the first is PADI Scuba Diver. The SD course includes three theory and three swimming pool lessons, and at least two dives in open water with the scuba. PADI follows the "dive today" philosophy - after a theory lesson, dives usually take place on the same day. The pool dives - which can also take place in calm, current free, shallow open water, provide the training in the basic and emergency skills, including getting into the water, breathing under water using the regulator, use of fins, basic buoyancy control, mask clearing and regulator recovery.&lt;ref name="OWD-Exler"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.exler.de/owdg.htm 
| title=PADI Open Water Diver Theorie}}, Wolfgang Exler&lt;/ref&gt; The same exercises are partly repeated in the open water dives.

PADI-SD training can be started without prior experience of diving. Normal physical health and fitness are required. Persons who wish to attend an SD course must be at least 15 years old, but a PADI Junior SD course (JSD) can be attended at the age of 10 years. The children's dive course differs only in a child-oriented mediation of the same contents.

===SSI Scuba Diver===
The SSI Scuba Diver (SD) is a basic diver certification equivalent to the Supervised Diver standard. The training shall include at least two open water dives, which may only be carried out after the successful completion of the theoretical training. SSI allows SD divers, accompanied by a [[Divemaster|dive guide]] or instructor, to dive to a maximum depth of 12 meters.&lt;ref name="SSI-Standards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.divessi.com/d/SSI%20Global%20Training%20Standards/2014%20Global%20Training%20Standards%20GERMAN%20(Version%20v102013).ssp | title=2014 Training &amp; Dive Center Standards | work=Scuba Schools International / v102813 | publisher=Concept Systems International GmbH | page=REC-8 | date=2013-10-28 | access-date=2014-02-25 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; After successful completion, training can be continued with Open Water Diver Training (OWD). The SSI SD course does not require previous experience of diving. Normal physical health and fitness are required and an SSI Medical Statement is issued. The learner must be able to swim 180 meters without an aid. Persons who wish to attend an SD course must be at least 15 years old, but SSI Junior SD training can be done at the age of 10 years.&lt;ref name="SSI-Standards" /&gt; The children's dive course differs only in a child-oriented mediation of the same contents.

===Other training agencies===
Some diving organizations dispense with a training level corresponding to the Supervised Diver and define the contents of the Autonomous Diver according to (ISO 24801-2) as the lowest level of training and breeding. In addition to the above, the following training corresponds to the Supervised Diver according to ISO 24801-1:&lt;ref name="Certified"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://certificates.austrian-standards.at/EUF_training_systems?5 |title=EUF Certified Training Systems/Training Organisations |publisher=European Underwater Federation (EUF) |access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vlade Divac''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Владе Дивац}}, {{IPA-sh|ʋlǎːde dǐːʋats|pron}}; born February 3, 1968) is a Serbian professional basketball executive and retired player, currently serving as the vice president of basketball operations and general manager of the [[Sacramento Kings]].&lt;ref name="divac-gm"/&gt;

Divac spent most of his career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). At {{nowrap|7 ft 1 in}}, he played [[center (basketball)|center]] and was known for his passing skills. He was among the first group of European basketball players to transfer to the NBA in the late 1980s and was named one of the [[50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleague.net/item/24016 |title=Experts decide European Club Basketball's 50 greatest contributors – 50 YEARS – Welcome to EUROLEAGUE BASKETBALL |publisher=Euroleague.net |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of seven players in NBA history to record 13,000 [[Point (basketball)|points]], 9,000 [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], 3,000 [[Assist (basketball)|assists]] and 1,500 blocked shots, along with [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Tim Duncan]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Pau Gasol]], and [[Hakeem Olajuwon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/divac_retires_051018.html |title=Vlade Divac Announces Retirement; Accepts Position With Lakers &amp;#124|publisher=Nba.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;The NBA did not record blocked shots before the 1973–74 season, so earlier players such as [[Bill Russell]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]] probably had similar career achievements.&lt;/ref&gt; Divac was also the first player born and trained outside the United States to play in over 1,000 games in the NBA. On August 20, 2010, he was inducted into the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his play in international competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halloffame.fiba.com/pages/eng/hof/news/p/newsid/42798/arti.html |title=FIBA announces 2010 Hall of Fame Class |publisher=[[FIBA]] |date=2010-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019073536/http://www.halloffame.fiba.com/pages/eng/hof/news/p/newsid/42798/arti.html |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from being noticed for his basketball abilities, Divac is also known as a humanitarian, helping children in his native country of Serbia, and in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/divac_youcantoo_070922.html |title=Divac Creates New Team With "You Can Too" Campaign |publisher=NBA.com |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, he was appointed as government adviser in Serbia for humanitarian issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=ap-divac-serbianadviser&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020220122/http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=ap-divac-serbianadviser&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |archivedate=October 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, he was elected President of the [[Serbian Olympic Committee]] for a 4-year term &lt;ref name="blicokserb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blic.rs/sport.php?id=80659 |title=Divac na čelu OKS naredne četiri godine |language=Serbian |date=2009-02-24 |publisher=Blic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227115052/http://www.blic.rs/sport.php?id=80659 |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-elected in November 2012.&lt;ref name=oks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.blic.rs/Ostali-sportovi/223132/Divac-ponovo-izabran-za-predsednika-Olimpijskog-komiteta-Srbije |title=Vlade Divac ponovo izabran za predsednika Olimpijskog komiteta |language=Serbian |trans-title=Vlade Divac re-elected for the President of the Olympic Committee|publisher=Beta |date= November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Divac received an honor from the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/kings/news/divac_hall_of_fame08.html |title=Kings News Full &amp;#124; The Official Site Of The Sacramento Kings |publisher=Nba.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club playing career==
Divac began playing basketball in his home town [[Prijepolje]] for the team KK Elan. He began his professional career in Yugoslavia playing for [[KK Sloga|Sloga]] from [[Kraljevo]], and was immediately noted for scoring 27 points against [[KK Crvena zvezda|Crvena zvezda]].&lt;ref name="vreme"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=512456 |title=Srbin broj jedan van Srbije |publisher=[[Vreme]] |date=2007-09-20 |author=Slobodan Georgijev |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KK Partizan===
In the summer of 1986, Divac was the top star of the basketball transfer season, and he ended up signing with [[KK Partizan|Partizan]] for [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]14,000.&lt;ref name="vreme" /&gt;

In the [[1986–87 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1986–87 Yugoslav First League season]], with players like Divac, [[Aleksandar Đorđević]], [[Žarko Paspalj]], [[Željko Obradović]], and with [[head coach|coach]] [[Duško Vujošević]] at the helm, Partizan had a "dream team", which won the [[Yugoslavian First Federal Basketball League|Yugoslavian League]] title. In the subsequent [[1987–88 FIBA European Champions Cup|1987–88 FIBA European Champions Cup season]] (now called EuroLeague), the club failed to reach the top of the [[EuroLeague]], after having lost to [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] in [[1988 EuroLeague Final Four|the semifinal in Ghent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.co.rs/partizan/eng/istorijat.php |title=Istorija: Novi "Dream Team" |publisher=[[KK Partizan|Partizan]] official website |accessdate=2007-09-24}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KK Split|Jugoplastika]], with [[Dino Rađa]] and [[Toni Kukoč]], was a stronger team in the subsequent three years, reigning both in Yugoslavia and in Europe.

Divac had an unusual style compared to most other [[center (basketball)|centers]] of his generation: despite his height, he possessed good mobility, had good control of the ball, and was a decent shooter. On occasion, he would also act as a [[point guard|play maker]]. His trademark moves included a mid-range shot at the top of the key and flip shots around the rim, while facing the complete opposite direction. His quirky moves complemented how he liked playing gags on the court: in the [[1989 EuroBasket]], he lifted teammate [[Zoran Radović]] for a [[slam dunk]]. In just four professional seasons in Europe, he became the most sought-after big man on the continent, after [[Arvydas Sabonis]].&lt;ref name="vreme" /&gt;

===Los Angeles Lakers===
Drafted into the NBA in [[1989 NBA draft|1989]] by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], Divac became one of the first European players to have an impact in the league. Under the mentorship of [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and [[Magic Johnson]], he improved his play and adapted to the American style of basketball. Though he spoke no English, he quickly became popular among his teammates and the public for his charm and joviality. In the 1989&amp;ndash;90 season, he was selected into the [[NBA All-Rookie Team]].&lt;ref name="vreme" /&gt;

Divac earned a reputation for [[flop (basketball)|flopping]], or deceiving the officials into calling a foul on the other team by purposely falling to the floor upon contact with an opposing player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/columnists/orl-nbainsider2807jan28,0,6686181.column?track=rss |title=Shutting down acting school? |author=Tim Povtak |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=2007-01-28 |accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran NBA forward [[P. J. Brown]] claimed that Divac might have been the best of all time at flopping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/0318nbaflop0318.html Flopping keeps cropping up], by Doug Haller, ''The Arizona Republic'', published March 18, 2007, retrieved April 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Divac freely admitted doing so, adding that he usually did it when he felt like the officials had missed some calls and owed him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BEST+ACTOR:+DIVAC+IN+%60FLOP+WARS+II'-a086219289 BEST ACTOR: DIVAC IN `FLOP WARS II'], by Kevin Modesti, Los Angeles ''Daily News'', published May 22, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the NBA instituted anti-flopping penalties in 2012, Divac expressed his support for such rules, stating that he felt players after him were "overdo[ing] it" with respect to flopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/kings/2015/03/10/vlade-divac-sacramento-front-office-vivek-ranadive-flopping-lakers-kobe-bryant/24666243/|title=Even Vlade Divac thinks flopping has gotten out of hand|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Thomsen, a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' columnist, grouped Divac with fellow international players [[Anderson Varejão]] and [[Manu Ginóbili]] as the players who "made [flopping] famous", exaggerating contact on the court in a manner analogous to [[diving (football)|diving]] in [[FIFA]] games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/ian_thomsen/09/28/nba-flopping-david-stern/ | title= NBA's new flopping policy the best response to a difficult problem | date= September 28, 2012 | first= Ian |last= Thomsen |work= [[Sports Illustrated]] | publisher= cnn.com| accessdate=2012-09-28| quote= The ugly trend of faking physical contact began in soccer, a sport in which gamesmanship has given way to players writhing in false agony around the world. Soccer has been unable to fix its problem, but now the NBA will have an opportunity to deter players from trying to simulate violent contact in ways made famous by Vlade Divac, Manu Ginobili and Anderson Varejao.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charlotte Hornets===
On July 1, 1996, Divac was traded to the [[Charlotte Hornets]] for the draft rights to [[Kobe Bryant]] and played two seasons there until signing with the Sacramento Kings in July 1998.

===Two games with KK Crvena zvezda===
During the [[1998–99 NBA lockout]], in January 1999, Divac played 2 games for Partizan's [[Eternal derby (Serbia)|eternal rival]] [[KK Crvena Zvezda]], in the [[1998–99 FIBA EuroLeague|1998–99 EuroLeague season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_KNce8jInH7Qj1EsyH5rjn2.compID_,Uz02qBnJiADOq5VntEf53.roundID_2570.season_1999.teamID_1490.playerID_2626.html |title=profile |publisher=Fibaeurope.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His debut for the ''crveno-beli'' took place mid-season, on [[Orthodox Christmas]], versus a heavily favoured [[BC Žalgiris|Žalgiris]] side led by [[Tyus Edney]], [[Mindaugas Žukauskas]], [[Saulius Štombergas]], and [[George Zidek|Jiří Zídek Jr.]]. Supported by a raucous home crowd and energized by Divac's arrival, as well as his 16 points and 8 rebounds, Crvena zvezda pulled off a 77-69 memorable upset win.&lt;ref name="mondo-feb-2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mondo.rs/a767526/Sport/Kosarka/Zvezda-Zalgiris-secanje-na-debi-Vlade-Divca.html|title=Prošli put protiv Žalgirisa za Zvezdu je igrao...|agency=mondo.rs|date=4 February 2015|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divac's brief stint with Crvena zvezda, for which he reportedly got paid US$250,000 per game,&lt;ref name="mondo-feb-2015"/&gt; immediately became a sore point with KK Partizan fans, who unfurled a banner calling him a traitor, at their club's next game.&lt;ref name="mondo-feb-2015"/&gt;

The issue of playing for the hated cross-town rival reignited several years later, when Divac returned to KK Partizan as club president. At the time, he stated his decision to play for Crvena zvezda was "a mistake".&lt;ref name="mondo-feb-2015"/&gt;

===Sacramento Kings===
He then signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Sacramento Kings]] where he played for six seasons alongside fellow countryman [[Peja Stojaković]]. Teamed with Stojaković, [[Hedo Türkoğlu]], [[Chris Webber]] and [[Mike Bibby]]; Divac revitalized the [[Sacramento Kings]] franchise. The Kings rose in the NBA ranks, becoming a perennial playoff contender and eventually a championship contender, leading the league in wins in [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/standings?season=2002&amp;group=league&amp;seasontype=2&amp;standType=standings |title=NBA Standings – 2001–2002 |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kings, however, could not get past the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], who beat them in a  [[2002 NBA Playoffs#Conference Finals|7-game series in 2002.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/ex-referee-tim-donaghy-blows-whistle-nba-dirty-secrets-article-1.293192|title=Ex-referee Tim Donaghy blows whistle on NBA dirty secrets|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to the Lakers===
After the [[2003–04 NBA season]], Divac became a [[free agent]]. He signed a deal to return to the Lakers, part of [[Mitch Kupchak]]'s plan to overhaul Laker basketball. The Lakers, following a defeat in the NBA Finals, had traded away or released most of their players, including [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Gary Payton]], [[Karl Malone]], [[Derek Fisher]], and more; Divac was supposed to help fill that void.

However, Divac suffered back problems and could not play most of the season, and even when he returned, could only play about nine minutes per game, averaging 2.3 points per game and 2.1 rebounds per game in 15 games, he played 8 games early in the season and 7 more in the final month of the season.

On 14 July 2005, 37-year-old Divac announced his retirement, ending his sixteen-year NBA and twenty-two-year professional basketball career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/divac_retires_051018.html|title=Vlade Divac Announces Retirement; Accepts Position With Lakers - THE OFFICIAL SITE OF THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divac accepted a position with the Lakers as a European liaison to help with scouting overseas.

===Retirement===
The Kings retired his No. 21 jersey in a ceremony on March 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090401/ap_on_sp_bk_ne/bkn_kings_divac_honored;_ylt=An5HUchghgZmP09wgS_FjaILMxIF Kings retire Divac's No. 21 Jersey]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Yahoo!

==National team==
[[File:Vlade Divac &amp; Drazen Petrovic in Argentina 1990.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Divac with [[Dražen Petrović]] in the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]] held in Argentina.]]

In summer 1986, at 18, right after signing for KK Partizan, Divac debuted for the senior [[Yugoslavia national basketball team]] at the [[1986 FIBA World Championship]] in Madrid, on invitation by the head coach [[Krešimir Ćosić]]. However, the excellent rookie's performance was spoiled by the event in the semi-finals against the [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]]. Forty-five seconds before the end, Yugoslavia had a comfortable lead of 9 points, but the Soviets scored two three-pointers within a few seconds and cut the difference to 3 points. Yugoslavia tried to hold the ball for the remaining time, opting to continue the play with throw-ins instead of free throws following fouls, but with only 14 seconds left, Divac committed a [[double dribble]], the Soviets were awarded the ball, and tied the score with another three-pointer. In the overtime, the Soviets easily prevailed against the shocked Yugoslavs, who had to be content with the bronze.&lt;ref name="vreme" /&gt;

The next year, Divac participated in the team that took the gold at the FIBA Junior World Championship (since split into separate [[FIBA Under-19 World Championship|under-19]] and [[FIBA Under-21 World Championship|under-21]] events) in [[Bormio]], Italy. That event launched the young generation of Yugoslavian basket ballers, also featuring stars like Rađa and Kukoč, regarded as likely the best in history. Before the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], they would also take the titles at [[EuroBasket 1989]] and the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]] in [[Argentina]],&lt;ref name="vreme" /&gt; where they were led by [[Dražen Petrović]],&lt;ref name="fiba1989"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_KNce8jInH7Qj1EsyH5rjn2.teamID_390.compID_qMRZdYCZI6EoANOrUf9le2.season_1989.roundID_938.html |title=Eurobasket 1989 |publisher=[[FIBA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[EuroBasket 1991]] title, with [[Aleksandar Đorđević]] at [[point guard]].&lt;ref name="fiba1991"&gt;{{cite web |
url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_KNce8jInH7Qj1EsyH5rjn2.teamID_390.compID_qMRZdYCZI6EoANOrUf9le2.season_1991.roundID_2263.html |title=Eurobasket 1991 |publisher=[[FIBA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yugoslavia 1990 basketball.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Divac (fourth from right, at centre) with the [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavia team]] that won the [[EuroBasket 1989]].]]
When Yugoslavia won the gold in the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]], fans rushed onto the court. One of them was holding a [[Croatia]]n flag, one of the six republics that made up Yugoslavia. Divac claims that he told the man that he should not be waving that flag, since this was a win for Yugoslavia. Divac claims the man made a derogatory remark about the Yugoslav flag, at which point Divac took his flag from him. This happened during a very tense time where nationalistic pride was threatening to tear Yugoslavia apart and ignite a war. The taking of the flag made Divac a hero to Serbs, and a villain to Croatians. Divac has stated that he did not mean it as an act against Croatia and he would have taken away a Serbian flag if a Serb fan had done the same.&lt;ref name=once&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/once-brothers,46215/| title=Once Brothers |publisher=A. V. club |author=Scott Tobias |date=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-vlade-divac-20101012 |title=Television review: Vlade Divac searches for closure in ESPN's 'Once Brothers' |publisher=LA Times |author=John Scheibe |date=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This action, along with the [[Yugoslav Wars]], alienated Divac from many of his former Croatian friends, particularly [[Dražen Petrović]], whom he considered his best friend.&lt;ref name=once/&gt; When Yugoslavia won [[EuroBasket 1995]], and [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatia]] won bronze, Croatia, still at [[War in Croatia|war with Serbs from Croatia]], walked off the podium during the medal ceremony. The teams had not faced each other in the tournament.

* One of only four basketball players born and trained in Europe ([[Peja Stojaković]], [[Dražen Petrović]] and [[Zydrunas Ilgauskas]] are the others) to have his number retired by an NBA team

==Administrative career==
Through the twilight of his playing career and afterwards, Divac focused on three fields: humanitarian work, sport management, and investment.

===KK Partizan president===
In late 2000, following the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milošević]] whose policies Divac had been openly critical of throughout mid-to-late 1990s,&lt;ref name="si-may1999-Rick Reilly"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1999/05/24/261148/vlade-divacs-private-war |title=Vlade Divac's Private War |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=1999-05-24 |author=[[Rick Reilly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divac and former teammate [[Predrag Danilović]] took over their former club [[KK Partizan]]. They did so on initiative by [[Ivica Dačić]], the club's outgoing president and, more importantly, a suddenly marginalized politician who, due to his association with Milošević, was forced to leave his post at the club. Seeing that various state-owned companies and community property were being taken over in a dubious manner during the power vacuum that resulted from régime change, Dačić saw it prudent to bring the club's two former greats as a safeguard against the same happening to KK Partizan. Divac became the club's president while Danilović took the vice-president role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/61059/Divac-savetuje-Dacica |title=Divac savetuje Dačića |work=[[Blic]] |date=2008-10-16 |author=Ž. Jevtić}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freshly retired from playing, Danilović was actually running the club's day-to-day operations since Divac was still very actively involved with the [[Sacramento Kings]] at the time. The head coach they inherited, [[Darko Russo]], finished out the 2000–01 season before they decided in summer 2001 to bring back their mentor [[Duško Vujošević]] to be the new head coach.

Though the duo never stated so outright, their additional motivation in getting involved with KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the [[National Assembly of Serbia|Serbian parliament]]. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, at least until the law appears. Divac and Danilović appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continued to be involved with it in a lesser capacity for a few years afterwards.

===LA Lakers scout===
In October 2005, right after ending his playing career with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], Divac got hired as the Lakers' European scout, reporting directly to the team's general manager [[Mitch Kupchak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2196445|title=Divac to serve as scout, liaison in Europe|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=19 October 2005|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the position in 2006.

===Real Madrid Baloncesto club management===
In June 2006, through his friendship with [[Predrag Mijatović]], Divac linked up with [[Ramón Calderón]] as part of the lawyer's candidate bid for the presidency of [[Real Madrid]] [[polideportivo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/06/05/actualidad/1149492115_850215.html|title=Calderón presenta su proyecto para el Real Madrid con Mijatovic como director deportivo|agency=''[[El País]]''|date=5 June 2006|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Calderón closely won the club elections on 2 July 2006, Divac was announced as the head of operations at [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]] basketball club though the scope of his job description soon got reduced to consulting duties as president Calderón's adviser for basketball and club's international coordinator.&lt;ref name="elmundo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2008/04/02/baloncesto/1207128247.html|title=El increíble caso de Vlade Divac|agency=''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''|date=4 April 2008|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/09/22/actualidad/1158909714_850215.html|title=Divac llega al Real Madrid como "asesor" y con el "gran reto de traer la NBA a Europa"|agency=''[[El País]]''|date=22 September 2006|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Divac's role in the club's day-to-day operations turned out to be largely symbolic, and he even admitted as much in a March 2007 interview for Croatian weekly ''[[Globus (weekly)|Globus]]'': "I literally do nothing and I only serve as part of the ''royal club'''s image. I only accepted the job because of Mijatović, who is currently the football director at Real".&lt;ref name="mondo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mondo.rs/a52680/Sport/Kosarka/Divac-Kandidovacu-se-za-predsednika-Srbije.html |title=Divac: Kandidovaću se za predsednika Srbije |publisher=MONDO web portal |language=Serbian |date=8 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2007, following a financial settlement between the two parties, Divac moved on from the post for which he had been reportedly receiving an annual compensation of [[€]]300,000.&lt;ref name="elmundo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/futbol/vlade-divac-cobro-300000-euros-por-no-hacer-nada-5822564|title=Vlade Divac cobró 300.000 euros por no hacer nada|agency=Sport.es|date=14 July 2008|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbian Deputy Prime Minister's adviser===
In October 2008, Divac's [[political consulting|political advisory]] engagement within the [[Cabinet of Mirko Cvetković|Serbian government]] as the sports, [[diaspora]], and humanitarian advisor to the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Internal Affairs Minister]] [[Ivica Dačić]], got announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=J.|first=Ž.|url=https://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/divac-dobija-kancelariju-u-vladi/gvxrmfk|title=Divac dobija kancelariju u Vladi|agency=''[[Blic]]''|date=17 October 2008|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/basketball/2008/10/16/vlade_divac_appointed_adviser_to_serbia.html|title=Vlade Divac appointed adviser to Serbia|agency=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=16 October 2008|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=Janis|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2008/10/16/divac-playing-new-role/|title=Divac playing new role|agency=''[[Orange County Register]]''|date=16 October 2008|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olympic Committee of Serbia president===
Divac was proposed in 2000 as Yugoslavia's candidate for the Sport Commission of the International Olympic Committee in spring 2000. This candidature was withdrawn under pressure from Milošević regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/arhiva_html/490/03.html|title=Apel "Vremena" H.A. Samaranu|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, Divac ran for presidency of the [[Olympic Committee of Serbia]] against incumbent president [[Ivan Ćurković]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blic.rs/sports.php?id=3867 |title=Curkovic backs Divac bid |publisher=[[Blic]] |date=2009-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215120515/http://www.blic.rs/sports.php?id=3867 |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the race after Ćurković withdrew just before the scheduled voting.&lt;ref name="blicokserb" /&gt; In November 2012, he was re-elected as the sole candidate; the end of his second mandate coincides with the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name=oks/&gt;

In December 2014, [[Kosovo]] was accepted as a full member of the [[International Olympic Committee]]. Divac and the Serbian Olympic Committee have been criticised, chiefly by the [[Democratic Party of Serbia]], for failing to take any effort to prevent that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/politika/dss-da-li-je-divac-pokusao-da-spreci-ulazak-kosova-u-mok_547452.html |title=DSS: Da li je Divac pokušao da spreči ulazak Kosova u MOK |publisher=Radio Television of Vojvodina |date=2014-12-14 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divac stated that he is not happy with the decision of the IOC, but could not have prevented it as it had already been made, and said he would accept it "in the interest of the athletes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/olympics-kosovo-idINKBN0JN10S20141209 |title=Kosovo earns Olympic recognition, Serbia furious |agency=Reuters |date=December 10, 2014 |author=Karolos Grohmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2017, he was succeeded by Serbian former basketball coach [[Božidar Maljković]] on position of the president of [[Olympic Committee of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.blic.rs/ostali-sportovi/bozidar-maljkovic-novi-predsednik-olimpijskog-komiteta-srbije/ws3p3fb Božidar Maljković novi predsednik Olimpijskog komiteta Srbije!]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacramento Kings front office===
====Initial advisory role====
In early March 2015, Divac was hired by the [[Sacramento Kings]] as their vice president of basketball and franchise operations.&lt;ref name="divac-kings-march2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/kings/2015/03/03/vlade-divac-sacramento-vice-president-basketball-franchise-operations-george-karl/24326819/ |title=Kings hire Vlade Divac as vice president, adviser |work=USA Today Sports |date=2015-03-03 |author=Adi Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brought into the organization by the principal owner [[Vivek Ranadivé]] towards the end of a turbulent [[2014–15 Sacramento Kings season|season]], Divac's arrival came in the wake of head coach [[Michael Malone (basketball)|Mike Malone]]'s firing and the eventual hiring of [[George Karl]]. Working alongside the team's general manager [[Pete D'Alessandro]], Divac's initial duties with the Kings were reported to be advising the front office and coaches as well as assisting with branding and fan outreach.&lt;ref name="divac-kings-march2015"/&gt; However, such broadly defined job responsibilities immediately led to press speculation about Divac's role within the organization that in addition to general manager D'Alessandro also featured assistant GM [[Mike Bratz]], special assistant to the GM [[Mitch Richmond]], director of player personnel and analytics [[Dean Oliver (statistician)|Dean Oliver]], adviser to the chairman [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]], as well as a head coach, Karl, who has always wanted to be involved in personnel issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziller|first=Tom|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/3/20/8263149/vivek-ranadive-kings-front-office-warriors-vlade-divac|title=The Kings are trying hard to be the Warriors and failing miserably|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month of Divac's hiring, [[ESPN]]'s [[Marc Stein (reporter)|Marc Stein]] reported that "despite the Kings not yet announcing their new power structure, Divac is indeed already regarded as the team's top basketball official by owner Ranadivé".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stein|first=Marc|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12644960/vlade-divac-emerges-sacramento-kings-lead-voice|title=Vlade Divac emerges as Kings' lead voice|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=8 April 2015|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 June 2015, two weeks before the NBA draft, general manager D'Alessandro left the Kings by accepting a front-office position with the Denver Nuggets amid reports he did so due to being stripped of his decision-making power after Ranadivé hired Divac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Jason|url=http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/kings-blog/article23669575.html|title=Kings general manager Pete D’Alessandro takes job with Nuggets|agency=''[[Sacramento Bee]]''|date=10 June 2015|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziller|first=Tom|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2015/6/11/8764711/sacramento-kings-front-office-vlade-divac-vivek-ranadive|title=The Kings front office is even messier than it appears|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only days before the draft, animosity between head coach Karl and the team's star center [[DeMarcus Cousins]] reignited, as Karl reportedly lobbied Divac, as well as multiple players on the Kings' roster, in order to make the case to owner Ranadive that Cousins needs to be traded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Adrian Wojnarowski|Wojnarowski]]|first=[[Adrian Wojnarowski|Adrian]]|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--george-karl-pushing-for-kings-to-trade-demarcus-cousins-051748948.html|title=Sources: George Karl pushing for Kings to trade DeMarcus Cousins|agency=[[Yahoo Sports]]|date=23 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, against the backdrop of Cousins calling Karl a "snake" on Twitter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zller|first=Tom|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/6/23/8830539/george-karl-snake-demarcus-cousins-history|title=A brief history of NBA stars calling George Karl a snake|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=23 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divac reportedly discussed multiple Cousins trade scenarios with various teams, but ultimately no deal got made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wojnarowski|first=Adrian|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--kings-talking-to-lakers-about-demarcus-cousins-trade--fielding-offers-from-other-teams-030157845.html|title=Sources: Kings talking to Lakers about DeMarcus Cousins trade, fielding offers from other teams|agency=[[Yahoo Sports]]|date=24 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2015 NBA draft]], with the 6th pick, the Kings selected 21-year-old center [[Willie Cauley-Stein]] out of [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. Less than a week following the draft, with the dissolution of the Karl—Cousins relationship on public display, the Kings' ultimately unsuccessful attempt at landing University of Kentucky head coach [[John Calipari]] to replace Karl got reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wojnarowski|first=Adrian|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--kings--john-calipari--kentucky-195614697.html|title=Sources: Kings probing John Calipari about coaching, front-office jobs|agency=[[Yahoo Sports]]|date=30 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in early July 2015, in an effort of clearing [[NBA salary cap|salary cap]] space in order to immediately go after [[free agent]]s, they agreed a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers, sending [[Nick Stauskas]], [[Carl Landry]], [[Jason Thompson (basketball)|Jason Thompson]] along with the Kings' future first round draft pick to the Sixers as well as the rights to swap first round picks in 2016 and 2017 while receiving the rights to Sixers oversees players [[Artūras Gudaitis]] and [[Luka Mitrović]] in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Dan|url=https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/07/01/76ers-get-nik-stauskas-in-salary-dump-trade-with-kings/|title=76ers get Nik Stauskas, first-rounder in salary-dump trade with Kings|agency=[[NBC Sports]]|date=1 July 2015|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, they agreed the acquisitions of two free agents: twenty-nine-year-old [[Marco Belinelli]] on a three-year US$19 million contract and twenty-nine-year-old point guard [[Rajon Rondo]] for one year for US$10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herbert|first=James|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rajon-rondo-kings-agree-to-1-year-10-million-deal/|title=Rajon Rondo, Kings agree to 1-year, $10 million deal
|agency=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=3 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by signing twenty-six-year-old center [[Kosta Koufos]] for four years and US$33 million with his role envisioned as backup for Cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Golliver|first=Ben|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/07/kosta-koufos-sacramento-kings-free-agency-grades-demarcus-cousins|title=Grade the deal: Kings cap strange summer by signing Kosta Koufos|agency=[[SI.com]]|date=7 July 2015|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the free agent signings done, Divac turned his attention to attempting to mend the relations between the team's head coach Karl and its star center Cousins ahead of the 2015-16 season, admitting publicly on 9 July 2015 on [[CBS Sports Radio]]'s ''[[The Jim Rome Show]]'' that the relationship between the two "isn't pretty right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=ESPN.com news services|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13229088/vlade-divac-sacramento-kings-george-karl-demarcus-cousins-union-not-pretty-right-now|title=Vlade Divac working to make Karl-Cousins relationship better|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, on 13 July 2015, during a [[2015 NBA Summer League]] game in [[Las Vegas]], the two shared an awkward on-camera handshake as Karl approached and Cousins reluctantly shook the coach's hand before turning away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=ESPN.com news services|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kings-coach-george-karl-demarcus-cousins-share-awkward/story?id=32439225|title=Kings coach George Karl, DeMarcus Cousins share awkward handshake|agency=[[Abcnews.go.com]]|date=14 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voisin-april-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last=Voisin|first=Ailene|url=https://www.sacbee.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/ailene-voisin/article74937347.html|title=George Karl reflective after firing by Kings|agency=''[[Sacramento Bee]]''|date=30 April 2016|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that week, Divac summoned Cousins and Karl to a private counseling session.&lt;ref name="voisin-april-2016"/&gt;

====Promotion to general manager====
Divac was promoted to the Kings' vice president of basketball operations and general manager on 31 August 2015.&lt;ref name="divac-gm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/kings/new/kings-announce-basketball-operations-update|title=Kings Announce Basketball Operations Update|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|date=August 31, 2015|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their final season in [[Sleep Train Arena]], the team's home since 1988, it was also their first 30 plus win campaign after seven consecutive seasons of fewer than 30 wins.

Early into the team's off-season, in mid April 2016, the Kings organization fired head coach George Karl, a decision made by Divac who had reportedly been pushing for it for months.&lt;ref name="Kings-fire-Karl"/&gt; Within three weeks, during which Divac interviewed head coaching candidates [[Sam Mitchell (basketball)|Sam Mitchell]], [[Vinny Del Negro]], [[Mike Woodson]], [[David Blatt]], [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]], [[Jeff Hornacek]], [[Nate McMillan]], [[Patrick Ewing]], [[Elston Turner]], and [[Corliss Williamson]],&lt;ref name="Joerger-hired"&gt;{{cite news|author=ESPN.com news services|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15494387/sacramento-kings-dave-joerger-agree-four-year-deal|title=Dave Joerger agrees to four-year deal to coach Kings|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=10 May 2016|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Kings hired [[Dave Joerger]] as their new head coach, signing him to a four-year deal worth [[US$]]16 million.&lt;ref name="Joerger-hired"/&gt; At the [[2016 NBA draft]], with the 8th pick, the Kings selected [[Marquese Chriss]] out of the [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|University of Washington]], but traded him to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for rights to [[Bogdan Bogdanović (basketball)|Bogdan Bogdanović]] as well as the Suns' 2016 draft 13th and 28th picks, [[Georgios Papagiannis]] and [[Skal Labissière]], respectively.

At the [[2017 NBA draft]], with the 5th pick, the Kings selected point guard [[De'Aaron Fox]] out of [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]].

==Investments==
Divac has been involved in many non-basketball endeavors while still actively playing in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and more so after he retired. He is an active restaurant investor in the [[Sacramento, California]] area. However, his attempts to make major investments in Serbia failed, for a variety of reasons.

The most notable affair was a highly publicized business venture—takeover bid of profitable beverage producer [[Knjaz Miloš]]. Divac's company "Apurna", in a joint venture with French dairy giant [[Danone]], ostensibly proposed the best bid, but the takeover was aborted by the Serbia's Securities Commission, because Danone/Apurna allegedly offered extra money to small shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cee-foodindustry.com/news/ng.asp?id=56547&amp;n=wh49&amp;c=%23emailcode |title=Knjaz Milos auction descends into chaos |publisher=CEE-foodindustry.com |date=2004-12-03 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |author=Chris Mercer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the repeated bid, Divac and Danone eventually withdrew and the sale went to [[FPP Balkan Ltd.]], a privatization fund from the [[Cayman Islands]]. The entire messy affair caused great friction within the [[Serbian government]], wide speculation about corruption, resignation of the Securities Commission chief, and even a police investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cee-foodindustry.com/news/ng.asp?id=56659-danone-pulls-out |title=Danone pulls out of Serbian soft drink bidding race |publisher=CEE-foodindustry.com |date=2004-12-08 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |author=Chris Mercer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar, though less spectacular, episode happened with 2005 Divac's attempt to take over the ''[[Večernje novosti]]'', a Serbian high-circulation daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Država preigrala Divca |url=http://www.nuns.org.yu/dosije/18/10.jsp |author=Vera Didanović |publisher=nuns.org |date=2006-01-03 |accessdate=2009-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228181340/http://www.nuns.org.yu/dosije/18/10.jsp |archivedate=2009-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made an agreement with small shareholders to take over the company by means of registering a new company with joint capital, which would increase the share capital. However, the Serbian Government intervened and halted what should have been a mere technical move.  While the attempted takeover was a "backdoor" one indeed, it was legal and similar cases had already occurred. The government ostensibly feared lack of control over the influential daily. Even though the [[Supreme Court of Serbia]] eventually ruled in Divac's favor, he withdrew from the contest, citing "friendly advice" by unnamed persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NBA ace Vlade Divac slam dunks the Serbian government |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2006/07/06/feature-02 |author=Georgi Mitev-Shantek |publisher=Southeast European Times |date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embittered, he decided to stop his attempts to invest in Serbia: "All of this is ugly and I'm very upset... I realized that there's no place for me in Serbia and my friends can meet me in Madrid from now on... In Serbia, some different rules are in effect, and I can't conceive them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnevnik.rs/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=12484 |title=Vukčević: Dijaspora će zapamtiti kako je prošao Divac |publisher=[[Dnevnik (Novi Sad)]] |language=Serbian |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |author=Lj. Malešević}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, that turned out not to be true, as in October 2007 Divac got legally registered as 100% owner of [[Voda Voda]], a [[bottled water]] brand previously owned by businessman [[Vojin Đorđević]]. That transaction was also followed by a stir of controversy, as Đorđević publicly accused Divac of deceit, asserting that he broke a [[gentlemen's agreement]] they had, and questioning the validity of the contract that Divac presented to the [[Serbian Business Registers Agency]]. The circumstances surrounding the deal (as of November 2007) are still unclear: Divac claims that he indeed loaned some money to the Đorđević's [[Si&amp;Si]] company, which was in financial troubles, and after Đorđević failed to fulfill his part of the deal, just used the contract, already properly signed by Đorđević, to claim ownership of the company.&lt;ref name="politika"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blic.co.rs/infocus.php?id=947 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416121130/http://www.blic.co.rs/infocus.php?id=947 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-16 |title='You are insulting me while you have debts' |date=2007-10-31 |publisher=[[Blic]] |accessdate=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b92voda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/business-article.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_id=45059 |title=Government to intervene in Voda Voda feud |date=2007-11-02 |publisher=[[B92]] |accessdate=2007-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107103443/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/business-article.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_id=45059 |archivedate=2007-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitarian work==
[[Image:Vlade Divac.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vlade Divac (rear, center) alongside Crown Prince [[Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia|Alexander II]] in 2005, at an event for [[World Heart Federation|World Heart Day]]]]
Divac is a humanitarian worker, focusing on aid to children worldwide and refugees in his home country. Along with six Serbian basketball teammates, Divac established the charity called [[Group Seven]], later renamed to "Divac's Children Foundation", and works closely with [[International Orthodox Christian Charities]] (IOCC), helping them to raise around US$500,000 for humanitarian assistance in Serbia since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://divac.com/aboutus.html |title=About us |publisher=Divac's Children Foundation |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divac's own foundation, presided by his wife Snežana, provided over $2,500,000 in humanitarian assistance through 1998–2007.&lt;ref name="nba"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/news/divac_youcantoo_070922.html |title=Divac Creates New Team With "You Can Too" Campaign |publisher=[[NBA.com]] |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007 Divac founded a humanitarian organization, "You Can Too" ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Можеш и ти/Možeš i ti''), bent on assisting the refugees in Serbia. Serbia has around 500,000 refugees from the 1990s [[Yugoslav wars]], making it the country with the largest refugee problem in Europe.&lt;ref name="nba" /&gt;  Around 7,800 of those people still live in collective centers under poor conditions, so the organization has vouched itself to buy abandoned countryside houses, in an attempt to finally solve their accommodation problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/sport/kosarka/kosarka.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=21&amp;nav_id=264626 |title=Divac za 7.850 izbeglica |publisher=[[B92]] |language=Serbian |date=2007-09-23 |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 21 to 23, 2007, Divac organized an official farewell from active basketball career in his hometown Prijepolje and Belgrade, simultaneously promoting the "You Can Too" campaign. The spectacle culminated in gathering of Divac and his worldwide friends in front of 10,000 people outside the [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/sport/kosarka/kosarka.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=23&amp;nav_id=264726 |title=Spektakularni oproštaj Divca |publisher=[[B92]] |language=Serbian |date=2007-09-23 |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the early 1990s, the song "Vlade Divac" by Belgrade band [[Deca Loših Muzičara]], devoted to his transfer to Lakers, was a big hit; the band finally got to personally meet Divac and perform the song with him on his farewell party in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arhiva.kurir-info.rs/Arhiva/2007/septembar/22/ST-06-22092007.shtml |title=Deca Loših Muzičara pevaju za Divca! |publisher=[[Kurir]] |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time with the Lakers, Divac's popularity and marketing potential, in addition to his entertaining and good-natured personality, were picked up on by the American TV industry. As a result, he appeared quite a few times on Los Angeles-based late night programmes such as ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. In 1990, he was featured in a commercial with Laker teammates [[A. C. Green]] and [[Mychal Thompson]] for the [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] brand razors company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTx6K3Irag |title=1990 – Schick – Vlade Divac, A.C. Green, Mychal Thompson |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in American [[sitcom]]s ''[[Married... with Children]]'' and ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'', as well as in the short lived ''[[Good Sports]]'' sitcom. On the big screen Divac took part in basketball-based movies ''[[Eddie (film)|Eddie]]'', ''[[Space Jam]]'' and ''[[Juwanna Mann]]''. Later in his career, he appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' in 1999 and ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' in 2002.

In Serbia, all throughout his playing career, Divac regularly appeared in commercials pitching products ranging from Atlas Beer to [[Société Générale Yugoslav Bank|Société Générale Bank]] mortgage credit plans. He appeared in a national TV commercial in the United States alongside former NBA star [[Darryl Dawkins]] for [[Taco Bell]].

Divac appeared as a special guest on [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|Eurovision 2008]]. He threw a ball into the audience, which marked the beginning of [[televoting]].

Divac features in the [[ESPN]] ''[[30 for 30]]'' documentary ''[[Once Brothers]]'', where he discusses the exploits of the [[Yugoslavia national basketball team]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s and how the Yugoslav Wars tore them apart, especially in context of his broken friendship with Croatian player [[Dražen Petrović]].&lt;ref name=once/&gt;

Divac appears in [[Boris Malagurski]]'s documentary film ''[[The Weight of Chains]]'', in which he talks about the 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].

==Personal life==
Divac and his wife, Snežana, have two sons, Luka and Matija, and an adopted daughter, Petra, whose biological parents were killed by [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] snipers during the [[Kosovo War]].&lt;ref name="si-may1999-Rick Reilly"/&gt;
