      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6859">In [[rugby union]], the '''"99" call''' was a policy of simultaneous retaliation by the [[British and Irish Lions|Lions]] during their [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa|1974 tour to South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Damian |last=Dolan |date=15 May 2009 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/international/jpr-williams-remembers-the-call-of-99-1676796.html |title= JPR Williams remembers the call of 99|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was marred by on-pitch violence, which the match officials did little to control and the relative absence of cameras compared to the modern game made citing and punishment after the fact unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |date=21 April 2009 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/extra/628655-lions-rampant-the-1974-south-africa-tour-and-that-amazing-punch-up |title=Lions rampant - The 1974 South Africa tour and that amazing punch-up |newspaper=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"According to the captain, Willie John McBride, the call was supposed to be '999'- for emergency - but he never had time to shout out the third '9'!"({{cite web| url=http://www.englandrugby.com/mm/Document/General/General/01/30/48/06/museum_britishlionspanels_English.pdf |title=‘A Pride of Lions’ Presented by Genesis Publications|publisher=[[Rugby Football Union]] [[World Rugby Museum|Rugby Museum]]|page=7 }}) }}

Lions' captain [[Willie John McBride]] therefore instigated a policy of "one in, all in" - that is, when one Lion retaliated, all other Lions were expected to join in the melee or hit the nearest [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]].&lt;ref name=Guardian-2006&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Doyle |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/smalltalk/story/0,,1888496,00.html |title=Small talk: JPR Williams |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] Unlimited |date=6 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120133505/http://sport.guardian.co.uk/smalltalk/story/0%2C%2C1888496%2C00.html |archivedate=20 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, the referee would be unable to identify any single instigator and so would be left with the choice of sending off all or none of the team. In this respect, the "99" call was extremely successful, as no Lions player was sent off during the tour.

According to former [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales international]] and Lion [[John Taylor (rugby union born 1945)|John Taylor]], the 99 call resulted from an incident that occurred during the Lions' [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa|1968 South Africa tour]] that saw [[John O'Shea (rugby player)|John O'Shea]] become the first and to date only Lion to have been sent off during a Lions tour. In 2013, Taylor recalled that during a Lions tour match against [[Falcons (rugby team)|Eastern Transvaal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/205863.html |title='We were charging round getting battered' |first=John |last=Taylor |authorlink=John Taylor (rugby union born 1945) |publisher=ESPN Scrum |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A scuffle broke out amongst the forwards (handbags – no damage) and Tess (O'Shea) was isolated by half a dozen home forwards. When the dust settled the home referee singled him out (the only Lion involved) and dismissed him. . . . Willie John rushed down from the stand to offer protection, dealing peremptorily with one idiot as he tried to attack Tess, and this was the genesis of the infamous '99' call six years later in 1974.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In mathematics, an '''adhesive category''' is a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] where [[Pushout (category theory)|pushout]]s of monomorphisms exist and work more or less as they do in the category of sets.  An example of an adhesive category is the category of directed multigraphs, or [[Quiver (mathematics)|quiver]]s, and the theory of adhesive categories is important in the theory of [[graph rewriting]].

More precisely, an adhesive category is one where any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

* ''C'' has all [[pullback]]s, it has pushouts along [[monomorphism]]s, and pushout squares of monomorphisms are also pullback squares and are stable under pullback.
* ''C'' has all pullbacks, it has pushouts along monomorphisms, and the latter are also (bicategorical) pushouts in the [[bicategory]] of [[Span (category theory)|span]]s in&amp;nbsp;''C''.

If ''C'' is small, we may equivalently say that ''C'' has all pullbacks, has pushouts along monomorphisms, and admits a full embedding into a [[Grothendieck topos]] preserving pullbacks and preserving pushouts of monomorphisms.

courts as well as the Supreme Court of the United States. He was a consultant to state and federal correctional agencies, appeared as an expert witness on numerous occasions and has edited or authored books and articles on human rights and corrections.'&lt;ref name="acluga" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Bronstein's Ukrainian-Polish Jewish family had moved to the United States to seek refuge from the pogroms. He was born in Brooklyn to Louis and Lillian (née Spielman) Bronstein, who both worked in sales. Bronstein attended [[Erasmus Hall High School]], then the [[City College of New York]] before graduating from [[New York Law School]] with an LL.B.&lt;ref name=bronbyrobnytobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Sam|title=Alvin Bronstein, Lawyer Who Fought Prison Abuse, Dies at 87|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/us/alvin-bronstein-lawyer-who-fought-prison-abuse-dies-at-87.html|accessdate=October 30, 2015|work=New York Times|date=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alvin J.

==Career==
He began his career working in the American South during the Civil Rights Movement, becoming the Chief Staff Counsel of the Lawyers’ Constitutional Defense Committee from 1964 to 1968 in Jackson, Mississippi.

He served as the director of the National Prison Project from 1972 until 1995. During this time, he argued three cases in the United States Supreme Court, [[Hudson v. McMillan]] (1992), Block v. Rutherford (1984) ([http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/468/576/]), and Montanye v. Haynes (1976) ([http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/427/236/]). After his departure from the National Prison Project, he has been a consultant for the ACLU. He also served as a board member of Penal Reform International (London) and a member of the Assembly of Delegates for the World Organization Against Torture (Geneva).&lt;ref name="acluga" /&gt; 

He had three children from his first marriage to Kate Ransohoff- Lisa Snitzer of Philadelphia, Susie Renner of Piedmont, Calif., and Laura Zatta of Lowell, Mass.; a daughter from his second marriage to Julie Bronstein- Sarah Bronstein of Berkeley, Calif. He is survived by his wife of 33 years, Jan Elvin. Their son, Benjamin Bronstein, lives in the District of Columbia. Bronstein also had seven grandchildren- Ian, Zoe, Sasha, Daniel, Ava, Corinna, and Sadie.

Bronstein died of Alzheimer's disease on October 24, 2015, in [[Centreville, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=bronbyrobnytobit/&gt;

The proponents arguing for anti-individualism in these areas have in common the view that what seems to be internal to the individual is to some degree dependent on the [[social environment]], thus self-knowledge, intentions, [[reason]]ing and [[Value theory|moral value]] may variously be seen as being determined by factors outside the person.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jessica: 2004, ''Anti-Individualism and Knowledge''.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and by other thinkers such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Tyler Burge]].&lt;ref name=burge/&gt;

== Overview ==
Academic discussion negotiating anti-individualism as a reasonable stance started with [[Tyler Burge]]'s 1988 ''Individuation and Self-Knowledge''&lt;ref name=Burge2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burge|first1=Tyler|title=Individuation and Self-Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=November 1988|volume=85|issue=11|pages=649–663|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1007312.files/Week%2013/burge%20individualism.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; being particularly influential. In it, Burge set out to argue for a limited agreement with the Cartesian model of self-cognition as being Authoritative, but also pointed out that knowledge of self-cognition was not always absolute, allowing for the individuation of thought to originate from both the external content of our environment as well as from the internal landscape of our self-knowledge as it is still being discovered: "One can know what one's mental events are and yet not know relevant general facts about the conditions for  individuating those events. It is simply not true that the cogito gives us knowledge of the individuation conditions of our thoughts which enables us to "shut off" their individuation conditions  from the physical environment".&lt;ref name=Burge2/&gt;

Michael McKinsey builds on this in 1991 discussing Burge's view in his paper ''Anti-Individualism and Privileged Access''&lt;ref name=Mckinsey/&gt; arguing that there is no [[Theory of justification|warrant]] to an [[Epistemology|epistemic]] narrow state of mind (i.e. privileged access) and that there is only a wide state of mind as influenced by the conditions of individuation of thought. Anthony Brueckner then questions McKinsey's take on Burge and McKinsey replies in his ''Accepting the Consequences of Anti-individualism''.&lt;ref name=McKinsey2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinsey|first1=Michael|title=Accepting the Consequences of Anti-individualism|journal=Analysis|date=April 1994|volume=54|issue=2|pages=124–128|url=https://www.academia.edu/8199013/Accepting_the_Consequences_of_Anti-Indiividualism|accessdate=26 December 2014|doi=10.2307/3328832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the essays found in Hilary Putnam's ''The Twin Earth Chronicles'' are considered early formative works for the anti-individualist model from the analytic perspective.&lt;ref name=Putnam&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilary|first1=Putnam|title=The Twin Earth Chronicles: Twenty Years of Reflection on Hilary Putnam's "The Meaning of 'Meaning'"|date=1 July 1996|publisher=M.E.

[[File:Arthur Stanley Eddington.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]]]

The '''Arrow of Time''', or '''Time's Arrow''', is the concept of the "one-way direction" or "asymmetry" of [[time]]. It was
developed in 1927 by the British astronomer [[Arthur Eddington]], and is an unsolved general [[physics]] question. This direction, according to Eddington, can be determined by studying the organization of [[Atom|atoms]], [[Molecule|molecules]], and bodies, and might be drawn upon a [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional]] relativistic map of the world (''"a solid block of paper"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The scientist as philosopher: philosophical consequences of great scientific discoveries
|first1=Friedel
|last1=Weinert
|publisher=Springer
|year=2005
|isbn=3-540-21374-0
|page=143
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-R4ANHu-csMC}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-R4ANHu-csMC&amp;pg=PA143 Chapter 4, p. 143]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical processes at the [[microscopic]] level are believed to be either entirely or mostly [[T-symmetry|time-symmetric]]: if the direction of time were to reverse, the theoretical statements that describe them would remain true. Yet at the [[macroscopic]] level it often appears that this is not the case: there is an obvious direction (or ''flow'') of time.

== Eddington ==
In the 1928 book ''The Nature of the Physical World'', which helped to popularize the concept, Eddington stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us draw an arrow arbitrarily.  If as we follow the arrow we find more and more of the random element in the state of the world, then the arrow is pointing towards the future; if the random element decreases the arrow points towards the past.  That is the only distinction known to [[physics]].  This follows at once if our fundamental contention is admitted that the introduction of randomness is the only thing which cannot be undone.  I shall use the phrase ‘time's arrow’ to express this one-way property of time which has no analogue in space.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eddington then gives three points to note about this arrow:

# It is vividly recognized by [[consciousness]].
# It is equally insisted on by our reasoning faculty, which tells us that a reversal of the arrow would render the external world nonsensical.
# It makes no appearance in physical science except in the study of organization of a number of individuals. (By which he means that it is only observed in entropy, a statistical mechanics phenomenon arising from a system.)

According to Eddington the arrow indicates the direction of progressive increase of the random element.  Following a lengthy argument upon the nature of [[thermodynamics]] he concludes that, so far as physics is concerned, time's arrow is a property of [[entropy]] alone.

== Overview ==
The symmetry of time ([[T-symmetry]]) can be understood by a simple analogy: if time were perfectly symmetrical, a video of real events would seem realistic whether played forwards or backwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isepp.org/Pages/01-02%20Pages/Albert.html David Albert on ''Time and Chance'']&lt;/ref&gt;  An obvious objection to this notion is [[gravity]]: things fall down, not up.  Yet a ball that is tossed up, slows to a stop, and falls into the hand is a case where recordings would look equally realistic  forwards and backwards.  The system is T-symmetrical, but while going "forward", [[kinetic energy]] is dissipated and entropy is increased.  Entropy may be one of the few processes that is [[Irreversibility|not time-reversible]].  According to the statistical notion of increasing entropy, the "arrow" of time is identified with a decrease of free energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Arrows ==

=== The thermodynamic arrow of time ===
{{Main article|Entropy (arrow of time)}}
The arrow of time is the "one-way direction" or "asymmetry" of time.  The thermodynamic arrow of time is provided by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which says that in an isolated system, entropy tends to increase with time.  Entropy can be thought of as a measure of microscopic disorder; thus the second law implies that time is asymmetrical with respect to the amount of order in an isolated system: as a system advances through time, it becomes more statistically disordered.  This asymmetry can be used empirically to distinguish between future and past, though measuring entropy does not accurately measure time.  Also, in an open system, entropy can decrease with time.

British physicist [[Brian Pippard|Sir Alfred Brian Pippard]] wrote, "There is thus no justification for the view, often glibly repeated, that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is only statistically true, in the sense that microscopic violations repeatedly occur, but never violations of any serious magnitude.  On the contrary, no evidence has ever been presented that the Second Law breaks down under any circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Pippard, Elements of Chemical Thermodynamics for Advanced Students of Physics (1966), p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are a number of paradoxes regarding [[second law of thermodynamics#Controversies|violation of the second law of thermodynamics]], one of them due to the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]].

This arrow of time seems to be related to all other arrows of time and arguably underlies some of them, with the exception of the [[#The particle physics (weak) arrow of time|weak arrow of time]].

[[Harold F. Blum|Harold Blum]]'s 1951 book ''Time's Arrow and Evolution''&lt;ref name="Blum1951"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum|first=Harold F.|authorlink=Harold F. Blum|title=Time's Arrow and Evolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmcNnwEACAAJ|edition=First|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; "explored the relationship between time's arrow (the second law of thermodynamics) and organic evolution."  This influential text explores "irreversibility and direction in evolution and order, [[negentropy]], and [[evolution]]."&lt;ref name=arrow-review&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103569900591?via=ihub | doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(69)90059-1 | title= Book review: Time's arrow and evolution: Third Edition  | journal = Icarus | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 278–279 | last = Morowitz | first = Harold J. | date = September 1969|bibcode = 1969Icar...11..278M | pmc = 2599115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blum argues that evolution followed specific patterns predetermined by the inorganic nature of the earth and its thermodynamic processes.&lt;ref name=yale&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2599115 | title= Book reviews: Time's Arrow and Evolution  | journal = [[Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine]] | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 164 | last = McN. | first = W. P. | date = November 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The cosmological arrow of time ===
{{See also|Entropy|Entropy (arrow of time)}}
The '''cosmological arrow of time''' points in the direction of the universe's expansion.  It may be linked to the thermodynamic arrow, with the universe heading towards a [[Heat death of the Universe|heat death]] ''(Big Chill)'' as the amount of usable energy becomes negligible.  Alternatively, it may be an artifact of our place in the universe's evolution (see the [[Anthropic bias]]), with this arrow reversing as gravity pulls everything back into a [[Big Crunch]].

If this arrow of time is related to the other arrows of time, then the future is ''by definition'' the direction towards which the universe becomes bigger.  Thus, the universe expands — rather than shrinks — by definition.

The thermodynamic arrow of time and the second law of thermodynamics are thought to be a consequence of the [[initial conditions]] in the early universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Susskind|first1=Leonard|title=Boltzmann and the Arrow of Time: A Recent Perspective|url=http://www.cornell.edu/video/leonard-susskind-1-boltzmann-and-the-arrow-of-time|website=Cornell University|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore they ultimately result from the cosmological set-up.

=== The radiative arrow of time ===
Waves, from [[radio waves]] to [[sound waves]] to those on a pond from throwing a stone, expand outward from their source, even though the [[wave equation]]s accommodate solutions of convergent waves as well as radiative ones. This arrow has been reversed in carefully worked experiments that created convergent waves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~fouque/fink.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231022842/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~fouque/fink.pdf |archive-date=31 December 2005 |dead-url=yes |title=Time-Reversed Acoustic |author=[[Mathias Fink]] |date=30 November 1999 |access-date=27 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so this arrow probably follows from the thermodynamic arrow in that meeting the conditions to produce a convergent wave requires more order than the conditions for a radiative wave.  Put differently, the probability for initial conditions that produce a convergent wave is much lower than the probability for initial conditions that produce a radiative wave.  In fact, normally a radiative wave increases entropy, while a convergent wave decreases it,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!-- ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nikolai Chernov |author2=Roberto Markarian |year=2006 |title=Chaotic Billiards |publisher=American Mathematical Soc. |page=207 |isbn=9780821840962}}&lt;/ref --&gt; making the latter contradictory to the second law of thermodynamics in usual circumstances.

=== The causal arrow of time ===
A [[causality|cause]] precedes its effect: the causal event occurs before the event it affects.  Birth, for example, follows a successful conception and not vice versa.  Thus causality is intimately bound up with time's arrow.

An [[epistemological]] problem with using causality as an arrow of time is that, as [[David Hume]] maintained, the causal relation per se cannot be perceived; one only perceives sequences of events.  Furthermore, it is surprisingly difficult to provide a clear explanation of what the terms cause and effect really mean, or to define the events to which they refer.  However, it does seem evident that dropping a cup of water is a cause while the cup subsequently shattering and spilling the water is the effect.

Physically speaking, the perception of cause and effect in the dropped cup example is a phenomenon of the [[thermodynamic]] arrow of time, a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Origins of Time Asymmetry'', chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Controlling the [[future]], or causing something to happen, creates [[Entropy (arrow of time)#Correlations|correlations]] between the doer and the effect,&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Origins of Time Asymmetry'', pp. 109–111.&lt;/ref&gt; and these can only be created as we move forwards in time, not backwards.

=== The particle physics (weak) arrow of time ===
{{Main article|CP violation}}
Certain subatomic interactions involving the [[weak nuclear force]] violate the conservation of both [[Parity (physics)|parity]] and [[charge conjugation]], but only very rarely.  An example is the [[kaon]] [[Particle decay|decay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/11/12/3&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[CPT symmetry|CPT Theorem]], this means they should also be time irreversible, and so establish an arrow of time.  Such processes should be responsible for [[Baryogenesis|matter creation]] in the early universe.

That the combination of parity and charge conjugation is broken so rarely means that this arrow only "barely" points in one direction, setting it apart from the other arrows whose direction is much more obvious.  This arrow had not been linked to any large scale temporal behaviour until the work of [[Joan Vaccaro]], who showed that T violation could be responsible for conservation laws and dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaccaro|first=Joan|date=2016|title=Quantum asymmetry between time and space|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|doi=10.1098/rspa.2015.0670|pmid=26997899|pmc=4786044|volume=472|pages=20150670|arxiv = 1502.04012 |bibcode = 2016RSPSA.47250670V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The quantum arrow of time ===
{{unsolved|physics|What links the quantum arrow of time to the thermodynamic arrow?}}
According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]], quantum evolution is governed by the [[Schrödinger equation]], which is time-symmetric, and by [[wave function collapse]], which is time irreversible.  As the mechanism of wave function collapse is [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|philosophically obscure]], it is not completely clear how this arrow links to the others. Despite the post-measurement state being entirely stochastic in formulations of quantum mechanics, a link to the thermodynamic arrow has been proposed, noting that the second law of thermodynamics amounts to an observation that nature shows a bias for collapsing wave functions into higher entropy states versus lower ones, and the claim that this is merely due to more possible states being high entropy runs afoul of [[Loschmidt's paradox]]. According to one physical view of [[wave function collapse]], the theory of [[quantum decoherence]], the quantum arrow of time is a consequence of the [[Entropy (arrow of time)|thermodynamic arrow of time]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[Relational quantum mechanics]] proposes that there is no such thing as an absolute wave function collapse, and that what an observer sees as wave function collapse is in fact the observer becoming entangled with the measured state. The thermodynamic arrow is an increase in entanglement over time; in this way, relational quantum mechanics relates the quantum arrow to the thermodynamic arrow.

=== The quantum source of time ===
Physicists say that [[quantum uncertainty]] gives rise to [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], the putative source of the arrow of time.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}  The idea that entanglement might explain the arrow of time was proposed by [[Seth Lloyd]] in the 1980s.  Lloyd argues that quantum uncertainty, and the way it spreads as particles become increasingly entangled, could replace human uncertainty in the old classical proofs as the true source of the arrow of time.  According to Lloyd; “The arrow of time is an arrow of increasing correlations.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/2014/04/quantum-theory-flow-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The psychological/perceptual arrow of time ===
{{Main article|Time perception}}

A related mental arrow arises because one has the sense that one's perception is a continuous movement from the known (past) to the unknown (future).  Anticipating the unknown forms the psychological future, which always seems to be something one is moving towards. However, like a projection in a mirror, it makes what is actually already a part of memory, such as desires, dreams, and hopes, seem ahead of the observer.

The association of "behind ⇔ past" and "ahead ⇔ future" is itself culturally determined.  For example, the [[Aymara language idiosyncrasies|Aymara language]] associates "ahead ⇔ past" and "behind ⇔ future".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmonitor.com/0606a/aymara.html ''For Andes tribe, it's back to the future''] &amp;mdash; accessed 2006-09-26&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the Chinese term for "the day after tomorrow" 後天 ("hòu tiān") literally means "after (or behind) day", whereas "the day before yesterday" 前天 ("qián tiān") is literally "preceding (or in front) day."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddict&amp;wdrst=0&amp;wdqb=day+before+yesterday mbdg.net Chinese-English Dictionary] &amp;mdash; accessed 2017-01-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "yesterday" and "tomorrow" both translate to the same word in Hindi:  कल ("kal"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bahri|first=Hardev|title=Learners' Hindi-English Dictionary|year=1989|publisher=Rajpal &amp; Sons|location=Delhi|isbn=81-7028-002-8|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "[one] day remote from today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexiadou|first=Artemis|title=Adverb placement : a case study in antisymmetric syntax|year=1997|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam [u.a.]|isbn=978-90-272-2739-3|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ambiguity is resolved by verb tense.  परसों ("parsoⁿ") is used for both "day before yesterday" and "day after tomorrow", or "two days from today".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hindi-english.org/index.php?input=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Hindi-English.org Hindi English Dictionary परसों] &amp;mdash; accessed 2017-01-11&lt;/ref&gt;  नरसों ("narsoⁿ") is used for "three days from today."&lt;ref&gt;[http://shabdkosh.raftaar.in/Meaning-of-%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82-in-English Shabdkosk.Raftaar.in Hindi English Dictionary नरसों] &amp;mdash; accessed 2017-01-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The other side of the psychological passage of time is in the realm of volition and action.  We plan and often execute actions intended to affect the course of events in the future.  From the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
&amp;nbsp; Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
&amp;nbsp; Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.
&lt;/poem&gt;
- [[Omar Khayyám]] (translation by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9615">'''Association'''&amp;nbsp;in psychology refers to a mental connection between concepts, events, or mental states that usually stems from specific experiences.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Klein, Stephen (2012).&amp;nbsp;''Learning: Principles and Applications''&amp;nbsp;(6 ed.). SAGE Publications. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-8734-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Associations are seen throughout several schools of thought in psychology including [[behaviorism]], [[associationism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[social psychology]], and [[structuralism]]. The idea stems from [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], especially with regard to the succession of memories, and it was carried on by philosophers such as [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and [[James Mill]].&lt;ref name="Boring"&gt;Boring, E. G. (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; It finds its place in modern psychology in such areas as [[memory]], [[learning]], and the study of neural pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E. E. &amp; Kosslyn, S. M. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learned associations==
[[Associative learning]] is when a subject creates a relationship between stimuli (auditory or visual) or behavior (auditory or visual) and the original stimulus (auditory or visual). The acquisition of associations is the basis for learning.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Psychology|last=Eich|first=Eric|last2=Forgas|first2=Joseph|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2003|isbn=|editor-last=Healy|editor-first=Alice|volume=4|location=New Jersey|pages=|chapter=Mood, Cognition, and Memory|editor-last2=Proctor|editor-first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning is seen in classical and operant conditioning.&amp;nbsp;

=== Law of Effect ===
[[Edward Thorndike]] did research in this area and developed the [[law of effect]], where associations between a stimulus and response are affected by the consequence of the response.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Psychology|last=Miller|first=Ralph|last2=Grace|first2=Randolph|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2003|isbn=|editor-last=Healy|editor-first=Alice|volume=4|location=New Jersey|pages=|chapter=Conditioning and Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, behaviors increase in strength and/or frequency when they have been followed by reward.&amp;nbsp;This occurs because of an association between the behavior and a&amp;nbsp;[[mental representation]]&amp;nbsp;of the reward (such as food). Conversely, receiving a negative consequence lowers the frequency of the behavior due to the negative association.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An example of this would be a rat in a cage with a bar lever. If pressing the lever results in a food pellet, the rat will learn to press the lever to receive food. If pressing the lever resulted in an electric shock on the floor of the cage, the rat would learn to avoid pressing the lever.

===Classical conditioning===
[[Classical conditioning]]&amp;nbsp;is an example of a learned association. The classical conditioning process consists of four elements: unconditioned stimulus (UCS), unconditioned response (UCR), conditioned stimulus (CS), and conditioned response (CR).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Without conditioning, there is already a relationship between the unconditioned stimulus and the unconditioned response. When a second stimulus is paired with the unconditioned stimulus, the response becomes associated with both stimuli. The secondary stimulus is known as the conditioned stimulus and elicits a conditioned response.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning: Principles and Applications|last=Klein|first=Stephen|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4129-8734-9|edition=6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of the response to the conditioned stimulus increases over the period of learning, as the CS becomes associated with UCS.&amp;nbsp;The strength of the response can diminish if CS is presented without UCS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;In his famous experiment, Pavlov used the unconditioned response of dogs salivating at the sight of food (UCS), and paired the sound of a bell (CS) with receiving food, and later the dog salivated (CR) to the bell alone, indicating that an association had been established between the bell and food.&lt;ref&gt;Timberlake, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shett"&gt;Shettleworth, S. J. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operant conditioning===
In&amp;nbsp;[[operant conditioning]],&amp;nbsp;behaviors are changed due to the experienced outcomes of those behaviors. Stimuli do not cause behavior, as in classical conditioning, but instead the associations are created between stimulus and consequence, as an extension by Thorndike on his Law of Effect.&lt;ref name="Shett" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning: Principles and Applications|last=Klein|first=Stephen|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4129-8734-9|edition=6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] was well known for his studies of reinforcers on behavior. His studies included the aspect of contingency, which refers to the connection between a specific action and the following consequence or reinforcement.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Skinner described three contingencies: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and punishment. Reinforcements create a positive association between the action and consequence in order to promote the continuation of the action. This is done in one of two ways, positive reinforcers introduce a rewarding stimulus, whereas negative reinforcers remove an aversive stimulus to make the environment less aversive. Punishments create a negative relationship between the action and the consequence so that the action does not continue.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Mood ===
[[John B. Watson|Watson]] introduced a white fluffy rabbit to an infant, and created a connection between the rabbit and a loud noise. This experience for [[Little Albert experiment|Little Albert]] associated a feeling of fear with the rabbit.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Psychology|last=Eich|first=Eric|last2=Forgas|first2=Joseph|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2003|isbn=|editor-last=Healy|editor-first=Alice|volume=4|location=New Jersey|pages=|chapter=Mood, Cognition, and Memory|editor-last2=Proctor|editor-first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory==
[[Memory]] seems to operate as a sequence of associations: concepts, words, and opinions are intertwined, so that stimuli such as a person’s face will call up the associated name.&lt;ref&gt;Watier &amp; Collin 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, Ivry &amp; Mangun, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the relationships between different items is fundamental to episodic memory, and damage to the hippocampal region of the brain has been found to hinder learning of associations between objects.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Bayley &amp; Squire, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing associations==
Associations in humans can be measured with the [[Implicit Association Test]], a psychological test which measures the implicit (subconscious) relation between two concepts. It has been used in investigations of subconscious racial bias. The test measures the associations between different ideas, such as race and crime. Reaction time is used to distinguish associations; faster reaction time is an indicator of a stronger association.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, McGhee &amp; Schwartz, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11987">{{short description|A biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is threatened with destruction}}
A '''biodiversity hotspot''' is a [[Biogeography|biogeographic region]] with significant levels of [[biodiversity]] that is threatened with destruction. For example forests are considered as biodiversity hotspots.The Status is designated by Conservation International. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsienvis.nic.in/Database/Biodiversity-Hotspots-in-India_20500.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.conservation.org/How/Pages/Hotspots.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norman Myers]] wrote about the concept in two articles in “The Environmentalist” (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. The Environmentalist 8 187-208 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; 1990&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. The Environmentalist 10 243-256 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; revised after thorough analysis by Myers and others “Hotspots: Earth’s Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecoregions”&lt;ref&gt;Russell A. Mittermeier, Norman Myers and Cristina Goettsch Mittermeier, ''Hotspots: Earth's Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecoregions,'' Conservation International, 2000 {{ISBN|978-968-6397-58-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a paper published in the journal ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="MyersMittermeier2000"/&gt;

To qualify as a biodiversity hotspot on Myers 2000 edition of the hotspot-map, a region must meet two strict criteria: it must contain at least 0.5% or 1,500 species of [[vascular plant]]s as [[Endemism|endemics]], and it has to have lost at least 70% of its primary vegetation.&lt;ref name="MyersMittermeier2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers|first1=Norman|last2=Mittermeier|first2=Russell A.|last3=Mittermeier|first3=Cristina G.|last4=da Fonseca|first4=Gustavo A.

==Hotspot conservation initiatives==
Only a small percentage of the total land area within biodiversity hotspots is now protected. Several international organizations are working in many ways to conserve biodiversity hotspots.
* [[Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund]] (CEPF) is a global program that provides funding and technical assistance to nongovernmental organizations and participation to protect the Earth's richest regions of plant and animal diversity including: biodiversity hotspots, high-biodiversity wilderness areas and important marine regions.
* The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] has derived a system called the "[[Global 200|Global 200 Ecoregions]]", the aim of which is to select priority Ecoregions for conservation within each of 14 terrestrial, 3 freshwater, and 4 marine habitat types. They are chosen for their species richness, endemism, taxonomic uniqueness, unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity. All biodiversity hotspots contain at least one Global 200 Ecoregion.
* [[Birdlife International]] has identified 218 “[[Endemic Bird Areas]]” (EBAs) each of which hold two or more bird species found nowhere else. Birdlife International has identified more than 11,000 Important Bird Areas&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808183125/http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html |date=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; all over the world.
* [[Plant life International]] coordinates several the world aiming to identify [[Important Plant Areas]].
* [[Alliance for Zero Extinction]] is an initiative of a large number of scientific organizations and conservation groups who co-operate to focus on the most threatened endemic species of the world. They have identified 595 sites, including a large number of Birdlife’ s Important Bird Areas.
* The [[National Geographic Society]] has prepared a world map&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/Documents/cihotspotmap.pdf |title=Conservation International |publisher=The Biodiversity Hotspots |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327075212/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/Documents/cihotspotmap.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the hotspots and ArcView shapefile and metadata for the Biodiversity Hotspots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/Documents/hotspots_revisited_2004.zip |title=Conservation International |publisher=The Biodiversity Hotspots |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320054336/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/Documents/hotspots_revisited_2004.zip |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including details of the individual endangered fauna in each hotspot, which is available from [[Conservation International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/resources/pages/maps.aspx |title=Resources |publisher=Biodiversityhotspots.org |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324024634/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/resources/pages/maps.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critiques of "Hotspots"'''

The high profile of the biodiversity hotspots approach has resulted in some criticism. Papers such as Kareiva &amp; Marvier (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Kareiva, P. and M. Marvier (2003) ''Conserving Biodiversity Coldspots'', [[American Scientist]], 91, 344-351.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} have argued that the biodiversity hotspots:
* Do not adequately represent other forms of species richness (e.g. total species richness or threatened species richness).
* Do not adequately represent taxa other than vascular plants (e.g. vertebrates, or fungi).
* Do not protect smaller scale richness hotspots.
* Do not make allowances for changing [[land use]] patterns. Hotspots represent regions that have experienced considerable habitat loss, but this does not mean they are experiencing ongoing habitat loss. On the other hand, regions that are relatively intact (e.g. the [[Amazon Basin]]) have experienced relatively little [[land loss]], but are currently losing habitat at tremendous rates.
* Do not protect [[ecosystem services]].
* Do not consider [[phylogenetic diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daru | first1 = Barnabas H. | last2 = van der Bank | first2 = Michelle | last3 = Davies | first3 = T. Jonathan | year = 2014 | title = Spatial incongruence among hotspots and complementary areas of tree diversity in southern Africa | url = | journal = [[Diversity and Distributions]] | volume = | issue = | page = | doi = 10.1111/ddi.12290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent series of papers has pointed out that biodiversity hotspots (and many other priority region sets) do not address the concept of cost.&lt;ref&gt;Possingham, H. and K. Wilson (2005) ''Turning up the heat on hotspots'', [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 436, 919-920.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of biodiversity hotspots is not simply to identify regions that are of high biodiversity value, but to prioritize conservation spending. The regions identified include some in the developed world (e.g. the [[California Floristic Province]]), alongside others in the developing world (e.g. [[Madagascar]]). The cost of land is likely to vary between these regions by an order of magnitude or more, but the biodiversity hotspot designations do not consider the conservation importance of this difference. However, the available resources for conservation also tend to vary in this way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7405">The '''Borussian myth''' or '''Borussian legend'''&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Michael (1992). ''Early Modern Germany, 1477-1806'', MacMillan Press and University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, p. xi. {{ISBN|0-8122-1427-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given by 20th-century historians of German history to the earlier idea that [[German unification]] was inevitable, and that it was [[Prussia]]'s destiny to accomplish it.  The Borussian myth is an example of a [[teleological]] argument.  ''Borussia'' is the Latin name for Prussia.

==Teleological arguments==
A teleological argument holds all things to be designed for, or directed toward, a specific final result.  That specific result gives events and actions, even retrospectively, an inherent purpose.  When applied to the historical process, an historical teleological argument posits the result as the inevitable trajectory of a specific set of events.  These events lead "inevitably," as [[Karl Marx]] or [[Friedrich Engels]] proposed, to a specific set of conditions or situations; the resolution of those lead to another, and so on.  This goal-oriented, 'teleological' notion of the historical process as a whole is present in a variety of arguments about the past: the "inevitability," for example, of the revolution of the proletariat and the [[Whig history|"Whiggish"]] narrative of past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment that culminated in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Butterfield]], ''The Whiggish Interpretation of History,'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinning the myth==

The narrative of the heroic past fell to such nationalist German historians as  [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] (1834–1896), [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903), and [[Heinrich von Sybel]] (1817–1895), to name three. Treitschke in particular viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, ''The peculiarities of German history: bourgeois society and politics in nineteenth-century Germany.'' Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-19-873057-6}} p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; These historical arguments can also be called the grand, or great, narratives but they are inherently [[ethnocentric]], at least when applied to the historical process.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  Treitschke's'' History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century'', published in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges the history of Prussia over the history of other German states, and it tells the story of the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this myth (''Borussia'' is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany's savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Friedrich, ''The other Prussia: royal Prussia, Poland and liberty, 1569–1772'', New York, 2000, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. This interpretation emphasizes Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of [[Napoleon]]'s power in 1814, at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], creating some semblance of economic unity through the ''[[Zollverein]]'' (German customs union), and uniting Germans under one proud flag after the defeat of France in the [[Franco Prussian War]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Many modern historians describe this myth, without subscribing to it: for example, Rudy Koshar, ''Germany's Transient Pasts: Preservation and the National Memory in the Twentieth Century.'' Chapel Hill, 1998; Hans Kohn. ''German history; some new German views.'' Boston, 1954; Thomas Nipperdey, ''Germany history from Napoleon to Bismarck.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deconstructing the myth==

After [[World War II]], various historians of Germany sought to re-examine the German past, in part to understand the immediate German past and the [[Holocaust]], and in part to understand Germany's supposed [[democratic deficit]]: Theoretically, Germans were inexperienced with democracy and self-government because their experience in unification came under the leadership of the least democratic of the German states (Prussia). This inevitably led to, first, [[World War I]], and second the failure of the [[Weimar Republic]], third, to the rise of [[National Socialism]], and fourth, to [[World War II]].

The Borussian myth was linked to the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' theory of Germany's ''peculiar road'' to modernity.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, ''Peculiarities of German History,'' p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  The set of circumstances that predated the Unification, for example, the so-called failure of the [[1848 revolution|1848 German revolutions]] and the elimination of [[German dualism|Austria]] as a possible leader in the unification process strengthen the myth's appeal.  In this way, teleological arguments tend to work backward from an event, to describe and rationalize all trends leading to it;&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  they are [[genealogy|genealogical]]&amp;mdash;trace from the present to the past&amp;mdash;rather than historical, which explores the past to the present.

In the 1970s, and later, as [[social history|social]] and [[cultural history|cultural]] historians examined nineteenth-century German history in greater depth, they realized that not only was there a vibrant and lively German culture without Prussia, but they also deconstructed significant elements of the ''Sonderweg'' theory as well.  They discovered, for example, that the 1848 Revolutions in Germany actually had some significant successes.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, Rhineland radicals: the democratic movement and the revolution of 1848–1849. Princeton, N.J., 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the history of 19th-century Germany was not a long process of grinding under the heel of Prussian militarism, but instead a process of economic expansion, testing of democratic institutions, the writing and testing of constitutions, and the creation of social insurance systems to maintain long term economic security.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn, ''The long nineteenth century: a history of Germany, 1780–1918.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507672-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carian alphabets''' are a number of regional scripts used to write the [[Carian language]] of western [[Anatolia]]. They consisted of some 30 [[alphabet]]ic letters, with several geographic variants in [[Caria]] and a homogeneous variant attested from the [[Nile]] delta, where [[Carians|Carian]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]] fought for the Egyptian pharaohs. They were written left-to-right in Caria (apart from the Carian–Lydian city of [[Tralleis]]) and right-to-left in Egypt. Carian was deciphered primarily through Egyptian–Carian bilingual tomb inscriptions, starting with John Ray in 1981; previously only a few sound values and the alphabetic nature of the script had been demonstrated. The readings of Ray and subsequent scholars were largely confirmed with a Carian–Greek bilingual inscription discovered in [[Kaunos]] in 1996, which for the first time verified personal names, but the identification of many letters remains provisional and debated, and a few are wholly unknown.

==Scripts==
There is a range of graphic variation between cities in Caria, some of which extreme enough to have separate Unicode characters.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the others, such as 𐅝, Λ, 𐤭, 𝈣, 𐅤, ʘ, Ϲ, 𝈋, 𐊑, Ш, Ϸ, have been filled in below with similar characters from other Unicode ranges.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaunos alphabet is thought to be complete. There may be other letters in Egyptian cities outside Memphis, but they need to be confirmed. The letters with identified values in the various cities are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Adiego 2007:207''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Carian scripts, which have a common origin, have long puzzled scholars. Most of the letters resemble letters of the Greek alphabet, but their sound values are generally unrelated to the values of the Greek letters. This is unusual among the [[alphabets of Asia Minor]], which generally approximate the Greek alphabet fairly well, both in sound and shape, apart from sounds which had no equivalent in Greek. However, the Carian sound values are not completely disconnected: &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊠&lt;/span&gt; /a/ (Greek Α), &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊫&lt;/span&gt; /o/ (Greek Ο), &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊰&lt;/span&gt; /s/ (Greek Ϻ [[san (letter)|san]]), and &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊲&lt;/span&gt; /u/ (Greek Υ) are as close to Greek as any Anatolian alphabet, and &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊷&lt;/span&gt;, which resembles Greek Β, has the similar sound /p/, which it shares with Greek-derived [[Lydian alphabet|Lydian]] &lt;span lang="xld"&gt;𐤡&lt;/span&gt;.

Adiego (2007) therefore suggests that the original Carian script was adopted from cursive Greek, and that it was later restructured, perhaps for monumental inscription, by imitating the form of the most graphically similar Greek print letters without considering their phonetic values. Thus a /t/, which in its cursive form may have had a curved top, was modeled after Greek ''qoppa'' (Ϙ) rather than its ancestral ''tau'' (Τ) to become &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊭&lt;/span&gt;. Carian /m/, from archaic Greek 𐌌, would have been simplified and was therefore closer in shape to Greek Ν than Μ when it was remodeled as &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊪&lt;/span&gt;. Indeed, many of the regional variants of Carian letters parallel Greek variants: &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊥 𐅝&lt;/span&gt; are common graphic variants of [[digamma]], &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊨 ʘ&lt;/span&gt; of [[theta]], &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊬 Λ&lt;/span&gt; of both [[gamma]] and [[lambda]], 𐌓 &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊯 𐌃&lt;/span&gt; of [[rho]], &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊵 𐊜&lt;/span&gt; of [[phi]], &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊴 𐊛&lt;/span&gt; of [[Chi (letter)|chi]], &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊲 V&lt;/span&gt; of [[upsilon]], and &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐋏 𐊺&lt;/span&gt; parallel Η 𐌇 [[eta]]. This could also explain why one of the rarest letters, &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊱&lt;/span&gt;, has the form of one of the most common Greek letters.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps coincidentally, &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊮&lt;/span&gt; /š/ resembles Ϸ ([[sho (letter)|sho]]), which was used for /š/ in the Greek-derived Bactrian alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no such proto-Carian cursive script is attested, so these etymologies are speculative.

Further developments occurred within each script; in Kaunos, for example, it would seem that &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊮&lt;/span&gt; /š/ and &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊭&lt;/span&gt; /t/ both came to resemble a Latin P, and so were distinguished with an extra line in one: &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐌓&lt;/span&gt; /t/, &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊯&lt;/span&gt; /š/.

Numerous attempts at deciphering the Carian inscriptions were made during the 20th century. After World War II, most of the known Carian inscriptions were collected and published, which provided good basis for decipherment.

In the 1960s the Russian researcher [[Vitaly Shevoroshkin]] showed that earlier assumptions that the script was a [[Syllabary|syllabic]] or [[Semi-syllabary|semisyllabic]] writing system was false. He devoted many years to his study, and used proper methodology. He made it clear that Carian was indeed alphabetically written, but made few significant advances in the understanding of the language. He took the values of letters resembling those of the [[Greek alphabet]] for granted, which proved to be unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio-Javier Adiego Lajara, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=alQqw2IxJO0C&amp;pg=PA179 ''The Carian Language''.] Volume 86 of Handbook of Oriental Studies. BRILL, 2006 {{ISBN|9004152814}} p179ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers of Carian were H. Stoltenberg, O. Masson, [[Yuri Otkupshchikov]], P. Meriggi (1966), and R. Gusmani (1975), but their work was not widely accepted.

Stoltenberg, like Shevoroshkin, and most others, generally attributed Greek values to Carian symbols.&lt;ref&gt;
Stoltenberg, H. L. (1958a) “Neue Lesung der karischen Schrift”, Die Sprache 4, 139–151&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, an Egyptologist K. Zauzich investigated bilingual texts in Carian and Egyptian (what became known as 'Egyptian approach'). This was an important step in decipherment, that produced good results.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio-Javier Adiego Lajara, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=alQqw2IxJO0C&amp;pg=PA187 ''The Carian Language''.] Volume 86 of Handbook of Oriental Studies. BRILL, 2006 {{ISBN|9004152814}} p187ff&lt;/ref&gt;

This method was further developed by T. Kowalski in 1975, which was his only publication on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;THOMAS W. KOWALSKI (1975), [http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/kadm.1975.14.issue-1/kadm.1975.14.1.73/kadm.1975.14.1.73.xml LETTRES CARIENNES: ESSAI DE DECHIFFREMENT DE L’ECRITURE CARIENNE] Kadmos. Volume 14, Issue 1, Pages 73–93, DOI 10.1515/kadm.1975.14.1.73&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Egyptologist [[John D. Ray]] apparently worked independently from Kowalski; nevertheless he produced similar results (1981, 1983). He used Carian–Egyptian [[bilingual inscription]]s that had been neglected until then. His big breakthrough was the reading of the name [[Psammetichus (disambiguation)|Psammetichus]] (Egyptian Pharaoh) in Carian.

The radically different values that Ray assigned to the letters initially met with scepticism. [[Ignasi-Xavier Adiego]], along with [[Diether Schürr]], started to contribute to the project in the early 1990s. In his 1993 book ''Studia Carica'', Adiego offered the decipherment values for letters that are now known as the ‘Ray-Schürr-Adiego system’. This system now gained wider acceptance. The discovery of a new [[bilingual inscription]] in 1996 (the [[Kaunos]] Carian-Greek bilingual inscription) confirmed the essential validity of their decipherment.

{{Conservation status}}
 
The '''conservation status''' of a [[taxon|group of organisms]] (for instance, a [[species]]) indicates whether the group still exists and how likely the group is to become [[Extinction|extinct]] in the near future. Many factors are taken into account when assessing conservation status: not simply the number of individuals remaining, but the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, and known threats.  Various systems of conservation status exist and are in use at international, multi-country, national and local levels as well as for consumer use.

==International systems==
===IUCN Red List of Threatened Species===
The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Species are classified by the IUCN Red List into nine groups set through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/categories-and-criteria Categories and Criteria] The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Retrieved 18 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IUCN. (2012) [http://jr.iucnredlist.org/documents/redlist_cats_crit_en.pdf ''IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria: Version 3.1''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128190606/http://jr.iucnredlist.org/documents/redlist_cats_crit_en.pdf |date=2016-01-28 }} Second edition. Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK. {{ISBN|9782831714356}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also included are species that have gone extinct since 500 AD.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} When discussing the IUCN Red List, the official term "[[Threatened species|threatened]]" is a grouping of three categories: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable.

* [[Extinction|Extinct]] (EX) – No known living individuals
* [[Extinct in the wild]] (EW) – Known only to survive in captivity, or as a naturalized population outside its historic range
* [[Critically endangered]] (CR) – Extremely high risk of extinction in the wild
* [[Endangered species|Endangered]] (EN) – High risk of extinction in the wild
* [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] (VU) – High risk of endangerment in the wild
* [[Near threatened]] (NT) – Likely to become endangered in the near future
* [[Least concern]] (LC) – Lowest risk; does not qualify for a higher risk category. Widespread and abundant [[taxa]] are included in this category.
* [[Data deficient]] (DD) – Not enough data to make an assessment of its risk of extinction
* [[Not evaluated]] (NE) – Has not yet been evaluated against the criteria.

===The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora===
[[CITES|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)]] aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Many countries require CITES permits when importing plants and animals listed on CITES.

==Multi-country systems==
In the [[European Union]] (EU), the Birds and Habitats Directives are the legal instruments that evaluate the conservation status within the EU of species and habitats.

[[NatureServe conservation status]] focuses on [[Latin America]], United States, Canada, and the [[Caribbean]]. It has been developed by scientists from [[NatureServe]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], and the network of natural heritage programs and data centers. It is increasingly integrated with the IUCN Red List system. Its categories for species include: ''presumed extinct'' (GX), ''possibly extinct'' (GH), ''critically imperiled'' (G1), ''imperiled'' (G2), ''vulnerable'' (G3), ''apparently secure'' (G4), and ''secure'' (G5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura/Lnsstatus.htm |title=InfoNatura: About the Data: Conservation Status |website=NatureServe.org |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system also allows ambiguous or uncertain ranks including ''inexact numeric ranks'' (e.g. G2?), and ''range ranks'' (e.g. G2G3) for when the exact rank is uncertain. NatureServe adds a qualifier for ''captive or cultivated only'' (C), which has a similar meaning to the IUCN Red List ''extinct in the wild'' (EW) status.

The [[Red Data Book of the Russian Federation]] is used within the Russian Federation, and also accepted in parts of Africa.

==National systems==
In Australia, the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]'' (EPBC Act) describes lists of threatened species, ecological communities and threatening processes. The categories resemble those of the 1994 [[IUCN Red List]] Categories &amp; Criteria (version 2.3). Prior to the EPBC Act, a simpler classification system was used by the ''Endangered Species Protection Act 1992''. Some state and territory governments also have their own systems for conservation status.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In Belgium, the Flemish [[Research Institute for Nature and Forest]] publishes an online set of more than 150 nature indicators in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inbo.be/content/homepage_en.asp |title=Research Institute for Nature and Forest |website=Inbo.be |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] (COSEWIC) is a group of experts that assesses and designates which wild species are in some danger of disappearing from Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosepac.gc.ca/eng/sct5/index_e.cfm |title=Cosewic |publisher=Government of Canada, Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada |accessdate=2013-07-22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA), it is up to the federal government, which is politically accountable, to legally protect species assessed by COSEWIC.

In China, the State, provinces and some counties have determined their key protected wildlife species. There is the China red data book.

In [[Finland]], a large number of species are protected under the Nature Conservation Act, and through the [[EU Habitats Directive]] and EU Birds Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?node=6053&amp;lan=en |title=Protecting species |website=Ymparisto.fi |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[Federal Agency for Nature Conservation]] publishes "red lists of endangered species".

India has the [[Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, Amended 2003]] and the [[Biological Diversity Act, 2002]].

In Japan, the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of Environment]] publishes a Threatened Wildlife of Japan Red Data Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodic.go.jp/english/rdb/rdb_e.html |title=Threatened Species |website=Biodic.go.jp |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], the Dutch [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality]] publishes a list of threatened species, and conservation is enforced by the Nature Conservation Act 1998. Species are also protected through the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives.

In New Zealand, the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] publishes the [[New Zealand Threat Classification System]] lists.  {{As of|2008|January}} threatened species or subspecies are assigned one of seven categories: Nationally Critical, Nationally Endangered, Nationally Vulnerable, Declining, Recovering, Relict, or Naturally Uncommon.&lt;ref name="NZTCS08"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Townsend|first1=Andrew J.|last2=de Lange|first2=Peter J.|last3=Duffy|first3=Clinton A.J.|last4=Miskelly|first4=Colin M.|last5=Molloy|first5=Janice|last6=Norton|first6=David A.|title=New Zealand Threat Classification System manual|date=January 2008|publisher=Science &amp; Technical Publishing Department of Conservation|location=Wellington, New Zealand|isbn=9780478143645|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/science-and-technical/sap244.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2018|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the classification looks only at a national level, many species are unique to New Zealand, and species which are secure overseas are noted as such.

In Russia, the Red Book of Russian Federation came out in 2001, it contains categories defining preservation status for different species. In it there are 8 taxa of amphibians, 21 taxa of reptiles, 128 taxa of birds, and 74 taxa of mammals, in total 231. There are also more than 30 regional red books, for example the red book of the Altaic region which came out in 1994.

In [[South Africa]], The South African National Biodiversity Institute, established under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/gazette/acts/2004/a10-04.pdf|title=Welcome to the official South African government online site! - South African Government|website=Info.gov.za|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for drawing up lists of affected species, and monitoring compliance with CITES decisions. It is envisaged that previously diverse Red lists would be more easily kept current, both technically and financially.

In [[Thailand]], the Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act of BE 2535 defines fifteen [[Reserved animals of Thailand|reserved animal]] species and two classes of protected species, of which hunting, breeding, possession, and trade are prohibited or restricted by law. The National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Thailand)|Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment]] is responsible for the regulation of these activities.

In [[Ukraine]], the Ministry of Environment Protection maintains list of endangered species (divided into seven categories from "0" - extinct to "VI" - rehabilitated) and publishes it in the Red Book of Ukraine.

In the [[United States of America]], the [[Endangered Species Act]] created the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species|Endangered Species List]].

==Consumer guides==
{{Main article|Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification}}

Some consumer guides for [[seafood]], such as [[Seafood Watch]], divide fish and other sea creatures into three categories, analogous to conservation status categories:
* Red ("''say no''" or "''avoid''")
* Yellow or orange ("''think twice''", "''good alternatives''" or "''some concerns''")
* Green ("''best seafood choices''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_recommendations.aspx | title=Seafood Recommendations: Our Seafood Ratings|website=Seafoodwatch.org | accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The categories do not simply reflect the imperilment of individual species, but also consider the environmental impacts of how and where they are fished, such as through [[bycatch]] or [[ocean bottom trawlers]]. Often groups of species are assessed rather than individual species (e.g. [[squid]], [[prawn]]s).

The [[Marine Conservation Society]] has five levels of ratings for seafood species, as displayed on their ''FishOnline'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fishonline.org/ratings | title=Fish ratings | work=FishOnline | publisher=Marine Conservation Society | accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention on Biological Diversity''' ('''CBD'''), known informally as the '''Biodiversity Convention''', is a [[multilateral treaty]]. The Convention has three main goals including: the conservation of biological diversity (or [[biodiversity]]); the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from [[Germplasm|genetic resource]]s.

In other words, its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. It is often seen as the key document regarding [[sustainable development]]. The Convention was opened for signature at the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993. At the 2010 10th Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October in [[Nagoya]], Japan, the Nagoya Protocol was adopted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.cbd.int/cop10/ Welcome to COP 10&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and scope==

The notion of an international convention on bio-diversity was conceived at a [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in November 1988. The subsequent year, the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts was established for the drafting of a legal text which addressed the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization with sovereign states and local communities.
In 1991, an intergovernmental negotiating committee was established, tasked with finalizing the convention's text.&lt;ref name="CBDweb01"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/history/|title=History of the Convention|work=Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD)|accessdate= 14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992, and its conclusions were distilled in the [[Nairobi Final Act]].&lt;ref name="nairAct"&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/doc/handbook/cbd-hb-09-en.pdf Nairobi Final Act of the Conference for the adoption of the agreed text of the Convention on Biological Diversity], Heinrich, M. (2002). Handbook of the Convention on Biological Diversity: Edited by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Earthscan, London, 2001. {{ISBN|9781853837371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention's text was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio "Earth Summit"). By its closing date, 4 June 1993, the convention had received 168 signatures. It entered into force on 29 December 1993.&lt;ref name="CBDweb01" /&gt;

The convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biodiversity is "a common concern of humankind" and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all [[ecosystem]]s, [[species]], and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;Louafi, Sélim and Jean-Frédéric Morin, International governance of biodiversity: Involving all the users of genetic resources, IDDRI, 2004, https://www.academia.edu/3809935/Louafi_S._and_J-F_Morin_2004_International_Governance_of_biodiversity_Involving_all_the_Users_of_Genetic_Resources_Les_synth%C3%A8ses_de_lIddri_n_5._4_p&lt;/ref&gt; It also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], addressing technology development and transfer, benefit-sharing and [[biosafety]] issues. Importantly, the Convention is legally binding; countries that join it ('Parties') are obliged to implement its provisions.

The convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of [[sustainable use]]. While past [[conservation biology|conservation]] efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats, the Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.

The convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the [[precautionary principle]] which demands that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve [[biodiversity|biological diversity]]. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.

The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 banned some forms of [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].

==Issues==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

Some of the many issues dealt with under the convention include:

* Measures the incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.
* Regulated access to genetic resources and [[traditional knowledge]], including Prior Informed Consent of the party providing resources.
* Sharing, in a fair and equitable way, the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of [[Genetics|genetic]] resources with the Contracting Party providing such resources (governments and/or local communities that provided the traditional knowledge or biodiversity resources utilized).
* Access to and transfer of technology, including [[biotechnology]], to the governments and/or local communities that provided traditional knowledge and/or biodiversity resources.
* Technical and scientific cooperation.
* Coordination of a global directory of taxonomic expertise (Global Taxonomy Initiative).
* Impact assessment.
* Education and public [[awareness]].
* Provision of financial resources.
* National reporting on efforts to implement treaty commitments.

==Cartagena Protocol==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

{{main|Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety}}
The '''Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety''' of the Convention, also known as the Biosafety Protocol, was adopted in January 2000. The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.

The Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the [[precautionary principle]] and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will for example let countries ban imports of a [[genetically modified organism]] if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is [[safe]] and requires exporters to label shipments containing [[genetically modified]] commodities such as corn or cotton.

The required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003.

== Global Strategy for Plant Conservation ==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

{{main|Global Strategy for Plant Conservation}}

In April 2002, the parties of the UN CBD adopted the recommendations of the Gran Canaria Declaration Calling for a Global Plant Conservation Strategy, and adopted a 16-point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010.

==Parties==
As of 2016, the Convention has 196 parties, which includes 195 states and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|title=CBD List of Parties}}&lt;/ref&gt; All UN member states—with the exception of the United States—have ratified the treaty. Non-UN member states that have ratified are the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. The [[Holy See]] and the [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]] are non-parties. The US has signed but not ratified the treaty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India Presses U.S. to Pass Biotic Treaty|last=Hazarika|first=Sanjoy|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 April 1995|page=1.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has not announced plans to ratify it.

==International bodies established==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

'''Conference of the parties:'''
The convention's governing body is the [[Conference of the parties]] (COP), consisting of all governments (and regional economic integration organizations) that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the Convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the Convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.

The Conference of the Parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the Convention. In addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis, two main organs are:

'''Secretariat:'''
The CBD Secretariat, based in [[Montreal]], operates under the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents, assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work, coordinate with other international organizations, and collect and disseminate information.

'''Subsidiary body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA):'''
The SBSTTA is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields. It plays a key role in making recommendations to the COP on scientific and technical issues.

The 13th Meeting of the SBSTTA, or SBSTTA-13, held from 18&amp;ndash;22 February 2008 at the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] headquarters in Rome, Italy. SBSTTA-13 delegates finalized and adopted recommendations on the in-depth reviews of the work programmes on agricultural and forest biodiversity and SBSTTA's modus operandi for the consideration of new and emerging issues, as well as on inland waters biodiversity, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] biodiversity, [[invasive alien species]], and biodiversity and [[climate change]].

The current chairperson of the SBSTTA is Dr. Theresa Mundita Lim of the [[Philippines]].

==Country implementation==

===National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP)===
"National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) are the principal instruments for implementing the Convention at the national level (Article 6). The Convention requires countries to prepare a national biodiversity strategy (or equivalent instrument) and to ensure that this strategy is mainstreamed into the planning and activities of all those sectors whose activities can have an impact (positive and negative) on biodiversity. To date [2012-02-01], 173 Parties have developed NBSAPs in line with Article 6."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/nbsap/|title= National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Tanzania have carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats. The United States of America, a signatory who has not yet ratified the treaty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/27/harrison-ford-conservation-nagoya | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | first=Jonathan | last=Watts | title=Harrison Ford calls on US to ratify treaty on conservation | date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; has produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species Recovery Programs and other mechanisms long in place in the USA for species conservation.

Singapore has also established a detailed ''National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130606095712/http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/docs/nbc/NPark-booklet-final-4sep.pdf National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''National Biodiversity Centre'' of Singapore represents Singapore in the Convention for Biological Diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150119041729/https://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=122&amp;Itemid=124 National Biodiversity Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Reports===
In accordance with Article 26 of the Convention, Parties prepare national reports on the status of implementation of the Convention.

==Executive secretary==
The current executive secretary is [[Cristiana Pașca Palmer]], who took up this post on 17 March 2017.&lt;ref name="exec"&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/secretariat/es/default.shtml] as on 20th March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias]] was the previous executive secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/secretariat/former-es/default.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nagoya Protocol==
{{main|Nagoya Protocol}}

The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity&lt;ref name="nagoya_text"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/ |title=Text of the Nagoya Protocol |work=cbd.int |publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity. It provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The Protocol was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Aichi Province, Japan, and entered into force on 12 October 2014. Its objective is the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cbd.int/abs/about/|title= Nagoya Protocol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 COP 11===
{{Main|2012 Hyderabad Biodiversity Conference}}
Leading up to the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) meeting on biodiversity in [[Hyderabad, India]] 2012, preparations for a World Wide Views on Biodiversity has begun, involving old and new partners and building on the experiences from the [[World Wide Views on Global Warming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biodiversity.wwviews.org/  World Wide Views on Biodiversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 COP 12===
Under the theme, "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development," thousands of representatives of governments, NGOs, indigenous peoples, scientists and the private sector gathered in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], Republic of Korea in October 2014 for the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 12).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbd.int/cop2014; Webcasting: {{cite web |url=http://www.liveto.com/cop12/floor/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006120510/http://www.liveto.com/cop12/floor/index.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 6–17 October 2014, Parties discussed the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which are to be achieved by the end of this decade. The results of Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, the flagship assessment report of the CBD informed the discussions.

The conference gave a mid-term evaluation to the UN Decade on Biodiversity (2011-2020) initiative, which aims to promote the conservation and sustainable use of nature.
 
At the end of the meeting, the meeting adopted the "Pyeongchang Road Map," which addresses ways to achieve biodiversity through technology cooperation, funding and strengthening the capacity of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;(Source http://www.cbd.int/doc/press/2014/pr-2014-10-06-cop-12-en.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 COP 13===
[[File:COP13 Mexico conference.jpg|thumb|COP13 Mexico meeting]]
The thirteenth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place between 2 and 17 December 2016 in Cancun, Mexico.

==Commemorative periods==
2010 was the [[International Year of Biodiversity]] and the Secretariat of the CBD was its focal point. Following a recommendation of CBD signatories during COP 10 at [[Nagoya]] in October 2010, the UN, on 22 December 2010, declared 2011 to 2020 as the [[United Nations Decade on Biodiversity]].

==Criticism==
There have been criticisms against CBD that the Convention has been weakened in implementation due to the resistance of Western countries to the implementation of the pro-South provisions of the Convention. &lt;ref&gt;Faizi, S (2004) The Unmaking of a Treaty. Biodiversity 5(3) 2004&lt;/ref&gt; CBD is also regarded as a case of a hard treaty gone soft in the implementation trajectory &lt;ref&gt;Harrop, Stuart &amp; Pritchard, Diana. (2011). A Hard Instrument Goes Soft: The Implications of the Convention on Biological Diversity's Current Trajectory. Global Environmental Change-human and Policy Dimensions - GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANGE. 21. 474-480. 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.01.014. &lt;/ref&gt; The argument to enforce the treaty as a legally binding multilateral instrument with the Conference of Parties reviewing the infractions and non-compliance is also gaining strength&lt;ref&gt;Faizi, S (2012) CBD: Putting the focus on enforcement. Square Brackets. Issue No. 7. October, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions,&lt;ref name="cbd1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/text/ |title=Text of the CBD|publisher=www.cbd.int|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening. The fifth report of the European Union, for example, makes frequent reference to animals (particularly fish) and plants, but does not mention [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] or [[protists]] at all.&lt;ref name="cbd_eur1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/eur/eur-nr-05-en.pdf |title=Fifth Report of the European Union to the Convention on Biological Diversity. June 2014 |publisher=www.cbd.int |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Society for Fungal Conservation has assessed more than 100 of these CBD documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories. No documents were assessed as good or adequate, less than 10% as nearly adequate or poor, and the rest as deficient, seriously deficient or totally deficient.&lt;ref name="isfc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli.htm |title=The Micheli Guide to Fungal Conservation |publisher=www.fungal-conservation.org |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, intensive monoculture and human overpopulation are the two most pertinent biodiversity issues to address.

Scientists working with biodiversity and medical research are expressing fears that the Nagoya Protocol is counterproductive, and will will hamper disease prevention and conservation efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6396/1405.full|title= When the cure kills—CBD limits biodiversity research|website=science.sciencemag.org|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and that the threat of imprisonment of scientists will have a chilling effect on research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nature.com/news/biopiracy-ban-stirs-red-tape-fears-1.16028|title= Biopiracy ban stirs red-tape fears}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-commercial researchers and institutions such as [[natural history museum]]s fear maintaining biological reference collections and exchanging material between institutions will become difficult&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/05/05/biosci.biv056.short?rss=1|title= The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing—International treaty poses challenges for biological collections}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and medical researchers have expressed alarm at plans to expand the protocol to make it illegal to publicly share genetic information, e.g. via [[GenBank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6413/404|title= Threats to timely sharing of pathogen sequence data|website=science.sciencemag.org|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three virtues Diligentia.jpg|thumb|Plate 1 of classical virtues: Diligence. She is holding a whip and spurs, signifying a drive to steadfastly move forward with one's means.]]

'''Diligence''' is one of the [[seven heavenly virtues]]. Diligent behavior is indicative of a [[work ethic]]; a belief that work is good in itself. Diligence is carefulness and persistent effort or work. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Work and society |author1=Keith E. Thurley |author2=Sek Hong Ng |chapter=The Concept of the Work Ethic |pages=136–137 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-962-209-391-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In students ==

Bernard et al.&lt;ref name=bdp/&gt; suggest diligence in a student is defined as an effort he or she puts towards balanced and holistic development in mental, physical, social and spiritual dimensions. They find diligence in students is correlated with [[academic performance]].  This is especially found in younger students.  The support of parents and educators encourages students to be diligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Student Diligence and Student Diligence Support: Predictors of Academic Success. |author=Christon G Arthur |year=2002 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED471295.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other factors which encourage diligence in students include [[motivation]], [[discipline]],  [[attention|concentration]], responsibility and devotedness.&lt;ref name=bdp&gt;{{citation |title=Student-Centered Educational Reform: The Impact of Parental and Educator Support of Student Diligence |author1=H Bernard |author2=DD Drake |author3=JJ Pace |journal=School Community Journal |year=1996 |url=http://www.adi.org/journal/fw96/BernardDrakePacesRaynorFall1996.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Buddhism ==

The last words of the [[Buddha]] were "Strive on with diligence." Diligence is an integral part of all [[Buddhist]] teaching, and is considered the fourth of the [[pāramitā]]. In [[Mahayana]] tradition diligence is the third pāramitā and the first which is said to lead to liberation. The practice of diligence will bring an increase of qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Gems of Dharma, Jewels of Freedom|author=Je Gampopa|page=163|publisher=Altea Publishing |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-9524555-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Christianity ==

Diligence, in Christianity, is the effort to do one's part, while keeping faith and reliance in God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web001.rbc.org/pdf/discovery-series/how-do-you-live-the-christian-life.pdf How do we live the Christian Life?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104234046/http://web001.rbc.org/pdf/discovery-series/how-do-you-live-the-christian-life.pdf |date=November 4, 2013 }} David Sper (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, diligence and faith are two sides of a mystery. One doesn’t know how, despite one's effort, it all works out. But diligence when combined with faith assures spiritual success. Diligence as one of seven virtues describes thoroughness, completeness and persistence of an action, particularly in matters of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas J. Kšstenberger (2011), ''Excellence: The Character of God and the Pursuit of Scholarly Virtue'', {{ISBN|978-1-58134-910-8}}, pp 88–90&lt;/ref&gt;

International Bible Society, (1973), THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE HEBREWS 6:11–12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In Islam ==
{{bq|That man can have nothing but what he strives for; That (the fruit of) his striving will soon come in sight: Then will he be rewarded with a reward complete.|The Quran|&lt;ref&gt;An-Najm 53:39–41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In Hinduism ==

According to Brian Hatcher, the precepts of Hinduism require a human being to discover and live a ''dharmic'' life. To live a ''dharmic'' life, one must live with right intention with diligence, and with concern for well being of others.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Hatcher (2008), ''Bourgeois Hinduism or Faith of the Modern Vedantists'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-532608-6}}, page 80–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, B. A. (2007). Bourgeois Vedānta: The Colonial Roots of Middle-class Hinduism. Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 75(2), 298–323.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindus celebrate [[Diwali]], a festival of lights, where Goddess Lakshmi (also called Goddess Sri) is worshipped; the goddess symbolizes thorough preparation, being organized, diligent and honest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/962/1/HINDUISM..pdf HINDUISM] Stephen Bigger (1990), University of Worcester, UK&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics are considered by Hindus as essential for success and Shubh Labh (ethical profit).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, S.

== Due diligence ==
{{main|Due diligence}}

Due diligence is the necessary amount of diligence required in a professional activity to avoid being [[negligence|negligent]]. This commonly arises in major [[takeover|acquisitions]] where the legal principle of [[caveat emptor]] ("let the buyer beware") requires the purchaser to make a diligent [[survey]] of the property or service being sold. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wT0NRBjjriMC&amp;pg=PA43 |title=The system of liability of articles III and IV of the Hague (Visby) Rules |author=N.J.

'''Ecosystem services''' are the many and varied benefits that humans freely gain from the natural environment and from properly-functioning [[ecosystems]]. Such ecosystems include, for example, [[agroecosystem]]s, [[forest ecosystem]]s, [[grassland ecosystem]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Collectively, these benefits are becoming known as 'ecosystem services', and are often integral to the provisioning of clean [[drinking water]], the [[decomposition]] of wastes, and the natural pollination of crops and other plants.

While scientists and [[environmentalists]] have discussed ecosystem services implicitly for decades, the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MA) in the early 2000s popularized the concept.&lt;ref name="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005"&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). 2005. Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Synthesis {{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/maweb/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005715/http://www.unep.org/maweb/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}. [[Island Press]], Washington. 155pp.&lt;/ref&gt; There, ecosystem services are grouped into four broad categories: ''provisioning'', such as the production of food and water; ''regulating'', such as the control of climate and disease; ''supporting'', such as [[nutrient cycles]] and [[oxygen]] production; and ''cultural'', such as spiritual and recreational benefits. To help inform [[Decision-making|decision-makers]], many ecosystem services are being assigned economic values.

==History==

While the notion of human dependence on Earth's ecosystems reaches to the start of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''{{'}} existence, the term 'natural capital' was first coined by [[E. F. Schumacher|E.F. Schumacher]] in 1973 in his book ''[[Small Is Beautiful|Small is Beautiful]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F (1973). ''Small is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered''.&lt;/ref&gt;''.''  Recognition of how ecosystems could provide complex services to humankind date back to at least [[Plato]] (c. 400 BC) who understood that [[deforestation]] could lead to soil [[erosion]] and the drying of springs.&lt;ref name="Daily1997"&gt;Daily, G.C. 1997. Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems. Island Press, Washington. 392pp.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed| date=February 2015}}  Modern ideas of ecosystem services probably began when Marsh challenged in 1864 the idea that Earth's natural resources are unbounded by pointing out changes in [[soil fertility]] in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, G.P. 1864 (1965). Man and Nature. [[Charles Scribner's Sons]], New York. 472pp.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2015}} It was not until the late 1940s that three key authors—[[Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr]],&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, F. 1948. [[Our Plundered Planet]]. Little, Brown and Company: Boston. 217pp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Vogt]],&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, W. 1948. Road to Survival. William Sloan: New York. 335pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aldo Leopold]] &lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. 1949. A Sand County Almanac and Sketches from Here and There. [[Oxford University Press]], New York. 226pp.&lt;/ref&gt;—promoted recognition of human dependence on the environment.

In 1956, [[Paul Sears]] drew attention to the critical role of the ecosystem in processing wastes and recycling nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, P.B. 1956. "The processes of environmental change by man." ''In'': W.L. Thomas, editor. Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth (Volume 2). [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago. 1193pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and Rosa Weigert called attention to "ecological systems" in their environmental science textbook&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R. and A. Ehrlich. 1970. Population, Resources, Environment: Issues in Human Ecology. [[W. H. Freeman and Company|W.H. Freeman]], San Francisco. 383pp. - see p.157&lt;/ref&gt; and "the most subtle and dangerous threat to man's existence... the potential destruction, by man's own activities, of those ecological systems upon which the very existence of the human species depends".

The term "'''environmental services'''" was introduced in a 1970 report of the ''Study of Critical Environmental Problems'',&lt;ref&gt;Study of Critical Environmental Problems (SCEP). 1970. Man's Impact on the Global Environment. MIT Press, Cambridge. 319pp.&lt;/ref&gt; which listed services including insect pollination, [[fisheries]], [[climate]] regulation and [[flood]] control. In following years, variations of the term were used, but eventually 'ecosystem services' became the standard in scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R. and A. Ehrlich. 1981. Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species. [[Random House]], New York. 305pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecosystem services concept has continued to expand and includes [[socio-economic]] and [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] objectives, which are discussed below. A history of the concepts and terminology of ecosystem services as of 1997, can be found in Daily's book "Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems".&lt;ref name="Daily1997"/&gt;

While [[Gretchen Daily]]'s original definition distinguished between ecosystem goods and ecosystem services, [[Robert Costanza]] and colleagues' later work and that of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment lumped all of these together as ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Brown2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown |first1=Thomas C. |author2=John C.

==Definition==
Per the 2006 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), ecosystem services are "the benefits people obtain from ecosystems". The MA also delineated the four categories of ecosystem services—supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural—discussed below.

By 2010, there had evolved various working definitions and descriptions of ecosystem services in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ojea, E. Classifying Ecosystem Services for Economic Valuation: the case of forest water services. BIOECON Conference, Venice 27–28 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent double counting in ecosystem services audits, for instance, [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB) replaced "Supporting Services" in the MA with "Habitat Services" and "ecosystem functions", defined as "a subset of the interactions between ecosystem structure and processes that underpin the capacity of an ecosystem to provide goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teebtest.org/wp-content/uploads/Study%20and%20Reports/Reports/Ecological%20and%20Economic%20Foundations/TEEB%20Ecological%20and%20Economic%20Foundations%20report/TEEB%20Foundations.pdf The Ecological and Economic Foundation], chapter 1, p.19, [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity|TEEB]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four categories==
[[Image:Dungbeetle.jpg|right|thumb|[[Detritivore]]s like this [[dung beetle]] help to turn animal wastes into organic material that can be reused by primary producers.]]

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) report 2005 defines ''Ecosystem services'' as benefits people obtain from ecosystems and distinguishes four categories of ecosystem services, where the so-called supporting services are regarded as the basis for the services of the other three categories.&lt;ref name="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005"/&gt;

=== Supporting services ===
These include services such as nutrient recycling, primary production and [[soil formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation of ecosystem services|url=http://basicbiology.net/biology/conservation/ecosystem_services.php|website=basicbiology.net|publisher=Adam Purcell|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129194450/http://basicbiology.net/biology/conservation/ecosystem_services.php|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services make it possible for the ecosystems to provide services such as food supply, flood regulation, and water purification.

=== Provisioning services ===
* food (including [[seafood]] and [[Game (food)|game]]), crops, wild foods, and [[spice]]s
* raw materials (including lumber, skins, fuel wood, organic matter, fodder, and fertilizer)
* genetic resources (including crop improvement genes, and health care)
* water
* [[biogenic minerals]]
* [[Medication|medicinal resources]] (including pharmaceuticals, chemical models, and test and assay organisms)
* [[energy]] ([[hydropower]], [[biofuel|biomass fuels]])
* ornamental resources (including fashion, handicraft, jewelry, pets, worship, decoration and souvenirs like furs, feathers, ivory, orchids, butterflies, aquarium fish, shells, etc.)

=== Regulating services ===
* pollination
* carbon sequestration and [[climate]] regulation
* waste [[decomposition]] and detoxification
* purification of [[water purification|water]] and [[air pollution|air]]
* [[Pest (organism)|pest]] and [[disease]] control

===Cultural services===
* cultural (including use of nature as motif in books, film, painting, folklore, national symbols, architect, advertising, etc.)
* spiritual and historical (including use of nature for religious or heritage value or natural)
* [[recreation]]al experiences (including [[ecotourism]], outdoor sports, and recreation)
* science and education (including use of natural systems for school excursions, and [[scientific discovery]])
* Therapeutic (including Ecotherapy, social forestry and animal assisted therapy)

There is discussion as to how the concept of '''cultural ecosystem services''' can be operationalized. A good review of approaches in landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation, and spiritual significance to define and assess cultural values of our environment so that they fit into the ecosystem services approach is given by Daniel et al.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, T. C. et al. 2012: ''Contributions of cultural services to the ecosystem services agenda.'' Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109: 8812–8819 [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/18/1114773109.full.pdf+html].&lt;/ref&gt; who vote for models that explicitly link ecological structures and functions with cultural values and benefits.
There also is a fundamental ''critique'' of the concept of cultural ecosystem services that builds on three arguments:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T. 2012: ''Pivotal cultural values of nature cannot be integrated into the ecosystem services framework.'' Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109 (46): E3146.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Pivotal cultural values attaching to the natural/cultivated environment rely on an area's unique character that cannot be addressed by methods that use universal scientific parameters to determine ecological structures and functions. 
# If a natural/cultivated environment has symbolic meanings and cultural values the object of these values are not ecosystems but shaped phenomena like mountains, lakes, forests, and, mainly, symbolic landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cosgrove, D.E. 1984: ''Social Formation and Symbolic Landscape'', London; Schama, S. 1995: ''Landscape and memory''. New York; Kirchhoff, T./Trepl, L./Vicenzotti, V. 2012:''What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions''. Landscape Research iFirst.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Those cultural values do result not from properties produced by ecosystems but are the product of a specific way of seeing within the given cultural framework of symbolic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cosgrove, D.E. 1984: ''Social Formation and Symbolic Landscape'', London; Schama, S. 1995: ''Landscape and memory''. New York; Backhaus, G./Murungi, J. (eds.): ''Symbolic Landscapes''. Dordrecht 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The following examples illustrate the relationships between humans and natural ecosystems through the services derived from them:
* In [[New York City]], where the quality of drinking water had fallen below standards required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]], authorities opted to restore the polluted [[Catskill Park|Catskill Watershed]] that had previously provided the city with the ecosystem service of water purification. Once the input of sewage and pesticides to the [[Drainage basin|watershed]] area was reduced, natural [[abiotic]] processes such as soil [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[filtration]] of chemicals, together with biotic recycling via [[root| root systems]] and [[soil]] [[microorganisms]], [[water quality]] improved to levels that met government standards. The cost of this investment in [[natural capital]] was estimated between $1–1.5 billion, which contrasted dramatically with the estimated $6–8 billion cost of constructing a [[water filtration]] plant plus the $300 million annual running costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graciela Chichilnisky|Chichilnisky, G.]] and G. Heal. 1998. Economic returns from the biosphere. [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 391: 629-630.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pollination of [[crops]] by [[bees]] is required for 15–30% of U.S. [[food production]]; most large-scale farmers import non-native honey bees to provide this service. One study &lt;ref name="Kremen 2005"&gt;Kremen, C. 2005. Managing ecosystem services: what do we need to know about their ecology?  [[Ecology Letters]] 8: 468-479.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that in [[California| California's]] agricultural region, it was found that wild bees alone could provide partial or complete pollination services or enhance the services provided by honey bees through behavioral interactions. However, [[Intensive farming|intensified agricultural practices]] can quickly erode pollination services through the loss of species. The remaining species are unable to compensate this. The results of this study also indicate that the proportion of [[chaparral]] and [[California oak woodland|oak-woodland habitat]] available for wild bees within 1–2&amp;nbsp;km of a [[farm]] can stabilize and enhance the provision of pollination services. The presence of such ecosystem elements functions almost like an insurance policy for farmers.
* In watersheds of the [[Yangtze River]] ([[China]]), [[Spatial analysis|spatial models]] for water flow through different forest habitats were created to determine potential contributions for [[hydroelectric power]] in the region. By quantifying the relative value of ecological parameters (vegetation-soil-slope complexes), researchers were able to estimate the annual economic benefit of maintaining forests in the watershed for power services to be 2.2 times that if it were harvested once for [[timber]].&lt;ref&gt;Guo, Z.W., X.M. Xio and D.M. Li. 2000. An assessment of ecosystem services: water flow regulation and hydroelectric power production. Ecological Applications 10: 925-936.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1980s, mineral water company Vittel (now a brand of Nestlé Waters) faced a critical problem. Nitrates and pesticides were entering the company's springs in northeastern France. Local farmers had intensified agricultural practices and cleared native vegetation that previously had filtered water before it seeped into the aquifer used by Vittel. This contamination threatened the company's right to use the "natural mineral water" label under French law.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, C, J Ranganathan, C Iceland, and J Finisdore. (2008) The Corporate Ecosystem Services Review (Version 1.0). [[World Resources Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this business risk, Vittel developed an incentive package for farmers to improve their agricultural practices and consequently reduce water pollution that had affected Vittel's product. For example, Vittel provided subsidies and free technical assistance to farmers in exchange for farmers' agreement to enhance pasture management, reforest catchments, and reduce the use of agrochemicals. This is an example of a [[payment for ecosystem services]] program.&lt;ref&gt;Perrot-Maître, D. (2006) The Vittel payments for ecosystem services: a "perfect" PES case? [[International Institute for Environment and Development]], London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was counted that to plant 15 000 ha new woodland in the UK, if we consider only the value of timber, it would cost  £79 000 000 which is more than the benefit of £65 000 000. If, however, we include all other benefits the trees in lowland could provide (like soil stabilization, wind deflection, recreation, food production, air purification, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, fuel production, cooling, flood prevention), the costs will increase due to displacing the profitable farmland (would be around £231 000 000) but will be overweight by benefits of £546 000 000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=EU Environment|title=Ecosystem services and Biodiversity - Science for Environment Policy|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6luBEJfi3s&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2016-09-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806014145/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6luBEJfi3s&amp;feature=youtu.be|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Europe, various projects are implemented in order to define the values of concrete ecosystems and to implement this concept into decision making process. For example,  "LIFE Viva grass" project aims to do this with grasslands in Baltics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vivagrass.eu/|title=LIFE Viva Grass {{!}} Integrated planning tool for grassland ecosystem services|website=vivagrass.eu|access-date=2016-09-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807201444/http://vivagrass.eu/|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Understanding of ecosystem services requires a strong foundation in [[ecology]], which describes the underlying principles and interactions of organisms and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. Since the scales at which these entities interact can vary from [[microbes]] to [[landscapes]], milliseconds to millions of years, one of the greatest remaining challenges is the descriptive characterization of energy and material flow between them.  For example, the area of a forest floor, the [[detritus]] upon it, the microorganisms in the soil and characteristics of the soil itself will all contribute to the abilities of that forest for providing ecosystem services like carbon sequestration, water purification, and [[erosion]] prevention to other areas within the watershed. Note that it is often possible for multiple services to be bundled together and when benefits of targeted objectives are secured, there may also be ancillary benefits—the same forest may provide [[habitat]] for other organisms as well as human recreation, which are also ecosystem services.

The complexity of Earth's ecosystems poses a challenge for scientists as they try to understand how relationships are interwoven among organisms, processes and their surroundings. As it relates to human ecology, a suggested research agenda &lt;ref name="Kremen 2005"/&gt; for the study of ecosystem services includes the following steps:
# identification of ''ecosystem service providers'' (''ESP''s)—[[species]] or populations that provide specific ecosystem services—and characterization of their functional roles and relationships;
# determination of community structure aspects that influence how ESPs function in their [[natural landscape]], such as compensatory responses that stabilize function and non-random extinction sequences which can erode it;
# assessment of key environmental (abiotic) factors influencing the provision of services;
# measurement of the spatial and temporal scales ESPs and their services operate on.

Recently, a technique has been developed to improve and standardize the evaluation of ESP functionality by quantifying the relative importance of different species in terms of their efficiency and abundance.&lt;ref name="Balvanera"&gt;Balvanera, P. C. Kremen, and M. Martinez. 2005. Applying community structure analysis to ecosystem function: examples from pollination and carbon storage. Ecological Applications 15: 360-375.&lt;/ref&gt; Such parameters provide indications of how species respond to changes in the environment (i.e. predators, resource availability, climate) and are useful for identifying species that are disproportionately important at providing ecosystem services. However, a critical drawback is that the technique does not account for the effects of interactions, which are often both complex and fundamental in maintaining an ecosystem and can involve species that are not readily detected as a priority. Even so, estimating the functional structure of an ecosystem and combining it with information about individual species traits can help us understand the [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] of an ecosystem amidst environmental change.

Many ecologists also believe that the provision of ecosystem services can be stabilized with [[biodiversity]]. Increasing biodiversity also benefits the variety of ecosystem services available to society. Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and an ecosystem's stability is essential to the management of natural resources and their services.

The concept of ecological redundancy is sometimes referred to as ''functional compensation'' and assumes that more than one species performs a given role within an ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, B.H. 1992. "Biodiversity and ecological redundancy." [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] 6: 18-23.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it is characterized by a particular species increasing its efficiency at providing a service when conditions are stressed in order to maintain aggregate stability in the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, T.M., [[Stephen R. Carpenter|S.R. Carpenter]], A.R. Ives, and T.K. Kratz. 1995. "Species compensation and complementarity in ecosystem function." ''In'': C. Jones and J. Lawton, editors. Linking species and ecosystems. [[Chapman &amp; Hall]], London. 387pp.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such increased dependence on a compensating species places additional stress on the ecosystem and often enhances its susceptibility to subsequent [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The redundancy hypothesis can be summarized as "species redundancy enhances ecosystem resilience".&lt;ref name="Naeem 1998"&gt;Naeem S. 1998. "Species redundancy and ecosystem reliability" [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] 12: 39–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another idea uses the analogy of rivets in an airplane wing to compare the exponential effect the loss of each species will have on the function of an ecosystem; this is sometimes referred to as ''rivet popping''.&lt;ref name="Lawton 1994"&gt;Lawton, J.H. 1994. What do species do in ecosystems? [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] 71: 367-374.&lt;/ref&gt; If only one species disappears, the loss of the ecosystem's efficiency as a whole is relatively small; however, if several species are lost, the system essentially collapses—similar to an airplane that lost too many rivets. The hypothesis assumes that species are relatively specialized in their roles and that their ability to compensate for one another is less than in the redundancy hypothesis. As a result, the loss of any species is critical to the performance of the ecosystem. The key difference is the rate at which the loss of species affects total ecosystem functioning.

===Portfolio effect===
A third explanation, known as the ''portfolio effect'', compares biodiversity to stock holdings, where diversification minimizes the volatility of the investment, or in this case, the risk of instability of ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, D., C.L. Lehman, and C.E. Bristow. 1998. Diversity-stability relationships: statistical inevitability or ecological consequence?" ''The American Naturalist'' 151: 277-282.&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the idea of ''response diversity'' where a suite of species will exhibit differential responses to a given environmental perturbation. When considered together, they create a stabilizing function that preserves the integrity of a service.&lt;ref&gt;Elmqvist, T., C. Folke, M. Nyström, G. Peterson, J. Bengtsson, B. Walker and J. Norberg. 2003. Response diversity, ecosystem change, and resilience. [[Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment]] 1: 488-494.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several experiments have tested these hypotheses in both the field and the lab. In ECOTRON, a laboratory in the UK where many of the [[biotic component|biotic]] and abiotic factors of nature can be simulated, studies have focused on the effects of earthworms and [[symbiotic bacteria]] on plant roots.&lt;ref name="Lawton 1994"/&gt;  These laboratory experiments seem to favor the rivet hypothesis. However, a study on grasslands at Cedar Creek Reserve in Minnesota supports the redundancy hypothesis, as have many other field studies.&lt;ref&gt;Grime, J.P. 1997. "Biodiversity and ecosystem function: The debate deepened." Science 277&lt;/ref&gt;

There are questions regarding the environmental and economic values of ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;Raudsepp-Hearne, C. et al. 2010. Untangling the Environmentalist's Paradox: Why is Human Well-being Increasing as Ecosystem Services Degrade? Bioscience 60(8)  576–589.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people may be unaware of the environment in general and humanity's interrelatedness with the natural environment, which may cause misconceptions. Although environmental awareness is rapidly improving in our contemporary world, ecosystem capital and its flow are still poorly understood, threats continue to impose, and we suffer from the so-called '[[tragedy of the commons]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, G. 1968. The tragedy of the commons" ''Science'' 162: 1243-1248.&lt;/ref&gt; Many efforts to inform decision-makers of current versus future costs and benefits now involve organizing and translating scientific knowledge to [[economics]], which articulate the consequences of our choices in comparable units of impact on human well-being.&lt;ref name="Daily et al. 2000."&gt;Daily, G.C., T. Söderqvist, S. Aniyar, K. Arrow, P. Dasgupta, P.R. Ehrlich, C. Folke, A. Jansson, B. Jansson, N. Kautsky, S. Levin, J. Lubchenco, K. Mäler, D. Simpson, D. Starrett, D. Tilman, and B. Walker. 2000. The value of nature and the nature of value" ''Science'' 289: 395-396.&lt;/ref&gt; An especially challenging aspect of this process is that interpreting ecological information collected from one spatial-temporal scale does not necessarily mean it can be applied at another; understanding the dynamics of ecological processes relative to ecosystem services is essential in aiding economic decisions.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, R.S., J.A. Foley, and G.P. Asner. 2004. Land-use choices: balancing human needs and ecosystem function. [[Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment]] 2: 249-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Weighting factors such as a service's irreplaceability or bundled services can also allocate economic value such that goal attainment becomes more efficient.

The economic valuation of ecosystem services also involves social communication and information, areas that remain particularly challenging and are the focus of many researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorriz-Misfud|first1=Elena|last2=Varela|first2=Elsa|last3=Piqué|first3=Miriam|last4=Prokofieva|first4=Irina|title=Demand and supply of ecosystem services in a Mediterranean forest: Computing payment boundaries.|journal=Ecosystem Services|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.11.006|url=http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_522_Gorriz%20et%20al%202016_Demand%20and%20supply%20of%20ES%20in%20a%20Med%20forest_Computing%20payment%20boundaries.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806071955/http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_522_Gorriz%20et%20al%202016_Demand%20and%20supply%20of%20ES%20in%20a%20Med%20forest_Computing%20payment%20boundaries.pdf|archivedate=6 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the idea is that although individuals make decisions for any variety of reasons, trends reveal the aggregative preferences of a society, from which the economic value of services can be inferred and assigned. The six major methods for valuing ecosystem services in monetary terms are:&lt;ref&gt;Farber, S.C., R. Costanza and M.A. Wilson. 2002. Economic and ecological concepts for valuing ecosystem services. Ecological Economics 41: 375-392.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Avoided cost: Services allow society to avoid costs that would have been incurred in the absence of those services (e.g. waste treatment by [[wetland]] habitats avoids health costs)
* Replacement cost: Services could be replaced with man-made systems (e.g. [[Restoration Ecology|restoration]] of the [[Catskill Watershed]] cost less than the construction of a [[water purification]] plant)
* Factor income: Services provide for the enhancement of incomes (e.g. improved [[water quality]] increases the commercial take of a [[fishery]] and improves the income of fishers)
* Travel cost: Service demand may require travel, whose costs can reflect the implied value of the service (e.g. value of [[ecotourism]] experience is at least what a visitor is willing to pay to get there)
* Hedonic pricing: Service demand may be reflected in the prices people will pay for associated goods (e.g. coastal housing prices exceed that of inland homes)
* Contingent valuation: Service demand may be elicited by posing hypothetical scenarios that involve some valuation of alternatives (e.g. visitors willing to pay for increased access to national parks)

A peer-reviewed study published in 1997 estimated the value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital to be between US$16–54 trillion per year, with an average of US$33 trillion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Costanza |first=Robert |first2=Ralph |last2=d'Arge |first3=Rudolf |last3=de Groot |first4=Stephen |last4=Farberk |first5=Monica |last5=Grasso |first6=Bruce |last6=Hannon |first7=Karin |last7=Limburg |first8=Shahid |last8=Naeem |first9=Robert V. |last9=O'Neill |first10=Jose |last10=Paruelo |first11=Robert G. |last11=Raskin |first12=Paul |last12=Sutton |first13=Marjan |last13=van den Belt |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |date=15 May 1997 |volume=387 |pages=253–260 |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |accessdate=8 August 2012 |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730185431/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Salles (2011) indicates 'The total value of biodiversity is infinite, so having debate about what is the total value of nature is actually pointless because we can't live without it'.

==Management and policy==

Although monetary pricing continues with respect to the valuation of ecosystem services, the challenges in policy implementation and management are significant and multitudinous. The administration of [[common pool resources]] is a subject of extensive academic pursuit.&lt;ref name="Ostrom 1990"&gt;Ostrom, E. 1990. Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action. [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge. 279pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, T. E. Ostrom and P.C. Stern. 2003. The struggle to govern the commons" ''Science'' 302: 1907-1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pretty, J. 2003. Social capital and the collective management of resources" ''Science'' 302: 1912-1914.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heikkila, T. 2004. Institutional boundaries and common-pool resource management: a comparative analysis of water management programs in California. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'' from [[Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management]] 23: 97-117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, C.C., J.T. Williams and E. Ostrom. 2005. Local management and better forests. [[World Development (journal)|World Development]] 33: 273-284.&lt;/ref&gt; From defining the problems to finding solutions that can be applied in practical and sustainable ways, there is much to overcome. Considering options must balance present and future human needs, and decision-makers must frequently work from valid but incomplete information. Existing legal policies are often considered insufficient since they typically pertain to human health-based standards that are mismatched with necessary means to protect [[ecosystem health]] and services. To improve the information available, one suggestion has involved the implementation of an ''Ecosystem Services Framework'' (ESF&lt;ref name="Daily 2000"&gt;Daily, G.C. 2000. Management objectives for the protection of ecosystem services. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 3: 333-339.&lt;/ref&gt;), which integrates the biophysical and [[socio-economic]] dimensions of protecting the environment and is designed to guide [[institutions]] through multidisciplinary information and jargon, helping to direct strategic choices.

Novel and expedient methods are needed to deal with managing Earth's ecosystem services. Local to regional collective management efforts might be considered appropriate for services like crop [[pollination]] or resources like water.&lt;ref name="Kremen 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ostrom 1990"/&gt; Another approach that has become increasingly popular over the last decade is the marketing of ecosystem services protection. Payment and trading of services is an emerging worldwide small-scale solution where one can acquire credits for activities such as sponsoring the protection of carbon sequestration sources or the [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] of ecosystem service providers. In some cases, banks for handling such credits have been established and conservation companies have even gone public on stock exchanges, defining an evermore parallel link with economic endeavors and opportunities for tying into social perceptions.&lt;ref name="Daily et al. 2000."/&gt; However, crucial for implementation are clearly defined [[land rights]], which is often lacking in many [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Jessica Brown and Neil Bird 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5049&amp;title=costa-rica-sustainable-resource-management-successfully-tackling-tropical-deforestation Costa Rica sustainable resource management: Successfully tackling tropical deforestation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514083601/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5049&amp;title=costa-rica-sustainable-resource-management-successfully-tackling-tropical-deforestation |date=14 May 2011 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many forest-rich developing countries suffering [[deforestation]] experience conflict between different forest stakeholders.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In addition, concerns for such global transactions include inconsistent compensation for services or resources sacrificed elsewhere and misconceived warrants for irresponsible use. Another approach has been focused on protecting ecosystem service '[[biodiversity hotspot|hotspots]]'. Recognition that the conservation of many ecosystem services aligns with more traditional conservation goals (i.e. [[biodiversity]]) has led to the suggested merging of objectives for maximizing their mutual success. This may be particularly strategic when employing networks that permit the flow of services across [[landscapes]], and might also facilitate securing the financial means to protect services through a diversification of investors.&lt;ref&gt;Balvanera, P., G.C. Daily, P.R. Ehrlich, T.H. Ricketts, S.Bailey, S. Kark, C. Kremen and H. Pereira. 2001. Conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. [[Science (journal)|Science]] 291: 2047.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, K.M.A., M.R. Shaw, D.R. Cameron, E.C. Underwood and G.C. Daily. 2006. Conservation planning for ecosystem services. [[PLoS Biology]] 4: 2138-2152.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in recent years there has been interest in the valuation of ecosystem services provided by [[shellfish]] production and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Northern Economics Inc|title=Valuation of Ecosystem Services from Shellfish Restoration, Enhancement and Management: A Review of the Literature|url=http://www.pacshell.org/pdf/ShellfishEcoServices.pdf|publisher=Prepared for Pacific Shellfish Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203085756/http://www.pacshell.org/pdf/ShellfishEcoServices.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A keystone species, low in the food chain, bivalve shellfish such as oysters support a complex community of species by performing a number of functions essential to the diverse array of species that surround them. There is also increasing recognition that some shellfish species may impact or control many ecological processes; so much so that they are included on the list of "ecosystem engineers"—organisms that physically, biologically or chemically modify the environment around them in ways that influence the health of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|author2=Lawton, and Shachak|title=Organisms as Ecosystem Engineers|journal=Oikos|year=1994|volume=69|issue=3|pages=373–386|doi=10.2307/3545850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the ecological functions and processes performed or affected by shellfish contribute to human well-being by providing a stream of valuable ecosystem services over time by filtering out particulate materials and potentially mitigating water quality issues by controlling [[nutrient pollution|excess nutrients]] in the water.

===Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)===

Ecosystem-based adaptation or EbA is an emerging strategy for community development and environmental management that seeks to use an ecosystem services framework to help communities adapt to the effects of [[climate change]]. The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] currently defines Ecosystem-Based Adaptation as "the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change", which includes the use of "sustainable management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems, as part of an overall adaptation strategy that takes into account the multiple social, economic and cultural co-benefits for local communities".&lt;ref name="ebaflagship.org"&gt;http://ebaflagship.org/images/ContentsForPublications/eba%20policy%20brochure%20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment announced that humanity's impact on the natural world was increasing to levels never before seen, and that the degradation of the planet's ecosystems would become a major barrier to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. In recognition of this fact, Ecosystem-Based Adaptation seeks to use the restoration of ecosystems as a stepping-stone to improving the quality of life in communities experiencing the impacts of climate change. Specifically, this involves the restoration of ecosystems that provide the community with essential services, such as the provisioning of food and water and protection from [[storm surges]] and flooding. EbA interventions typically combine elements of both [[climate change mitigation]] and [[adaptation to global warming]] to help address the community's current and future needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/climatechange/adaptation/EcosystemBasedAdaptation/tabid/29583/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604195815/http://www.unep.org/climatechange/adaptation/EcosystemBasedAdaptation/tabid/29583/Default.aspx |archivedate=4 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative planning between scientists, policy makers, and community members is an essential element of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation. By drawing on the expertise of outside experts and local residents alike, EbA seeks to develop unique solutions to unique problems, rather than simply replicating past projects.&lt;ref name="ebaflagship.org"/&gt;

==Estuarine and coastal ecosystem services==

Ecosystem services are defined as the gains acquired by humankind from surroundings ecosystems. Four different types of ecosystem services have been distinguished by the scientific body: regulating services, provisioning services, cultural services and supporting services. An ecosystem does not necessarily offer all four types of services simultaneously; but given the intricate nature of any ecosystem, it is usually assumed that humans benefit from a combination of these services. The services offered by diverse types of ecosystems (forests, seas, coral reefs, mangroves, etc.) differ in nature and in consequence. In fact, some services directly affect the livelihood of neighboring human populations (such as fresh water, food or aesthetic value, etc.) while other services affect general environmental conditions by which humans are indirectly impacted (such as climate change, erosion regulation or natural hazard regulation, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Barbier, E.B.; Hacker, S.D.; Kennedy, C.; Koch, E.W.; Stier, A.C. &amp; Silliman, B.R. [http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/10-1510.1] ''Ecological Monographs'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Estuarine and coastal ecosystems are both marine ecosystems. An [[estuary]] is defined as the area in which a river meets the sea or the ocean. The waters surrounding this area are predominantly salty waters or brackish waters; and the incoming river water is dynamically motioned by the tide. An estuary strip may be covered by populations of reed (or similar plants) and/or sandbanks (or similar form or land).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A coastal ecosystem occurs in areas where the sea or ocean waters meet the land.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Regulating services===
Regulating services are the "benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html|title=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|author=|date=|website=www.millenniumassessment.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224041032/http://millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html|archivedate=24 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of coastal and estuarine ecosystems, these services include climate regulation, waste treatment and disease control and natural hazard regulation.

====Climate regulation====
Both the biotic and abiotic ensembles of marine ecosystems play a role in climate regulation. They act as sponges when it comes to gases in the atmosphere, retaining large levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide). Marine plants also use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for photosynthesis purposes and help in reducing the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The oceans and seas absorb the heat from the atmosphere and redistribute it through the means of water currents, and atmospheric processes, such as evaporation and the reflection of light allow for the cooling and warming of the overlying atmosphere. The ocean temperatures are thus imperative to the regulation of the atmospheric temperatures in any part of the world: "without the ocean, the Earth would be unbearably hot during the daylight hours and frigidly cold, if not frozen, at night".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"&gt;MOlnar, Michelle; Clarke-Murray, Cathryn; Whitworth, Jogn &amp; Tam, Jordan. {{cite web |url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230158/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste treatment and disease regulation====
Another service offered by marine ecosystem is the treatment of wastes, thus helping in the regulation of diseases. Wastes can be diluted and detoxified through transport across marine ecosystems; pollutants are removed from the environment and stored, buried or recycled in marine ecosystems: "Marine ecosystems break down organic waste through microbial communities that filter water, reduce/limit the effects of eutrophication, and break down toxic hydrocarbons into their basic components such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt; The fact that waste is diluted with large volumes of water and moves with water currents leads to the regulation of diseases and the reduction of toxics in seafood.

====Buffer zones====
Coastal and estuarine ecosystems act as buffer zones against natural hazards and environmental disturbances, such as floods, cyclones, tidal surges and storms. The role they play is to "[absorb] a portion of the impact and thus [lessen] its effect on the land".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt; Wetlands, for example, and the vegetation it supports – trees, root mats, etc. – retain large amounts of water (surface water, snowmelt, rain, groundwater) and then slowly releases them back, decreasing the likeliness of floods.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, A.C.; Hernandez, M.E.; Moreno-Casasola, P.; Espinosa, E.C.; Robledo, A.R. &amp; Mata, D.I. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02626667.2011.629786] ''Hydrological Sciences Journal'', December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Mangrove forests protect coastal shorelines from tidal erosion or erosion by currents; a process that was studied after the 1999 cyclone that hit India. Villages that were surrounded with mangrove forests encountered less damages than other villages that weren't protected by mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;Badol, Ruchi &amp; Hussain, S.A. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=314311&amp;jid=ENC&amp;volumeId=32&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=314310], ''Environmental Conservation'', February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provisioning Services===
Provisioning services consist of all "the products obtained from ecosystems". Marine ecosystems provide people with: wild &amp; cultured seafood, fresh water, fiber &amp; fuel and biochemical &amp; genetic resources.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Marine products====
Humans consume a large number of products originating from the seas, whether as a nutritious product or for use in other sectors: "More than one billion people worldwide, or one-sixth of the global population, rely on fish as their main source of animal protein. In 2000, marine and coastal fisheries accounted for 12 per cent of world food production".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Molnar, Michelle; Clarke-Murray, Cathryn; Whitworth, Jogn &amp; Tam, Jordan. {{cite web |url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230158/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Fish and other edible marine products – primarily fish, shellfish, roe and seaweeds – constitute for populations living along the coast the main elements of the local cultural diets, norms and traditions. A very pertinent example would be sushi, the national food of Japan, which consists mostly of different types of fish and seaweed.

====Fresh water====
Water bodies that are not highly concentrated in salts are referred to as 'fresh water' bodies. Fresh water may run through lakes, rivers and streams, to name a few; but it is most prominently found in the frozen state or as soil moisture or buried deep underground. Fresh water is not only important for the survival of humans, but also for the survival of all the existing species of animals, plants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Raw materials====
Marine creatures provide us with the raw materials needed for the manufacturing of clothing, building materials (lime extracted from coral reefs), ornamental items and personal-use items (luffas, art and jewelry): "The skin of marine mammals for clothing, gas deposits for energy production, lime (extracted from coral reefs) for building construction, and the timber of mangroves and coastal forests for shelter are some of the more familiar uses of marine organisms. Raw marine materials are utilized for non-essential goods as well, such as shells and corals in ornamental items".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Humans have also referred to processes within marine environments for the production of renewable energy: using the power of waves – or tidal power – as a source of energy for the powering of a turbine, for example.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Oceans and seas are used as sites for offshore oil and gas installations, offshore wind farms.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Biochemical and genetic resources====
Biochemical resources are compounds extracted from marine organisms for use in medicines, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other biochemical products. Genetic resources are the genetic information found in marine organisms that would later on be used for animal and plant breeding and for technological advances in the biological field. These resources are either directly taken out from an organism – such as fish oil as a source of omega3 –, or used as a model for innovative man-made products: "such as the construction of fiber optics technology based on the properties of sponges. ... Compared to terrestrial products, marine-sourced products tend to be more highly bioactive, likely due to the fact that marine organisms have to retain their potency despite being diluted in the surrounding sea-water".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Cultural services===
Cultural services relate to the non-material world, as they benefit the benefit recreational, aesthetic, cognitive and spiritual activities, which are not easily quantifiable in monetary terms.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Inspirational====
Marine environments have been used by many as an inspiration for their works of art, music, architecture, traditions... Water environments are spiritually important as a lot of people view them as a means for rejuvenation and change of perspective. Many also consider the water as being a part of their personality, especially if they have lived near it since they were kids: they associate it to fond memories and past experiences. Living near water bodies for a long time results in a certain set of water activities that become a ritual in the lives of people and of the culture in the region.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Recreation and tourism====
Sea sports are very popular among coastal populations: surfing, snorkeling, whale watching, kayaking, recreational fishing...a lot of tourists also travel to resorts close to the sea or rivers or lakes to be able to experience these activities, and relax near the water.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} [[File:Tourism on Greek Beaches.jpg|thumb|Beach accommodated into a recreational area.]]

====Science and education====
A lot can be learned from marine processes, environments and organisms – that could be implemented into our daily actions and into the scientific domain. Although much is still yet to still be known about the ocean world: "by the extraordinary intricacy and complexity of the marine environment and how it is influenced by large spatial scales, time lags, and cumulative effects".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt;

===Supporting services===
Supporting services are the services that allow for the other ecosystem services to be present. They have indirect impacts on humans that last over a long period of time. Several services can be considered as being both supporting services and regulating/cultural/provisioning services.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Nutrient cycling====
Nutrient cycling is the movement of nutrients through an ecosystem by biotic and abiotic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scienceaid.net/biology/ecology/nutrient.html|title=Nutrient Cycles: Recycling in Ecosystems, The Carbon and Nitrogen Cycles - ScienceAid|work=ScienceAid|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ocean is a vast storage pool for these nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The nutrients are absorbed by the basic organisms of the marine food web and are thus transferred from one organism to the other and from one ecosystem to the other. Nutrients are recycled through the life cycle of organisms as they die and decompose, releasing the nutrients into the neighboring environment. "The service of nutrient cycling eventually impacts all other ecosystem services as all living things require a constant supply of nutrients to survive".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt;

====Biologically mediated habitats====
Biologically mediated habitats are defined as being the habitats that living marine structures offer to other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;UK National Ecosystem Assessment Technical Report, {{cite web |url=http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/Resources/tabid/82/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707060244/http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/Resources/tabid/82/Default.aspx |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, ''Chapters 13-16'', June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These need not to be designed for the sole purpose of serving as a habitat, but happen to become living quarters whilst growing naturally. For example, coral reefs and mangrove forests are home to numerous species of fish, seaweed and shellfish... The importance of these habitats is that they allow for interactions between different species, aiding the provisioning of marine goods and services. They are also very important for the growth at the early life stages of marine species (breeding and bursary spaces), as they serve as a food source and as a shelter from predators.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} [[File:Example of Biologically Mediated Habitats.jpg|thumb|Coral and other living organisms serve as habitats for many marine species.]]

====Primary production====
Primary production refers to the production of organic matter, i.e., chemically bound energy, through processes such as photosynthesis and chemosynthesis. The organic matter produced by primary producers forms the basis of all food webs. Further, it generates oxygen (O2), a molecule necessary to sustain animals and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.be/books?isbn=1118506243|title=isbn:1118506243 - Google zoeken|author=|date=|website=books.google.be|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canr.msu.edu/nativeplants/ecosystem_services|title=Ecosystem Services|author=|date=|website=msu.edu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228161544/http://www.canr.msu.edu/nativeplants/ecosystem_services/|archivedate=28 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/wc.notes/1.atmosphere/oxygen_and_human_requirements.htm|title=Oxygen and Human Requirements|author=|date=|website=www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022082604/http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/wc.notes/1.atmosphere/oxygen_and_human_requirements.htm|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/pe/appliedanatomy/1_anatomy_respiratorysys_rev3.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Inhaled and exhaled air|author=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026150605/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/pe/appliedanatomy/1_anatomy_respiratorysys_rev3.shtml|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem services degradation can pose a number of risks to corporate performance as well as provide business opportunities through ecosystem restoration and enhancement. Risks and opportunities include:

* '''''Operational'''''
** Risks such as higher costs for freshwater due to scarcity or lower output for hydroelectric facilities due to siltation
** Opportunities such as increasing water-use efficiency or building an on-site wetland to circumvent the need for new water treatment infrastructure
* '''''Regulatory and legal'''''
** Risks such as new fines, government regulations, or lawsuits from local communities that lose ecosystem services due to corporate activities
** Opportunities such as engaging governments to develop policies and incentives to protect or restore ecosystems that provide services a company needs
* '''''Reputational'''''
** Risks such as retail companies being targeted by nongovernmental organization campaigns for purchasing wood or paper from sensitive forests
::Opportunities such as implementing and communicating sustainable purchasing, operating, or investment practices in order to differentiate corporate brands.
* '''''Market and product'''''
** Risks such as customers switching to other suppliers that offer products with lower ecosystem impacts or governments implementing new sustainable procurement policies
** Opportunities such as launching new products and services that reduce customer impacts on ecosystems or participating in emerging markets for carbon sequestration and watershed protection other products
* '''''Financing'''''
** Risks such as banks implementing more rigorous lending requirements for corporate loans
** Opportunities such as banks offering more favorable loan terms or investors taking positions in companies supplying products and services that improve resource use efficiency or restore degraded ecosystems

Many companies are not fully aware of the extent of their dependence and impact on ecosystems and the possible ramifications. Likewise, environmental management systems and environmental due diligence tools are more suited to handle "traditional" issues of pollution and natural [[resource consumption]]. Most focus on [[environmental impacts]], not dependence. Several newly developed tools and methodologies can help the private sector value and assess ecosystem services.

==Land use change decisions==

Ecosystem services decisions require making complex choices at the intersection of [[ecology]], [[technology]], [[society]] and the [[economy]]. The process of making ecosystem services decisions must consider the interaction of many types of information, honor all [[project stakeholder|stakeholder]] viewpoints, including [[regulatory agencies]], proposal proponents, decision makers, residents, [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, and measure the impacts on all four parts of the intersection. These decisions are usually [[spatial planning|spatial]], always [[multi-objective optimization|multi-objective]], and based on uncertain data, models, and estimates. Often it is the combination of the best science combined with the stakeholder values, estimates and opinions that drive the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorriz-Misfud|first1=Elena|last2=Secco|first2=L|last3=Pisani|first3=E|title=Exploring the interlinkages between governance and social capital: A dynamic model for forestry.|journal=Forest Policy and Economics|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2016.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One analytical study modeled the stakeholders as [[software agent|agents]] to support water resource management decisions in the Middle Rio Grande basin of New Mexico.  This study focused on modeling the stakeholder inputs across a spatial decision, but ignored uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url= http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2012/120710.pdf|author= Tidwell, V.,  E.

Here the stakeholder inputs were modeled as random effects to reflect the uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/openspace/pubs/Lewis%20Alig%20WEF-Vol.8-No.1-Spring2009.pdf |author1=Lewis D.

This study was about siting wave energy devices off the Oregon Coast, but presents a general method for managing uncertain spatial science and stakeholder information in a decision making environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://davidullman.com/uploads/Managing_Eco.pdf |author1=Ullman D.

In Baltic countries scientists, nature conservationists and local authorities are [http://vivagrass.eu/about-the-project/ implementing integrated planning approach for grassland ecosystems]. They are developing Integrated Planning Tool that will be based on [[GIS]] (geographic information system) technology and put online that will help for planners to choose the best grassland management solution for concrete grassland. It will look holistically at the processes in the countryside and help to find best grassland management solutions by taking into account both natural and socioeconomic factors of the particular site.

'''Ernst Roets''' is a political activist, writer and filmmaker in [[South Africa]]. He is Deputy CEO of the civil rights organisation [[AfriForum]] and the CEO of the film production company Forum Films.

== Education ==
Roets grew up in the agricultural town of Tzaneen where he matriculated in 2003 from the Merensky High School. He obtained his LLB degree in 2009 from the [[University of Pretoria|University of Pretoria (UP)]]. During his student years he served in various leadership structures, including the Student Representative Council (SRC) and the Senate, at this university.

During his student years Roets served as founding member and the first National Chairperson of Solidarity Youth. In 2008 Solidarity Youth changed its name and the organisation was converted to AfriForum Youth. In 2016, Roets obtained his LLM degree in Public Law with distinction from the [[University of Pretoria|UP]]. The title of his dissertation was ''’n Peiling van die middele kragtens die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet, ter afdwinging van die basiese regte van minderheidsgemeenskappe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roets|first=Ernst|date=2016|title='n Peiling van die middele kragtens die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet, ter afdwinging van die basiese regte van minderheidsgemeenskappe|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/53186|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Roets was arrested in 2010 after he attempted to install a billboard with the words “Welcome to Pretoria” next to the N1 highway. This action was in protest against the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality|Tshwane Metropolitan]] Municipality’s use of the word “Tshwane” to refer to the capital during the 2010 Fifa Soccer World Cup, while the city’s name is in fact [[Pretoria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/3-held-for-violating-ad-by-law-20100709|title=3 held for violating ad by-law|last=|first=|date=2010-07-09|website=News24|archive-url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/3-held-for-violating-ad-by-law-20100709|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2011 Roets was appointed as Deputy CEO of AfriForum. He testified on behalf of [[AfriForum]] in 2011 in the case of AfriForum vs. [[Julius Malema|Malema]]. On behalf of AfriForum he submitted a charge of hate speech against Julius Malema after Malema sang the song “Dubula I’Bhunu” (Shoot the Boer) at various political gatherings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Afriforum-takes-Malema-to-Equality-Court-20150430|title=Afriforum takes Malema to Equality Court|last=|first=|date=11 March 2010|work=News24|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The court found Malema guilty of hate speech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAEQC/2011/2.html|title=Afri-Forum and Another v Malema and Others (20968/2010) [2011] ZAEQC 2; 2011 (6) SA 240 (EqC); [2011] 4 All SA 293 (EqC); 2011 (12) BCLR 1289 (EqC) (12 September 2011)|last=|first=|date=12 September 2011|website=South Africa: Equality Court|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Roets addressed various conferences of the United Nations (UN), especially on farm murders and the state of minority rights in South Africa. In 2015, at the UN’s offices in Genève, he reacted sharply to an accusation by the South African government that those who are asking for the prioritisation of farm murders only did so because they were steering a racial agenda and wanted to bring back apartheid&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AfriForum|title=AfriForum kap regering by VN|date=2015-11-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5oFBek4e2E|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the same year Roets submitted a complaint of discrimination against the South African government with the UN’s Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders after the South African government politically interfered at the UN to prevent AfriForum from registering as a non-government organisation at the UN&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politicsweb.co.za/politics/dirco-guns-for-afriforum-at-un--ernst-roets|title=DIRCO guns for AfriForum at UN - Ernst Roets - POLITICS {{!}} Politicsweb|website=politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Farm murders ==
Since 2012 Roets has led AfriForum's campaign to raise awareness about farm attacks.

=== Tainted Heroes ===
Tainted Heroes is a [[South Africa|South African]] documentary film that was produced by Forum Films under direction of Elrich Yssel, with Roets and Beatrice Pretorius as producers. The film is about the violent battle of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) against [[apartheid]] in South Africa between 1976 and 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://taintedheroes.co.za/|title=Tainted Heroes|website=taintedheroes.co.za|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The documentary is based on the book ''People’s War: New Light on the Struggle for [[South Africa]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irr.org.za/reports/books/copy_of_peoples-war-new-light-on-the-struggle-for-south-africa|title=People's War: New Light on the Struggle for South Africa|last=Jonathan|first=Ball|date=|website=SAIRR (South African Institute of Race Relations)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Anthea Jeffery. 

Max du Preez described the film as “crude” and “reckless”, but afterwards admitted that he hasn’t seen the film yet. The journalist Pieter du Toit said that Roets played with fire. Even though the ANC did not want to comment on the contents of the film, the party characterised it as propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/anc-scoffs-at-propaganda-film-claims-1980960|title=ANC scoffs at ‘propaganda’ film claims {{!}} IOL News|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Kill the Boer (book) ===
Roets is the author of the book ''Kill the Boer'' that was published in June 2018. ''Kill the Boer'' is about farm attacks in [[South Africa]]. In the book Roets argues that the South African government, due to a number of reasons, is complicit in the attacks.&lt;ref name="Hlatshaneni"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hlatshaneni |first1=Simnikiwe |title=Outrage surrounds book claiming top ANC officials ‘killed the boer’ |url=https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1964479/outrage-surrounds-book-claiming-top-anc-officials-killed-the-boer/ |accessdate=24 November 2018 |publisher=The Citizen |date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He characterises the events as [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.killtheboerbook.com|title=Home - Kill the Boer Book|website=Kill the Boer Book|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roets argues that in 2017 [[South African farm attacks]] took place at an unusual frequency" and that the killings "were unusually cruel."&lt;ref name="JordaanAttacks"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jordaan |first1=Nomahlubi |title=AfriForum concerned about 'sharp' increase in farm attacks |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2018-06-28-afriforum-concerned-about-sharp-increase-in-farm-attacks/ |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=[[The Times (South Africa)]] |date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">An '''excitable medium''' is a [[nonlinear dynamical system]] which has the capacity to propagate a wave of some description, and which cannot support the passing of another wave until a certain amount of time has passed (known as the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory time]]).

A forest is an example of an excitable medium: if a [[wildfire]] burns through the forest, no fire can return to a burnt spot until the vegetation has gone through its refractory period and regrown.  In chemistry, [[oscillating reaction]]s are excitable media, for example the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] and the [[Briggs–Rauscher reaction]].  Pathological activities in the heart and brain can be modelled as excitable media.  A group of spectators at a sporting event are an excitable medium, as can be observed in a [[Audience wave|Mexican wave]] (so-called from its initial appearance in the 1986 [[Football World Cup|World Cup]] in [[Mexico]]).

==Modelling excitable media==

Excitable media can be modelled using both [[partial differential equation]]s and [[cellular automata]].

===With cellular automata===

Cellular automata provide a simple model to aid in the understanding of excitable media. Perhaps the simplest such model is in.&lt;ref name="Greenberg1978"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics|volume=54|year=1978|pages=515–523|title=Spatial Patterns for Discrete Models of Diffusion in Excitable Media|author=J. M. Greenberg |author2=S. P. Hastings|doi=10.1137/0134040|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton]] for this model. 
 
Each cell of the automaton is made to represent some section of the medium being modelled (for example, a patch of trees in a forest, or a segment of heart tissue).  Each cell can be in one of the three following states:

* Quiescent or excitable — the cell is unexcited, but can be excited.  In the forest fire example, this corresponds to the trees being unburnt.
* Excited — the cell is excited.  The trees are on fire.
* Refractory — the cell has recently been excited and is temporarily not excitable.  This corresponds to a patch of land where the trees have burnt and the vegetation has yet to regrow.

As in all cellular automata, the state of a particular cell in the next time step depends on the state of the cells around it—its neighbours—at the current time.  In the forest fire example the simple rules given in [[Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton]] &lt;ref name="Greenberg1978" /&gt; might be modified as follows:

* If a cell is quiescent, then it remains quiescent unless one or more of its neighbours is excited.  In the forest fire example, this means a patch of land only burns if a neighbouring patch is on fire.
* If a cell is excited, it becomes refractory at the next iteration. After trees have finished burning, the patch of land is left barren.
* If a cell is refractory, then its remaining refractory period is lessened at the next period, until it reaches the end of the refractory period and becomes excitable once more. The trees regrow.

This function can be refined according to the particular medium.  For example, the effect of wind can be added to the model of the forest fire.

==Geometries of waves==

===One-dimensional waves===

It is most common for a one-dimensional medium to form a closed circuit, i.e. a ring.  For example, the [[Mexican wave]] can be modeled as a ring going around the stadium.  If the wave moves in one direction it will eventually return to where it started.  If, upon a wave's return to the origin, the original spot has gone through its refractory period, then the wave will propagate along the ring again (and will do so indefinitely).  If, however, the origin is still refractory upon the wave's return, the wave will be stopped.

In the Mexican wave, for example, if for some reason, the originators of the wave are still standing upon its return it will not continue.  If the originators have sat back down then the wave can, in theory, continue.

===Two-dimensional waves===

Several forms of waves can be observed in a two-dimensional medium.

A ''spreading wave'' will originate at a single point in the medium and spread outwards.  For example, a forest fire could start from a lightning strike at the centre of a forest and spread outwards.

A ''spiral wave'' will again originate at a single point, but will spread in a spiral circuit.  Spiral waves are believed to underlie phenomena such as [[tachycardia]] and [[fibrillation]].

Spiral waves constitute one of the mechanisms of fibrillation when they organize in long-lasting reentrant activities named rotors.

[[File:EleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png|thumb|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1949)—Article 19 states that "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Orator at Speakers Corner, London, with crowd, 1974.jpg|thumb|Orator at [[Speakers' Corner]] in London, 1974]]
'''Freedom of speech''' is a principle that supports the [[freedom]] of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, [[censorship]], or legal sanction.  The term "'''freedom of expression'''" is sometimes used synonymously but includes any act of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.

Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and recognized in [[international human rights law]] in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). Article 19 of the UDHR states that "everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice". The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries "special duties and responsibilities" and may "therefore be subject to certain restrictions" when necessary "[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others" or "[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Article 19 |url= http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |work= International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher= Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by UN General Assembly resolution 2200A (XXI) of 16 December 1966, entry into force 23 March 1976 |date=23 March 1976 |accessdate=13 March 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations to freedom of speech relate to [[libel]], [[slander]], [[obscenity]], [[pornography]], [[sedition]], [[incitement]], [[fighting words]], [[classified information]], [[copyright violation]], [[trade secrets]], [[List of food labeling regulations|food labeling]], [[non-disclosure agreements]], the [[right to privacy]], the [[right to be forgotten]], [[public security]], and [[perjury]]. Justifications for such include the [[harm principle]], proposed by [[John Stuart Mill]] in ''[[On Liberty]]'', which suggests that: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."&lt;ref name="van Mill"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/freedom-speech/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=van Mill|first=David|date=1 January 2016 |editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the "offense principle" is also used in the justification of speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided.&lt;ref name="van Mill"/&gt; With the evolution of the [[digital age]], application of the freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise, for example the [[Golden Shield Project]], an initiative by Chinese government's [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] that filters potentially unfavorable data from foreign countries.

== Origins ==
Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern [[international human rights instruments]].&lt;ref name="guardiantimeline" /&gt; It is thought that ancient [[Athenian democracy|Athenian democratic principle]] of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of democracy in ancient Greece|first=Kurt|last=Raaflaub|first2=Josiah|last2=Ober|first3=Robert|last3=Wallace|year=2007|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=0-520-24562-8|page=65|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The values of the [[Roman Republic]] included freedom of speech and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Classical Review|volume=57|issue=1|date=March 1943|page=49|publisher=The Classical Association|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=9192DF339924E8290F982D7458AFBC06.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4343064|author=M. P. Charlesworth|title=Freedom of Speech in Republican Rome|doi=10.1017/s0009840x00311283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts of freedom of speech can be found in early human rights documents.&lt;ref name="guardiantimeline"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/05/religion.news | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Timeline: a history of free speech | first=David | last=Smith |date=5 February 2006 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; England's [[Bill of Rights 1689]] legally established the constitutional right of 'freedom of speech in Parliament' which is still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv |last=Williams |first= E. N. |year=1960| title=The Eighteenth-Century Constitution. 1688–1815 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |oclc=1146699 |pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], adopted during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, specifically affirmed freedom of speech as an inalienable right.&lt;ref name="guardiantimeline" /&gt; The Declaration provides for freedom of expression in Article 11, which states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/frenchdec.html|title=Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|work=Hrcr.org|publisher=www.hrcr.org|accessdate=25 June 2013|author=Arthur W. Diamond Law Library at Columbia Law School|date=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, states that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|author=[[United Nations]]|work=UN.org|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=10 September 1948|publisher=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognized in international and regional [[human rights law]]. The right is enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] and Article 9 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[John Milton]]'s arguments, freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas, but three further distinct aspects:
# the right to seek information and ideas;
# the right to receive information and ideas;
# the right to impart information and ideas

International, regional and national standards also recognize that freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, be it orally, in written, in print, through the [[Internet]] or through art forms. This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Relationship to other rights ===
The right to freedom of speech and expression is closely related to other rights, and may be limited when conflicting with other rights (see [[Freedom of speech#Limitations|limitations on freedom of speech]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The right to freedom of expression is also related to the [[right to a fair trial]] and court proceeding which may limit access to the search for information, or determine the opportunity and means in which freedom of expression is manifested within court proceedings.&lt;ref name=Limitstotolerance&gt;{{cite book | last =Brett| first = Sebastian| title = Limits to tolerance: freedom of expression and the public debate in Chile| publisher = Human Rights Watch| year =1999| location =| page = xxv| url = https://books.google.com/?id=KGS_vAYDdtoC&amp;dq=freedom+of+expression+limitations| doi =| id =| isbn =978-1-56432-192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general principle freedom of expression may not limit the [[right to privacy]], as well as the honor and reputation of others. However greater latitude is given when criticism of public figures is involved.&lt;ref name=Limitstotolerance/&gt;

The right to freedom of expression is particularly important for [[News media|media]], which plays a special role as the bearer of the general right to freedom of expression for all.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; However, [[freedom of the press]] does not necessarily enable freedom of speech. Judith Lichtenberg has outlined conditions in which freedom of the press may constrain freedom of speech, for example where the media suppresses information or stifles the diversity of voices inherent in freedom of speech. Lichtenberg argues that [[freedom of the press]] is simply a form of [[property right]] summed up by the principle "no money, no voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sanders |first= Karen |title= Ethics &amp; Journalism |publisher= Sage |year= 2003 |page= 68 |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;as_brr=3|isbn= 978-0-7619-6967-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Democracy and social interaction ==
[[File:Free Speech Wall.jpg|thumb|Permanent Free Speech Wall in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], U.S.]]
Freedom of speech is understood to be fundamental in a democracy. The norms on limiting freedom of expression mean that public debate may not be completely suppressed even in times of emergency.&lt;ref name=Limitstotolerance /&gt; One of the most notable proponents of the link between freedom of speech and [[democracy]] is [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. He has argued that the concept of democracy is that of self-government by the people. For such a system to work, an informed electorate is necessary. In order to be appropriately knowledgeable, there must be no constraints on the free flow of information and ideas. According to Meiklejohn, democracy will not be true to its essential ideal if those in power are able to manipulate the electorate by withholding information and stifling criticism. Meiklejohn acknowledges that the desire to manipulate opinion can stem from the motive of seeking to benefit society. However, he argues, choosing manipulation negates, in its means, the democratic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first= Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn=978-1551113760 |pages=226–27 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Barendt]] has called this defense of free speech on the grounds of democracy "probably the most attractive and certainly the most fashionable free speech theory in modern Western democracies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn= 978-1551113760 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas I. Emerson expanded on this defense when he argued that freedom of speech helps to provide a balance between stability and [[Social change|change]]. Freedom of speech acts as a "safety valve" to let off steam when people might otherwise be bent on [[revolution]]. He argues that "The principle of open discussion is a method of achieving a more adaptable and at the same time more stable community, of maintaining the precarious balance between healthy cleavage and necessary consensus." Emerson furthermore maintains that "Opposition serves a vital social function in offsetting or ameliorating (the) normal process of bureaucratic decay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=Broadview Press |location= |isbn= 978-1551113760  |pages=228–29 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research undertaken by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project at the [[World Bank]], indicates that freedom of speech, and the process of accountability that follows it, have a significant impact in the quality of [[governance]] of a country. "Voice and Accountability" within a country, defined as "the extent to which a country's [[citizen]]s are able to participate in selecting their [[government]], as well as freedom of expression, [[freedom of association]], and [[Freedom of the press|free media]]" is one of the six dimensions of governance that the Worldwide Governance Indicators measure for more than 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |title=A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance|publisher=World Bank|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408193105/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf|archivedate=8 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this backdrop it is important that development agencies create grounds for effective support for a free press in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Freedom of expression promotes democracy|url =  http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/alexander-matschke-promoting-free-media-task-development-policy|first = Alexander|last = Matschke|date = 25 December 2014|website = D+C Development and Cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Moon has developed the argument that the value of freedom of speech and freedom of expression lies with social interactions. Moon writes that "by communicating an individual forms relationships and associations with others – family, friends, co-workers, church congregation, and countrymen. By entering into discussion with others an individual participates in the development of knowledge and in the direction of the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy|title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |publisher=Broadview Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1551113760|location=|page=229|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal systems sometimes recognize certain limits on the freedom of speech, particularly when freedom of speech conflicts with other rights and freedoms, such as in the cases of [[Defamation|libel]], [[Defamation|slander]], [[pornography]], [[obscenity]], [[fighting words]], and [[intellectual property]]. In Europe, blasphemy is a limitation to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brennan |first1=David |title=Calling Prophet Muhammad a Pedophile Not Protected by Free Speech, Court Rules |url=https://www.newsweek.com/calling-prophet-muhammad-pedophile-not-protected-free-speech-court-rules-1189031 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Newsweek |date=26 October 2018 |quote=The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that calling the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile was not protected by freedom of speech laws.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chase Winter |title=Calling Prophet Muhammad a pedophile does not fall within freedom of speech: European court |url=https://www.dw.com/en/calling-prophet-muhammad-a-pedophile-does-not-fall-within-freedom-of-speech-european-court/a-46050749 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=26 October 2018 |quote=An Austrian woman's conviction for calling the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile did not violate her freedom of speech, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lucia I.

[[Censorship of broadcasting in the United States|Limitations to freedom of speech]] may occur through legal sanction or social disapprobation, or both.&lt;ref name="leeds1"&gt;{{cite web | title = Freedom of Speech| work = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| publisher = | date = 17 April 2008| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/ | accessdate = 29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain public institutions may also enact policies restricting the freedom of speech, for example [[speech code]]s at [[state school]]s.

In ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859), [[John Stuart Mill]] argued that "...there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered."&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt; Mill argues that the fullest liberty of expression is required to push arguments to their logical limits, rather than the limits of social embarrassment.&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 1-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 2-19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ten Cate 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wragg 2015"/&gt;  However, Mill also introduced what is known as the harm principle, in placing the following limitation on free expression: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt;

In 1985, [[Joel Feinberg]] introduced what is known as the "offense principle", arguing that Mill's harm principle does not provide sufficient protection against the wrongful behaviors of others. Feinberg wrote "It is always a good reason in support of a proposed criminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective way of preventing serious offense (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons other than the actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that end."&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Collapse of the Harm Principle|url = http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7037&amp;context=jclc|chapter = Conclusion|author = Harcourt|accessdate = 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Feinberg argues that the harm principle sets the bar too high and that some forms of expression can be legitimately prohibited by law because they are very offensive. But, as offending someone is less serious than harming someone, the penalties imposed should be higher for causing harm.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; In contrast, Mill does not support legal penalties unless they are based on the harm principle.&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt; Because the degree to which people may take offense varies, or may be the result of unjustified prejudice, Feinberg suggests that a number of factors need to be taken into account when applying the offense principle, including: the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offense, and the general interest of the community at large.&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt;

Along similar lines as Mill, Jasper Doomen argued that harm should be defined from the point of view of the individual citizen, not limiting harm to physical harm since nonphysical harm may also be involved; Feinberg's distinction between harm and offense is criticized as largely trivial.&lt;ref&gt;Doomen 2014, pp. 111, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Bernard Harcourt]] wrote of the collapse of the harm principle: "Today the debate is characterized by a cacophony of competing harm arguments without any way to resolve them. There is no longer an argument within the structure of the debate to resolve the competing claims of harm. The original harm principle was never equipped to determine the relative importance of harms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/law-phil.htm |chapter=Philosophy of Law|author=Kenneth Einar Himma|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretations of both the harm and offense limitations to freedom of speech are culturally and politically relative. For instance, in Russia, the harm and offense principles have been used to justify the [[Russian LGBT propaganda law]] restricting speech (and action) in relation to [[LGBT]] issues. A number of European countries that take pride in freedom of speech nevertheless outlaw speech that might be interpreted as [[Holocaust denial#Laws against Holocaust denial|Holocaust denial]]. These include Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Lechtholz-Zey, Jacqueline: Laws Banning Holocaust Denial.

In the U.S., the standing landmark opinion on political speech is ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brandenburg v.

Jo Glanville, editor of the ''[[Index on Censorship]]'', states that "the Internet has been a revolution for [[censorship]] as much as for free speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |work= The Guardian | location=London|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International, national and regional standards recognise that freedom of speech, as one form of freedom of expression, applies to any medium, including the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA) of 1996 was the first major attempt by the [[United States Congress]] to regulate [[pornography|pornographic]] material on the Internet. In 1997, in the landmark [[cyberlaw]] case of ''[[Reno v. ACLU]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]] partially overturned the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Godwin | first = Mike | authorlink =Mike Godwin  | year = 2003 | title = [[Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age]] | publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-57168-4|pages=349–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Stewart R. Dalzell]], one of the three federal judges who in June 1996 declared parts of the CDA unconstitutional, in his opinion stated the following:&lt;ref name="rowland"&gt;{{cite book|title=Information Technology Law|first=Diane |last=Rowland|pages=463–65|year=2005|isbn= 978-1859417560|publisher=Routledge-Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than [[Print media|print]], the [[village green]], or the [[mail]]s. Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself, the CDA would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium. This is a constitutionally intolerable result. Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the limits of conventional discourse. Speech on the Internet can be unfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar – in a word, "indecent" in many communities. But we should expect such speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a voice. We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to ordinary people as well as media magnates.[...] My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of protecting children from the dangers of Internet communication. The Government can continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography. [...] As we learned at the hearing, there is also a compelling need for public educations about the benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role as well. In my view, our action today should only mean that Government's permissible supervision of Internet contents stops at the traditional line of unprotected speech. [...] The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of the plaintiff's experts put it with such resonance at the hearing: "What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is. The strength of the Internet is chaos." Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so that strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects.&lt;ref name="rowland" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the "[[Information society|Information Society]]" in stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the [[Information society|Information Society]]. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age| publisher = Routledge| year = 2005|page=1 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=USksfqPjwhUC&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights | isbn = 978-1-904385-31-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bernt Hugenholtz and Lucie Guibault the [[public domain]] is under pressure from the "[[commodification]] of information" as information with previously little or no economic value has acquired independent economic value in the information age. This includes factual data, [[personal data]], [[genetic information]] and pure [[idea]]s. The commodification of information is taking place through [[intellectual property]] law, [[contract law]], as well as broadcasting and telecommunications law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Guibault| first = Lucy|last2=Hugenholtz |first2=Bernt| title = The future of the public domain: identifying the commons in information law| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| page = 1| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&amp;dq=public+domain&amp;as_brr=3| isbn = 9789041124357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of information ===
{{Main|Freedom of information}}
Freedom of information is an extension of freedom of speech where the medium of expression is the [[Internet]]. Freedom of information may also refer to the [[right to privacy]] in the context of the Internet and [[information technology]]. As with the right to freedom of expression, the right to privacy is a recognised [[human right]] and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite magazine |url = http://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf |title = Protecting Free Expression Online with Freenet |magazine = Internet Computing|publisher =  IEEE|last1 = Clarke |first1 = Ian|last2 = Miller|first2 = Scott G.|last3= Hong|first3 = Theodore W.|last4 = Sandberg|first4= Oskar|last5 = Wiley|first5 = Brandon|date = 2002|pages =40–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of information may also concern [[censorship]] in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access [[Web content]], without censorship or restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pauli|first=Darren|date=14 January 2008|url=http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/01/14/industry-rejects-australian-govt-sanitized-internet-measure|title=Industry rejects Australian gov't sanitized Internet measure|work=[[The Industry Standard]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912112920/http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/01/14/industry-rejects-australian-govt-sanitized-internet-measure|archivedate=12 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of information is also explicitly protected by acts such as the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act of Ontario, in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sourcebook of Canadian Media Law|pages=232–34|first=Robert|last=Martin|last2=Adam |first2=G.

=== Internet censorship ===
{{Main |Internet censorship |Internet censorship by country}}
The concept of [[freedom of information]] has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet.

A widely publicized example of internet censorship is the "[[Great Firewall of China]]" (in reference both to its role as a [[firewall (networking)|network firewall]] and to the ancient [[Great Wall of China]]). The system blocks content by preventing [[IP address]]es from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and [[proxy server]]s at the [[Internet]] [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]]. The system also selectively engages in [[DNS poisoning]] when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,,1713317,00.html|author=Watts, Jonathan |date=20 February 2006 |title=War of the words |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]] is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations, including more than sixty regulations directed at the Internet.

Before the invention of the [[printing press]] a written work, once created, could only be physically multiplied by highly laborious and error-prone manual copying. No elaborate system of censorship and control over [[scribes]] existed, who until the 14th century were restricted to religious institutions, and their works rarely caused wider controversy. In response to the [[printing press]], and the ''[[heresies]]'' it allowed to spread, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] moved to impose censorship.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14"&gt;{{Cite book | last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | page = 14 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22Censorship+and+Control%22#v=onepage| isbn = 978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing allowed for multiple exact copies of a work, leading to a more rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information (see [[print culture]]).&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34"&gt;{{Cite book | last = MacQueen | first = Hector L |last2=Waelde |first2=Charlotte |last3=Laurie |first3=Graeme T | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | page = 34 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property | isbn = 978-0-19-926339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of [[copyright law]] in most European countries lie in efforts by the Roman Catholic Church and governments to regulate and control the output of printers.&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34" /&gt;

In 1501 [[Pope Alexander VI]] issued a Bill against the unlicensed printing of books and in 1559 the [[Index Expurgatorius]], or ''List of Prohibited Books'', was issued for the first time.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14" /&gt; The Index Expurgatorius is the most famous and long lasting example of "bad books" catalogues issued by the Roman Catholic Church, which presumed to be in authority over private thoughts and opinions, and suppressed views that went against its doctrines. The Index Expurgatorius was administered by the [[Roman Inquisition]], but enforced by local government authorities, and went through 300 editions. Amongst others, it banned or [[censored]] books written by [[René Descartes]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[David Hume]], [[John Locke]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Castillo| first = Anastasia| title = Banned Books: Censorship in Eighteenth-Century England| publisher = GRIN Verlag| year = 2010| page = 12| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CqaAGfL-IQIC&amp;dq=Giordano+Bruno+censorship| isbn = 978-3-640-71688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways because it allowed for the dissemination of [[Bible]]s and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licenses to trade and produce books.&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34" /&gt;

Milton's defense of freedom of expression was grounded in a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] worldview and he thought that the English people had the mission to work out the truth of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which would lead to the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of all people. But Milton also articulated the main strands of future discussions about freedom of expression. By defining the scope of freedom of expression and of "harmful" speech Milton argued against the principle of pre-censorship and in favor of tolerance for a wide range of views.&lt;ref name="Sanders 2003 66" /&gt; Freedom of the press ceased being regulated in England in 1695 when the Licensing Order of 1643 was allowed to expire after the introduction of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] shortly after the Glorious Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/gordon-rayner/8812486/Leveson-Inquiry-British-press-freedom-is-a-model-for-the-world-editor-tells-inquiry.html | title=Leveson Inquiry: British press freedom is a model for the world, editor tells inquiry | publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited | work=The Telegraph | date=7 October 2011 | accessdate=9 May 2018 | author=Rayner, Gordon | quote=Mr Rusbridger said: “When people talk about licensing journalists or newspapers the instinct should be to refer them to history.

As the "menace" of printing spread, more governments attempted to centralize control.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15"&gt;{{Cite book | last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | page = 15 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=36#v=onepage| isbn = 978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French crown]] repressed printing and the printer [[Etienne Dolet]] was burned at the stake in 1546. In 1557 the [[British Crown]] thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the [[Star Chamber]] was chartered to curtail the "greate enormities and abuses" of "dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books." The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the [[city of London]], which had 53 [[printing presses]]. As the British crown took control of type founding in 1637 printers fled to the [[Netherlands]]. Confrontation with authority made printers radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the [[Bastille]] in Paris before it was stormed in 1789.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15" /&gt;

A succession of English thinkers was at the forefront of early discussion on a right to freedom of expression, among them [[John Milton]] (1608–74) and [[John Locke]] (1632–1704). Locke established the [[individual]] as the unit of value and the bearer of rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to liberty|liberty]], [[right to property|property]] and the [[pursuit of happiness]]. However Locke's ideas evolved primarily around the concept of the right to seek salvation for one's soul, and was thus primarily concerned with theological matters. Locke neither supported a universal toleration of peoples nor freedom of speech; according to his ideas, some groups, such as atheists, should not be allowed.&lt;ref name="jonathanisrael"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=Radical Enlightenment|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2002|pages= 265–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the 17th century philosophers on the European continent like [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Pierre Bayle]] developed ideas encompassing a more universal aspect freedom of speech and toleration than the early English philosophers.&lt;ref name="jonathanisrael" /&gt; By the 18th century the idea of freedom of speech was being discussed by thinkers all over the Western world, especially by French [[philosophes]] like [[Denis Diderot]], [[Baron d'Holbach]] and [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=Enlightenment Contested|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2006|pages= 155ff, 781ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea began to be incorporated in political theory both in theory as well as practice; the first state edict in history proclaiming complete freedom of speech was the one issued December 4, 1770 in [[Denmark-Norway]] during the regency of [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=A Revolution of the Mind|publisher= Princeton University Press|year= 2010|page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Struensee himself imposed some minor limitations to this edict in October 7, 1771, and it was even further limited after the fall of Struensee with legislation introduced in 1773, although censorship was not reintroduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Arnold Barton|title=Scandinavia in the Revolutionary Era – 1760–1815|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year= 1986|pages= 90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873) argued that without human freedom there can be no progress in science, law or politics, which according to Mill required free discussion of opinion. Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'', published in 1859 became a classic defence of the right to freedom of expression.&lt;ref name="Sanders 2003 66" /&gt; Mill argued that [[truth]] drives out falsity, therefore the free expression of ideas, true or false, should not be feared. Truth is not stable or fixed, but evolves with time. Mill argued that much of what we once considered true has turned out false. Therefore, views should not be prohibited for their apparent falsity. Mill also argued that free discussion is necessary to prevent the "deep slumber of a decided opinion". Discussion would drive the onwards march of truth and by considering false views the basis of true views could be re-affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics &amp; Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| page = 67| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;as_brr=3| isbn = 978-0-7619-6967-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Mill argued that an opinion only carries intrinsic value to the owner of that opinion, thus silencing the expression of that opinion is an injustice to a basic human right. For Mill, the only instance in which speech can be justifiably suppressed is in order to prevent harm from a clear and direct threat. Neither economic or moral implications, nor the speakers own well-being would justify suppression of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Warburton| first = Nigel| title = Free Speech: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford| year = 2009| pages = 24–29| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nJ0uf50ZtzsC&amp;printsec=frontcover| isbn = 978-0-19-923235-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Evelyn Beatrice Hall]]'s biography of [[Voltaire]], she coined the following sentence to illustrate Voltaire's beliefs: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."&lt;ref name="paulboller" /&gt; Hall's quote is frequently cited to describe the principle of freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="paulboller"&gt;{{cite book |last=Boller, Jr. |first=Paul F. |authorlink= |author2=George, John |title=They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |pages=124–26 |isbn=0-19-505541-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th Century, Noam Chomsky states that: "If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Dictators such as [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], were in favor of freedom of speech for views they liked only. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media|title=[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]|year=1992|people= Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Bollinger]] argues that "the free speech principle involves a special act of carving out one area of social interaction for extraordinary self-restraint, the purpose of which is to develop and demonstrate a social capacity to control feelings evoked by a host of social encounters." Bollinger argues that [[Toleration|tolerance]] is a desirable value, if not essential. However, critics argue that society should be concerned by those who directly deny or advocate, for example, [[genocide]] (see limitations above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lee C.|last =  Bollinger|title=The Tolerant Society: Freedom of Speech and Extremist Speech in America|publisher=Oxford University Press|location= |year= 1986|isbn = 0195040007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1928 novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D. H. Lawrence]] was banned for [[obscenity]] in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, it was the subject of landmark court rulings which saw the ban for obscenity overturned. Dominic Sandbrook of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' in the UK wrote, "Now that public obscenity has become commonplace, it is hard to recapture the atmosphere of a society that saw fit to ban books such as ''Lady Chatterley’s Lover'' because it was likely to “deprave and corrupt” its readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8066784/Lady-Chatterley-trial-50-years-on.-The-filthy-book-that-set-us-free-and-fettered-us-forever.html |title= Lady Chatterley trial - 50 years on.

Now that public obscenity has become commonplace, it is hard to recapture the atmosphere of a society that saw fit to ban books such as Lady Chatterley’s Lover because it was likely to “deprave and corrupt” its readers. Although only half a century separates us from Harold Macmillan’s Britain, the world of 1960 can easily seem like ancient history. In a Britain when men still wore heavy grey suits, working women were still relatively rare and the Empire was still, just, a going concern, D H Lawrence’s book was merely one of many banned because of its threat to public morality.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Kaplan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated the overturning of the obscenity laws "set off an explosion of free speech" in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/opinion/21kaplan.html |title= The Day Obscenity Became Art |work= The New York Times |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2018 |author= Kaplan, Fred |quote=TODAY is the 50th anniversary of the court ruling that overturned America’s obscenity laws, setting off an explosion of free speech — and also, in retrospect, splashing cold water on the idea, much discussed during Sonia Sotomayor’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, that judges are “umpires” rather than agents of social change.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to freedom of expression has been interpreted to include the right to take and publish photographs of strangers in public areas without their permission or knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.newseuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-the-press/photography-first-amendment/ |title= Photography &amp; First Amendment |last= Kenworthy |first= Bill |date = April 2012|website = Newseum Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/photographers-rights | title=Photographers' Rights | publisher=American Civil Liberties Union | accessdate=9 May 2018 | work=aclu.org | quote=Taking photographs and video of things that are plainly visible in public spaces is a constitutional right—and that includes transportation facilities, the outside of federal buildings, and police and other government officials carrying out their duties.

Other people have ended up in FBI databases for taking innocuous photographs of public places.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], and [[psychoanalysis]], the '''gaze''' (translated from French ''le regard'') is the act of seeing and being seen.

Numerous [[existentialism|existentialists]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] have addressed the concept of gaze beginning with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Part 3, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] elaborated on gaze to illustrate a particular dynamic in power relations and disciplinary mechanisms in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]''. [[Derrida]] also elaborated on the relations of animals and humans via the gaze in ''The Animal That Therefore I Am''. The concept of a male gaze was originally theorized by feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]], and has since been applied to many other forms of media and technology, such as advertisements, the work space, and video games.

==In psychoanalysis==

In [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] psychoanalytic theory, it is the anxious state that comes with the awareness that one can be viewed. The psychological effect, Lacan argues, is that the subject loses a degree of autonomy upon realizing that he or she is a visible object. This concept is bound with his theory of the [[mirror stage]], in which a child encountering a mirror realizes that he or she has an external appearance. Lacan suggests that this gaze effect can similarly be produced by any conceivable object such as a chair or a television screen. This is not to say that the object behaves optically as a mirror; instead it means that the [[awareness]] of any object can induce an awareness of also ''being'' an object.

It has also been called an aspect of one of the "most powerful human forces"; that is, "the meeting of the face and the gaze" because "Only there do we exist for one another."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ove Knausgaard, "The Inexplicable," ''The New Yorker,'' May 25, 2015, page 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems of power and the gaze==
[[Michel Foucault]] first used the term "medical gaze" in ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' to explain the process of medical diagnosis, power dynamics between doctors and patients, and the hegemony of medical knowledge in society. He elaborated on the gaze to illustrate a particular dynamic in power relations and disciplinary mechanisms in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', such as surveillance and the function of related disciplinary mechanisms and self-regulation in a prison or school as an apparatus of power.

The gaze is not something one has or uses; rather, it is the relationship into which someone enters. As [[Marita Sturken]] and [[Lisa Cartwright]] write in ''Practices of Looking'', "The gaze is integral to systems of power and ideas about knowledge."&lt;ref name=Cartwright&gt;Sturken, Marita; Cartwright, Lisa. ''Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture''. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 94, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main concepts that Foucault introduced are [[panopticism]], [[power/knowledge]], and [[biopower]]. These concepts all address self-regulation under systems of [[surveillance]]. This refers to how people modify their behaviour under the belief that they are constantly being watched even if they cannot directly see who or what is watching them. This possible surveillance, whether real or unreal, has self-regulating effects.&lt;ref&gt;Sturken, Marita and Lisa Cartwright. ''Practices of Looking: an introduction to visual culture''. Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 106-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The male gaze ==
{{main article|Male gaze}}
In her 1975 essay ''Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema'', [[Laura Mulvey]] introduced the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] concept of "[[male gaze]]" as a feature of gender power asymmetry in film. The concept was present in earlier studies of the gaze,{{specify|date=June 2016}} but it was Mulvey who brought it to the forefront. Mulvey stated that women were objectified in film because heterosexual men were in control of the camera. Hollywood films played to the models of [[voyeurism]] and [[scopophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturken, Marita and Lisa Cartwright. ''Practices of Looking: an introduction to visual culture''. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has subsequently been influential in [[feminist film theory]] and [[media studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, Roberta. ''Interview with Laura Mulvey: Gender, Gaze and Technology in Film Culture''. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, September 2011, 28(5) p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The feminine gaze ==
{{Main article|Judith Butler}}

In [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', she proposed the idea of the feminine gaze as a way in which men choose to perform their masculinity by using women as the ones who force men into self-regulation.

== Imperial gaze&lt;!-- linked from 'Male gaze'--&gt; ==
[[E. Ann Kaplan]] has introduced the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] concept of the imperial gaze, in which the observed find themselves defined in terms of the privileged observer's own set of value-preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Ashcroft et al, ''Post-Colonial Studies'' (2000) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the colonised, the imperial gaze infantilizes and trivializes what it falls upon,&lt;ref&gt;Vijay Mishra, ''Bollywood Cinema'' (2002) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; asserting its command and ordering function as it does so.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Yekani, ''The Privilege of Crisis'' (2011) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan comments: "The imperial gaze reflects the assumption that the white western subject is central much as the male gaze assumes the centrality of the male subject."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Patricia Waugh, ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 514&lt;/ref&gt;

== The oppositional gaze ==
In her 1992 essay titled "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectatorship",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Cultural Reader|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Amelia Jones|year=|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge, 2003|pages=94–105|chapter=The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectator|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bell hooks]] counters [[Laura Mulvey]]'s notion of the [[Male gaze|(male) gaze]] by introducing the oppositional gaze of Black women. This concept exists as the reciprocal of the normative white spectator gaze. As [[Laura Mulvey|Mulvey]]'s essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media and Cultural Studies: Keywords|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner|year=|isbn=|location=2001; Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2006|pages=342–352|chapter=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contextualizes the [[Male gaze|(male) gaze]] and its objectification of white women, [[Bell hooks|hooks]] essay&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; opens "oppositionality [as] a key paradigm in the feminist analysis of the 'gaze' and of scopophilic regimes in Western culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking Differently: A Reader in European Women's Studies|last=Griffin|first=Gabriele, and Rosi Braidotti|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=London: Zed, 2002|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oppositional gaze remains a critique of rebellion due to the sustained and deliberate misrepresentation of Black women in cinema as characteristically [[Mammy archetype|Mammy]], [[Jezebel]] or Sapphire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.|first=West, Carolyn|date=2012-01-01|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire, and Their Homegirls: Developing an "Oppositional Gaze" Toward the Images of Black Women|url=http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_pub/270/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postcolonial gaze===
First referred to by Edward Said as "orientalism", the term "post-colonial gaze" is used to explain the relationship that colonial powers extended to people of colonized countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|title=Orientalism|year=1978|publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing the colonized in a position of the "[[Other (philosophy)#Imperialism and colonialism|other]]" helped to shape and establish the colonial's identity as being the powerful conqueror, and acted as a constant reminder of this idea.&lt;ref name = Beardsell&gt;{{cite book|last=Beardsell|first=Peter|title=Europe and Latin America: Returning the Gaze|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postcolonial gaze "has the function of establishing the subject/object relationship&amp;nbsp;... it indicates at its point of emanation the location of the subject, and at its point of contact the location of the object".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beardsell|first=Peter|title=Europe and Latin America: Returning the Gaze|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, this means that the colonizer/colonized relationship provided the basis for the colonizer's understanding of themselves and their identity.&lt;ref name = Beardsell/&gt; The role of the appropriation of power is central to understanding how colonizers influenced the countries that they colonized, and is deeply connected to the development of post-colonial theory. Utilizing postcolonial gaze theory allows formerly colonized societies to overcome the socially constructed barriers that often prohibit them from expressing their true [[Economic, social and cultural rights|cultural, social, economic]], and [[civil and political rights|political rights]].&lt;ref name = Beardsell/&gt;


'''The international gaze'''
The international gaze is the term used to describe the Neo Liberal and globalising manifestation of the imperial,- / post-colonial gaze. Both latter terms are helpful in defining the dominated status of developing countries. However, the international gaze offers a way of understanding how internationalism, seemingly neutral and optimistic in outlook, is deeply rooted in a discourse of advantage and power. It inculcates an implicit assumption of dominance by those empowered to be international, whilst obviating the innate power relations. This term is first used by A. Gardner-McTaggart (2018) in ''International Capital, International Schools, Leadership and Christianity

''
'''The male tourist gaze'''

The tourism image is created through cultural and ideological constructions and advertising agencies that have been male dominated. What is represented by the media assumes a specific type of tourist: white, Western, male, and heterosexual, privileging the gaze of the "master subject" over others.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pritchard and Morgan|first1=Annette and Nigel|title=Privileging the Male Gaze|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|date=2000|issue=27.4|pages=884–905|doi=10.1016/s0160-7383(99)00113-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the representation of the typical tourist because those behind the lens, the image, and creators are predominantly male, white, and Western. Those that do not fall into this category are influenced by its supremacy. Through these influences female characteristics such as youth, beauty, sexuality, or the possession of a man are desirable while the prevalence of stereotypes consisting of submissive and sensual women with powerful "macho" men in advertising are projected.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7295">'''Golf etiquette''' refers to a set of rules and practices designed to make the game of [[golf]] safer and more enjoyable for golfers and to minimize possible damage to golf equipment and courses. Although many of these practices are not part of the formal [[rules of golf]], golfers are customarily expected to observe them.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/rules_and_equipment/4229612.stm |title=A guide to the rules of golf |work=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=2010-09-08 |date=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[R&amp;A]] rule book states that "[t]he overriding principle is that consideration should be shown to others on the course at all times."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pga.com/golf-instruction/instruction-feature/fundamentals/golf-etiquette|title=Golf Etiquette {{!}} PGA.com|website=www.pga.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairway divots==

Divots should always be repaired, either by placing sand in the divot or replacing the grass, preferably with a driver. Some courses also place containers of divot repair mix on carts and at tees, which can be poured into the divot.&lt;ref name="PGA.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pga.com/golf-instruction/instruction-feature/fundamentals/golf-basics-golf-etiquette-rules-and-glossary|title=Golf Etiquette|publisher=Turner Sports Network|work=Professional Golf Association|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walking==

Golfers should avoid distracting fellow golfers. Golfers should not run during play, but instead walk quickly but lightly during play and remain stationary while others play their shots. Players should be still and remain silent during a fellow player's pre-shot routine and subsequent shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golf Etiquette|url=http://www.pga.com/golf-instruction/instruction-feature/fundamentals/golf-basics-golf-etiquette-rules-and-glossary|work=Professional Golf Association|publisher=Turner Sports Network|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golf carts and equipment==

[[Golf cart]]s should not be used to annoy or distract other players. The cart should be parked on the cart path when at the tee box or putting green.  Carts should normally stay ''only'' on the paths, and are required to do so on many courses. Golfing equipment (bags, clubs and carts) should never be placed in front of the green as annoyance to the approaching players. 

Should carts be permitted off the paths, golfers should observe the "90 degree rule": make a 90 degree turn off the path toward the fairway to a given ball, and return straight back to the path, not along the path of greatest convenience. Carts inflict wear and tear on the course, and can be accidentally driven over another player's ball. Golfers should keep the [[noise]] of backing up to a minimum and must always set the park [[brake]] before disembarking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://golfoid.com/golf-etiquette|title=Golf Etiquette And Rules Every Beginner Should Know And Follow in 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honor==

The player with the best score on the previous hole has the honor of teeing off first.  If there is no outright winner of a hole, then the order of play does not change from the previous tee.  In informal games one can play ready golf and not wait for the best score on the hole to tee up first.

==Ball identification==

A golfer should always know which [[brand]] of ball he or she is using, or mark it to avoid confusion during play.

==Line of sight==

In the tee box, other players should stand alongside the person playing, out of the way and not behind the player getting ready to swing.  Should the player about to play the ball ask his partners to move, the request should be honoured.

==Pitch marks on the green==

A ball hitting the green often leaves an indentation, a [[golf glossary|pitch mark]], where it strikes the ground. These need to be repaired to keep the green in good condition. After golfers have arrived at the green, they should make it a point to find their pitch marks and repair them.

==Putting lines==

Golfers should note each player's putting line, and avoid stepping on it as they play on the green or stand on a line of sight, that is, in the line of sight either ahead or behind a player who is attempting to putt. Players should not stand close to or directly behind the ball, or directly behind the hole, when a player is about to play. In the event that your ball is in another player's line, it is important to mark your ball's position, and only then remove it (pick it up) from the green.&lt;ref name=PGA.com /&gt;

A second but related concern involves the hole itself. A golfer should avoid stepping within at least a one-foot radius of the hole.

==Bunkers==

[[File:Sand bunker golf.jpg|thumb|After a bunker shot a player should rake the sand smooth again]]
According to the rules of golf, a player is not allowed to "ground" the club in any type of hazard. This means that a player getting ready for a shot cannot allow the club to touch the ground, sand, [[water]], or anything else during a practice swing. A player is allowed to thrash as much sand, water, etc., as necessary during the actual shot.

A player should always enter and leave a bunker from the low side. After the shot, a player should [[rake (tool)|rake]] the sand smooth again to leave a fresh surface for other players. Normally, the rake should be replaced alongside the bunker, not inside it.

Not all bunkers must be raked; anything deemed a waste trap does not need to be raked.  Waste traps can be determined by signs or by the overall condition of the bunker.  These bunkers are common in coastal courses (i.e. Myrtle Beach), and at some courses players may be permitted to drive carts in these bunkers.  Players may also ground clubs in all waste bunkers.  If players are unsure whether or not the bunker is a waste bunker, assume it is a regular bunker.

==Slower players==

Slower players should allow following faster players to [[Golf glossary#P|play through]] if there is substantial room in front of them. Golfers should try to follow closely the group ahead of them, and not to be "pushed" by the group behind them.

==Tee==

A golfer should choose the correct tee for their skill level, regardless of where the other members of the group are playing. The different tee lengths are one way to help even the playing field. A golfer should tee the ball between the two markers, within 2 club lengths behind. Should a golfer address the ball, swing and miss, the golfer incurs no penalty (but the stroke counts).  If the ball is moved, anywhere off the tee at address, a one-stroke penalty will be incurred.&lt;ref&gt;R and A&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:9mm-hollowpoint from XC75.jpg|thumb|Gunshot residue from a pistol shot]]
'''Gunshot residue (GSR)''', also known as '''cartridge discharge residue''' (CDR), "gunfire residue" (GFR), or '''firearm discharge residue''' (FDR), is residue deposited on the hands and clothes of someone who discharges a [[firearm]]. It is principally composed of burnt and unburnt particles from the [[explosive primer]], the [[propellant]]—and possibly fragments of the [[bullet]], [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] case, and the firearm.

Law enforcement investigators test the clothing and skin of people for GSR to determine if they were near a gun when it discharged. Gunshot residue can travel over 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 meters) from the gun. At the farthest distance, only a few trace particles may be present.

==History==
In 1971 John Boehm presented some [[micrographs]] of GSR particles found during the examination of bullet entrance holes using a [[scanning electron microscope]]. If the scanning electron microscope is equipped with an [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] detector, the [[chemical elements]] present in such particles, mainly [[lead]], [[antimony]] and [[barium]], can be identified.

In 1979 Wolten et al. proposed a classification of GSR based on composition, [[Morphology (chemistry)|morphology]], and size. Four compositions were considered ''characteristic'':
* [[Lead]], [[antimony]], and [[barium]]
* Barium, [[calcium]], and [[silicon]]
* Antimony
* Barium
The authors proposed some rules about chemical elements that could also be present in these particles.

Wallace and McQuillan published a new classification of the GSR particles in 1984. They labeled as ''unique'' particles those that contain lead, antimony, and barium, or that contain antimony and barium. Wallace and McQuillan also maintained that these particles could contain only some chemical elements.

==Current practice==
In the latest [[ASTM]] Standard Guide for GSR analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive [[X-ray]] [[Spectroscopy|Spectrometry]] (SEM-EDX) particles containing lead, antimony and barium, and respecting some rules related to the morphology and to the presence of other elements are considered characteristic of GSR. The most definitive method to determine whether a particle is characteristic of or consistent with GSR is by its elemental profile. An approach to the identification of particles characteristic of or consistent with GSR is to compare the elemental profile of the recovered particulate with that collected from case-specific known source items, such as the recovered [[weapon]], Cartridge cases or victim-related items whenever necessary. This approach was called ‘‘case by case’’ by Romolo and Margot in an article published in 2001. In 2010 Dalby et al. published the latest review on the subject and concluded that the adoption of a "case by case" approach to GSR analysis must be seen as preferable, in agreement with Romolo and Margot.

In light of similar particles produced from extraneous sources, both Mosher et al. (1998) and Grima et al. (2012) presented evidence of pyrotechnic particles that can be mistakenly identified as GSR. Both publications highlight that certain markers of exclusion and reference to the general population of collected particulate can help the expert in designating GSR-similar particles as [[Fireworks|firework]]-sourced.

Particle analysis by scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector is the most powerful [[forensic]] tool that investigators can use to determine a subject's proximity to a discharging firearm or contact with a surface exposed to GSR (firearm, spent cartridge case, target hole). Test accuracy requires procedures that avoid secondary gunshot residue transfer from police officers onto subjects or items to be tested, and that avoid [[contamination]] in the laboratory.

The two main groups of specialists currently active on gunshot residue analysis are the [[Scientific Working Group]] for Gunshot Residue (SWGGSR) based in USA and the ENFSI EWG Firearms/GSR  Working Group based in Europe.

==Results==
A positive result for GSR from SEM-EDX analysis can mean many things.  Mainly it indicates that the person sampled was either in the vicinity of a gun when it was fired, handled a gun after it was fired, or touched something that was around the gun when it was fired. (For example: When a person goes to the aid of a victim of a gunshot wound, some GSR particles can transfer from the victim.)

A negative result can mean that the person was nowhere near the gun when it was fired, or that they were near it but not close enough for GSR to land on them, or it can mean that the GSR deposited on them wore off. GSR is the consistency of flour and typically only stays on the hands of a living person for 4–6 hours.  Wiping the hands on anything, even putting them in and out of pockets can transfer GSR off the hands.  Victims don't always get GSR on them; even suicide victims can test negative for GSR.

==Matching GSR to a specific source==
If the ammunition used was specifically tagged in some way by special elements, it is possible to know the cartridge used to produce the GSR. Inference about the source of GSR can be based on the examination of the particles found on a suspect and the population of particles found on the victim, in the firearm or in the cartridge case, as suggested by the ASTM Standard Guide for GSR analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry. Advanced analytical techniques such as Ion Beam Analysis (IBA), carried out after Scanning Electron Microscopy, can support further information allowing to infer about the source of GSR particles. Christopher et al. showed as the grouping behaviour of different makes of ammunition can be determined using multivariate analysis. Bullets can be matched back to a gun using comparative ballistics.

==Organic gunshot residue==
[[organic compound|Organic]] gunshot residue can be analysed by [[analytical techniques]] such as [[chromatography]], [[capillary electrophoresis]], and [[mass spectrometry]].

In Sikhism, the ''Haumai'' can only be overcome through meditation on God’s name (''[[Naam]]''), ''[[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]]'' and ''[[Selfless service|Sewa]]''. It is a combination of the words ''Hau'' (ਹਉ) meaning "I" and ''Mai'' (ਮੈ) meaning "me".

The opposite of ''Haumai'' is humility (or ''[[Nimrata]]''), which is considered a virtue in Sikhism. [[Selfless service]] called ''Seva'', and complete submission to [[Waheguru]], or God is the Sikh path to liberation.&lt;ref name=cole9/&gt;

==Related concepts==
The concept of destructive self-centeredness and covetous attachment, similar to ''Haumai'' in Sikhism, is important in other Indian religions. In Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, it is referred to as "Ahankar'' (अहङ्कार), ''Ahammana'' (अहम्मान),  ''Ahammati'' (अहम्मति), ''Mamatta'' (ममता) and ''Maminkāra''.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC|year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skU2AQAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hip hip hooray''' (also '''hippity hip hooray'''; ''Hooray'' may also be spelled and pronounced '''hoorah''', '''hurrah''', '''hurray''' etc.) is a [[cheering|cheer]] called out to express congratulation toward someone or something, in the [[English language|English speaking]] world and elsewhere.

By a sole speaker, it is a form of [[interjection]]. In a group, it takes the form of [[call and response]]: the cheer is initiated by one person exclaiming "Three cheers for...[someone or something]" (or, more archaically, "Three times three"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dlfPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA410 ''Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country, Volume 9'']. 1834, James Fraser.

==History==
The call was recorded in England in the beginning of the 19th century in connection with making a [[Toast (honor)|toast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/453841| issn = 0003-1283| volume = 36| issue = 2| pages = 83–92| last = Read| first = Allen Walker| title = The Rebel Yell as a Linguistic Problem| journal = American Speech| date = 1961-05-01| jstor = 453841}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eighteenth century dictionaries list "Hip" as an attention-getting interjection, and in an example from 1790 it is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Times (London)| date= 1790-11-27| page = 2}} 'Sir Charles engag'd one day at dice / Hip! hip! come hither John, he cries;'&lt;/ref&gt;"Hip-hip" was added as a preparatory call before making a toast or cheer in the early 19th century, probably after 1806.  By 1813, it had reached its modern form, hip-hip-hurrah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Peter Jensen|title=Three Cheers, Hip-Hip-Hurrah and Tom and Jerry|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/05/three-cheers-hip-hip-hurrah-and-tom-and.html|work=Early Sports 'n Pop-Culture Blog|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the word "hip" stems from a [[medieval]] [[Latin]] [[acronym]], "''H''ierosolyma ''E''st ''P''erdita", meaning "Jerusalem is lost",&lt;ref&gt;Gabay's Copywriter's Compendium, Jonathan Gaby, pub.

Cornell's Michael Fontaine disputes this etymology, tracing it to a single letter in an English newspaper published August 28, 1819, some weeks after the riots.  He concludes that the "acrostic interpretation ... has no basis in fact.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fontaine|first=Michael|title=On the Acronym Origin of the English Phrase Hep!

One theory about the origin of "hurrah" is that the Europeans picked up the Mongol exclamation "hooray" as an enthusiastic cry of bravado and mutual encouragement.

'''Hügelkultur''' is a [[horticulture|horticultural]] technique where a mound constructed from decaying wood debris and other [[compost]]able [[biomass]] plant materials is later (or immediately) planted as a [[raised bed]].  Adopted by [[permaculture]] advocates, it is suggested the technique helps to improve soil fertility, water retention, and soil warming, thus benefiting plants grown on or near such mounds.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;&lt;ref name="Permaculture Magazine" /&gt;

==History==
Hügelkultur is a German word meaning mound culture or hill culture.&lt;ref name=Lauterbach /&gt; It is said to have been practiced in German and Eastern European societies for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; 

The term is first published in a 1962 German gardening booklet by Herrman Andrä.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Inspired by observation of the diversity and success of plants growing in a pile of woody debris, "mound culture" is suggested (as opposed to "flatland culture").&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; This was also posited as an easy way to utilise woody debris without burning, which was illegal.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Andrä appears to have been influenced by [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s [[biodynamic agriculture]]. Steiner developed his biodynamic philosophy through [[meditation]] and [[clairvoyance]], and rejected scientific inquiry on the grounds that his methods were “true and correct unto themselves.”&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chalker-Scott |first1=Linda |title=The Science Behind Biodynamic Preparations: A Literature Review |journal=HortTechnology |date=December 2013 |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=814-819 |url=http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/23/6/814.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrä quotes a 1924 lecture on biodynamics by Steiner, which describes mixing of soil with composting or decaying material in earthen hillocks.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Joined by author Hans Beba, another German gardener, "Hill Culture - the horticultural method of the future" was revised and republished several times in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AndräBeba"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Beba, Hans |author2=Andrä, Herrman |title=Hügelkultur – die Gartenbaumethode der Zukunft |publisher=Waerland |location=Mannheim, Germany |edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was later adopted and developed by [[Sepp Holzer]], an Austrian permaculture advocate.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; More recent permaculture advocates such as [[Paul Wheaton]] and [[Geoff Lawton]] strongly promote Hügelkultur beds as a perfect permaculture design.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, Paul, [http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds], retrieved 6/9/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
===Construction===
[[File:End point (4315712587).jpg|thumb|Hügelkultur bed construction, shown without the top layer of soil]]
[[File:Hugelkultur.png|thumb|right|200px|Hügelkultur layout]]
In its basic form, mounds are constructed by piling logs, branches, plant waste, compost and additional soil directly on the ground. The pile has the form of a pyramid. The sides of the two slopes both have a grade of between 65 and 80 degrees.&lt;ref name=Holzer /&gt; The beds are usually about {{convert|3|ft|m}} by {{convert|6|ft|m}} in area and about {{convert|3|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt; However, this height reduces as decomposition progresses.&lt;ref name=Chalker-Scott2017&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chalker-Scott |first1=Linda |title=Hugelkultur: What is it, and should it be used in home  gardens? |url=https://research.wsulibs.wsu.edu:8443/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2376/12233/FS283E.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |publisher=Pullman, Washington : Washington State University Extension |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When positioned on sloped terrain, the beds need to be put at an angle to the hillside (rather than having them parallel to it). This makes sure the beds do not receive unequal amounts of water. In most cases, it is useful to have the beds positioned against the prevailing wind direction.

The raised bed can form light-duty [[swale (landform)|swales]], circles and mazes.&lt;ref name=Hemenway /&gt;&lt;ref name=Feineigle /&gt; Mounds may also be made from alternating layers of wood, sod,&lt;ref name=Shein /&gt; compost, straw, and soil. Although their construction is straightforward, planning is necessary to prevent steep slopes that would result in erosion.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; 

In his book ''Desert or Paradise: Restoring Endangered Landscapes Using Water Management, Including Lake and Pond Construction'', Holzer describes a method of constructing Hügelkultur which incorporates rubbish such as cardboard, clothes and kitchen waste. He recommends building mounds that are {{convert|1|meter|ft}} wide and any length. Mounds are built in a {{convert|0.7|meter|ft}} trench in sandy soil, and without a trench if the ground is wet.&lt;ref name=Holzer /&gt;

===Planting===
The mound is left to rest for several months before planting,&lt;ref name=Chalker-Scott2017 /&gt; although some advise immediate planting.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Anything can be grown on the raised beds, but if the bed will decompose/release its nutrients quickly (so long as it is not made of bulky materials like tree trunks), more demanding crops such as pumpkins, courgettes, cucumbers, cabbages, tomatoes, sweet corn, celery, or potatoes are grown in the first year, after which the bed is used for less demanding crops like beans, peas, and strawberries.
===Lifespan===
The original German publications described the mounds as having a lifespan of 5-6 years, after which they had to be rebuilt from scratch.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt;

==Evidence==
As of 2017 there are no peer-reviewed scientific studies available regarding the efficacy of the technique.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; A few university student projects investigate Hügelkultur but have not been published in scientific journals.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; 

One small scale and short term student project investigated the Hügelkultur method as a potential use for yard trimmings waste, and also if lima beans, kale and okra planted on a Hügelkultur mound showed any signs of nutrient deficiency compared to a non-raised control bed. It was found that over 11 tons of yard trimmings were used in the mound, and no evidence of macronutrient deficiency could be detected in the crops in the short term.&lt;ref name="Adams2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=A |title=UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM SOLID WASTE RESEARCH PROGRAM Student Project Report: Hugelkultur  Gardening Technique Does not Result in Plant  Nutrient  Deficiencies and is a Potential Source Reduction   Strategy for Yard Trimmings Wastes |url=https://www.wisconsin.edu/waste-research/download/2013_student_reports/13%20MSN%20Adams%20Hugelkultur.pdf |date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, despite concerns that incorporation of large quantities of high carbon woody matter would lead to nitrogen immobilization and hence nitrogen deficiency in the crop, a higher level of nitrogen was found in the raised bed. However the micronutrient iron was lower relative to the control bed.&lt;ref name="Adams2013" /&gt; The author speculated that no nitrogen deficiency occurred since the roots of the plants did not penetrate past the superficial layers of the mound into the deeper wood-containing region.&lt;ref name="Adams2013" /&gt;

A student thesis investigated the water holding capacity of Hügelkultur beds and whether the technique could be useful to prevent [[karst]] rocky [[desertification]] in China.&lt;ref name=Laffoon2016&gt;{{cite web |last1=Laffoon |first1=M |title=A Quantitative Analysis Of Hugelkultur And Its Potential Application On Karst Rocky Desertified Areas In China |url=https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1641&amp;context=stu_hon_theses |date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 3 months of measurements, water concentration in hügel mounds remained high. Samples from hugel sites contained almost twice as much water as those from flat control plots. It was suggested that 1 Hectare of hügels has 3-10 times more water than a flat plot affected by karst rocky desertification.&lt;ref name=Laffoon2016 /&gt;

==Theory==
Many publications and websites advocate the technique based on personal experience of the authors.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Some have criticised the technique as lacking genuine scientific principles, and running counter to the ecological principles of soil building with [[litterfall]].&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; 

Hügelkultur is said to replicate the natural process of decomposition that occurs on forest floors, however in natural ecosystems wood would be present at the soil surface.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Trees that fall in a forest often become [[nurse log]]s&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; decaying and providing [[ecological facilitation]] to seedlings. As the wood decays, its porosity increases, allowing it to store water like a sponge. The water is slowly released back into the environment, benefiting nearby plants.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;

Hügelkultur beds are said to be ideal for areas where the underlying soil is of poor quality or compacted. They tend to be easier to maintain due to their relative height above the ground.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; 

Decomposition speed of organic material depends on the [[carbon to nitrogen ratio]] of the material, among other factors. Wood breaks down relatively slowly because it has one of the highest carbon to nitrogen ratios of all organic matter that is used in composting. If the wood is not processed into smaller pieces with larger surface area to speed up chemical reactions, breakdown is even slower. The decomposition process may in the short term take more nitrogen from the soil through microbial activity ([[nitrogen immobilization]]), if not enough nitrogen is available.&lt;ref name="Seymour2008" /&gt; Thus in the short term the fertility of the soil may be decreased before eventually, perhaps after 1-2 years, the nitrogen level is increased past the original level.&lt;ref name="Seymour2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seymour |first1=John |title=The new self-sufficient gardener : the complete illustrated guide to planning, growing, storing and preserving your own garden produce |date=2008 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=London |isbn=978-1405321334 |pages=12,13 |edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally therefore, it is said to be advantageous to balance "browns" (e.g. woodchippings) with "greens" (e.g. leaves) for efficient composting, and to allow compost to become well-rotted before applying it a bed to prevent competition between soil bacteria and plants for nitrogen, reducing yield.

==Criticisms and controversy==
===Hügelkultur mounds as solid earthworks===
[[File:Hugelkultur arboretum.jpg|thumb|Hügelkultur bed with wildflower overplanting]]
Although Hügelkultur beds can safely retain water in light-duty applications (for example, conserving the moisture of rain that falls on the bed), creating heavy-duty rainwater retention areas behind Hügelkultur beds on contour, to catch [[surface runoff]] from surrounding areas, can be dangerous. Some designers conflate the Hügelkultur bed's appearance with that of solid [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], but Hügelkultur beds cannot predictably control large amounts of [[stormwater]] in the way that solid earthworks can. Whereas [[embankment dam]]s or the hillsides of [[swale (landform)|swales]] can be relied on to hold back many thousands of gallons of water for weeks to allow it to seep into the ground, and [[berm]]s can slow runoff, Hügelkultur beds are different in two ways: earthworks have no buoyant core (whereas Hügelkultur mounds contain logs), and the soil that they are made of is compacted. If fresh or dried timber is used in the bed, it may become buoyant in the water-saturated substrate, bursting from the soil covering and releasing all the sitting water through a breach. This can be an issue for years, until the wood is sufficiently rotten and infused with water. Another consideration is that Hügelkultur beds will degrade, shrinking over time into much lower mounds of soft, rich soil. This means that the retention area will have less depth as time goes on, but it also means that the uncompacted soil will remain a threat to breaching even if the logs become saturated.

There is a recorded instance of a breach occurring in a new project. Upon the first rainstorm, the retention areas behind the Hügelkultur beds filled with water and broke through. The released water carried the freshly-buried logs and dirt downhill, smashing a hole in a building being used as a church and filling the space with mud. No injuries were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://permaculturenews.org/2015/11/06/dont-try-building-hugel-swales-this-is-a-very-and-i-mean-very-bad-idea/ |title=Don't Try Building Hugel Swales |publisher=permaculturenews.org |first=Jack |last=Spirko |date=November 6, 2015 |access-date=March 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some permaculturists have taken mild positions against the "hügel swales" still being promoted by other permaculturists, citing the danger and cross-purposes of Hügelkultur beds and swales.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Overfertilization, contamination of soil and water habitats===
Over-fertilized plants are said to have less flavor,&lt;ref name="Holzer2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holzer |first1=Sepp |title=Sepp Holzer's Permaculture: A Practical Guide to Small-Scale, Integrative Farming and Gardening |date=2011 |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |isbn=9781603583831 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNXK9kE-lOoC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and too much nitrogen can be consumed by eating certain plants which have been over-fertilised (e.g. spinach).&lt;ref name="Holzer2011" /&gt; Advocates state that overfertilization is a risk in the first year if woodchips are used, which will break down too fast.&lt;ref name="Holzer2011" /&gt; Instead raised beds made with whole logs release nutrients slowly over a period of years.&lt;ref name="Holzer2011" /&gt; It has been suggested that excessive use of decomposing organic matter in Hügelkultur could leach out and contaminate and disrupt soil and water habitats.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt;

In [[mathematics]], if  &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''inclusion map''' (also '''inclusion function''', '''insertion''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first1 = S. | last1 = Mac Lane | first2 = G. | last2 = Birkhoff | title = Algebra | year = 1967}}, page 5, says "Note that “insertion” is a function &lt;math&gt;S \to U&lt;/math&gt; and "inclusion" a relation &lt;math&gt;S \subset U&lt;/math&gt;; every inclusion relation gives rise to an insertion function."&lt;/ref&gt; or '''canonical injection''') is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; that sends each element, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, treated as an element of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\iota: A\rightarrow B, \qquad \iota(x)=x.&lt;/math&gt;

A "hooked arrow" ({{unichar|21AA|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH HOOK|ulink=Unicode}})&lt;ref name="Unicode Arrows"&gt;{{cite web| title = Arrows – Unicode| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes used in place of the function arrow above to denote an inclusion map; thus: &lt;math&gt;\iota: A\hookrightarrow B.&lt;/math&gt; (On the other hand, this notation is sometimes reserved for [[embedding]]s.)

This and other analogous [[injective]] functions&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = C. | last = Chevalley | title = Fundamental Concepts of Algebra | year = 1956}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[substructure (mathematics)|substructures]] are sometimes called '''natural injections'''.

Given any [[morphism]] ''f'' between [[object (category theory)|objects]] ''X'' and ''Y'', if there is an inclusion map into the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] &lt;math&gt;\iota : A\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, then one can form the [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restriction]] ''fi'' of ''f''.  In many instances, one can also construct a canonical inclusion into the [[codomain]] ''R''→''Y'' known as the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f''.

== Applications of inclusion maps ==
Inclusion maps tend to be [[homomorphism]]s of [[algebraic structure]]s; thus, such inclusion maps are [[embedding]]s.  More precisely, given a sub-structure closed under some operations, the inclusion map will be an embedding for tautological reasons. For example, for a binary operation &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;, to require that

:&lt;math&gt;\iota(x\star y)=\iota(x)\star \iota(y)&lt;/math&gt;

is simply to say that &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; is consistently computed in the sub-structure and the large structure. The case of a [[unary operation]] is similar; but one should also look at [[nullary]] operations, which pick out a ''constant'' element. Here the point is that [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] means such constants must already be given in the substructure.

Inclusion maps are seen in algebraic topology where if ''A'' is a [[strong deformation retract]] of ''X'', the inclusion map yields an isomorphism between all homotopy groups (i.e. is a [[Homotopy|homotopy equivalence]]).

Inclusion maps in [[geometry]] come in different kinds: for example [[embedding]]s of [[submanifold]]s. [[Covariance and contravariance of functors|Contravariant]] objects&lt;ref name=pullback&gt;I.e., objects that have [[pullback]]s; these are called [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] in an older and unrelated terminology&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[differential form]]s ''restrict'' to submanifolds, giving a mapping in the ''other direction''. Another example, more sophisticated, is that of [[affine scheme]]s, for which the inclusions

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(R/I) \to \operatorname{Spec}(R)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(R/I^2) \to \operatorname{Spec}(R)&lt;/math&gt;

may be different [[morphism]]s, where ''R'' is a [[commutative ring]] and ''I'' an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].

'''Infatuation''' or '''being smitten''' is the state of being carried away by an unreasoned passion, usually towards another person for which one has developed strong romantic or platonic feelings.

==Characteristics==
Cox says that infatuation can be distinguished from [[romantic love]] only when looking back on a particular interest. Infatuation may also develop into a mature love.&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. Cox, ''Human Intimacy'' (2008) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein and Brandon describe infatuation as the first stage of a relationship before developing into a mature intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;A. Goldstein and M. Brandon, ''Reclaiming Desire'' (2009) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips describes how the illusions of infatuations inevitably lead to disappointment when learning the truth about a lover.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; It is an object of extravagant, short-lived passion or the temporary love of an adolescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Infatuation meaning - Spinfold|url = http://www.spinfold.com/infatuation-meaning/|website = Spinfold|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==

'It is customary to view young people's dating relationships and first relationships as [[puppy love]] or infatuation';&lt;ref&gt;Vappu Tyyska, ''Long and Winding Road'' (2001) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and if infatuation is both an early stage in a deepening sequence of [[love]]/[[Attachment theory|attachment]], ''and'' at the same time a potential stopping point, it is perhaps no surprise that it is a condition especially prevalent in the first, youthful explorations of the world of relationships. Thus 'the first passionate adoration of a youth for a celebrated actress whom he regards as far above him, to whom he scarcely dares lift his bashful eyes'&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; may be seen as part of an 'infatuation with celebrity especially perilous with the young'.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy W. Quinnan, ''Generation Lost'' (2002) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiration plays a significant part in this, as 'in the case of a schoolgirl crush on a boy or on a male teacher. The girl starts off admiring the teacher..[then] may get hung up on the teacher and follow him around'.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (Penguin 1970) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Then there may be [[shame]] at being confronted with the fact that 'you've got what's called a crush on him...Think if someone was hanging around ''you'', pestering and sighing'.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Wynne Jones, ''[[Fire and Hemlock]]'' (London 2000) p. 347-8&lt;/ref&gt; Of course 'sex may come into this...with an infatuated schoolgirl or schoolboy'&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 108-10&lt;/ref&gt; as well, producing the 'stricken gaze, a compulsive movement of the throat...an "I'm lying down and I don't care if you walk on me, babe", expression'&lt;ref&gt;L J Smith, ''Night World Vol II'' (2009) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; of infatuation. Such a cocktail of emotions 'may even falsify the "erotic sense of reality": when a person in love estimates his partner's virtues he is usually not very realistic...[[Psychological projection|projection]] of all his ideals onto the partner's personality'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

It is this projection that differentiates infatuation from love, according to the spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]]: "In infatuation, the person is a ''passive victim'' of the spell of conceived attraction for the object. In love there is an ''active appreciation'' of the intrinsic worth of the object of love."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org ''Discourses'']. Volume I. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 159. {{ISBN|978-1-880619-09-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance from the object of infatuation—as with [[celebrities]]—can help maintain the infatuated state. A time-honoured cure for the one who 'has a ''tendre''...infatuated' is to have 'thrown them continually together...by doing so you will cure...[or] you will know that it is not an infatuation'.&lt;ref&gt;Georgette Heyer, ''The Grand Sophy'' (London 1974) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Three types of infatuation have been identified by Brown: the first, and perhaps most common, being a state of 'being        'carried away, without insight or proper evaluative judgement, by blind desire'.&lt;ref name=brown-38&gt;Brown, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The second, 'evaluation...may well be sound although the craving or love remains unaffected by it'; while 'a third type is that of the agent who exhibits bad judgement and misevaluation for reasons such as ignorance or recklessness', regardless of their desire.&lt;ref name=brown-38/&gt;

==In transference==

In [[psychoanalysis]], a sign that the method is taking hold is 'the initial infatuation to be observed at the beginning of treatment',&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; the beginning of [[transference]]. The patient, in [[Freud]]'s words, 'develops a special interest in the person of the doctor...never tires in his home of praising the doctor and of extolling ever new qualities in him'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; What occurs, 'it is usually maintained...is a sort of false love, a shadow of love', replicating in its course the infatuations of 'what is called true love'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan,''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1993) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Some however claim that it is wrong to convince the patient 'that their love is an illusion...that it's not you she loves. Freud was off base when he wrote that. It ''is'' you. Who else could it be?'&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;—thereby taking 'the question of what is called true love...further than it had ever been taken'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Fundamental'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, in [[countertransference]], the therapist may become infatuated with his/her client: 'very good-looking...she was the most gratifying of patients. She made literary allusions and understood the ones he made....He was dazzled by her, a little in love with her. After two years, the analysis ground down to a horrible halt'.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual infatuations==

Infatuations need not only involve people, but can extend to objects, activities, and ideas. 'Men are always falling in love with other men...with their war heroes and sport heroes':&lt;ref&gt;Carol O'Connell, ''Flight of the Stone Angel'' (London 1997) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; with institutions, discourses and [[role model]]s. Thus for example [[Jung]]'s initial '"unconditional devotion" to Freud's theories and his "no less unconditional veneration" of Freud's person' was seen at the time by both men as a 'quasi-religious infatuation to...a [[cult]] object';&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (London 1989) p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; while Freud in turn was 'very attracted by Jung's personality',&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (Penguin 1964) p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps 'saw in Jung an idealized version of himself':&lt;ref&gt;Frank McLynn, ''Carl Gustav Jung'' (London 1996) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; a [[wiktionary:mutual admiration society|mutual admiration society]]—'intellectually infatuated with one another'.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony stevens, ''Jung'' (Oxford 1994) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman too might have 'had a hankering for one ''guru'' after another...she loved being a pupil.'&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Snow, ''Corridors of Power''  (Penguin 1975) p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

But there are also collective infatuations: 'we are all prone to being drawn into ''social phantasy systems'' '.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1972) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for instance 'the recent intellectual infatuation with [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]]'&lt;ref&gt;Sally Banes, ''Terpsichore in Sneakers'' (1980) p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; arguably lasted at least until '[[September 11 attacks|September 11]] ended intellectual infatuation with [[postmodernism]]'&lt;ref&gt;David Stoesz, ''Quixote's Ghost'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; as a whole.

[[Economic bubbles]] thrive on collective infatuations of a different kind: 'all boom-bust processes contain an element of misunderstanding or misconception',&lt;ref&gt;George Soros, ''The New Paradigms for Financial Markets'' (London 2008) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; whether it is the 'infatuation with...becoming the latest [[Dot-com company|dot.com]] billionaire',&lt;ref&gt;Haynes Johnson, ''The Best of Times'' (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; or the one that followed with [[subprime mortgage]]s, once '[[Alan Greenspan|Greenspan]] had replaced the tech bubble with a housing bubble'.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Zuckerman, ''[[The Greatest Trade Ever]]'' (London 2010) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; As markets 'swung virtually overnight from euphoria to fear' in the [[Financial crisis (2007-present)|credit crunch]], even the most hardened [[Market fundamentalism|market fundamentalist]] had to concede that such 'periodic surges of euphoria and fear are manifestations of deep-seated aspects of human nature'&lt;ref&gt;Alan Greenspan, ''The Age of Turbulence'' (Penguin 2008) p. 520-3&lt;/ref&gt;—whether these are enacted in home-room infatuations or upon the global stage.

==Literary depictions==

[[Shakespeare's sonnets]] have been described as a "Poetics for Infatuation"; as being dominated by one theme, and 'that theme is infatuation, its initiation, cultivation, and history, together with its peaks of triumph and devastation'—a lengthy exploration of the condition of being 'subject to the appropriate disorders that belong to our infatuation...the condition of infatuation.'&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Blackmur/J. T Jones, ''Outsider at the Heart of Things'' (1989) p. 242 and p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jens Galschiøt''', (Born 4 June 1954), is a Danish [[sculpture|sculptor]] best known for the [[Pillar of Shame]]. Galschiøt moved to [[Odense]] in 1973, and in 1985 he opened a 2000 square metre combined foundry, studio, [[Gallery Galschiøt]] and sculpture park.&lt;ref name=askart&gt;{{cite web | title =Jens Galschiot (1954 - )| work =The Artists' Bluebook - Worldwide Edition | publisher =AskART | url =http://www.askart.com/AskART/G/Jens_Galschiot/Jens_Galschiot.aspx?searchtype=SUMMARY&amp;artist=11101977 | accessdate =2009-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Galschiøt, [[Erik Mortensen]] and [[Jean Voigt]], created the sculpture ''The Ringwearer's Jacket'', which was commissioned by the Clothing Industry’s Union of Denmark for Queen [[Margrethe II]]’s 50th birthday. Galschiøt contributed work to the [[Seville Expo '92]].

Jens Galschiot is a very complex artist, who moves around in the main distributing frame as, [[Installation art]] , [[Conceptual art]], [[Happening]], [[Performance art]] and [[Street art|Street Art]] with clear references to "social sculptures" (Joseph Beuys), [[Symbolisme (stilperiode)|Symbolism]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. Jens Galschiot mainly works with sculptures to fight the injustice in the world, and puts them up in big squares and cities all around the world. The sculptures are mainly made in [[bronze]] and paid for with his own money.

In 1997, he created the [[Pillar of Shame]] in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Indie1997"&gt;{{cite news

In 2008, Galschiøt started ''The Color Orange'' campaign against human rights violations in China. He was denied entry to Hong Kong, where he had intended to paint the [[Pillar of Shame]] orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Pan | first =Aaron | title =Hong Kong Hosts Torch Relay Amid Support, Criticism | work =News - Asia | publisher =Bloomberg | date =2 May 2008 | url =https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?sid=aXX_8VM2uAZ4&amp;pid=20601080 | accessdate =2009-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works for awards==

Jens Galschiøt has made several works for awards over the past years, and many are given annually. Some of them are mentioned here:

'''''The Showbiz of 1993'''''. A mask of bronze. The prize is given once a year by the Kolding Theatre
to an outstanding character in cultural life.

'''''Wing'''''. Sculpture for the Phoenix Architectural Competition, ‘Function and Form 1991’.

'''''Hans Christian Andersen Prize'''''.&lt;ref name="artPublic"&gt;{{cite web

{{main|Pillar of Shame}}[[File:Pillar of Shame in Orange Color 02a (crop).jpg|thumb|Pillar of Shame in Orange Color 02a (crop)]][[Pillar of Shame]] is a series of Galschiøt's sculptures.

The Pillar was later moved to a site at the entrance of the village of [[Acteal]] in [[Chiapas]], where 45 unarmed indigenous people were killed by a paramilitary group on 22 December 1997. The re-erection of the sculpture was attended by hundreds of local people. On 22 December 2003, plates in the local language [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]] were donated to the inhabitants of Acteal. The original plates on the Pillar were in Spanish and English - languages that many indigenous people do not understand.

The Minister of Justice said that: "This sculpture will never be set up in front of the Brazilian Parliament."{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} On 1 May, the [[Pillar of Shame]] was permanently erected in [[Belém]], capital of the northern
state of Pará, where the [[Eldorado dos Carajás massacre|Eldorado massacre]] had taken place in connection with a land occupation. Mayor [[Edmilson Rodrigues]] declared at the inauguration: "Despite of resistance from the elite, we stick to our promise of setting up the [[Pillar of Shame]] as a symbol opposing oppression and violence that is taking a toll of lives and depriving people of
their rights".{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Cocoon==

''The Cocoon'' is a sculpture group made for the Danish exhibition in the Art Pavilion at the World Exhibition,
[[Seville Expo '92]], Spain. The Cocoon consists of 22 steel shields, each measuring

The exhibition was arranged in cooperation with The Mobile Gallery in Kolding that had received a 76-metre-long submarine as a gift from Gorbatjev.&lt;ref&gt;Folkebladet Sydjylland, 4. oct 1991, 23. May 1992&lt;/ref&gt; French artist [[:fr:Jean Dewasne|Jean Dewasne]] was responsible for the outside ornamentation, Galschiot for the inside fitting up of the submarine.

The purpose was, in an untraditional way, to focus on the increasing violence, intolerance, [[racism]] and persecution of minorities, that Europe is witnessing these years. In November 1993, the twenty sculptures of [[my inner beast]] were erected within 55 hours without the knowledge of the authorities. The sculptures created a lot of commotion and debate in political circles, in the press&lt;ref&gt;Berlingske Tidende, Jyllandsposten, Aalborg stiftstidende, Jydske vestkysten, fyens stiftstidende, Det fri aktuelt, 8. nov 1993 - 17. nov 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and in the public. In several places, a permanent position has been found for my inner beast that was a gift to each city. More than 100 volunteers contributed to the happening.

===The Beast - 10 years after===
On the occasion of the 10th anniversary, Jens Galschiot and his staff initiated a search to find
out what has happened to each of the 20 sculptures. The fate of the Beasts varies quite a lot. In some cities the statue has been hidden away or even destroyed. In other cities the Beast has found a prominent site.&lt;ref&gt;Herning Folkeblad, 8. dec 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In Bonn it has even been incorporated in the German state’s art collection, and the statue also found a permanent place in Copenhagen, Milano,&lt;ref name="aidoh_links"&gt;{{cite web

== The Children of Abraham ==
[[The Children of Abraham]] is a dialogue project created by Jens Galschiøt, which highlights the three monotheistic religions: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The project consists of the sculpture [[Fundamentalism (sculpture)|Fundamentalism]], where 600 quotes from the [[Torah]], the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]] are displayed on the sculpture. The sculpture consists of letters forming the word “Fundamentalism”, and the letters are 3,5 meters tall and the sculpture is 9 meters in diameters.

Galschiot has also created “Pillars of Scriptures” for the project, where the 600 quotes are displayed on monitors. The project has been exhibited at [[Silkeborg Bad]] in January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silkeborgbad.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/filer/information/KunstCentretSilkeborgBadogAbrahamsBoernENG.pdf|title=Silkeborg Bad|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is going to be exhibited at the festival Heavenly Days in [[Copenhagen]] in 2016.

==Gallery==
Galshiøt maintains a workshop and gallery in northern Odense. It includes an exhibition hall containing Galschiøt's sculptures and art, along with painting exhibitions by artists associated with the workshop. There is also a gallery with room for more than 300 guests, which is also used for concerts, debates and conferences. In addition to the gallery there is a small shop with small sculptures and jewellery cast in the workshop, a TV production company, an art school, a willow weaver workshop and a sculpture park. Entrance is free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallerigalschiot.dk/info_en.html|title=Gallery Galshciot - Info - Gallery &amp; Museum, Meeting Center, Sculpture Studio|website=www.gallerigalschiot.dk|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skulpturparkbillund.dk/en/the-artists/jens-galschioet.html|title=skulpturpark-billund.dk: Jens Galschiøt|website=www.skulpturparkbillund.dk|access-date=2016-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323215640/http://www.skulpturparkbillund.dk/en/the-artists/jens-galschioet.html#|archive-date=2016-03-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galschiøt's foundry works with bronze and silver castings from a few grams, up to 400&amp;nbsp;kg. It is presently one of the few places in Denmark where precious metal casters are educated.

In the 1960s, the buildings were built for the Næsby Car Body Factory and served for many years as one of the largest garages at [[Funen]], but in the context of the economic crisis in the late 1990s the factory closed, and the buildings stood empty for five years. In 1994 Galschiøt bought the factory complex along with several of the surrounding buildings and adjoining land so that the area now is about 10,000 square metres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2635">In the mathematical field of [[differential geometry]], the '''Kulkarni–Nomizu product''' (named for [[Ravindra Shripad Kulkarni]] and [[Katsumi Nomizu]]) is defined for two (0,2)-tensors and gives as a result a (0,4)-tensor. 

If ''h'' and ''k'' are symmetric (0,2)-tensors, then the product is defined via:

:&lt;math&gt;(h {~\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\;\bigcirc~} k)(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) := h(X_1,X_3)k(X_2,X_4) + h(X_2,X_4)k(X_1,X_3) - h(X_1,X_4)k(X_2,X_3) - h(X_2,X_3)k(X_1,X_4) &lt;/math&gt;
where the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are tangent vectors.

Note that &lt;math&gt;h {~\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\;\bigcirc~} k = k {~\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\;\bigcirc~} h&lt;/math&gt;.  The Kulkarni–Nomizu product is a special case of the product in the graded algebra
:&lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_{p=1}^n S^2(\Omega^p M),&lt;/math&gt;
where, on simple elements,
:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha\cdot\beta) {~\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\;\bigcirc~} (\gamma\cdot\delta) = (\alpha\wedge\gamma)\odot(\beta\wedge\delta)&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Symmetric tensor#Symmetric product|symmetric product]]).

The Kulkarni–Nomizu product of a pair of symmetric tensors has the algebraic symmetries of the [[Riemann tensor]].  It is thus commonly used to express the contribution that the [[Ricci curvature]] (or rather, the [[Schouten tensor]]) and the [[Weyl tensor]] each makes to the [[curvature of Riemannian manifolds|curvature]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]].  This so-called [[Ricci decomposition]] is useful in [[differential geometry]].

When there is a [[metric tensor]] ''g'', the Kulkarni–Nomizu product of ''g'' with itself is the identity endomorphism of the space of 2-forms, Ω&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M''), under the identification (using the metric) of the endomorphism ring End(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')) with the tensor product Ω&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')&amp;nbsp;⊗&amp;nbsp;Ω&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'').

A Riemannian manifold has constant [[sectional curvature]] ''k'' if and only if the Riemann tensor has the form
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{k}{2}g {~\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\;\bigcirc~} g&lt;/math&gt;
where ''g'' is the [[metric tensor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9040">{{Taxation}}
A '''landfill tax''' or '''levy''' is a form of [[tax]] that is applied in some countries to increase the cost of [[landfill]]. The tax is typically levied in units of currency per unit of weight or volume (£/t, €/t, $/yard³). The tax is in addition to the overall cost of landfill and forms a proportion of the [[gate fee]].

==Reasons for landfill tax==
A tax or fee may be imposed on landfills or other disposal facilities as a means of raising general revenues, to generate funds for inspection programs or long-term mitigation of environmental impacts related to disposal, or as a means of inhibiting disposal by raising the cost in comparison to preferable alternatives, in the same manner as an [[excise tax|excise]] or "[[sin tax]]".

Landfilling is discouraged due to a number of key reasons:

*[[Climate change]] caused by [[landfill gas]] from [[biodegradable waste]]
*Loss of resources
**Constraints on areas suitable for landfill sites
**Loss of recyclable components of waste landfilled
* [[Nimby]] objections causing political problems

==Landfill tax by country==
&lt;!--

Is it at a state rather than federal level?

see also Environmental Protection Regulations 1987 
===Australia===

 --&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]] the [[Waste Minimisation Act 2008]] allowed for the charging of a landfill levy. Half of the landfill levy goes to local authorities with the other half going into a Waste Minimisation Fund. As of 2010 it is set at $10 a tonne but it can be reviewed by the Minister for the Environment.&lt;ref name="mfe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/waste/waste-disposal-levy/faq.html|title=Waste Disposal Levy FAQs|date=22 September 2009|publisher=Ministry for the Environment|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Landfill Tax was introduced in 1996 by Conservative Secretary of State for the Environment, [[John Gummer]], and was the UK's first environmental tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00237/SN00237.pdf|title=Landfill tax : introduction &amp; early history|website=parliament.uk|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Landfill Tax Regulations 1996|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1527/introduction/made|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax is seen as a key mechanism in enabling the UK to meet its targets set out in the [[Landfill Directive]] for the landfilling of biodegradable waste. Through increasing the cost of landfill, other [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|advanced waste treatment technologies]] with higher gate fees are made to become more financially attractive.

The amount of tax levied is calculated according to the weight of the material disposed of and whether it is active or inactive waste.

*Inactive waste covers most materials used in a building's fabric as well as earth excavated for foundations. Most forms of concrete, brick, glass, soil, clay and gravel are classified as inactive.
*Active waste covers all other forms of waste such as wood, ductwork, piping and plastics.

Inevitably there will be some mixing of waste such as inert bricks and concrete mixed with small amounts of wood or mineral dust packaged in polythene bags. It is for the producer of the waste to decide what is reasonable and acceptable in terms of active waste contamination of inert waste.

The landfill site operator is responsible for paying the tax and will pass the cost on to businesses and local councils on top of normal landfill fees. VAT is charged on the landfill fees and the landfill tax.

Operators can reduce their tax liability by making payments to the Landfill Communities Fund under the [[Landfill Tax Credit Scheme]]. The fund aids community or environmental projects in the vicinity of a landfill site and is regulated by ENTRUST, a company limited by guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrust.org.uk/landfill-community-fund|title=Landfill Communities Fund|website=www.entrust.org.uk|publisher=ENTRUST|access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landfill tax rates 2013–2014'''

*Standard rate for active waste: £80 per tonne&lt;ref&gt;[[Finance Act 2012]], section 205.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.50 per tonne

Sections from the coalition government's Emergency Budget 2010:
*2.128 The standard rate of landfill tax will increase by £8 per tonne each year from 1 April 2011 until at least 2014. There will be a floor under the standard rate at £80 per tonne, so that the rate will not fall below £80 per tonne from April 2014 until at least 2020.
*2.129 New qualifying criteria for lower rated wastes will be legislated in the Finance Bill introduced in the autumn (2010), to come into effect on 1 April 2011.

'''Landfill tax rates 2015–16'''

From 1 April 2015 to April 2016 the landfill tax rates were:
* Standard rate for active waste: £82.60 per tonne&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EfW, landfill, RDF - letsrecycle.com|url = http://www.letsrecycle.com/prices/efw-landfill-rdf-2/|website = letsrecycle.com|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.60 per tonne

With the [[Scotland Act 2012]], the [[Scottish Government]] gained the devolved power to levy its own landfill tax. The [[Scottish Landfill Tax]] was introduced by the [[Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014]] and began to be payable on 1 April 2015.&lt;ref name="ZeroWaste"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/landfill-tax-scotland-0|title=A landfill tax for Scotland|website=zerowastescotland.org.uk|publisher=Zero Waste Scotland|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LegislationSCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/2/|title=Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RevenueScotland"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.scot/scottish-landfill-tax|title=Scottish Landfill Tax|website=Revenue Scotland|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 and 2016, there were concerns that some companies disposing waste to landfill were wrongly putting waste with a biodegradable and non-inert content into landfills at the inactive waste taxation level. A new testing regime was introduced, where a small amount of the load is tested to ascertain its biodegradable content.

'''Landfill tax rates 2018-19'''

From 1 April 2018 to April 2019 the landfill tax rates are:
* Standard rate for active waste: £88.95 per tonne
* Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.80 per tonne

The [[Welsh Government]] will take responsibility for the tax in Wales from April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrust.org.uk/landfill-community-fund/wales/|title=The LCF in Wales|website=ENTRUST|access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The United States has numerous federal laws and regulations regarding the operation of landfills,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} but there is no national landfill tax or fee.  Many{{Which|date=October 2009}} states and local governments collect fees and taxes on the collection or disposal of solid waste.

==== California ====
Landfills in California are subject to fees and taxes levied by cities and counties, as well as by the state.  The Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 authorized a state fee (set at $1.40 per ton effective 2002-07-01) to fund the activities of the [[California Integrated Waste Management Board]] (CIWMB).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/agendas/mtgdocs/2001/06/00005641.doc California Integrated Waste Management Board, June 19–21, 2001, Agenda Item 28] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cities and counties collect fees from landfills within their jurisdiction to recover the costs of local solid waste planning and inspection programs, to operate programs for the collection and disposal of household [[hazardous wastes]], and to fund some costs of recycling and reuse programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=prc&amp;group=41001-42000&amp;file=41900-41904 California Public Resources Code, Section 41900 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landfills in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] are subject to the highest disposal tax in California, with the Disposal Facility Tax set at $13.00 per ton in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14367&amp;sid=5 San Jose Municipal Code, Chapter 4.78]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9983">In [[mathematics]], a '''limit point''' (or '''cluster point''' or '''accumulation point''') of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a point ''x'' that can be "approximated" by points of ''S'' in the sense that every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x'' with respect to the [[topology]] on ''X'' also contains a point of ''S'' other than ''x'' itself. A limit point of a set ''S'' does not itself have to be an element of ''S''.

This concept profitably generalizes the notion of a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] and is the underpinning of concepts such as [[closed set]] and [[topological closure]]. Indeed, a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points, and the topological closure operation can be thought of as an operation that enriches a set by uniting it with its limit points.

There is also a closely related concept for [[sequence|sequences]]. A '''cluster point''' (or '''accumulation point''') of a [[sequence]] (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a point ''x'' such that, for every neighbourhood ''V'' of ''x'', there are infinitely many natural numbers ''n'' such that ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V''. This concept generalizes to [[net (mathematics)|nets]] and [[filter (mathematics)|filters]]. 

==Definition==
Let ''S'' be a subset of a [[topological space]] ''X''. 
A point ''x'' in ''X'' is a '''limit point''' (or '''cluster point''' or '''accumulation point''') of ''S'' if every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x'' contains at least one point of ''S'' different from ''x'' itself. 

Note that it doesn't make a difference if we restrict the condition to open neighbourhoods only. It is often convenient to use the "open neighbourhood" form of the definition to show that a point is a limit point and to use the "general neighbourhood" form of the definition to derive facts from a known limit point. 

If ''X'' is a [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]] (which all [[metric space|metric spaces]] are), then ''x'' &amp;isin; ''X'' is a limit point of ''S'' if and only if every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains infinitely many points of ''S''. Indeed, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spaces are characterized by this property. 

If ''X'' is a [[sequential space#Fréchet-Urysohn space|Fréchet–Urysohn space]] (which all [[metric space|metric spaces]] and [[first-countable space|first-countable spaces]] are), then ''x'' &amp;isin; ''X'' is a limit point of ''S'' if and only if there is a [[sequence]] of points in ''S''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{''x''} whose [[limit of a sequence|limit]] is ''x''. Indeed, Fréchet–Urysohn spaces are characterized by this property.

==Types of limit points==
{| style="float:right"
| [[File:Diagonal argument.svg|thumb|A sequence enumerating all positive [[rational number]]s. Each positive [[real number]] is a cluster point.]]
|}
{| style="float:right"
| [[File:Rational sequence with 2 accumulation points svg.svg|thumb|400px|With respect to the usual [[Topological space#Examples of topological spaces|Euclidean topology]], the sequence of rational numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (-1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;·{{sfrac|''n''|''n''+1}} has no ''[[Limit of a sequence#Topological spaces|limit]]'' (i.e. does not converge), but has two accumulation points (which are considered ''limit points'' here), viz. -1 and +1. Thus, thinking of sets, these points are limit points of the set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}.]]
|}
If every open set containing ''x'' contains infinitely many points of ''S'' then ''x'' is a specific type of limit point called an '''ω-accumulation point of ''S'''''.

If every open set containing ''x'' contains uncountably many points of ''S'' then ''x'' is a specific type of limit point called a '''[[condensation point]] of ''S'''''.

If every open set ''U'' containing ''x'' satisfies {{nowrap|{{!}}''U'' &amp;cap; ''S''{{!}} {{=}} {{!}}''S''{{!}}}} then ''x'' is a specific type of limit point called a '''{{visible anchor|complete accumulation point}} of ''S'''''.

==For Sequences and Nets==
In a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a point &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''cluster point'''  (or '''accumulation point''') of a sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} &lt;/math&gt; if, for every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, there are infinitely many &lt;math&gt; n \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x_n \in V &lt;/math&gt;. It is equivalent to say that for every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt; n_0 \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;, there is some &lt;math&gt; n \geq n_0 &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x_n \in V &lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric space]] or a [[first-countable space]]  (or, more generally, a [[Fréchet–Urysohn space]]), then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is cluster point of &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x &lt;/math&gt; is a limit of some subsequence of &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} &lt;/math&gt;. 
The set of all cluster points of a sequence is sometimes called the [[limit set]]. 

The concept of a [[net (mathematics)|net]] generalizes the idea of a [[sequence]]. A net is a function &lt;math&gt;f:(P,\le)\to X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(P,\le) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[directed set]] and &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a topological space. A point &lt;math&gt;x\in X &lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''cluster point'''  (or '''accumulation point''') of the net &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt; if, for every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;p_0 \in P&lt;/math&gt;, there is some &lt;math&gt; p \ge p_0  &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f(p)\in V &lt;/math&gt;, equivalently, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Subnet (mathematics)|subnet]] which converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Cluster points in nets encompass the idea of both condensation points and ω-accumulation points. Clustering and limit points are also defined for the related topic of [[filter (mathematics)|filters]].

==Some Facts==
*We have the following characterization of limit points: ''x'' is a limit point of ''S'' if and only if it is in the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''S'' \ {''x''}.
**''Proof'': We use the fact that a point is in the closure of a set if and only if every neighborhood of the point meets the set. Now, ''x'' is a limit point of ''S'', if and only if every neighborhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S'' other than ''x'', if and only if every neighborhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S'' \ {''x''}, if and only if ''x'' is in the closure of ''S'' \ {''x''}.
*If we use L(''S'') to denote the set of limit points of ''S'', then we have the following characterization of the closure of ''S'': The closure of ''S'' is equal to the union of ''S'' and L(''S''). This fact is sometimes taken as the ''definition'' of [[closure (topology)|closure]].
**''Proof'': ("Left subset") Suppose ''x'' is in the closure of ''S''. If ''x'' is in ''S'', we are done. If ''x'' is not in ''S'', then every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S'', and this point cannot be ''x''. In other words, ''x'' is a limit point of ''S'' and ''x'' is in L(''S''). ("Right subset") If ''x'' is in ''S'', then every neighbourhood of ''x'' clearly meets ''S'', so ''x'' is in the closure of ''S''. If ''x'' is in L(''S''), then every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S'' (other than ''x''), so ''x'' is again in the closure of ''S''. This completes the proof.
*A corollary of this result gives us a characterisation of closed sets: A set ''S'' is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points.
**''Proof'': ''S'' is closed if and only if ''S'' is equal to its closure if and only if ''S'' = ''S'' ∪ L(''S'') if and only if L(''S'') is contained in ''S''.
**''Another proof'': Let ''S'' be a closed set and ''x'' a limit point of ''S''. If ''x'' is not in ''S'',  then the complement to ''S'' comprises an open neighbourhood of ''x''. Since ''x'' is a limit point of ''S'', any open neighbourhood of ''x'' should have a non-trivial intersection with ''S''. However, a set can not have a non-trivial intersection with its complement. Conversely, assume ''S'' contains all its limit points. We shall show that the complement of ''S'' is an open set. Let ''x'' be a point in the complement of ''S''. By assumption, ''x'' is not a limit point, and hence there exists an open neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' that does not intersect ''S'', and so ''U'' lies entirely in the complement of ''S''. Since this argument holds for arbitrary ''x'' in the complement of ''S'', the complement of ''S'' can be expressed as a union of open neighbourhoods of the points in the complement of ''S''. Hence the complement of ''S'' is open.
*No [[isolated point]] is a limit point of any set.
**''Proof'': If ''x'' is an isolated point, then {''x''} is a neighbourhood of ''x'' that contains no points other than ''x''.
*A space ''X'' is [[discrete space|discrete]] if and only if no subset of ''X'' has a limit point.
**''Proof'': If ''X'' is discrete, then every point is isolated and cannot be a limit point of any set. Conversely, if ''X'' is not discrete, then there is a singleton {''x''} that is not open. Hence, every open neighbourhood of {''x''} contains a point ''y'' ≠ ''x'', and so ''x'' is a limit point of ''X''.
* If a space ''X'' has the [[trivial topology]] and ''S'' is a subset of ''X'' with more than one element, then all elements of ''X'' are limit points of ''S''. If ''S'' is a singleton, then every point of ''X'' \ ''S'' is still a limit point of ''S''.
**''Proof'': As long as ''S'' \ {''x''} is nonempty, its closure will be ''X''. It's only empty when ''S'' is empty or ''x'' is the unique element of ''S''.
* By definition, every limit point is an [[adherent point]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42851">'''Lip reading''', also known as lipreading or '''speechreading''', is a technique of understanding [[speech]] by visually interpreting the movements of the lips, face and tongue when normal sound is not available. It relies also on information provided by the context, knowledge of the language, and any residual hearing. Although ostensibly used by deaf and hard-of-hearing people, most people with normal hearing process some speech information from sight of the moving mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodhouse | first1 = L | last2 = Hickson | first2 = L | last3 = Dodd | first3 = B | year = 2009 | title = Review of visual speech perception by hearing and hearing-impaired people: clinical implications | url = | journal = International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 253–70 | doi = 10.1080/13682820802090281 | pmid = 18821117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

Although [[speech perception]] is considered to be an auditory skill, it is intrinsically multimodal, since producing speech requires the speaker to make  movements of the lips, teeth and tongue which are often visible in face-to-face communication. Information from the lips and face supports aural comprehension &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 5808871 | volume=12 | title=Interaction of audition and vision in the recognition of oral speech stimuli | year=1969 | journal=J Speech Hear Res | pages=423–5 | last1 = Erber | first1 = NP | doi=10.1044/jshr.1202.423}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most fluent listeners of a language are sensitive to seen speech actions (see [[McGurk effect]]).  The extent to which people make use of seen speech actions varies with the visibility of the speech action and the knowledge and skill of the perceiver.

===Phonemes and visemes===
The [[phoneme]] is the smallest detectable unit of sound in a language that serves to distinguish words from one another. /pit/ and /pik/ differ by one phoneme and refer to different concepts. Spoken English has about 44 phonemes. For lip reading, the number of visually distinctive units - [[viseme]]s - is much smaller, thus several phonemes map onto a few visemes. This is because many phonemes are produced within the mouth and throat, and cannot be seen. These include [[glottal consonants]] and most gestures of the tongue. [[Voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] pairs look identical, such as [p] and [b], [k] and [g], [t] and [d], [f] and [v], and [s] and [z]; likewise for [[nasalisation]] (e.g. [m] vs. [b]). [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homophene Homophenes] are words that look similar when lip read, but which contain different phonemes. Because there are about three times as many phonemes as visemes in English, it is often claimed that only 30% of speech can be lip read. Homophenes are a crucial source of  [[Bad Lip Reading|mis-lip reading]].

[[File:  Sam Loyd lipreading puzzle.jpg|thumb| The legend to this puzzle reads "Here is a class of a dozen boys, who, being called up to give their names were photographed by the instantaneous process just as each one was commencing to pronounce his own name. The twelve names were Oom, Alden, Eastman, Alfred, Arthur, Luke, Fletcher, Matthew, Theodore, Richard, Shirmer, and Hisswald. Now it would not seem possible to be able to give the correct name to each of the twelve boys, but if you practice the list over to each one, you will find it not a difficult task to locate the proper name for every one of the boys."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Loyd|Sam Loyd's]] Cyclopedia of Puzzles, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;
]]

===[[Co-articulation]]===
Visemes can be captured as still images, but speech unfolds in time. The smooth articulation of speech sounds in sequence can mean that mouth patterns may be ‘shaped’ by an adjacent phoneme:  the ‘th’ sound in ‘tooth’ and in ‘teeth’ appears very different because of the [[vowel|vocalic]] context. This feature of dynamic speech-reading affects lip-reading 'beyond the viseme'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7162162 | volume=25 | title=Coarticulation effects in lipreading | year=1982 | journal=J Speech Hear Res | pages=600–7 | last1 = Benguerel | first1 = AP | last2 = Pichora-Fuller | first2 = MK | doi=10.1044/jshr.2504.600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===How can it 'work' with so few visemes?===
The statistical distribution of phonemes within the lexicon of a language is uneven. While there are clusters of words which are phonemically similar to each other ('lexical neighbors', such as spit/sip/sit/stick...etc.), others are unlike all other words: they are 'unique' in terms of the distribution of their phonemes ('umbrella' may be an example). Skilled users of the language bring this knowledge to bear when interpreting speech, so it is generally harder to identify a heard word with many lexical neighbors than one with few neighbors. Applying this insight to seen speech, some words in the language can be unambiguously lip-read even when they contain few visemes - simply because no other words could possibly 'fit'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Auer | first1 = ET | year = 2010 | title = Investigating speechreading and deafness | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Audiology | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 163–8 | doi = 10.3766/jaaa.21.3.4 | pmid = 20211120 | pmc = 3715375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variation in readability and skill===
Many factors affect the visibility of a speaking face, including illumination, movement of the head/camera, frame-rate of the moving image and distance from the viewer (see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = TR | last2 = Thomas | first2 = SM | year = 2011 | title = When half a face is as good as a whole: effects of simple substantial occlusion on visual and audiovisual speech perception | url = | journal = Atten Percept Psychophys | volume = 73 | issue = 7| pages = 2270–85 | doi = 10.3758/s13414-011-0152-4 | pmid = 21842332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Head movement that accompanies normal speech can also improve lip-reading, independently of oral actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = SM | last2 = Jordan | first2 = TR | year = 2004 | title = Contributions of oral and extraoral facial movement to visual and audiovisual speech perception | url = | journal = J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform | volume = 30 | issue = 5| pages = 873–88 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.30.5.873 | pmid = 15462626 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when lip-reading [[connected speech]], the viewer's knowledge of the spoken language, familiarity with the speaker and style of speech, and the context of the lip-read material&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spehar | first1 = B | last2 = Goebel | first2 = S | last3 = Tye-Murray | first3 = N | year = 2015 | title = Effects of Context Type on Lipreading and Listening Performance and Implications for Sentence Processing | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 1093–102 | doi = 10.1044/2015_JSLHR-H-14-0360 | pmid = 25863923 | pmc=4610295}}&lt;/ref&gt; are as important as the visibility of the speaker. While most hearing people are sensitive to seen speech, there is great variability in individual speechreading skill. Good lipreaders are often more accurate than poor lipreaders at identifying phonemes from visual speech.

A simple visemic measure of 'lipreadability'  has been questioned by some researchers. The 'phoneme equivalence class' measure takes into account the statistical structure of the lexicon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Files | first1 = BT | last2 = Tjan | first2 = BS | last3 = Jiang | first3 = J | last4 = Bernstein | first4 = LE | year = 2015 | title = Visual speech discrimination and identification of natural and synthetic consonant stimuli | url = | journal = Front Psychol | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 878 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00878 | pmid = 26217249 | pmc=4499841}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also accommodate individual differences in lip-reading ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9407662 | volume=102 | title=Speechreading and the structure of the lexicon: computationally modeling the effects of reduced phonetic distinctiveness on lexical uniqueness | year=1997 | journal=J Acoust Soc Am | pages=3704–10 | last1 = Auer | first1 = ET | last2 = Bernstein | first2 = LE | doi=10.1121/1.420402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feld J1, Sommers M 2011 There Goes the Neighborhood: Lipreading and the Structure of the Mental Lexicon. ''Speech Commun.''  Feb;53(2):220-228&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this, excellent lipreading is often associated with more broad-based cognitive skills including general language proficiency, [[executive function]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tye-Murray | first1 = N | last2 = Hale | first2 = S | last3 = Spehar | first3 = B | last4 = Myerson | first4 = J | last5 = Sommers | first5 = MS | year = 2014 | title = Lipreading in school-age children: the roles of age, hearing status, and cognitive ability | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 556–65 | doi = 10.1044/2013_JSLHR-H-12-0273 | pmid=24129010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feld | first1 = JE | last2 = Sommers | first2 = MS | year = 2009 | title = Lipreading, processing speed, and working memory in younger and older adults | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 52 | issue = 6| pages = 1555–65 | doi = 10.1044/1092-4388(2009/08-0137) | pmid = 19717657 | pmc=3119632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lipreading and language learning in hearing infants and children==

===The first few months===

Seeing the mouth plays a role in the very young infant's early sensitivity to speech, and prepares them to become speakers at 1 – 2 years. In order to imitate, a baby must learn to shape their lips in accordance with the sounds they hear; seeing the speaker may help them to do this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/16/babies-learning-to-talk_n_1209219.html&lt;/ref&gt; Newborns imitate adult mouth movements such as sticking out the tongue or opening the mouth, which could be a precursor to further imitation and later language learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 897687 | volume=198 | title=Imitation of facial and manual gestures by human neonates | year=1977 | journal=Science | pages=74–8 | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = AN | last2 = Moore | first2 = MK | doi=10.1126/science.897687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants are disturbed when audiovisual speech of a familiar speaker is desynchronized &lt;ref&gt;Dodd B.1976 Lip reading in infants: attention to speech presented in- and out-of-synchrony. ''Cognitive Psychology'' Oct;11(4):478-84&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to show different looking patterns for familiar than for unfamiliar faces when matched to (recorded) voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spelke | first1 = E | year = 1976 | title = Infants intermodal perception of events | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 553–560 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(76)90018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infants are sensitive to [[McGurk effect|McGurk illusions]] months before they have learned to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burnham | first1 = D | last2 = Dodd | first2 = B | year = 2004 | title = Auditory-visual speech integration by prelinguistic infants: perception of an emergent consonant in the McGurk effect | url = | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume = 45 | issue = 4| pages = 204–20 | doi = 10.1002/dev.20032 | pmid = 15549685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9136265 | volume=59 | title=The McGurk effect in infants | year=1997 | journal=Percept Psychophys | pages=347–57 | last1 = Rosenblum | first1 = LD | last2 = Schmuckler | first2 = MA | last3 = Johnson | first3 = JA}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies and many more point to a role for vision in the development of sensitivity to (auditory) speech in the first half-year of life.

===The next six months; a role in learning a native language===

Until around six months of age, most hearing infants are sensitive to a wide range of speech gestures - including ones that can be seen on the mouth - which may or may not later be part of the [[phonology]] of their native language. But in the second six months of life, the hearing infant shows [[perceptual narrowing]] for the phonetic structure of their own language - and may lose the early sensitivity to mouth patterns that are not useful. The speech sounds  /v/ and /b/ which are visemically distinctive in English but not in Castilian Spanish are accurately distinguished in Spanish-exposed and English-exposed babies up to the age of around 6 months. However, older Spanish-exposed infants lose the ability to 'see' this distinction, while it is retained for English-exposed infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pons | first1 = F | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Narrowing of intersensory speech perception in infancy | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 106 | issue = 26| pages = 10598–602 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0904134106 | pmid = 19541648 | pmc=2705579}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies suggest that rather than hearing and vision developing in independent ways in infancy, multimodal processing is the rule, not the exception, in (language) development of the infant brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewkowicz | first1 = DJ | last2 = Ghazanfar | first2 = AA | year = 2009 | title = The emergence of multisensory systems through perceptual narrowing | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 11| pages = 470–8 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.004 | pmid=19748305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early language production: one to two years===

Given the many studies indicating a role for vision in the development of language in the pre-lingual infant, the effects of congenital blindness on language development are surprisingly small.  18-month-olds learn new words more readily when they hear them, and do not learn them when they are shown the speech movements without hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Havy, M., Foroud, A., Fais, L., &amp; Werker, J.F. (in press; online January 26, 2017). The role of auditory and visual speech in word-learning at 18 months and in adulthood. Child Development.  (Pre-print version)&lt;/ref&gt; However, children blind from birth can confuse /m/ and /n/ in their own early production of English words – a confusion rarely seen in sighted hearing children, since  /m/ and /n/ are visibly distinctive, but auditorilly confusable.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, A.E. 1987 The development of phonology in the blind child. In B.Dodd &amp; R.Campbell(Eds) Hearing by Eye: the psychology of lipreading, Hove UK, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt; The role of vision in children aged 1–2 years may be less critical to the production of their native language, since, by that age, they have attained the skills they need to identify and imitate speech sounds. However, hearing a non-native language can shift the child's attention to visual and auditory engagement by way of lipreading and listening in order to process, understand and produce speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewkowicz | first1 = DJ | last2 = Hansen-Tift | first2 = AM | date = Jan 2012 | title = Infants deploy selective attention to the mouth of a talking face when learning speech | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 5| pages = 1431–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1114783109 | pmid = 22307596 | pmc=3277111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In childhood===
Studies with pre-lingual infants and children use indirect, non-verbal measures to indicate sensitivity to seen speech. ''Explicit'' lip-reading can be reliably tested in hearing preschoolers by asking them to 'say aloud what I say silently'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies R1 | first1 = Kidd E | last2 = Lander | first2 = K | year = 2009 | title = Investigating the psycholinguistic correlates of speechreading in preschool age children | url = | journal = International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 164–74 | doi = 10.1080/13682820801997189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In school-age children, lipreading of familiar closed-set words such as number words can be readily elicited.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd B. 1987 The acquisition of lipreading skills by normally hearing children. In B.Dodd &amp; R.Campbell (Eds) Hearing by Eye, Erlbaum NJ pp163-176&lt;/ref&gt; Individual differences in lip-reading skill, as tested by asking the child to 'speak the word that you lip-read', or by matching a lip-read utterance to a picture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jerger | first1 = S | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Developmental shifts in children's sensitivity to visual speech: a new multimodal picture-word task | url = | journal = J Exp Child Psychol | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 40–59 | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2008.08.002 | pmid = 18829049 | pmc=2612128}}&lt;/ref&gt; show a relationship between lip-reading skill and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kyle | first1 = FE | last2 = Campbell | first2 = R | last3 = Mohammed | first3 = T | last4 = Coleman | first4 = M | last5 = MacSweeney | first5 = M | year = 2013 | title = Speechreading development in deaf and hearing children: introducing the test of child speechreading | url = | journal = Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 416–26 | doi = 10.1044/1092-4388(2012/12-0039) | pmid = 23275416 | pmc=4920223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tye-Murray | first1 = N | last2 = Hale | first2 = S | last3 = Spehar | first3 = B | last4 = Myerson | first4 = J | last5 = Sommers | first5 = MS | year = 2014 | title = Lipreading in school-age children: the roles of age, hearing status, and cognitive ability | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 556–65 | doi = 10.1044/2013_JSLHR-H-12-0273 | pmid = 24129010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In hearing adults: lifespan considerations==
While lip-reading silent speech poses a challenge for most hearing people, adding sight of the speaker to heard speech improves speech processing under many conditions. The mechanisms for this, and the precise ways in which lip-reading helps, are topics of current research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peelle | first1 = JE | last2 = Sommers | first2 = MS | year = 2015 | title = Prediction and constraint in audiovisual speech perception | journal = Cortex | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 169–81 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2015.03.006 | pmid=25890390 | pmc=4475441}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Seeing the speaker helps at all levels of speech processing from [[Phonetics|phonetic feature]] discrimination to interpretation of [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] utterances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = R | year = 2008 | title = The processing of audio-visual speech: empirical and neural bases | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 363 | issue = 1493| pages = 1001–1010 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2007.2155 | pmid=17827105 | pmc=2606792}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The positive effects of adding vision to heard speech are greater in noisy than quiet environments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sumby | first1 = WH | last2 = Pollack | first2 = I | year = 1954 | title = Visual contribution to speech intelligibility in noise | doi = 10.1121/1.1907309 | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 212–215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
where by making speech perception easier, seeing the speaker can free up cognitive resources, enabling deeper processing of speech content.

As [[Hearing loss|hearing becomes less reliable in old-age]] people may tend to rely more on lip-reading, and are encouraged to do so. However, greater reliance on lip-reading may not always make good the effects of age-related hearing loss. Cognitive decline in aging may be preceded by and/or associated with measurable hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taljaard | first1 = Schmulian | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = The relationship between hearing impairment and cognitive function: A meta-analysis in adults | url = | journal = Clin Otolaryngol | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1111/coa.12607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hung | first1 = SC | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = Hearing Loss is Associated With Risk of Alzheimer's Disease: A Case-Control Study in Older People | url = | journal = J Epidemiol | volume = 25 | issue = 8| pages = 517–21 | doi = 10.2188/jea.JE20140147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus lipreading may not always be able to fully compensate for the combined hearing and cognitive age-related decrements.

===In specific (hearing) populations===

A number of studies report anomalies of lipreading in populations with distinctive developmental disorders. [[Autism]]:  People with autism may show reduced lipreading abilities and reduced reliance on vision in audiovisual speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = EG | last2 = Bennetto | first2 = L.J | year = 2007 | title = Audiovisual speech integration and lipreading in autism | url = | journal = Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8| pages = 813–21 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01766.x | pmid = 17683453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Irwin | first1 = JR | last2 = Tornatore | first2 = LA | last3 = Brancazio | first3 = L | last4 = Whalen | first4 = DH | year = 2011 | title = Can children with autism spectrum disorders "hear" a speaking face? | url = | journal = Child Dev | volume = 82 | issue = 5| pages = 1397–403 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01619.x | pmid = 21790542 | pmc=3169706}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be associated with gaze-to-the-face anomalies in these people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Irwin | first1 = JR | last2 = Brancazio | first2 = L | year = 2014 | title = Seeing to hear?

==Deafness==
"When you are deaf you live inside a well-corked glass bottle. You see the entrancing outside world, but it does not reach you. After learning to lip read, you are still inside the bottle, but the cork has come out and the outside world slowly but surely comes in to you." &lt;ref name="Clegg1953"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf|Debate has raged for hundreds of years]] over the role of lip-reading ('[[oralism]]') compared with other communication methods (most recently, [[total communication]]) in the education of deaf people. The extent to which one or other approach is beneficial depends on a range of factors, including level of hearing loss of the deaf person, age of hearing loss, parental involvement and parental language(s). Then there is a question concerning the aims of the deaf person and her community and carers. Is the aim of education to enhance communication generally, to develop [[sign language]] as a first language, or to develop skills in the spoken language of the hearing community? Researchers now focus on which aspects of language and communication may be best delivered by what means and in which contexts, given the hearing status of the child and her family, and their educational plans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.handsandvoices.org/articles/research/v9-2_marschark.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bimodal bilingualism]] (proficiency in both speech and sign language) is one dominant current approach in language education for the deaf child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swanwick | first1 = R | year = 2016 | title = Deaf Children's bimodal bilingualism and education | url = | journal = Language Teaching | volume = 49 | issue = 01| pages = 1–34 | doi = 10.1017/S0261444815000348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaf people  are often better lip-readers than people with normal hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = LE | last2 = Demorest | first2 = ME | last3 = Tucker | first3 = PE | year = 2000 | title = Speech perception without hearing | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 233–52 | doi=10.3758/bf03205546}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some deaf people practice as professional lipreaders, for instance in [[forensic lipreading]]. In deaf people who have a [[cochlear implant]], pre-implant lip-reading skill can predict post-implant (auditory or audiovisual) speech processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bergeson TR1 | first1 = Pisoni DB | last2 = Davis | first2 = RA | year = 2005 | title = Development of audiovisual comprehension skills in prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants | url = | journal = Ear &amp; Hearing | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 149–64 | doi=10.1097/00003446-200504000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many deaf people, access to spoken communication can be helped when a spoken message is relayed via a trained, ''[http://lipspeaking.co.uk/ professional lip-speaker]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/communication-support-for-deaf-people&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lipspeaker.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with lipreading and literacy development, children born deaf typically show [[Reading disability|delayed development of literacy]] skills&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/reading-and-dyslexia-deaf-children&lt;/ref&gt; which can reflect difficulties in acquiring elements of the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2007 | title = What really matters in the early literacy development of deaf children | url = | journal = J Deaf Stud Deaf Educ | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 411–31 | doi=10.1093/deafed/enm020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, reliable [[Phonics|phoneme-grapheme mapping]] may be more difficult for deaf children, who need to be skilled speech-readers in order to master this necessary step in literacy acquisition.  Lip-reading skill is associated with literacy abilities in deaf adults and children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02699200500266745 | volume=20 | title=Speechreading and its association with reading among deaf, hearing and dyslexic individuals | journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics | pages=621–630}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kyle | first1 = F.

[[Cued Speech]] uses lipreading with accompanying hand shapes that disambiguate the visemic (consonant) lipshape. Cued speech is said to be easier for hearing parents to learn than a sign language, and studies, primarily from Belgium, show that a deaf child exposed to cued speech in infancy can make more efficient progress in learning a spoken language than from lipreading alone
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholls | first1 = GH | last2 = Ling | first2 = D | year = 1982 | title = Cued Speech and the reception of spoken language | url = | journal = J Speech Hear Res | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 262–9 | doi=10.1044/jshr.2502.262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cued speech in cochlear implantation for deafness is likely to be positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leybaert | first1 = J | last2 = LaSasso | first2 = CJ | year = 2010 | title = Cued speech for enhancing speech perception and first language development of children with cochlear implants | url = | journal = Trends in Amplification | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 96–112 | doi = 10.1177/1084713810375567 | pmc = 4111351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach, involving the use of handshapes accompanying seen speech, is  [http://seethesound.org/visual_phonics.html Visual Phonics], which is used by some educators to support the learning of  written and spoken language.

==Teaching and training==
The aim of teaching and training in lipreading is to develop awareness of the nature of lipreading, and to practice ways of improving the ability to perceive speech 'by eye'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lipreading.org/lipreading-&lt;/ref&gt; Lipreading classes, often called ''lipreading and managing hearing loss classes'', are mainly aimed at adults who have hearing loss. The highest proportion of adults with hearing loss have an [[Presbycusis|age related]], or [[Occupational hearing loss|noise related loss]], and with both these the high frequency sounds are lost first. Since many of the consonants in speech are high frequency sounds, speech becomes distorted. Hearing aids help, but may not cure this. Lipreading classes have been shown to be of benefit in  UK studies  commissioned by the charity, [[Action on Hearing Loss]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/notjustlipservice.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012.

Trainers recognise that lipreading is an inexact art. Students are taught to watch the lips, tongue and jaw movements, to follow the stress and rhythm of language, to use their residual hearing, with or without hearing aids, to watch expression and body language, and use their ability to put two and two together. They are taught the [http://limpingchicken.com/2016/04/05/molly-berry-what-lipreading-classes-can-offer-deaf-people/  lipreaders alphabet], groups of sounds that look alike on the lips (visemes) like p, b, m, or f, v. The aim is to get the gist, so as to have the confidence to join in conversation, and avoid damaging social isolation that often accompanies hearing loss. Lipreading classes are recommended for anyone who struggles to hear in noise, and help to adjust to hearing loss.
[http://atlalipreading.org.uk ATLA ](the association for teaching lipreading to adults) is the professional association in the UK  for qualified lipreading tutors.

=== Tests ===

Most tests of lipreading were devised to measure individual differences in performing specific speech processing tasks, and to detect changes in performance following training.  Lipreading tests have been used with relatively small groups in experimental settings,  or as clinical indicators with individual patients and clients. That is, lipreading tests to date have limited validity as markers of lipreading skill in the general population.

==Lipreading and lip-speaking by machine==
[[Automated Lip Reading|Automated lip-reading]] has been a topic of interest in computational engineering, as well as in [[2001: A Space Odyssey|science fiction movies]]. The computational engineer [[Steve Omohundro]], among others, pioneered its development. In [[facial animation]], the aim is to generate realistic facial actions, especially mouth movements, that simulate human speech actions. Computer algorithms to deform or manipulate images of faces can be driven by heard or written language. Systems may be based on detailed models derived from facial movements ([[motion capture]]); on anatomical modelling of actions of the jaw, mouth and tongue; or on mapping of known viseme- phoneme properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~rwalker/Walker/Publications_files/1996_CohenWalker%26Massaro_VisualSpeech.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A318099&amp;dswid=2041&lt;/ref&gt; Facial animation has been used in speechreading training (demonstrating how different sounds 'look').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JADD.0000006002.82367.4f#/page-1 | doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000006002.82367.4f | volume=33 | title=Development and Evaluation of a Computer-Animated Tutor for Vocabulary and Language Learning in Children with Autism | journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | pages=653–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are a subset of [[speech synthesis]] modelling which aim to deliver reliable 'text-to-(seen)-speech' outputs.  A complementary aim—the  reverse of making faces move in speech—is to develop computer algorithms  that can deliver realistic interpretations of speech (i.e. a written transcript or audio record)  from natural video data of a face in action: this is facial speech recognition. These models too can be sourced from a variety of data.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uea.ac.uk/computing/visual-speech-synthesis&lt;/ref&gt; Automatic visual speech recognition from video has been quite successful in distinguishing different languages (from a corpus of spoken language data).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnet.com/news/lip-reading-computer-can-distinguish-languages/&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstration models, using machine-learning algorithms, have had some success in lipreading speech elements, such as specific words, from video&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2vInqqHX8&lt;/ref&gt;  and for identifying hard-to-lipread phonemes from visemically similar seen mouth actions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/the-innovators-can-computers-be-taught-to-lip-read-artificial-intelligence&lt;/ref&gt; Machine-based speechreading is now making successful use of [https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602949/ai-has-beaten-humans-at-lip-reading/ neural-net based algorithms] which use large databases of speakers and speech material (following the successful model for auditory [[automatic speech recognition]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2113299-googles-deepmind-ai-can-lip-read-tv-shows-better-than-a-pro/&lt;/ref&gt;

Uses for machine lipreading could include automated lipreading of video-only records, automated lipreading of speakers with damaged vocal tracts, and speech processing in face-to-face video (i.e. from videophone data). Automated lipreading may help in processing noisy or unfamiliar speech.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Bodoff/publication/234819242_An_improved_automatic_lipreading_system_to_enhance_speech_recognition/links/5628b96008ae04c2aeaeb404.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Automated lipreading may  contribute to [[biometric]] person identification, replacing password-based identification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asel.udel.edu/icslp/cdrom/vol1/954/a954.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetbiometrics.com-article-details-i-2250&lt;/ref&gt;

==The brain==
Following the discovery that [[Auditory cortex|auditory brain regions]], including [[Heschl's gyrus]], were activated by seen speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calvert | first1 = GA | last2 = Bullmore | first2 = ET | last3 = Brammer | first3 = MJ | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1997 | title = Activation  of auditory cortex during silent lipreading | url = | journal = Science | volume = 276 | issue = 5312| pages = 593–6 | pmid = 9110978 | doi=10.1126/science.276.5312.593}}&lt;/ref&gt; the neural circuitry for speechreading was shown to include supra-modal processing regions, especially [[superior temporal sulcus]] (all parts) as well as posterior inferior occipital-temporal regions including regions specialised for the processing of [[Fusiform face area|faces]] and [[visual area MT|biological motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = LE | last2 = Liebenthal | first2 = E | year = 2014 | title = Neural pathways for visual speech perception | url = | journal = Front Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 386 | doi = 10.3389/fnins.2014.00386 | pmid = 25520611 | pmc=4248808}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some but not all studies, activation of Broca's area is reported for speechreading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skipper | first1 = JI | last2 = van Wassenhove | first2 = V | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = HC | last4 = Small | first4 = SL | year = 2007 | title = Hearing Lips and Seeing Voices: How Cortical Areas Supporting Speech Production Mediate Audiovisual Speech Perception | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 17 | issue = 10| pages = 2387–2399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhl147 | pmid=17218482 | pmc=2896890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11587893 | volume=12 | title=Cortical substrates for the perception of face actions: an fMRI study of the specificity of activation for seen speech and for meaningless lower-face acts (gurning) | year=2001 | journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res | pages=233–43 | last1 = Campbell | first1 = R | last2 = MacSweeney | first2 = M | last3 = Surguladze | first3 = S | last4 = Calvert | first4 = G | last5 = McGuire | first5 = P | last6 = Suckling | first6 = J | last7 = Brammer | first7 = MJ | last8 = David | first8 = AS | doi=10.1016/s0926-6410(01)00054-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that articulatory mechanisms can be activated in speechreading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swaminathan | first1 = S. | last2 = MacSweeney | first2 = M. | last3 = Boyles | first3 = R. | last4 = Waters | first4 = D. | last5 = Watkins | first5 = K.

This article lists incidents that have been termed [[ethnic cleansing]] by some academic or legal experts. Not all experts agree on every case, particularly since there are a variety of [[Ethnic cleansing#Definitions|definitions for the term ethnic cleansing]]. Where claims of ethnic cleansing originate from non-experts (e.g., journalists or politicians) this is noted.

==Ancient and Medieval periods==
* {{circa}} 149 BC: The [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] was the main engagement of the [[Third Punic War]] between the [[Punic]] city of [[Carthage]] in Africa and the [[Roman Republic]]. It was a siege operation, starting sometime between 149 and 148 BC, and ending in spring 146 BC with the sack and complete destruction of the city of Carthage. In spring 146 BC, the Romans broke through the city wall, eventually after hours upon hours of house-to-house fighting, the Carthaginians surrendered.  An estimated 50,000 surviving inhabitants were sold into slavery. The city was then leveled. The land surrounding Carthage was eventually declared ager publicus (public land), and it was shared between local farmers, and Roman and Italian ones.
*{{circa}} 350 AD: Ancient Chinese texts record that General [[Ran Min]] ordered the extermination of the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]], especially the [[Jie people]], during the [[Wei–Jie war]] in the fourth century AD. People with racial characteristics such as high-bridged noses and bushy beards were killed; in total, 200,000 were reportedly massacred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%99%89%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B7107 《晉書·卷一百七》("Jìnshū Juǎn Yī Bǎi Qī")] [[Jin Shu]] '''Original text''' 閔躬率趙人誅諸胡羯，無貴賤男女少長皆斬之，死者二十余萬，屍諸城外，悉為野犬豺狼所食。屯據四方者，所在承閔書誅之，于時高鼻多須至有濫死者半。''(Mǐn gōng lǜ zhào rén zhū zhū hú jié, wú guìjiàn nánnǚ shǎo cháng jiē zhǎn zhī, sǐzhě èrshí yú wàn, shī zhūchéng wài, xī wéi yě quǎn cháiláng suǒ shí.

*{{circa}} 1282 [[Sicilian Vespers]]  (Italian: Vespri siciliani; Sicilian: Vespiri siciliani) is the name given to the successful rebellion on the island of Sicily that broke out on the Easter of 1282 against the rule of the French/Capetian king [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I]], who had ruled the Kingdom of Sicily since 1266. Within six weeks, three thousand French men and women were slain by the rebels, and the government of King Charles lost control of the island. It was the beginning of the War of the Sicilian Vespers.
*{{circa}} 1250–1500 AD: From the [[History of the Jews in Europe|13th to the 16th centuries]] many European countries expelled the Jews from their territory on at least 15 occasions. Spain was preceded by England, France and some German states, among many others, and succeeded by at least five more expulsions.
*{{circa}} 1492–1614 AD: As a result of [[religious persecution]], up to a quarter million Jews in Spain converted to [[Catholicism]], those remaining (between 40,000 and 70,000) were expelled in 1492 following the [[Alhambra Decree]]. Shortly after the practice of Islam was outlawed and all of Spain's Muslims became nominally Christian.&lt;ref&gt;''A brief History of Ethnic Cleansing'', by Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of these converted Muslims were called [[Moriscos]]. After the 1571 suppression of the [[Morisco Revolt]] in the  [[Alpujarras]] region, almost 80,000 Moriscos were relocated to other parts of Spain and some 270 villages and hamlets were repopulated with settlers brought from other regions. This was followed by a general [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] between 1609–1614 which was nominally applied to the entire Spanish realm, but was carried out most thoroughly in the eastern region of Valencia. Although its overall success in terms of implementation is subject to academic debate and did not involve widespread violence, it is considered one of the first episodes of state-sponsored ethnic cleansing in the modern western world.

*{{circa}} 1652 AD: After the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement]] in 1652, the whole post-war Cromwellian settlement of Ireland has been characterised by historians such as Mark Levene and [[Alan Axelrod]] as ethnic cleansing, in that it sought to remove Irish [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] from the eastern part of the country, but others such as the historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] have described the actions of Cromwell and his subordinates as [[genocide]].&lt;ref name=genocide/&gt;
*{{circa}} 1740 AD: In the 1740s, the British government, following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], instituted the "[[Highland Clearances]]" in [[Scotland]] which essentially depopulated much of the Scottish Highlands.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source complying with [[WP:HISTRS]] needed.

*1755–1764 AD: During the [[French and Indian War]], the Nova Scotia colonial government aided by New England troops, instituted a [[Expulsion of the Acadians|systematic removal]] of the French Catholic [[Acadian people|Acadian]] population of [[Nova Scotia]] – eventually removing thousands of settlers from the region and relocating them to areas in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], Britain and France. Many eventually moved and settled in [[Louisiana]] and became known as [[Cajuns]]. Many scholars have described the subsequent death of over 50% of the deported Acadian population as an ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ghr/article/download/13572/6829+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=es&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=cr|title=The Unsaid of the Grand Dérangement: An Analysis of Outsider and Regional Interpretations of Acadian History|last=MACLEOD|first=KATIE|date=|website=University of Victoria|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Michael Mann, basing his figures on those provided by [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], states that between 1821 and 1922, a large number of Muslims were expelled from [[Southeast Europe]] as [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]] and [[Serbia]] gained their independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Mann describes these events as "murderous ethnic cleansing on a stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe". These countries sought to expand their territory against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which culminated in the [[Balkan Wars]] of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''The dark side of democracy: explaining ethnic cleansing'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=KKGt7CMROmgC&amp;pg=PA112 pp. 112–4], Cambridge, 2005 "... figures are derive[d] from McCarthy (1995: I 91, 162–4, 339), who is often viewed as a scholar on the Turkish side of the debate. Yet even if we reduce his figures by 50 percent, they would still horrify. He estimates that between 1812 and 1922 somewhere around 5½ million Muslims were driven out of Europe and 5 million more were killed or died of either disease or starvation while fleeing. ... In the final [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–13 he estimates that 62 percent of all Muslims (27 percent dead, 35 percent refugees) disappeared from the lands conquered by Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria. This was murderous ethnic cleansing on a stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe, ..."

*In 2005, the historian [[Gary Clayton Anderson]] of the [[University of Oklahoma]] published ''The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1830–1875''. This book repudiates traditional historians, such as [[Walter Prescott Webb]] and [[Rupert N. Richardson]], who viewed the settlement of [[Texas]] by the displacement of the native populations as a healthful development. Anderson writes that at the time of the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], when the population of Texas was nearly 600,000, the still-new state was "a very violent place. ... Texans mostly blamed Indians for the violence – an unfair indictment, since a series of terrible droughts had virtually incapacitated the Plains Indians, making them incapable of extended warfare."&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KKGt7CMROmgC&amp;pg=PA9|title=The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1830–1875|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]], 2005, p. 9 (quotation), {{ISBN|0-8061-3698-7}}|accessdate=23 October 2010|isbn=978-0-8061-3698-1|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Conquest of Texas'' was nominated for a [[Pulitzer Prize]].

| pages=In late 1988, the entire Azerbaijani population (including Muslim Kurds) – some 167000 people – was kicked out of the Armenian SSR. In the process, dozens of people died due to isolated Armenian attacks and adverse conditions. This population transfer was partially in response to Armenians being forced out of Azerbaijan, but it was also the last phase of the gradual homogenization of the republic under Soviet rule. The population transfer was the latest, and not so "gentle", episode of ethnic cleansing that increased Armenia's homogenization from 90 percent to 98 percent. Nationalists, in collaboration with the Armenian state authorities, were responsible for this exodus.

* On 5 and 6 September 1955 the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] or "Septembrianá"/"Σεπτεμβριανά", secretly backed by the Turkish government, was launched against the Greek population of [[Istanbul]]. The mob also attacked some Jewish and Armenian residents of the city.

* In 1966, there was unrest in the northern part of [[Nigeria]] that led to the death of about 80,000 people. Those killed were originally from the South Eastern region of the country and this act was seen as an attack on the [[Igbo people]]. This led [[C.

* The [[Communism|Communist]] [[Khmer Rouge]] government in [[Cambodia]] disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups, including ethnic [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[Thai people|Thai]]s.

The small Thai minority along the border was almost completely exterminated, only a few thousand managing to reach safety in Thailand. The [[Cham people|Cham]] Muslims suffered serious purges with as much as 80% of their population exterminated. The Khmer's racial supremacist ideology was responsible to this ethnic purge.

The fact that it did not include 'total' genocide in its remit, or that it failed to put into practice the vast majority of its proposed expulsions, ultimately, however, says less about the lethal determination of its makers and more about the political, structural and financial weakness of the early modern English state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of '''sound artists'''. [[Sound art]] is a diverse group of art practices that considers wide notions of sound, listening and hearing as its predominant focus. There is contention as to which artists are “sound artists” or if another category might be more accurate such as [[experimental music]], [[electronic music]], [[sound installation]], [[circuit bending]], [[sound sculpture]], builder of [[experimental musical instrument]]s, [[noise music]], [[acoustic ecology]], [[sound poetry]], [[installation art]], [[performance art]] or [[Fluxus]].&lt;ref&gt;N.B. Aldrich. 2003. [http://www.emf.org/emfinstitute/aldrich/aldrich.html What is Sound Art?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426234548/http://www.emf.org/emfinstitute/aldrich/aldrich.html |date=2014-04-26 }} Albany: Electronic Music Foundation website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith. 2004. [http://www.newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=2413 Bring Da Noise: A Brief Survey of Sound Art]. New York: American Music Center.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wilson. 2006. “[http://cec.concordia.ca/econtact/9_2/wilson.html Boundaries and Definitions: The SoundAsArt Conference, Aberdeen Scotland (24–26 November, 2006)].” ''eContact! 9.2 — Canadian Regions: The Prairies'' (March 2007). Montréal: [[Canadian Electroacoustic Community|CEC]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Licht. 2007. ''Sound Art: Beyond Music, Between Categories''. New York: Rizzoli.&lt;/ref&gt;

The category “sound art” is relatively new and it is difficult to justify excluding any artist who uses sound (as opposed to standard definitions of music) and listening as a significant element in their art from this field. Whether or not an artist has achieved sufficient renown is difficult as accolades are seldom in the area of sound art, but in other categories (visual art, music, design, etc.).

Published material on sound art is sparse. Scottish artist [[Susan Philipsz]]'s 2010 British [[Turner Prize]] win for her piece 'Lowlands' was the first time a work of sound art won this prize and highlighted the genre's blurred boundaries with other, more visual artforms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4840">A '''Malthusian growth model''', sometimes called a '''simple exponential''' growth model, is essentially [[exponential growth]] based on the idea of the function being proportional to the speed to which the function grows. The model is named after [[ Thomas Robert Malthus]], who wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798), one of the earliest and most influential books on [[population]].&lt;ref name=malthus&gt;"Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population: Library of Economics"&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthusian models have the following form:
:&lt;math&gt; P(t) = P_0e^{rt} &lt;/math&gt;
where

* ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''(0) is the initial population size,
* ''r'' = the population growth rate, sometimes called ''Malthusian parameter'',
* ''t'' = time.

The model can also been written in the form of a differential equation:

dP/dt = rP

with initial condition:
P(0)= P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

This model is often referred to as the ''exponential law''.&lt;ref&gt;Turchin, P. "Complex population dynamics: a theoretical/empirical synthesis" Princeton [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7436.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded in the field of [[population ecology]] as the [[first principle]] of [[population dynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;Turchin, P. "Does Population Ecology Have General Laws?" Oikos 94:17–26. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Malthus]] as the founder. The exponential law is therefore also sometimes referred to as the ''Malthusian Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Haemig, "Laws of Population Ecology", 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By now, it is a widely accepted view to analogize Malthusian growth in Ecology to [[Newton's First Law|Newton's First Law of uniform motion]] in physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Lev R.|title=The theory of population dynamics: I. Back to first principles|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-5193(86)80180-1|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=122|issue=4|pages=385–399|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus wrote that all life forms, including humans, have a propensity to exponential population growth when resources are abundant but that actual growth is limited by available resources:
{{quote|Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has scattered the seeds of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand.... The germs of existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. Necessity, that imperious all pervading law of nature, restrains them within the prescribed bounds. The race of plants, and the race of animals shrink under this great restrictive law. And the race of man cannot, by any efforts of reason, escape from it. Among plants and animals its effects are waste of seed, sickness, and premature death. Among mankind, misery and vice. |Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Chapter I.}}

A model of population growth bounded by resource limitations was developed by [[Pierre Francois Verhulst]] in 1838, after he had read Malthus' essay. Verhulst named the model a [[logistic function]].

[[File:Yemenite Jews studying Torah in Sana'a.jpg|thumb|right|Yemenite Jews of Sana'a, 1907]]

The '''Exile of Mawzaʻ''' (the expulsion of Yemenite Jews to [[Mawza District|Mawza']]) {{lang-he-n|גלות מוזע}}, {{IPA-he|''ğalūt mawzaʻ''|pron}};&amp;lrm; 1679–1680, is considered the single most traumatic event experienced collectively by the [[Jews of Yemen]],&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Yuval Tobi, "Attitude of the Muslim Authority in Yemen to the Jewish Messianic Movements", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 135 {{OCLC|1041776317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, ''Galut Mawzaʻ'', Sefunot (Volume Five), Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, p. 79 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; in which Jews living in nearly all cities and towns throughout Yemen were banished by decree of the king, Imām [[al-Mahdi Ahmad]], and sent to a dry and barren region of the country named Mawzaʻ to withstand their fate or to die. Only a few communities, ''viz.'', those Jewish inhabitants who lived in the far eastern quarters of Yemen ([[Nihm District|Nihm]], [[Al Jawf Governorate|al-Jawf]], and [[Khwlan District|Khawlan]] of the east&lt;ref&gt;The one exception being Tan'am, which although it lies in the principality of Khawlan, was not spared the fate of exile.&lt;/ref&gt;) were spared this fate by virtue of their Arab patrons who refused to obey the king's orders.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," Sefunot, Volume 2, Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1958, pp. 246-286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Many would die along the route and while confined to the hot and arid conditions of this forbidding terrain. After one year in exile, the exiles were called back to perform their usual tasks and labors for the indigenous Arab populations, who had been deprived of goods and services on account of their exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafiḥ]] (ed.), "Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Ketavim'' (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 714 (end); [[Amram Qorah]], ''Sa'arat Teiman'', Jerusalem 1987, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
With the rise to power of the Qāsimīd Imām, [[al-Mutawakkil Isma'il]] (1644–1676), there was a crucial turning point in the condition of Jews living under the Imamate kingdom of Yemen. He endorsed the most hostile policies toward his Jewish subjects, partly due to the claim that the Jews were aiding the Ottoman Turks during the local uprising against them.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''Politics and Poetry in the Works of Shalom Shabazī'', Routledge - ''Israel Affairs'' 2014, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Shabbathian]] movement in Yemen in 1666 exacerbated the problems facing the community, calling into question their status as protected wards of the State. One decree led to another.&lt;ref&gt;One Jewish poet bewails their fate at this time, saying: "Since the day that they removed the turbans from our heads (i.e. 1666), we are full of orders which he decrees [against us]. He has placed over our heads [a governor] who is the master of oppression!" See: Ratzaby, ''Sefunot'' (Volume Five), Jerusalem 1961, p. 378 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The king initially demanded their conversion to Islam and when they refused, he made them stand out in the sun without apparel for three days, which was later followed by harsher decrees. It is said that al-Mutawakkil Isma'il consulted with the religious scholars of Islam and sought to determine whether or not the laws concerning Jews in the Arabian Peninsula applied also to Yemen, citing [[Muhammad]] who was reported as saying, "There shall not be two religions in Arabia." When it was determined that these laws did indeed apply to Yemen, since the country was an indivisible part of the Arabian Peninsula, it then became incumbent upon Jews living in Yemen to either convert to Islam or to leave the country. Yet, since the king fell ill and was bedridden, he did not presently perform his ill-designs to expel the Jews from his kingdom, but commanded the heir to his throne, al-Mahdi Ahmad, to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13537121.2014.889893#.U_Q_qcJ0xjo Yosef Tobi, ''Politics and Poetry in the Works of Shalom Shabazī'', Routledge - ''Israel Affairs'' 2014, p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen'' (''Studies in Their History and Culture''), Brill: Leiden 1999, pp. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Mahdi Ahmad of al-Ghirās, who is also known by the epithet ''Ṣafī al-Din'' (purity of religion), succeeded al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, but perpetuated the same hostilities toward his Jewish subjects as those made by his predecessor. Everything reached its climax between the years 1677 and 1680, when he ordered the destruction of the synagogues in Sana'a and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Tanḥum ben Joseph, of Jerusalem, ''al-Murshid al-kāfi'' (in manuscript form), p. 112 (Yosef Tobi's Private Collection), we read the following marginal note: "The synagogue was destroyed here, [in] Ḥamdah, on Wednesday, the 17th day of the lunar month Teveth, in the year 1,989 [of the Seleucid Era] (=1678 CE), by order of al-Mahdi and Muhammad ben Ahmad." Yehudah Ratzaby (1984, p. 149) also brings down a manuscript extracted from the binding of an old book, now at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York (239), in which the author complains: "The razing of the synagogue of Būsān on the fourth day of the week which is the third day of the year 1,989 [of the Seleucid Era] (= 1678 CE), and the enemies forbade us to gather as a quorum of ten for prayer and three scrolls of Law were slashed to pieces. May He in His mercy save us and all Israel from all the decrees." (See: Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen'' - ''Studies in Their History and Culture'', Brill: Leiden 1999, pp. 78 [end] - 79)&lt;/ref&gt;  By early summer of 1679, he gave an ultimatum unto his Jewish subjects, namely, that they had the choice of either converting to Islam, in which they'd be allowed to remain in the country, or of being killed by the sword. He gave to them three months to decide what they would do.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," [https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152755/http://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsArticles/sefunotII_OCR.pdf#page=270 ''Sefunot'', Volume Two, Jerusalem 1958], page רסב (p. 270 in PDF) (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 713 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The king's words led to no small consternation amongst his Jewish subjects in Yemen, who immediately declared a time of public fasting and prayer, which they did both by night and day. Their plight soon became known to the local Yemeni tribesmen, whose chiefs and principal men pitied their condition and intervened on their behalf. They came before the king and enquired concerning the decree, and insisted that the Jews had been loyal to their king and had not offended the Arab peoples, neither had they done anything worthy of death, but should only be punished a little for their "obduracy" in what concerns the religion of Islam. The king, agreeing to their counsel, chose not to kill his Jewish subjects, but decided to banish them from his kingdom. They were to be sent to [[Zeila|Zeilaʻ]], a place along the African coast of the [[Red Sea]], where they would be confined for life, or else repent and accept the tenets of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Sefunot'', Volume Two, Jerusalem 1958], page רסג (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Sana'a]] ==
The Jewish community in Sana'a was concentrated in the neighborhood of al-Sā'ilah, within the walled city, as one enters Bab al-Shaʻub (the Shaʻub Gate) on Sana'a's north side. The chief rabbi of the Jewish community at that time was an elder to whom they gave the title of Prince (''nasi''), Rabbi Suleiman al-Naqqāsh,&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''Studies in 'Megillat Teman' '' (''ʻIyunim bi-megilat Teman''), The Magnes Press – Hebrew University, Jerusalem 1986, p. 42, note 68 (Hebrew). According to [[Erich Brauer]], the title of ''nasi'' was conferred upon a man belonging to the community's most noble and richest family. There was no direct election for this post. In general, the ''nasi'' was also a scholar, well-versed in Torah, but this was not a condition for his office. Among his duties, he was a representative of the community in all its affairs before the government. He was also entrusted with the duty of collecting the annual poll-tax (''ğizya''), as also to settle disputes arising between members of the community (E. Brauer, ''Ethnologie der jemenitischen Juden'', Heidelberg 1934, pp. 281–282).&lt;/ref&gt; while the city's chief seat of learning was under the tutelage of Rabbi and Judge, Shelomo ben Saadia al-Manzeli (''resh methivta'').&lt;ref&gt;Yiḥya Saleḥ, ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Saleh), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, s.v. ''Shaḥrith shel Shabbath''. Rabbi Shelomo ben Saadia al-Manzeli (1610–1690) is said to have returned to his post after the Mawza Exile, serving as both President of the court at Ṣan'ā' and the city's spiritual instructor. He helped draft a series of enactments meant at bettering the spiritual condition of the Jewish community, by way of merit, and thereby hoping to prevent the recurrence of harsh decrees against the community in the future. See: Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman'': ''Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'', vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, p. 70 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of Sana'a were given but short notice about the things that were about to happen to them.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yosef Qafih believes that they were given advance warning as early as late-summer of 1678. See: Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 713, note 130 (Hebrew). According to Arabic sources, Imām al-Mahdī had ordered the newly appointed governor of [[Sana'a]], Muhammad ibn al-Mutawakkil, to expel the Jews and demolish their synagogues on 1 Shaʻbān 1088 ''anno'' Hijri (= 29 September 1677), nearly two years before the actual expulsion. The matter was delayed only because the governor wished to consult first with the religious scholars of his city. All this may have been done without the foreknowledge of the Jewish community. (See: ''Yemenite Authorities and Jewish Messianism'', by P.S. van Koningsveld, J. Sadan and Q. Al-Samarrai, Leiden University 1990, p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; They had been advised to sell their houses, fields and vineyards, and that all property which they were unable to sell would automatically be confiscated and accrue to the Public Treasury (Ar. ''al-māl''), without recompense.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1679, when the king saw that they were unrelenting in their fathers' faith, he then decided to follow through with what he had determined for them and issued a decree, banishing all Jews in his kingdom to the Red Sea outpost known as [[Zeila]]'. On the 2nd day of the lunar month [[Rajab]], in the year 1090 of the [[Hijri calendar]] (corresponds with [[Gregorian calendar]], August 10, 1679), his edict was put into effect, and he ordered the Jews of Sana'a to take leave of their places, but gave more space to the provincial governors of Yemen to begin the expulsion of all other Jews in Yemen to Zeila', and which should be accomplished by them in a time period not to exceed twelve months. The Jews of Sana'a had, meanwhile, set out on their journey, leaving behind them their homes and possessions, rather than exchange their religion for another. In doing so, they brought [[Kiddush Hashem|sanctity]] to God's name.&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with a teaching in Leviticus 22:31–32, and explained in the ''Responsa of Rabbi [[David ben Zimra|David ibn Zimra]]'',vol. 2 (part 4), ''responsum'' no. 92 [1163], Warsaw 1882 (reprinted), p. 47 (Hebrew pagination כד). Here, the author makes it clear that if Jews are collectively compelled by the [[Ismaelites]] to convert to Islam or else face punishment, they are to prefer punishment rather than exchange their religion for another, and, in so doing, they bring sanctity to God's name.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Suleiman al-Naqqāsh, by his wisdom and care for his community, had preemptively made arrangements for the community's safety and upkeep by sending written notifications to the Jewish communities which lay along the route, requesting that they provide food and assistance to their poor Jewish brethren when they passed through their communities in the coming weeks or days. The king's soldiers were sent to escort the exiles unto their final destination, while the king himself had sent orders to the governors of the outlying districts and places where it was known that the Jewish exiles were to pass through while ''en route'' to Zeila', commanding them not to permit any Jew to remain in those cities when they reached them, but to send them on in their journey.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Al-Naddaf|Avraham al-Naddaf]], ''Ḥoveret'' (article: ''History of Rabbi Sholem al-Shabazi''), Jerusalem 1928 (Hebrew); Reprinted in ''Zechor le'Avraham'', by Uziel al-Nadaf, (Part II) Jerualem 1992 (Hebrew), pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unexpected turn of events==
[[File:Jewish Mother and Daughter, December 1, 1949.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish mother and daughter in Yemen, 1949]]
Meanwhile, while columns of men, women and children were advancing by foot southward with only bare essentials, along the road leading from Sana'a to [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]], [[Yarim]], '[[Ibb]] and [[Ta'izz]], the chiefs of the indigenous Sabaean tribes who had been the patrons of the Jews came together once again and petitioned the king, [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]], this time requesting that the king rescind his order to expel all Jews unto the Red Sea outpost of Zeila', but to be content with their banishment to the [[Tihama]] coastal town of Mawza'. The reason being for this urgent request was that, by taking into consideration their troubles in a barren wasteland, those that will remain of them will be more inclined to repent and to choose the way of Islam, in which case it will be easier to hoist them from that place and to bring them back unto their former places. The grandees reminded the king how they had been faithful in implementing his orders. At hearing this, the king agreed and sent orders to the effect that Jewish exiles should be conducted only to Mawza'.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim'' (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the Jews of Sana'a reached Dhamar, they had already been joined by the Jewish villagers of Siān and Tan'am (located about {{convert|15|km|mi|order=flip}}  eastward of Bayt al-Ḥāḍir, southeast Sana'a), all of which places lie within Sana'a's periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, Sefunot (Volume Five), his article: ''Galut Mawza''', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, p. 367, s.v. poem entitled: אבן אלאסבאט אבדע, lines 16–19 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews had sent fifteen letters to the king in al-Ghirās, asking him to forgive them of whatever offense they may have made and to permit them to remain in their former settlements, yet none of these did he answer.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, Sefunot (Volume Five), his article: ''Galut Mawza' '', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, p. 369, s.v. poem entitled: אבן אלאסבאט אבדע, lines 4–5 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evacuation of the Jews of Dhurān==
[[File:Yemenite Elder Blowing Shofat, February 1, 1949.jpg|thumb|Yemenite Jew blows the shofar, 1947]]
Around the beginning of September 1679, approximately one month after the Jews of Sana'a had set out for Mawza‛, Jews that hailed from Dhurān – a village situate about three days' walking distance southwest of Sana'a – were also evacuated from their village. In a letter written in 1684 to the Jewish community of [[Hebron]], only four years after the community's return to Dhurān, the author describes the sufferings of the Jews who were forced to leave their homes and to go into Mawza‛.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, ''Zion – A Quarterly for Research in Jewish History'', vol. xxxvii. The Historical Society of Israel: Jerusalem 1972, pp. 203-207 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; One important revelation that emerges from his account of these events is that the Jews of Yemen had tried to pacify the king's wrath by paying large sums of money to him, but which money the king refused to accept:

{{blockquote|….On account of our many iniquities,&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew expression of contriteness, signifying the people's acceptance of God's judgments and which expression is based on the Jewish teaching that all of God's ways are just.&lt;/ref&gt; God stirred up the spirit of the king who dwells in this country to banish us; we and our wives and our children, unto a barren desert, a place of serpents and scorpions and scorching fire; wrath pursues [us], so that there has been fulfilled in us [the Scripture that says]: '''And I shall bring them into the land of their enemies''' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:41)&lt;/small&gt;. He has destroyed our synagogues, and has darkened the light of our eyes. 'Go away! [You are] unclean!' they cry out unto us, while the taskmasters are in a hurry, saying: 'Go away from here; purify yourselves!' &lt;small&gt;(Isa. 52:11)&lt;/small&gt;, and do not take pity upon any of your delectable things, lest the king should be sorely angry with you, [and] will kill you and your children, your aged men and your young men. Now if you should forsake your God whom you trust, and enter into our own religion, it will be well with you, seeing that He is no longer with you, but has already abandoned you in our hands; [we] being able to do with you as we please!' …Now, there is no one who helps us, whether of the deputies or of the ministers, for when they saw that we had given-up our souls unto martyrdom for His name sake, and that we had been obedient to His word and speech, they then conspired against us to eradicate our name with fierce anger. They said [to us], 'this despised and wretched nation, they have rejected our religion (i.e. Islam), whereas neither largess, nor gratis, would have made them come over.' …They banded together against us, they and their kings, their male servants and handmaids, so that small babes spat upon him who is greatest amongst us. …Now, God has hidden His face from us, 'while we have all faded like a leaf' &lt;small&gt;(Isa. 64:5)&lt;/small&gt;. We went with shame and with reproach, in hunger and in thirst, and in nakedness and in deprivation of all things, unto that place which the king had decreed over us, for he had no wish for money, but rather in seeing our destruction.}}

The author goes on to explain how that, when they reached their destination, they wept bitterly, since many of them had perished as in a plague, and they were unable to bury them because of the excruciating heat. When some of their party had tried to escape at night, approximately seventy men, the next morning when the sun arose they were stricken down by the intense heat, and there they died. The author concludes by saying, "Now, this decree of exile was at the beginning of ''[[anno mundi]]'' 5440 (= 1679 CE), and the blessed God redeemed us at the [year's] end; the sign of which being: 'The punishment of your iniquity has ''ended'' ' &lt;small&gt;(Lam. 4:22)&lt;/small&gt;." Here, the author makes a play on words; the Hebrew word for "ended" (Heb. תם) having the numerical value of 440, the same as the year when abbreviated without the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, ''Zion – A Quarterly for Research in Jewish History'', vol. xxxvii. The Historical Society of Israel: Jerusalem 1972, p. 207 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mawzaʻ==
[[File:Tihama Coastal Plain, Yemen 1931.jpg|thumb|right|The Tihama Coastal Plain - 1931]]

Mawzaʻ is a town situated eleven-days' walking distance from Sana'a, and ca. {{convert|20|km|mi|order=flip}} from the port of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]], in the [[Tihama]] coastal plain. During their long trek there, the king's soldiers pressed them on. Many of the sick and elderly and children died along the way. Others would later succumb to the harsh weather conditions of that place. All, however, suffered from hunger and thirst.  Eventually, the community of Sana'a was joined by other Jewish communities from across Yemen. In Mawzaʻ they remained for one full year, until 1680, when the king's non-Jewish subjects began to complain about their lack of farm implements which had been exclusively made by Jewish craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," Sefunot (Volume Two), Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1958, pp. 246–286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 714–715 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of [[`Amran]] went personally before the king with a petition to bring back his Jewish subjects. The king acquiesced and sent emissaries bearing food and water to call them back to their former cities.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Sassoon#Progeny|David Solomon Sassoon]], ''On the Origins of the Jews in Yemen'' (לקורות היהודים בתימן), Budapest 1931, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Some returned only to find their homes taken by usurping occupants. Others decided to move and to settle elsewhere in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush''," Ketavim (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Hayim Hibshush]], speaking somewhat about this time, writes: "For the duration of one year since this decree was first issued, they went as sheep to the slaughter from all the districts of Yemen, while none remained of all those districts who did not go into exile, excepting the district of Nihm towards the east, and the district of al-Jawf, as well as the eastern district of Khawlan."&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," Ketavim (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical records==
[[File:Two Jewish Elders from Sana'a, Yemen, in 1904.jpg|thumb|Two Jewish Elders from Sana'a, 1904]]
Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]] (who is known by the acronym [[Maharitz (Yihya Salah)|Maharitz]]) gives a most captivating account of these harrowing events borne by the Jews of Sana'a in the years leading up to their expulsion, as also when they left their city, based on a hand-written document preserved and copied down by subsequent generations. Some have judged the sum and bearing of these events as a mere microscopic example of the sufferings experienced by the Jewish inhabitants as a whole, in each and every city throughout Yemen. Thus, he gives the following account:&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi (ed.), ''Studies in 'Megillat Teman' '' by Yiḥyah Salaḥ, The Magnes Press: Hebrew University,  Jerusalem 1986, pp. 44-47 (based on MS. #1, Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=...In the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-six [of the [[Seleucid Era]]] (1675{{nbsp}}CE) the king named [[Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il|Isma'il]] died, and there was a famine and many died. Then [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|Aḥmad]], the son of Ḥasan, reigned in his stead, who was called al-Ḥasni, who expelled the Turks, and ruled by strength of arms, and was a man of exploits, and went up north and captured those districts, and went as far as to [[Yafa|al-Yāfaʻ]] [in the south] and captured it. And in the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-seven [of the Seleucid Era] (1676 CE), he destroyed the synagogues of the Jews. Then in the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-eight [of the Seleucid Era] (1677 CE) there was a famine, and in the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-nine (1678 CE) he expelled Israel unto the desert of Mawzaʻ,&lt;ref&gt;Professor Yosef Tobi says that the date here is in error, and should rather be amended to read 1679.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a horrific place, and one known for its excruciating heat; its air being bad.  No man could proceed upon the ground on account of their over weariness and the blisters which effected their feet.

Now, during that same year, when they departed from Sana'a to go unto Mawzaʻ, there was a certain gentile unto whom they committed for safekeeping several scrolls of the Law and several books of the [[Talmud]], and of Bible codices and of [[Midrashic]] literature [aplenty], as well as several leather-bound books which had been composed by the early scholars in their own hand-writing, for they were not able to carry them because of the encumbrance along the way, since they had been driven out on a sudden, they and their wives and children. Now these books nearly filled up one large room. They were of the opinion that they could appease the king, and that they would return to take their books. And it came to pass when they were gone away, that that [wicked] man arose and set fire to them, and burnt them all. On that very hour, Israel became impoverished in all things, whether on account of their shortage of books, or on account of their own novellæ and commentaries being burnt. Nothing remained except a few things of what little they had, of scrolls of the Law and ''[[Gemara]]''s, and the other books which had been taken by the heads of the people in their own hands for their own needs in study and in reading from the books of the Law.

Now while they ventured out in exile, several wise and pious men perished along the way, and several families were utterly taken away from off the face of the earth. Now, it has been told to us that about eighty souls died in one short period of time during one single journey in the desert, near the village of Mawzaʻ, on account of iniquities. On that upcoming Sabbath when they reached the village of Mawzaʻ it happened to be the Sabbath reading for the biblical lection known as ''Beḥuḳḳothai'' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:3-ff.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This reading, based on the sequence of the biblical portions that are read throughout the year, would have been read the following year, in 1680.&lt;/ref&gt; and there stood up the greatest man amongst them to read the [[Tocheichah|Reproofs]], and when they came to the verse that says: ''And I shall bring them into the land of their enemies, perhaps then their uncircumcised heart should be brought under submission etc.'' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:41)&lt;/small&gt;, and when he had then finished his reading, he began to expound [on that portion of the Law], and the spirit of God moved him, and he said that the present decree had been given from the start since ancient times, and is alluded to and is cleverly arranged and has been preserved in the acrostic at the end of each word [in the Hebrew verse], '''oyyaveihe&lt;big&gt;m&lt;/big&gt; '&lt;big&gt;o&lt;/big&gt; 'a&lt;big&gt;z&lt;/big&gt; yikan&lt;big&gt;a&lt;/big&gt;'' = אויביה&lt;big&gt;ם&lt;/big&gt; א&lt;big&gt;ו&lt;/big&gt; א&lt;big&gt;ז&lt;/big&gt; יכנ&lt;big&gt;ע&lt;/big&gt;  &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:41)&lt;/small&gt;, [and which last letters spell out] '''M'''&lt;small&gt;a&lt;/small&gt;'''wzaʻ'''! By the end of the year, the blessed God took mercy upon them and the king was appeased by agreeing to bring back the Jews, only he did not permit them to return to their former houses, but rather to build for themselves [new] houses outside of the city. And so it was.

After these things, they settled in that place wherein the king had given to them to dwell, and they built houses. Now, in those days they appointed over themselves a Prince ([[Nagid]]), even the teacher and rabbi, Yiḥya Halevi, of blessed memory.}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Jewish children in Sana'a, Yemen, circa 1909.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish Children in the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a, 1901]]
Those Jews who survived, who returned either to Sana'a or to the other towns and villages, were mostly ill from being exposed to the changes in climate and from the poor quality of drinking water. In Sana'a, they were required to relinquish their ownership over their houses and fields within the city's wall, in the neighborhood of al-Sā'ilah, and were directed to build humble abodes in a new area outside of the city's walls, in a place then known as the "hyena's field" (Ar. ''Qāʻ al-simaʻ''), or what later became known as ''Qāʻ al-Yahud '' (the Jewish Quarter).&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," Sefunot, Volume 2, 1958, pp. 246-286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 706 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; This place attracted other migrant Jews from the other towns and villages from which they had been expelled and soon grew into a suburb, situate about one kilometer beyond the walls which then existed on the extreme west-side of the city. The first synagogue to be built in this place was the Alsheikh synagogue, in which was housed the returnees most prized possessions: Torah scrolls and old, handwritten manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafiḥ]], ''Halikhot Teiman'' (Jewish Life in Sana) , Ben-Zvi Institute, Jerusalem, 1982, p. 81, note 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish houses were made "low, seldom more than two storeys, and built of sun-baked brick dressed with mud."&lt;ref name="G. Wyman Bury 1915, p. 80"&gt;G. Wyman Bury, ''Arabia Infelix or the Turks in Yamen'', London 1915, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the place is called ''Qāʻ al-ʻUlufi'' (Ar. قاع العلفي).&lt;ref&gt;R.

Between the new Jewish Quarter and the city walls was a suburb full of gardens called ''Bi'r alʻAzab'' (the Single's Well), being once the Turkish Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafiḥ]], ''Halikhot Teiman (Jewish Life in Sana) '', Ben-Zvi Institute, Jerusalem, 1982, p. 80, note 44&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, the Jewish Quarter was also enclosed by a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''Studies in `Megillat Teman`'', Jerusalem 1986, p. 77 (Hebrew) {{ISBN|965-223-624-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the Muslims passed a new edict which forbade Jews from dwelling within Muslim neighborhoods, so as not to "defile their habitations," although they were at liberty to work in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 706 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who traversed between the Jewish Quarter and the city would go by foot, while those who were either aged or ill would make use of beasts of burden to carry them into the city, the Jewish Quarter being then at a distance of about one-kilometer from the city's walls. When these who had ridden upon donkeys were spied by the gentiles, they were presently envied by the gentiles, who then went unto the king and pressed upon him to outlaw their riding upon donkeys, saying that this mode of transportation seemed to be too extravagant for the Jews and would lead to a general unrest and eventual hegemony over the indigenous people. The king then passed a series of discriminatory laws (Ar. ''ghiyār'') meant to humiliate the Jews and which not only forbade their riding upon donkeys and horses, but also from walking or passing to the right side of any Muslim. Jews were to pass only on the left side of all Muslims. They also petitioned the king that a Jew would be prohibited by an edict from raising his voice against any Muslim, but to behave in a lowly and contrite spirit, and that offenders would be made punishable by flogging.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 706-707 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  Such were the conditions of the Jews at that time.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Exile of Mawzaʻ brought about demographic changes that could be felt all across Yemen. In Sana'a, to distinguish the original inhabitants from incoming migrant Jews, all newcomers who chose to dwell in the newly built Jewish Quarter were given surnames, each one after the place from which he was exiled, so that a man who came from the district of Sharʻab was called so-and-so, al-Sharʻabi, or he that came from the village of Maswar was called so-and-so, al-Maswari.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 706 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of the Jewish chronicler who wrote ''Dofi Hazeman'' (Vicissitudes of Time), being one of the earliest Jewish accounts of the expulsion (initially compiled by Yaḥyā ben Judah Ṣa'di in 1725) &lt;ref&gt;[[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], ''The Yemenites (History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life)'', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1983, p. 162 (Hebrew). David Solomon Sassoon attributes the writing to [the son of] Sa'īd, based on the author's own remark that he is "the son of ''Ḥazmaq'' the younger" (= Sa'īd, or Se'adyah), the usual rendition for this name given in the reversed order of the Hebrew alphabet. See: David Solomon Sassoon, ''Ohel Dawid'' (vol. 2), Oxford University Press: London 1932, p. 969, s.v. דופי הזמן. A microfilm copy of this work is available at the National Library of Israel in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Givat Ram Campus), Manuscript Dept., Microfilm reel # F-9103.&lt;/ref&gt; and which work has since undergone several recensions by later chroniclers, we read the following testimony:&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," or what was originally entitled ''Dofi Hazeman'' (Vicissitudes of Time), Sefunot (Volume Two), 1958, pp. 246-286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|He (i.e. the king) then commanded to give license unto the Jews to return unto the country and to build for themselves tents, although set apart from the houses of the Muslims so that they will not defile them. Those who were banished then came up from the [[Tihama]] [coastal plain], returning from [[Mawza District|Mawzaʻ]]; one man from a city and two from a family, for most of them had been consumed by the land of [[Tihama]] which dispenses of life. Neither had there remained any of them, save ten people for every hundred [who were driven out into exile], while the majority of them did not return to settle in their former place, but were scattered in all the districts of Yemen. That is, aside from the family of the Levites, most of whom returned and settled in their [former] place. Now their dwelling place was from the town of ash-Sharafah, eastward of Wadi al-Sirr, stretching as far as the town of al-'Arus which lies in the region of [[Kawkaban]], a walking distance of about one and a half days; as well as the breadth of the city of [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']], stretching as far as the extremity of the land of Arḥab, being also a walking distance of one and a half days. These trace their lineage to Sasson the Levite, their ancestor, seeing that there was a law for the early Jews in Yemen for each family to dwell separately; the family of priests ([[Kohen|Cohenim]]) by themselves with their burial grounds, and also the family of Levites and the Israelites, each of them dwelling by themselves in their cities and with their own burial grounds. Now, unto this day, those Levites dwell separately in those said districts, although a few Israelites have newly arrived to dwell in their midst. In every place, the gentiles have given to them a parcel of ground, on a rental basis, in order that they may construct shelters in which to live, set apart from them, seeing that their enemies had already taken [from them] their own towns and houses and vineyards and fields. Thus, they were pleased to dwell with them and to be occupied in the various fields of labour, according to their diverse skills, in order that they might find sustenance thereby for their beings: among which were those who plastered with earth, and of those who crushed limestone, and of those who were potters, and some who were wood craftsmen, and others silversmiths, while still others blacksmiths and some who were merchants; There were yet others who were couriers, some who were weavers, others tailors, and some who were knowledgeable in prophylactic matters; others who were physicians, and others who chiseled away the surface of millstones, and some of whom who were porters. Now their magnanimity did not permit them to just lay back in idleness.}}

Danish explorer, [[Carsten Niebuhr]], who visited the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a in 1763, some eighty-three years following the community's return to Sana'a, estimated their numbers at only two-thousand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carsten Niebuhr]], ''Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien und andern umliegenden Ländern'' (''Description of Travel to Arabia and Other Neighboring Countries''), Zürich 1992, pp. 416-418 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; These had built, up until 1761, fourteen synagogues within the new Jewish Quarter. In 1902, before the famine of 1905 decimated more than half of the city's Jewish population, German explorer [[Hermann Burchardt]] estimated the Jewish population of Sana'a at somewhere between six and eight thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Burchardt, ''Die Juden in Yemen'', published in: ''Ost und West'', Berlin 1902, p. 338 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; G. Wyman Bury, who visited the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a in 1905 noted a decrease in the city's population from 1891, estimated at 50,000 people (Jews and Muslims alike), to only about 20,000 people in 1905.&lt;ref name="G. Wyman Bury 1915, p. 80"/&gt; By 1934, when [[Carl Rathjens]] visited Sana'a, the Jewish population in the city had swollen to about seven thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rathjens &amp; Hermann v. Wissman, ''Landeskundliche Ergebnisse'', vol. 40, Hamburg 1934, pp. 133-134; 141 (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate of the Old Synagogue==
One of the outcomes of the king's notorious decree was that Jewish property passed into Muslim hands. A Jewish public bath house in Sana'a was relinquished and passed into the proprietorship of the Muslim [[Waqf]]. So, too, the once famous synagogue within Sana'a's walled city and which was known as ''Kenisat al-'Ulamā'' (The Synagogue of the Sages) was turned into a [[mosque]] and called ''Masjid al-Jalā'' – the Mosque of the Expulsion, or "of those banished." On the frieze (Ar. ''ṭiraz'') of the ''Masjid al-Jalā'' were inscribed words with invectives, in gypsum plaster (Ar. ''al-juṣ''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our king, [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]], is the sun of [religious] guidance / even [[al-Mahdi Ahmad|Aḥmad]], the [grand]son of him who rose to power, [[Al-Mansur al-Qasim|al-Qasim]]. Unto him is ascribed dignities, such as were not accorded / before [to any other], even in part. Had he not done aught but banish / the Jews of [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']], who are the 'scum' of the world, and turned their venerable place (Ar. ''bi'ah'' = synagogue) into a mosque, / for bowing down unto God or standing [before Him in prayer], by that decree, he would have still been most triumphant. Now the time of this event happened to concur with the date that is [alluded to] in ''ghānim'' [victorious]";  [[Abjad numerals#Letter values|''Ghān&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;m'']] = ({{lang-ar|'''غانم'''}}), the numerical value of which letters adds up to [[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] 1091 = 1680 CE).&lt;ref&gt;P.S. van Koningsveld, J. Sadan &amp; Q. Al-Samarrai, ''Yemenite Authorities and Jewish Messianism'', Leiden University 1990, pp. 156-158. {{ISBN|9071220079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi [[Amram Qorah]] brings down a brief history of the said mosque, taken from a book originally drawn up in Arabic and which was entitled: ''A List of the Mosques of Ṣan'ā'''.&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teman'' (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1988, pp. 10-11 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  Therein is found a vivid description of the events which transpired in that fateful year and which reads as follows: "Among the mosques built in the vicinity of al-Sā'ilah, northwards from the path which leads from al-Sā'ilah to al-Quzālī, and the mosque [known as] Ben al-Ḥussein built by the Imam of the Qasimid dynasty, the son of Muhammad (i.e. al-Mahdi Ahmad b. al-Ḥasan b. [[Al-Mansur al-Qasim|al-Qasim]] b. Muhammad), in the year [[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] 1091 (= 1679 CE) in the synagogue of the Jewish Quarter, who banished them from Sana'a and removed them unto a place befitting them, [a place] now known as ''Qāʻ al-Yahud'' on the west side of Sana'a, just as it has been intimated by the scholarly judge, Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Suḥuli, etc." Rabbi Amram Qorah then proceeds to bring down the words or [[panegyric]] inscribed on the frieze of the mosque in rhymed verse (see: ''supra''), and which apparently had been composed by the said judge, in which he describes the exploits of the king who banished the Jews and who converted their synagogue into a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teman'' (1st edition), Jerusalem 1954, pp. 10-11 ([http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7292&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=23&amp;hilite= pp. 23-24] in PDF) [Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Amram Qorah, in the same work, brings down Rabbi Pinheas ben Gad Hacohen's account of events, whose testimony he found written in the margin of the first page of a Prayer Book (''Siddur''), written in 1710:&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teman'' (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1988, pp. 9 -10 (Hebrew). Moshe Gavra brings down the same account, mentioning that Rabbi Pinheas ben Gad Hacohen of Dhamar had first written this account in a ''Siddur'' that he had written for Rabbi Yehudah Ṣa'adi in 1680. See: {{cite book | last=Gavra | first=Moshe | year=2010 | title=Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman: Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen, vol. 1, p. 72 | place=Benei Barak | publisher=Mechon le'ḥeqer ḥakhmei tayman | language=Hebrew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now I shall inform you, my brethren, about what has happened to us at this time, since the beginning of ''anno'' 1,990 of the [[Seleucid Era]] (1678 CE) and in 1,991 [of the same] (1679 CE), how that the king made a decree and demolished all the synagogues of all the towns of Yemen, and there were some of the books and sacred writings that were desecrated at the hand of the gentiles, on account of our great iniquities, so that we could no longer make our [public] prayers, save only a very few [men] secretly within their houses. Afterwards, the king made a decree against the Jews to expel them into the wilderness of Mawzaʻ, while they, [at this time] demolished also their houses. However, there were some who managed to sell their house; what was worth one-thousand gold pieces they sold for one-hundred, and what was worth one-hundred gold pieces they sold for ten. So that, by these things, we were for a reproach amongst the nations, who continuously sought after ways by which they might cause us to change [our religion], O may God forbid! So, all of the exiles of Israel stood up and laid aside their most beloved and precious possessions as a means by which God's name might be sanctified, blessed be He, including their fields and their vineyards, and delivered themselves up as martyrs for God's name sake, blessed be He. And if one had need of going out into the marketplace, he could not avoid being the object of hatred and spite, while there were those who even attacked him or called him by abusive language, so that there was fulfilled in this, our generation, the scripture that says, ''Who will raise up Jacob, for he is too small'' &lt;small&gt;(Amos 7: 2, 5)&lt;/small&gt; to bear all the afflictions. So, too, was there fulfilled in us by reason of our iniquities the scripture that says, ''And I shall send a faintness into their hearts'' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:36)&lt;/small&gt;. Yet, the divine Name, blessed be He, gives us strength to bear all those troubles and travails each day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Testimonies preserved in poetry==
Another man who witnessed these events, Shalem 'Ashri, also wrote a suppliant poem about the events of that year – the Exile of Mawzaʻ, now preserved in the Yemenite [[Diwan (poetry)|''Diwān'']],&lt;ref name=jerusalem1976&gt;''Sefer Hashirim Hagadol – The Large Song Book'', [[Shalom Shabazi]] (ed. Yosef Hasid), Jerusalem 1976, p. 51, s.v. אזיל דמעותי כמטר יזלו (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; which same poem is meant to be chanted as a slow dirge by one or, at the most, two individuals, who are then answered by others who sit in attendance. It is sung without the accompaniment of musical instruments, although a tin drum is sometimes used, in accordance with what is customary and proper for the ''[[nashid]]'' (a rejoinder). His own name is spelt out in acrostic form in the first letters of each stanza:&lt;ref name=jerusalem1976 /&gt;
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Poem: "I Shall Shed My Tears"}}}}

"I shall shed my tears – like rain they shall pour down / over all the pleasant sons who have gone forth into exile.
They have forgotten what pertains to their happiness, and have also been diminished. / They journeyed in haste; along the parched ground they trod.
On the day when 'Uzal (i.e. [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']])&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Based on Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Judeo-Arabic translation of 'Uzal in Genesis 10:27, which is rendered as Sanaa.&lt;/ref&gt; went into exile, they took up his burden.
The sun and the moon were extinguished at their departure!
A multitude of the handmaid's sons&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to [[Ishmael]], the son of Hagar (handmaid of Abraham), and the progenitor of the Arab nation.&lt;/ref&gt; have ruled over them. / Wrath, and also jealousy, they've poured out upon them.
So that they have inherited all of the glory, even their sublime honour!
Whilst the dwelling place of God's glory, they have been given power to destroy!  
Midrash, as also the Talmud and the Torah, they have abolished. / Constable and elder were, both, drawn away by their hands.
Orion and Pleiades, as well as the crescent moon, have become dim! / Even all the luminous lights, their light has turned into darkness!
The beauty of their homes and their money they had entirely looted. / Every oppressor and every governor have prepared their bow for shooting.
Preserve, O Master of the universe, those who are your peculiar friends, / Hadoram (i.e. [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]]),&lt;ref&gt;Based on Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Judeo-Arabic translation of Hadoram in Genesis 10:27, which is rendered as Dhamar.&lt;/ref&gt; God's congregation, have been drawn after you!
The heads of their academies have borne patiently the exile, / to do even the will of God, having valued the commandments.
Redeem, O Master of the universe, your friends who have inherited / the Divine Law and sound wisdom, by which they have been blest!
For the honour due to the writing of thine own hand on the day when they were gathered,&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to the tablets of the Ten Commandments, given to the people of Israel while they were gathered at Mount Sinai.&lt;/ref&gt; / may you call to remembrance and deliver them during the time of their flight.
My name is Shalem; 'tis written in the locked rhyme. / Rejoice in God's Divine Law, and bless His name!"

'''Original: '''

אזיל דמעותי כמטר יזלו / על כל בני חמדה בגלות הלכו.
נשו לטובתם וגם נתדלדלו / נסעו בחפזון בציה דרכו.
יום גלתה אוזל וסבלו סבלו / שמש וירח בצאתם נדעכו.
שפעת בני אמה עליהם משלו / חמה וגם קנאה עליהם שפכו.
לכלל יקר הדרת כבודם נחלו / ומעון כבוד האל להחריב נמלכו.

עיש וגם כימה וסהר אפלו / גם כל מאורי אור מאורם חשכו.
את כל נאות ביתם וכספם שללו / כל צר וכל מושל לקשתם דרכו.
שמרה אדון עולם ידידים נסגלו / הדורם עדת האל אחריך נמשכו.
ראשי ישיבתם לגלות סבלו / לעשות רצון האל ומצות ערכו.
יגאל אדון עולם ידידים נחלו / תורה ותושיה ובה נתברכו.

שלם שמי כתוב בחרוזים ננעלו / שמחו בתורת אל ולשמו ברכו.

In the following poem of the subgenre known as ''qiṣṣa'' (poetic tale), composed mostly in [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] with only two stanzas written in Hebrew, the author gives a long testimony about the events which transpired during that year of exile. The poem is entitled, ''Waṣalnā hātif al-alḥān'' – "Tidings have reached us," and is the work of the illustrious poet, [[Shalom Shabazi]], who was an eye-witness to these events and whose name is inscribed in the poem in acrostics. The rhyme, however, has been lost in the translation:&lt;ref&gt;The English translation (in the collapsible thread) is based on the Hebrew translation of the poem made by Yehudah Ratzaby, in his article, ''Galut Mawza''', published in Sefunot, Volume 5, Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, pp. 353-354 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Poem: "Tidings Have Reached Us"}}}}
"Tidings have reached us on the second day of [the lunar month] ''[[Rajab]]'' (i.e. corresponds with the 2nd day of the lunar month Elul), saying, 'My companions, arise and ascribe singularity unto the Merciful One, and read [the decree] that has been inscribed!  Hearken to these matters, and let not your mind be distracted, for the appointed time is at hand. [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|Al-Mahdi]] the king has decreed over us that we take flight.' The Jews of [[Sana'a]] then took leave, and have wandered unto those select places,&lt;ref&gt;Lit. "...have wandered unto Khabt," perhaps being the Al-Khabt in the Abyan District, in the far south-eastern reaches of Yemen, near the Indian Ocean. Yehudah Ratzaby suggests that the sense here is the two towns, the one being called ''Khabt of Darʻān'' and the other, ''Khabt of al-Baqr''. Initially, the king had agreed that Jews be permitted to resettle in these towns, but later changed his mind. See: Yehudah Ratzaby, article: ''Galut Mawza''', published in Sefunot (Volume Five), Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, pp. 378-379, note *4 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; even unto the habitation of vipers and brute beasts. Even from al-Mahjam and from Dar'ān it was decreed over us to leave; by authorization of an edict which has overcome us. Now, we shall wait in Mawza'; there we shall dwell in the far reaches of the land belonging to the inhabitants of Arabia.

All of the inhabitants of 'Uzal (i.e. [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']])&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; were obedient, and they assembled in [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]]. My companion, tighten the camel's gear and we'll begin moving after the ass. Let us proceed to 'Adinah, then to 'Amirah, and to al-'Ammār, while there we shall make camp. As for the young ones and those who were weak, their tears flowed like riverine brooks. 'Idaynah, receive those who are beloved! Go out to the gate of the city to welcome them! Now is the hour of testing those who are friends. Let them take pleasure in the weary fugitive, so that his fatigue might depart from him. Lo! They are the sons of the tribes and of those who are pious; those who are highborn and of gentility.

''Ṣafī al-Din'' (i.e. [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]]) has already given the order that we not remain in our places.  Whether rich man or poor man, or he that is respectable, together they have gone forth; let us proceed according to our ability, under the influences of Saturn's horoscope; its evil portent will bring destruction. If its light flickers, it is about to change. The wisdom of the Blessed God has decreed upon the Sages of Israel, even the chosen sons of Jacob. Our elder, Suleiman [al-Naqqāsh] the Helmsman, will be the judge of those attempting to bypass [his decree]. In his hand there is the Imām's order for all to see, while there is nothing disparaging about the matter.

I am curtailed of my sleep from dismay, while tears run down my cheeks. When our elder, al-Naqqāsh, had arrived, all of the Jews [who had come out to see him] were shaken-up. 'Let us go out into the barren wasteland, a place of monstrous beasts and every kind of lion. Happy is he who returns safely from that place. We have already sold our fields, have forsaken our houses, and have submitted to the decree of our lord, [the king].' The young men wept, as also the pious men, when His anger was turned against us. Consider, O Lord, and reflect upon how many distinguished men, as well as those who were delicately raised, have been humiliated!

Weep, O Rachel, in our city for [your] wandering sons! Stir up our forefathers, let them arise, standing upon their feet, so that they may make mention of our fathers who, with grace, insist upon God's unison.  May God's favour accompany us, in whose shadow we fervently desire. Let him gather those who dwell in Yemen, seeing that He is a Shepherd and the Faithful God. We shall then hear the song of the sons of Heman (i.e. the sons of Zerah, the son of Judah). Let him then take away the poison of the adder, which is most bitter. Let him command Yinnon (i.e. the Messiah) and the Prefect [of the priest] (i.e. Elijah, the forerunner of the Messiah), and let him say to him: 'Draw nigh!'

By the merit of our forefathers, by the favour [with which you have favoured] Levi who is of Jacob's seed, make level [the ground] along the route in your wilderness for the son who is, both, comely and good. And by the nut tree garden may you sedate my heart which is in pain. As for Gabriel and the rooster, I have heard them in the street, whilst my pigeon is at rest; she calls out to the poor: 'Release [them] from their bonds!' In Zion there is to be found relief, whilst our portion is in the [[Garden of Eden]], just as a son who is dearly loved. We shall then behold the house of our God, and the houses of [[Gush Halav|Gischala]] (Heb. Gush Ḥalab).

The Mashtaite&lt;ref&gt;Another appellation for Shalom Shabazi&lt;/ref&gt; has said: O God, remove mine affliction. Our strength is brought low in Yemen, in the days of my exile. In both small and great matters, I think about my case. Now, by the abundance [of afflictions] delights have been diminished. O gracious God! He who instructs my tongue to speak, Heaven forbid that you have forgotten me!  Unto Whom belong signs and wonders. Behold, it was upon us that He bestowed His bounty, and He has chosen Moses, the son of Amram, our beloved prophet!

The pampered pigeons are cooing in the tops of the citadels. The householders of al-Sā'ilah who have come to visit [[al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]] are complaining [before him] about how destruction and evil have come over them. They recall the conversations revolving around the Divine Law spoken [between their walls], and the vines and the flowers [in their gardens]; they recall also the social gatherings where wine was served, and the chalices, and the splendour of their wedding feasts, where [a man] would delight himself in them, become inebriated, but would avoid that which is obscene or mockery; [he'd drink] pure wine, whatever kind at hand, whose colour was as gold!

The Book of the Law (i.e. [[Torah]]) calls out to all wise men, and says: 'Have you neglected the study of the Law? It is the reason for their ignorance. Let them repent before the masters and return unto their Lord. The day of redemption is nigh, and He shall gather together their dispersed. There is a time for drinking wine, together with [eating] dainties, and there is a time for delving in wisdom. He, whose wine makes him heavy laden, let him sleep [and rest] from his weariness and from his burden. Let him wake-up to drink a second cup, such as may be imposed upon him.

In conclusion, [let us pray] that He who is congenial (i.e. God) might conceal us in the covert of His mercy. The Benevolent One shall not forget us, while we shall proclaim the eminence of His bountiful grace. He that will console us, may he be merited with a good life. He that gives to us clothing, may his own wishes be fulfilled. My salutations go out unto those of my companions on this happy, but powerful night; [which shall continue unabated] until Venus comes out [in the sky]. That which my God has decreed shall come to pass, while for every thing there is a reason. The birds will once again trill at the top of the ben [nut] tree (''Moringa peregrina'') in the fruitful orchard."

Another record of these events, composed here in poetic verse (although the rhyme has been lost in the translation), is the poem composed by Sālim ben Sa'īd, in [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]]. The poem is written as a ''nashid'' and is entitled, '''Ibda' birrub al-'arsh'' (I shall commence by addressing Him who is upon the throne).&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, Sefunot (Volume Five), his article: ''Galut Mawza''', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, pp. 379-380 (Translation of the original Judeo-Arabic), s.v. poem entitled: אבדע ברב אלערש; The original Judeo-Arabic was published in ''Hazofeh – Quartalis Hebraica'' (ed.

"I shall commence by addressing Him who is upon the throne [of glory], even He that is an Omniscient God, the Creator of all creatures; He who causes the dumb to speak.

I was curtailed of my sleep this night, while my heart was aching on account the king's decree; he that has made a decree against us by an oath.

He has revealed his ill-intentions on a dark night, one made sullen by the shadow of death; and who has sent against us soldiers and oppressors.

We lifted up our voices unto God of heaven, [saying]: 'Remove from us the evil of this decree. Behold! You are He that governs all!'

They have destroyed all of the cities, and have cast their fear upon the Sages. There is none who takes an interest in our case, nor anyone who will take pity upon us.

He lifted up his right hand and swore, 'They have no choice but to be banished unto Mawza!'

He commanded to destroy the synagogues which were in [[Sana'a]], the habitation of the Divine Law and the seating place of the Sages.

He forced (?) them to go out into a parched land, the [[Tihama]] and al-Mahjam.

They wandered unto Mawza' and walked along the paths, in the fierce blaze of heat and with severe thirst.

On the day in which he took them out of their houses, their eyes rained tears of blood. They had gone out a short distance in the dark of night.&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with a verse in Ezekiel 12:4, ''And you shall go forth at eventide in their sight, as they that go forth into exile''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several distinguished persons, and several disciples of the Sages [went forth into exile]; they and their little ones, who were without understanding.

'You are obliged to go forth into exile; `tis from the Lord of Heaven, who once delivered us from the hand of wicked Pharaoh.'

My heart moans over my relatives who are missing. I have no pleasure in sleep, nor in bread or water!

A flame burns inside of me, ever since the evil tidings [of the king's decree] reached me; I have become perplexed.

Praised be the Creator of the heavenly circuits, the Ruler of all [things], unto whom none can be compared.

Your covenant and your signs have been forever. You have intoxicated your people with the waters of Abraham, [made during] the covenant between the dissected halves.&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to Genesis 15:1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

But now, O king of most puissant kings, your people are sadly distressed and are deprived of all things.

They (i.e. the gentiles) cast their fear upon us, while the horsemen inflict us. No one tries to help us, nor is there anyone who takes pity upon us.

They have humiliated our religion, and have called out to us to become Muslims; even to sin and to desecrate your Divine Law.

He (i.e. the Imām) has issued against us frequent declarations; shall we not fear the punishment of God on High?

Our elders have gone forth into exile by an urgent command, whether willingly or unwillingly.

I have concluded my words, my brethren! Take-up my salutations and remain silent! Our hope is in God the Omniscient.

Remember me, O God, on account of the Divine Law's hidden mystery! So, too, remember Jacob, 'the man of pure intentions' [dwelling in tents]!&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to Genesis 25:27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remember Moses who built for you the Tent of Convocation in the Sinai wilderness, on the day in which your Divine Presence dwelt thereon.

Do not forget Isaac, your bound [servant], on the day in which he spoke to Abraham face to face.

Praise be to you, O Master of the universe! `Tis from me, Sālim ben Sa'īd, who has written rhymed verse."

==Jacob Saphir's Testimony==
In 1859, Lithuanian Jew, [[Jacob Saphir]], visited the Jewish community in Yemen, less than two-hundred years after the Exile of Mawza', but still heard vivid accounts from the people about the things that befell their ancestors during that fateful event. Later, he made a written account of the same in his momentous ethnographic work, ''Iben Safir''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Saphir, ''Iben Safir'' (vol. 1 - ch. 43), Lyck 1866, pp. 100a-100b (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The full, unabridged account is given here (translated from the original Hebrew):
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Jacob Saphir's Testimony}}}}
"[The Jews] dwelt securely, beneath the shadow of the kings of that country, until three-hundred ([[sic]]) years ago&lt;ref&gt;Should be amended to read "approximately two-hundred years ago," i.e. 1679&lt;/ref&gt; while they were dwelling in that chief metropolis, when the daughter of the king became pregnant outside of wedlock, and they laid the blame upon a Jewish man, one of the king's courtiers and of those who behold his countenance. However, the king's wrath wasn't assuaged until he had banished all of the Jews from that city and the surrounding regions, expelling them to the region of [[Tihama]], a desolate wilderness (a walking distance of ten days' journey in a south-westerly direction from [[Sana'a]]), between [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] and [[Aden]]; a salty land, and one of very fearsome heat, while they were all tender and accustomed to delicacies. Many of them died along the way, while those who came there could not bear the climate of that place and its infirmities. Two thirds of them succumbed and perished, and they had entertained the notion that all of them would perish either by the plague, by famine or by thirst, may God forbid. &lt;small&gt;'''(Here, J. Saphir brings down a poem written about the event by Rabbi [[Shalom Shabazi]], and which has already been quoted above)'''&lt;/small&gt; Now during the time of this exile and perdition, they had lost all of their precious belongings, and their handwritten books, as well as their peculiar compositions which they possessed of old. I have also seen their synagogues and places of study used by them of old in the city of the gentiles; eternal desolations 'and where demons will be found making sport' &lt;small&gt;(Isa. 13:21)&lt;/small&gt;, on account of our great iniquities. Notwithstanding, it is by the mercies of the Lord that we have not perished. He (i.e. God) did not prolong the days of their exile, but sent great distempers upon the king and upon his household. (They say that this was on account of the virtue of that pious Rabbi, the [[kabbalist]], even our teacher and Rabbi, Mori [[Shalom Shabazi|Sālim al-Shabazi]], may the memory of the righteous be blessed, who brought about multiple forms of distempers upon that cruel king, who then regretted the evil [that he caused them] and sent [messengers] to call out unto them [with] a conciliatory message, [requesting] that they return to their place – with the one exception that they not dwell with them in the royal city built as a fortress. He then gave to them a possession, being a grand inheritance outside of the city, which is ''al-Qaʻa'', ''B'ir al-ʻAzāb'' – the plain wherein is the cistern known as ''ʻAzāb'', and they built there houses for their dwelling quarters and built for themselves an enclosing wall which extended as far as to the wall of the city built like unto a fortress. In only a short time God assisted them, and they built there a large city and one that was spacious. They also acquired wealth and they rose to prominence, while many of the villagers likewise seized [upon land] with them, that they might dwell in the city, until it became [a place] full of people. At that time, Mori Yiḥya Halevi was the ''Nasi'' among them and the Exilarch.)"

== References to [[Sana'a]] before the expulsion==
There are several references to Jewish life in Sana'a before the expulsion of 1679. [[Yihya Saleh|Maharitz]] (d. 1805) mentions in his Responsa&lt;ref name=jerusalem1979b&gt;''Questions &amp; Responsa Pe'ulath Ṣadiq'', [[Yihya Saleh]], vol. III, ''responsum'' # 252, Jerusalem 1979, p. 153 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; that before the Exile of Mawza the Jews of Sana'a had an old custom to say the [[Sheva Brachot|seven benedictions]] for the bridegroom and bride on a Friday morning, following the couple's wedding the day before. On Friday (Sabbath eve) they would pitch a large tent within a garden called ''al-Jowzah'', replete with pillows and cushions, and there, on the next day (Sabbath afternoon), the invited guests would repeat the seven benedictions for the bridegroom and bride, followed by prayer inside the tent, before being dismissed to eat of their third Sabbath meal, at which time some accompanied the bridegroom to his own house to eat with him there. The significance of this practice, according to Maharitz, was that they made the seven blessings even when not actually eating in that place, a practice which differs from today's custom.&lt;ref name=jerusalem1979b /&gt;

German-Jewish ethnographer, [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], mentions a historical note about the old synagogue in Sana'a, before the expulsion of Jews from the city in 1679, and which is written in the glosses of an old copy of the [[Mishnah]] (''[[Seder Moed]]''), written with Babylonian [[Yemenite Hebrew#History|supralinear punctuation]].&lt;ref name=holon1975&gt;''The Mishnah: Order Mo'ed - A Yemenite Manuscript '', ed. Yehudah Levi Nahum, Introduction, Ḥolon 1975, p. 18 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The marginal note concerns the accurate pronunciation of the word אישות in Mishnah ''Mo'ed Ḳaṭan'' 1:4, and reads as follows: "Now the Jews of Sana'a read it as אִישׁוּת (''ishūth''), with a [vowel] ''[[Kubutz and Shuruk|shuraq]]'' (''shuruk''). I studied with them a long time ago, during the time when the synagogue of Sana'a was still standing ''[[in situ]]''."&lt;ref name=holon1975 /&gt;

==Enactments in wake of exile (1680–1690)==
Upon returning to Sana'a, the Chief Rabbis, led by R. Shelomo Manzeli and Yiḥya Halevi (called ''Alsheikh''), came together in the newly built Alsheikh synagogue and decided to put in place a series of enactments meant at bettering the spiritual condition of the community, and which they hoped would prevent the recurrence of such harsh decrees against the Jewish community in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman: Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'', vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, pp. 70 – 71; ibid. vol. 4, pp. 156 – 159 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  These enactments were transcribed in a document entitled ''Iggereth Ha-Besoroth'' (Letter of Tidings), and which was believed to have been disseminated amongst the community at large. Only excerpts of the letter have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yosef Subeiri, ''Siddur Kenesseth Ha-Gedolah'', vol. 3, Tel-Aviv/Jaffa 1976 – 1992, p. 297 (Hebrew); Rabbi Yihya Saleh, Questions &amp; Responsa ''Pe'ulath Ṣadiq'', vol. III, ''responsum'' # 252, Jerusalem 1979, p. 153 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The enactments called out for a more strict observance of certain laws which, heretofore, had been observed with leniency. Such strictures were to be incumbent upon the entire community and which, in the Rabbis' estimation, would have given to the community some merit in the face of oppression or persecution.  Not all of these enactments, however, were upheld by the community, since some enactments were seen as breaking-away from tradition.&lt;ref&gt;One of the enactments called out for making one-hundred blasts of the horn on the Jewish New Year ([[Rosh Hashanah]]), based on a teaching found in Rabbi [[Nathan ben Jehiel]]'s [[Sefer Ha-Arukh]], s.v. ערב, instead of the traditional forty blasts which had been observed earlier. Another enactment sought to make it a standard procedure during the [[Mussaf]]-prayer of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to make two prayers: the first, by the congregation praying silently, followed by a repetition of the prayer said aloud by the ''Shaliach Tzibbur'' (Prayer precentor).  Maharitz would later adamantly oppose the enactment, since it sought to cancel the ancient tradition in Yemen in this regard in which it had always been a practice to make only one [[Mussaf]]-prayer. Another enactment concerned the seven benedictions mentioned by Rabbi Yosef Karo in his ''Shulḥan Arukh'' (''Even Haʻezer'' 62:10), where he brings down a certain opinion which states that is not permissible for the groom and bride to be entertained in another person's house other than in his own house during the seven days of wedding festivities, unless he and his bride were to leave their own house or town for an extended period of time, in which case it is then permissible. The enactment is mentioned with regard to ''Iggereth Ha-Besoroth'' in [[Yihya Saleh|Maharitz]]'s Questions &amp; Responsa, ''Pe'ulath Sadiq'', vol. III, ''responsum'' # 252, although the enactment seemed to have been rejected by Maharitz, in favour of Israel's older practice in Yemen. Rabbi Shalom Yitzhaq Halevi informs us that the Yemenite custom in his day was as that taught by Maharitz, and rectifies the discrepancy between the ''Shulḥan Arukh'' and the Yemenite Jewish custom by writing in the glosses of his 1894 edition of the ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim'' that the ''Shulḥan Arukh'' (ibid.) refers merely to when the groom and bride are invited to make the "seven benedictions" in another house where, during the seven days of feasting, a supper had been made on behalf of a circumcision, or some other ceremonial meal other than what was specifically made on the groom's behalf, in which it is not permitted to say for them the "seven benedictions." See also Rabbi Ḥayim Kessar's Questions &amp; Responsa ''Haḥayim wehashalom'' (Even Haʻezer, ''responsum'' # 10), who cites from Rabbi Yihya Hacohen's Responsa, ''Ḥayei Shalom'' (''responsum'' # 2), where he says that after the wedding, it was never a custom in Yemen that a man's bride accompanied him when he was invited to eat in the home of others. He reasons that, since she is not with him, they should not say the seven benedictions for the bridegroom alone.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19937">It has been argued that [[social tagging]] or '''[[collaborative tagging]]''' systems can provide navigational cues or "way-finders"&lt;ref&gt;Kang, R., Fu, W.-T., &amp; Kannampallil, T. (2010). Exploiting Knowledge-in-the-head and Knowledge-in-the-social-web: Effects of Domain Expertise on Exploratory Search in Individual and Social Search Environments.

W., Fake, C., Von Ahn, L., Schachter, J., Golder, S., Fox, K., Davis, M., Marlow, C., and Naaman, M. Why Do Tagging Systems Work? in CHI '06 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems. (2006). Montréal, Québec, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; for other users to explore information. The notion is that, given that social tags are labels that users create to represent topics extracted from Web documents, interpretation of these tags should allow other users to predict contents of different documents efficiently. Social tags are arguably more important in [[exploratory search]], in which the users may engage in iterative cycles of goal refinement and exploration of new information (as opposed to simple fact-retrievals), and interpretation of information contents by others will provide useful cues for people to discover topics that are relevant. 
One significant challenge that arises in social tagging systems is the rapid increase in the number and diversity of the tags. As opposed to structured annotation systems, tags provide users an unstructured, open-ended mechanism to annotate and organize web-content. As users are free to create any tag to describe any resource, it leads to what is referred to as the vocabulary problem.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Furnas, T. K. Landauer, L. M. Gomez, and S. T. Dumais, "The vocabulary problem in human-system communication," Communications of the ACM, vol. 30, no. 11, pp. 964-971, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Because users may use different words to describe the same document or extract different topics from the same document based on their own background knowledge, the lack of a top-down mediation may lead to an increase in the use of incoherent tags to represent the information resources in the system. In other words, the inherent "unstructuredness" of social tags may hinder their potential as navigational cues for searchers because the diversities of users and motivation may lead to diminishing tag-topic relations as the system grows. However, a number of studies have shown that  structures do emerge at the semantic level&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; – indicating that there are cohesive forces that are driving the emergent structures in a social tagging system.

== The distinction between descriptive and predictive models ==
Just like any [[social phenomena]], [[behavioral pattern]]s in social tagging systems can be characterized by either a [[Descriptive statistics|descriptive]] or [[predictive model]]. While descriptive models ask the question of "what", predictive models go deeper to also ask the question of "why" by attempting to provide explanations to the aggregate behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hedstrom|Hedstrom, Peter]] (2005). Dissecting the social. On the principle of analytic sociology. Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; While there may be no general agreement on what an acceptable explanation should be like, many believe that a good explanation should have certain level of predictive accuracy. Descriptive models of social tagging typically are not concerned with explaining the actions of single individuals but describing the patterns that emerge as individual behavior is aggregated in a large social information system. Predictive models, however, attempt to explain aggregate patterns by analyzing how individuals interact and link to each other in ways that bring about similar or different emergent patterns of social behavior. In particular, a mechanism-based predictive model assumes a certain set of rule that individuals interact with each other, and understand how these interactions could produce aggregate patterns as observed and characterized by descriptive models. Predictive models can therefore provide explanations to why different system characteristics may lead to different aggregate patterns, and can therefore potentially provide information on how systems should be designed to achieve different social purposes.

== Descriptive models of social tagging ==
=== Information theory models ===

For most tagging systems the total number of tags in the collective vocabulary is much less than the total number of objects being tagged. Given this multiplicity of tags to documents, a question remains: how effective are the tags at isolating any single document? Naively, if we specify a single tag in this system we would uniquely identify lots of documents – thus the answer to our question is "not very well!". However this method carries a faulty assumption; not every document is equal. Some documents are more popular and important than others, and this importance is conveyed by the number bookmarks per document. Thus, we can reformulate the above question to be: how well does the mapping of tags to documents retain about the distribution of the documents?  [[Information theory]] provides a natural framework to understand the amount of shared information between two random variables. The conditional entropy measures the amount of entropy remaining in one random variable when we know the value of a second random variable.  Work done by Chi and Mytkowicz&lt;ref&gt;Ed H. Chi, Todd Mytkowicz. Understanding the Efficiency of Social Tagging Systems using Information Theory. In Proc. of ACM Conference on Hypertext 2008. (to appear). ACM Press, 2008. Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; show that the entropy of documents conditional on tags, H(D|T), is increasing rapidly. What this means is that, even after knowing completely the value of a tag, the entropy of the set of documents is increasing over time. Conditional Entropy asks the question: "Given that I know a set of tags, how much uncertainty regarding the document set that I was referencing with those tags remains?" The fact that this curve is strictly increasing suggests that the specificity of any given tag is decreasing. That is to say, as a navigation aid, tags are becoming harder and harder to use. We are moving closer and closer to the proverbial "needle in a haystack" where any single tag references too many documents to be considered useful. 

Another way to look at the data is to think about [[mutual information]], which is a measure of independence between the two variables. Full independence is reached when I(D;T) = 0. Chi and Mytkowicz research on delicious social tagging data show that as a measure of usefulness of the tags and their encoding, there is a worsening trend in the ability of users to specify and find tags and documents when they are engaged in simple fact retrieval. This suggests that we need to build search and recommendation systems that help users sift through resources in social tagging systems, especially when we are engaged in more than simple fact retrieval as characterized by the information theory. In fact, although the number of documents associated with any given tag is increasing, there are many ways contextual information can help users to look for relevant information. This is in fact one of the major weakness of the simple information theory in explaining usefulness of tags – it ignores the fact that humans can extract meanings from a set of tags assigned to a document, and this semantic extraction process is exactly the reason why humans are able to communicate efficiently even though the size of our vocabulary is increasing ever since language was developed. For example, the work by Cattuto et al. (2007),&lt;ref name="Cattuto, C. 2007"&gt;Cattuto, C., Loreto, V., and Pietronero, L., Semiotic Dynamics and Collaborative Tagging. Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, (2007), 104, 1461-1464.&lt;/ref&gt; published in PNAS, show that while the number of tags are increasing, the general growth pattern is scale-free – the general distribution of tag-tag co-occurrences follows a power-law. Cattuto also finds that the characteristics of this scale-free distribution are dependent on the semantics of the tag – tags that are semantically general (e.g., blogs) tend to co-occur with many tags, while semantically narrow tags (e.g., Ajax) tend to co-occur with few number of tags across a wide set of documents in a social tagging system. What this means is that the assumption of the information theory approach is too simple – when the semantics of the set of tags assigned to documents are taken into account, the predictive value of tags on contents of documents are relatively stable. This finding is important for development of [[recommender system]]s – discovering these higher level semantic patterns is important in helping people to find relevant information (also see semantic imitation model below).

=== Tag convergence ===
 
Despite this potential vocabulary problem, recent research has found that at the aggregate level, tagging behavior seemed relatively stable and that the tag choice proportions seemed to be converging rather than diverging. While these observations provided evidence against the proposed vocabulary problem, they also triggered a series of research investigating how and why tag proportions tended to converge over time. 

One explanation for the stability was that there was an inherent propensity for users to "imitate" word use of others  as they create tags. This propensity may act as a form of social cohesion that fosters the coherence of tag-topic relations in the system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Mech, (1923), 1,   279-289.&lt;/ref&gt; was useful in explaining how simple imitation behavior at the individual level could explain the converging usage patterns of tags. Specifically, convergence of tag choices was simulated by a process in which a colored ball was randomly selected from an urn and was replaced in the urn along with an additional ball of the same color, simulating the probabilistic nature of tag reuse. The simple model, however, does not explain why certain tags would to be "imitated" more often than others, and therefore cannot provide a realistic mechanism for tag choices and how social tags could be utilized as navigational cues during exploratory search, not to mention the obviously over-simplified representation of individual users by balls in an urn.

=== Complex systems dynamics and emergent vocabularies===

Other research, using data from the social bookmarking website [[Del.icio.us]], has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of [[complex system]]s (or [[Self-organization|self-organizing]]) dynamics.&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref" &gt;Harry Halpin, Valentin Robu, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602 The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging], Proceedings 6th International Conference on the World Wide Web (WWW'07), Banff, Canada, pp. 211-220, ACM Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable [[power law]] distributions.&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref" /&gt; Once such stable distributions form, examining the [[correlation]]s between different tags can be used to construct simple [[folksonomy]] graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtain a form of community or shared vocabularies.&lt;ref name="TWEB-ref" &gt;Valentin Robu, Harry Halpin, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1594173.1594176 Emergence of consensus and shared vocabularies in collaborative tagging systems], ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), Vol. 3(4), article 14, ACM Press, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Such vocabularies can be seen as emerging from the decentralised actions of many users, as a form of [[crowdsourcing]].

=== Tag choice by stochastic process ===

The memory-based Yule-Simon (MBYS) model of Cattuto&lt;ref name="Cattuto, C. 2007"/&gt; attempted to explain tag choices by a stochastic process. They found that the temporal order of tag assignment influences users' tag choices. Similar to the stochastic urn model, the MBYS model assumed that at each time step a tag would be randomly sampled: with probability p the sampled tag was new, and with probability 1-p the sampled tag was copied from existing tags. When copying, the probability of selecting a tag was assumed to decay with time, and this decay function was found to follow a power law distribution. Thus, tags that were recently used had a higher probability of being reused than those used in the past. One major finding by Cattuto et al. was that semantically general tags (e.g., "blog") tended to co-occur more frequently with other tags than semantically narrower tags (e.g., "ajax"), and this difference could be captured by the decay function of tag reuse in their  model. Specifically, they found that a slower decay parameter (when the tag is reused more often) could explain the phenomenon that semantically general tags tended to co-occur with a larger set of tags. In other words, they argued that the "semantic breadth" of a tag could be modeled by a memory decay function, which could lead to different emergent behavioral patterns in a tagging system.

== Predictive models of social tagging ==
=== Semantic imitation model of social tag choices ===
Descriptive models mentioned above were based on analyses of word-word relations as revealed by the various statistical structures in the organization of tags (e.g., how likely one tag would co-occur with other tags or how likely each tag was reused over time). These models are therefore descriptive models at the aggregate level, and have little to offer about predictions at the level of interface interactions and cognitive processes of individual. 
Rather than imitating other users at the word level, one possible explanation for this kind of social cohesion could be grounded on the natural tendency for people to process tags at the semantic level, and it was at this level of processing that most imitation occurred. This explanation was supported by research in the area of reading comprehension,&lt;ref&gt;Kintsch, W. (1988). The role of knowledge in discourse comprehension: A construction-integration model. Psychological Review, 95, 163–182.&lt;/ref&gt; which showed that people tended to be influenced by meanings of words, rather than the words themselves during comprehension. Assuming that background knowledge of people in the same culture tend to have shared structures (e.g., using similar vocabularies and their corresponding meanings in order to conform and communicate with each), users of the same social tagging system may also share similar semantic representations of words and concepts, even when the use of tags may vary across individuals at the word level. In other words, we argued that part of the reason for the stability of social tagging systems can be attributed to the shared semantic representations among the users, such that users may have relatively stable and coherent interpretation of information contents and tags as they interact with the system. Based on this assumption, the semantic imitation model&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicts how different semantic representations may lead to differences in individual tag choices and eventually different emergent properties at the aggregate behavioral level. The model also predicts that the folksonomies (i.e., knowledge structures) in the system reflect the shared semantic representations of the users.

Semantic imitation has important implication to the general vocabulary problem (see work by, e.g., [[Susan Dumais]]) in information retrieval and human-computer interaction – the creation of large number of diverse tags to describe the same set of information resource. The finding that semantic imitation occurs implies that the unit of communication among users is more likely at the semantic level, not at the word level. Thus, although there may not be strong coherence in the choice of words in describing a resource, at the semantic level there seems to be a stronger coherence force that guides the convergence of descriptive indices. This is in sharp contrast to conclusions derived based on a purely information-theoretical approach, which assumes that humans search and evaluation information at the word level. Instead, the process of semantic imitation in social tagging implies that the information-theoretic approach is at most incomplete, as it does not take into account the basic unit of human information processing. Similar to the fact that human communication occurs at the semantic level, the fact that people may use different words or syntax does not affect the effectiveness of communication, so long as the underlying "common ground" between the two persons is the same.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, H. H. (1996). Using language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the social tagging case, so long as users share similar understanding of the contents of the information resources, the fact that the information value of tag-document decreases (that humans have more words in their languages) do not imply that it will always be harder to find relevant information (similarly, the fact that there are more words in our languages does not mean that our communication becomes less effective). However, it does point to the notion that one needs to effectively present these semantic structures in the information system so that people can effectively interpret the semantics of the tagged documents. Intelligent techniques based on statistical models of language such as [[latent semantic analysis]], probabilistic topics model, etc. are promising aspects that will overcome this vocabulary problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16192">{{about|the formal terminology in logic|causal meanings of the terms|Causality|the concepts in statistics|Sufficient statistic}}In [[logic]], '''necessity''' and '''sufficiency''' are terms used to describe a [[material conditional|conditional]] or implicational relationship between [[Statement (logic)|statements]]. For example, in the conditional statement "If P then Q", we say that "Q is '''necessary''' for P" because P cannot be true unless Q is true. Similarly, we say that "P is '''sufficient''' for Q" because P being true always implies that Q is true, but P not being true does not always imply that Q is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proofs and Fundamentals: A First Course in Abstract Mathematics|last=Bloch|first=Ethan D.|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4419-7126-5|location=|pages=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The assertion that a statement is a "necessary ''and'' sufficient" condition of another means that the former statement is true [[if and only if]] the latter is true. That is, the two statements must be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false.&lt;ref name=betz&gt;{{cite book|last=Betz|first=Frederick|title=Managing Science: Methodology and Organization of Research|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-7487-7|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Manktelow&gt;{{cite book|last=Manktelow|first=K.

In [[ordinary English]], "necessary" and "sufficient" indicate relations between conditions or states of affairs, not statements. Being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother.

==Definitions==

In the conditional statement, "if ''S'', then ''N''", the expression represented by ''S'' is called the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and the expression represented by ''N'' is called the [[consequent]]. This conditional statement may be written in many equivalent ways, for instance, "''N'' if ''S''", "''S'' only if ''N''", "''S'' implies ''N''", "''N'' is implied by ''S''", {{math|''S'' → ''N''}} , {{math|''S'' ⇒ ''N''}}, or "''N'' whenever ''S''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Keith|last=Devlin|title=Sets, Functions and Logic / An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|edition=3rd|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58488-449-1|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the above situation, we also say that ''N'' is a '''necessary''' condition for ''S''. In common language this is saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement, then the consequent ''N'' must be true if ''S'' may at all be true (see "[[truth table]]" immediately below). Phrased differently, the antecedent ''S'' cannot be true without ''N'' being true. For example, in order for someone to be called '''''S'''''ocrates, it is necessary for that someone to be '''''N'''''amed.

We also say that ''S'' is a '''sufficient''' condition for ''N''. Consider the truth table again. If the conditional statement is true, then if ''S'' is true, ''N'' must be true; whereas if the conditional statement is true and N is true, then S may be true or  be false. In common terms, "''S'' guarantees ''N''". Continuing the example, knowing that someone is called '''''S'''''ocrates is sufficient to know that someone has a '''''N'''''ame.

A '''''necessary and sufficient''''' condition requires that both of the implications &lt;math&gt;S \Rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N \Rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; (which can also be written as &lt;math&gt;S \Leftarrow N&lt;/math&gt;)  hold. From the first of these we see that ''S'' is a sufficient condition for ''N'', and from the second that ''S'' is a necessary condition for ''N''. This is expressed as "''S'' is necessary and sufficient for ''N'' ", "''S'' [[if and only if]] ''N'' ", or &lt;math&gt;S \Leftrightarrow N&lt;/math&gt;.

==Necessity==

[[File:Solar eclipse 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The sun being above the horizon is a necessary condition for direct sunlight; but it is not a sufficient condition, as something else may be casting a shadow, e.g., the moon in the case of an [[solar eclipse|eclipse]].]]

The assertion that ''Q'' is necessary for ''P'' is colloquially equivalent to "''P'' cannot be true unless ''Q'' is true" or "if Q is false, then P is false". By [[contraposition]], this is the same thing as "whenever ''P'' is true, so is ''Q''".

The logical relation between ''P'' and ''Q'' is expressed as "if ''P'', then ''Q''" and denoted "''P'' ⇒ ''Q''" (''P'' [[Logical consequence|implies]] ''Q''). It may also be expressed as any of "''P'' only if ''Q''", "''Q'', if ''P''", "''Q'' whenever ''P''", and "''Q'' when ''P''". One often finds, in mathematical prose for instance, several necessary conditions that, taken together, constitute a sufficient condition, as shown in Example 5.

;Example 1: For it to be true that "John is a bachelor", it is necessary that it be also true that he is
:# unmarried,
:# male,
:# adult,
:since to state "John is a bachelor" implies John has each of those three additional [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]].

;Example 2: For the whole numbers greater than two, being odd is necessary to being prime, since two is the only whole number that is both even and prime.

;Example 3: Consider thunder, the sound caused by lightning. We say that thunder is necessary for lightning, since lightning never occurs without thunder. Whenever there's lightning, there's thunder. The thunder ''does not cause'' the lightning (since lightning causes thunder), but because lightning always comes with thunder, we say that thunder is necessary for lightning. (That is, in its formal sense, necessity doesn't imply causality.)

;Example 4: Being at least 30 years old is necessary for serving in the U.S. Senate.  If you are under 30 years old, then it is impossible for you to be a senator.  That is, if you are a senator, it follows that you are at least 30 years old.

;Example 5: In [[algebra]], for some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; to form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], it is necessary that &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; be [[associative]].  It is also necessary that ''S'' include a special element ''e'' such that for every ''x'' in ''S'' it is the case that ''e'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' and ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''e'' both equal ''x''.  It is also necessary that for every ''x'' in ''S'' there exist a corresponding element ''x'' "such that both ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' " and ''x''" &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' equal the special element ''e''.  None of these three necessary conditions by itself is sufficient, but the [[conjunction (logic)|conjunction]] of the three is.

==Sufficiency==

[[File:ICE 3 Fahlenbach.jpg|thumb|right|200px|That a train runs on schedule can be a sufficient condition for arriving on time (if one boards the train and it departs on time, then one will arrive on time); but it is not always a necessary condition, since there are other ways to travel (if the train does not run to time, one could still arrive on time through other means of transport).]]

If ''P'' is sufficient for ''Q'', then knowing ''P'' to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that ''Q'' is true; however, knowing ''P'' to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that ''Q'' is false.

The logical relation is, as before, expressed as "if ''P'', then ''Q''" or "''P'' ⇒ ''Q''". This can also be expressed as "''P'' only if ''Q''", "''P'' implies ''Q''" or several other variants. It may be the case that several sufficient conditions, when taken together, constitute a single necessary condition, as illustrated in example 5.

;Example 1: "John is a king" implies that John is male. So knowing that it is true that John is a king is sufficient to know that he is a male.

;Example 2: A number's being divisible by 4 is sufficient (but not necessary) for its being even, but being divisible by 2 is both sufficient and necessary.

;Example 3: An occurrence of thunder is a sufficient condition for the occurrence of lightning in the sense that hearing thunder, and unambiguously recognizing it as such, justifies concluding that there has been a lightning bolt.

;Example 4: If the U.S. Congress passes a bill, the president's signature of the bill is sufficient to make it law. Note that the case whereby the president did not sign the bill, e.g. through exercising a presidential [[veto#United States|veto]], does not mean that the bill has not become law (it could still have become law through a congressional [[veto override|override]]).

;Example 5: That the center of a [[playing card]] should be marked with a single large spade (♠) is sufficient for the card to be an ace.  Three other sufficient conditions are that the center of the card be marked with a diamond (♦), heart (♥), or club (♣), respectively.  None of these conditions is necessary to the card's being an ace, but their [[disjunction]] is, since no card can be an ace without fulfilling at least (in fact, exactly) one of the conditions.

==Relationship between necessity and sufficiency==
[[File:Set intersection.svg|thumb|260 px|Being in the purple region is sufficient for being in A, but not necessary. Being in A is necessary for being in the purple region, but not sufficient. Being in A and being in B is necessary and sufficient for being in the purple region.]]

A condition can be either necessary or sufficient without being the other.  For instance, ''being a [[mammal]]'' (''N'') is necessary but not sufficient to ''being human'' (''S''), and that a number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''is rational'' (''S'') is sufficient but not necessary to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''being a [[real number]]'' (''N'') (since there are real numbers that are not rational).

A condition can be both necessary and sufficient. For example, at present, "today is the [[Fourth of July]]" is a necessary and sufficient condition for "today is [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the [[United States]]".  Similarly, a necessary and sufficient condition for [[Inverse matrix|invertibility]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''M'' is that ''M'' has a nonzero [[determinant]].

Mathematically speaking, necessity and sufficiency are [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to one another.  For any statements ''S'' and ''N'', the assertion that "''N'' is necessary for ''S''" is equivalent to the assertion that "''S'' is sufficient for ''N''". Another facet of this duality is that, as illustrated above, conjunctions (using "and") of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency, while disjunctions (using "or") of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity.  For a third facet, identify every mathematical [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] ''N'' with the set ''T''(''N'') of objects, events, or statements for which ''N'' holds true; then asserting the necessity of ''N'' for ''S'' is equivalent to claiming that ''T''(''N'') is a [[superset]] of ''T''(''S''), while asserting the sufficiency of ''S'' for ''N'' is equivalent to claiming that ''T''(''S'') is a [[subset]] of ''T''(''N'').

==Simultaneous necessity and sufficiency==
{{See also|Material equivalence}}

To say that ''P'' is necessary and sufficient for ''Q'' is to say two things:
# that ''P'' is necessary for ''Q'',  &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, and that ''P'' is sufficient for ''Q'', &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;.  
# equivalently, it may be understood to say that ''P'' and ''Q'' is necessary for the other, &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q \land Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, which can also be stated as each ''is sufficient for'' or ''implies'' the other.

One may summarize any, and thus all, of these cases by the statement "''P'' [[if and only if]] ''Q''", which is denoted by &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, whereas cases tell us that &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is identical to &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q \land Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in [[graph theory]] a graph ''G'' is called [[Bipartite graph|bipartite]] if it is possible to assign to each of its vertices the color ''black'' or ''white'' in such a way that every edge of ''G'' has one endpoint of each color.  And for any graph to be bipartite, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that it contain no odd-length [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]].  Thus, discovering whether a graph has any odd cycles tells one whether it is bipartite and conversely.  A philosopher&lt;ref name="stan"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intensional/ Stanford University primer, 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; might characterize this state of affairs thus: "Although the concepts of bipartiteness and absence of odd cycles differ in [[intension]], they have identical [[extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref&gt;"Meanings, in this sense, are often called ''intensions'', and things designated, ''extensions''. Contexts in which extension is all that matters are, naturally, called ''extensional'', while contexts in which extension is not enough are ''intensional''. Mathematics is typically extensional throughout." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intensional/ Stanford University primer, 2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, theorems are often stated in the form "''P'' is true if and only if ''Q'' is true". Their proofs normally first prove sufficiency, e.g. &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;. Secondly, the opposite is proven, &lt;math&gt;Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;
# either directly, assuming ''Q'' is true and demonstrating that the Q circle is located within P, or 
# [[Proof by contrapositive|contrapositively]], that is demonstrating that stepping outside circle of P, we fall out the ''Q'': ''assuming not P, not Q results''.

This proves that the circles for Q and P match on the Venn diagrams above.

Because, as explained in previous section, necessity of one for the other is equivalent to sufficiency of the other for the first one, e.g. &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is [[Logical equivalence|equivalent to]] &lt;math&gt;Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, if ''P'' is necessary and sufficient for ''Q'', then ''Q'' is necessary and sufficient for ''P''. We can write &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q \equiv Q \Leftrightarrow P&lt;/math&gt; and say that the statements "''P'' is true [[if and only if]] ''Q'', is true" and "''Q'' is true if and only if ''P'' is true" are equivalent.

'''Neeti Saara''' or '''Neeti Sastra''' is a popular collection of morals written by Baddena, a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] poet. Baddena (1220-1280? AD)  is the composer of the most famous [[Sumathi Satakam]] as well as Niti Sastra. Complete details about his origin are not known. But, He was believed to be a Chola prince and was called as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Samanta Raju (vassal) under the Kakateeya [[Rudrama Devi]] (reign: 1262-1296 AD) during the thirteenth century.
In the post mauryan age, kamandhaka wrote 'neetisara' based on kautilya's artha shastra and serves as an important literary source of guptan age.

1. I shall expound Nitisara (essence of maxims on right conduct) compiled from all scriptures, bowing down to Vishnu, the lord of the universe.

2. Listen to the complete essence of dharma (right action) and contemplate on it. “Do not do unto others what one would not like others to do unto oneself”.

3. Do not act without examining the situation carefully; one ought to act only after scrutinizing the situation carefully. Otherwise, one will have to grieve like the brahmani (Brahman woman) who killed the mongoose ([[Neeti_Sastra#References|1]]).

4. Man is bound to experience the fruits of his good and bad actions. The karma does not diminish even after billions of days of Brahma (2) unless one experiences fruits of karma.

5. One cannot earn or retain wealth without undergoing suffering. There is suffering in earning wealth as well as in spending it. Is not wealth the home of suffering?

6. Only a learned person can understand the hardship borne by another learned person to earn knowledge just as a barren woman cannot understand the severe pain endured by a pregnant woman.

7. The parents who do not educate a child are his enemies since he is humiliated in an assembly of learned men like a crane among swans.

8. Onion does not lose its smell even if it is planted in a basin of [[Camphor]], tended using musk and watered using the dew from rose petals.

9. A student acquires quarter of knowledge from the teacher, a quarter from self study, a quarter from class mates and the final quarter in course of time.

10. When a girl is getting married, the father of the girl looks for education in the bride groom; the mother for wealth, the kith and kin for family reputation and the girl for beauty.

11. A scorpion has poison in its tail. A bee has poison in its head. [[Takshaka]] has poison in its teeth. An evil person has poison in all his limbs.

12. Sky is the strength of birds, water the strength of fish; king the strength of the weak and wailing the strength of babies.

13. Renounce that wife who is quarrelsome, steals money, faithless and speaks ill of her husband, eats before feeding her husband or children and visits others‟ houses, even if she is the mother of ten sons.

14. An ideal wife will have these six virtues – she will be like a counselor in dealing with various situations, like a maid servant in serving her husband, like Goddess [[Lakshmi]] in beauty, like the earth in patience, like a mother in giving love and be like a [[Courtesan]] in bedroom.

15. Keep aloof from a horse that is drenched in water, mad elephant, bull that is maddened with lust and an uncultured man who is educated.

16. Helping an evil person will cause harm to one even as feeding milk to a snake will only increase its poison.

17. The fruit of giving charity to a knower of Truth (Brahma Jnani) multiplies like an arrow, shot by Arjuna that turns into ten arrows when he takes aim, hundred when he shoots them, thousand on the way and a shower of arrows when they hit the target.

18. Even God does not know about the leaps of a horse, roaring of clouds, minds of women, destiny of man, lack of rain or excess of rain. Then how can a man know these?

19. Attainment of wealth by an incompetent person, knowledge by a man of ignoble descent, a woman by undeserving person, etc. are in vain like the rainfall on a mountain.

20. Win the whole world by truth, sorrow by charity, elders by service and the enemies by archery.

23. The wives of teacher, king and elder brother, the mother-in-law and the mother who gave birth – these five are mothers.

24. Keep a distance of 5 hasta3 (cubits) from a vehicle, ten cubits from a horse and 1000 cubits from an elephant. Keep as much away as possible from an evil person.

25. In childhood, a woman is protected by her father, by her husband in her youth and by her sons in her old age. A woman should never be left alone to fend for herself.

26. The snake and the wicked person are both dangerous. The poison of a snake can be neutralized by mantra or medicine while there is no mantra or medicine that can remove the poison of a wicked person.

27. Longevity, deeds, prosperity, knowledge and death of a person are decided even while he is in the mother‟s womb.

28. Ordinary poison is insignificant when compared to the poison of the sin of usurping the property of a Brahmin (one who is virtuous). Poison kills only one person while the sin of usurping the property of a Brahmin destroys three generations (oneself, one‟s children and grand children).

29. Having two wives in spite of being poor, building a house on a road, doing cultivation in two different places, becoming a witness or bail in a lawsuit are the five self-sought misfortunes.

35. Truth is my mother, knowledge is my father, righteousness is my brother, compassion is my friend, peace is my wife and patience is my son. These six are my kith and kin.

36. The Sun sets daily taking away a part of one's longevity. Knowing this, one should reflect daily what righteous action one has performed.

37. Speaking sweet words to the wicked is like offering a garland of exquisite flowers into the hands of a monkey.

38. Morning Sun, smoke from funeral pyre, coitus with old woman, muddy water and eating curd-rice at night increase ill health day by day.

39. Setting Sun, smoke from Homa (sacrificial pyre), coitus with young woman, pure water and eating milk rice at night increase longevity day by day.

40. One's wealth and properties remain at one's home, sons and relatives take leave at cremation ground. It is one's good and evil actions that accompany oneself after death.

41. Righteousness prevails and not unrighteousness. Truth prevails and not untruth. Patience prevails and not anger. Gods prevail and not demons.

42. Stocking grains, taking care of calves, doing cultivation oneself, serving one's elders – these five habits foster one's family.

43. Treat the child like a prince till the age of 5, like a servant till the age of 15. When the son reaches the age of 16, treat him like a friend.

47. One who plants a holy fig tree, a neem tree, an Indian fig tree, ten tamarind trees; three trees each of pomegranate, wood-apple and Emblic Myrobalan and five trees each of mango and coconut will not suffer Hell.

48. Will Neem ever acquire sweetness even if it is grown on top of a mountain of molasses and watered thousands of times with milk?

49. One who is beneficial is a kinsman though he is a stranger. One who is harmful is an enemy though he is a kinsman. When one is seriously sick, herbs from distant forest are used as medicine.

50. The knowledge confined to books, wealth that is in the custody of others and a son who has gone to foreign countries are useful in name only.

51. Company of wife is as good as the treatment given by ten physicians. Sun is ten times beneficial than the care given by wife. Mother is ten times beneficial compared to the Sun. Yellow Myrobalan is ten times beneficial than the mother.

52. Even a virtuous person perishes due to association with the wicked just as the swans that gave refuge to the crows perished because of the evil deeds committed by the crows.

53. The characteristics of the wicked persons and phlegm are surprisingly similar. Both of these are agitated by sweetness and are pacified by bitterness. (Phlegm is agitated by sweet food and is pacified by bitter food while the wicked person is agitated by sweet words and is pacified by bitter words).

54. Enmity comes to an end by death. Youth ends with pregnancy. Anger comes to an end by bowing down. Pride comes to an end by begging before others.

55. He, who renovates or helps to regain the glory of fallen family, abandoned well or lake, dethroned king, refugee, cows, temples and wise men, attains fourfold merit.

56. Profession of an artist or writer is the highest. That of cultivation and trade is mediocre, that of a servant is the lowest and that of a porter is lower than the lowest.

57. A bee pursues fragrance. Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth pursues a tactful person, water pursues depth. Fate follows intelligence.

58. The following give better results when they are beaten: the wicked, gold, drum, stubborn horse, unchaste woman, sugar-cane, sesamum and uncultured person.

59. I bow down before these six persons – one who gives pure food, one who performs agnihotra (daily fire ritual) everyday, a knower of Vedanta, one who has seen one thousands full moons, one who fasts every month and a chaste woman.

60. Flees desire wounds, kings desire wealth, the wicked persons desire to quarrel and the wise men desire to have peace.

61. The sun stone shines by the mere presence of the Sun. In the same manner, knowledge shines in a disciple by the mere presence of the teacher.

62. One who does not do any charity is in fact a man of renunciation since he leaves behind all his wealth when he dies and goes to the other world empty-handed. I consider the person who does charity as a miser because when he dies he takes with him the fruits of his charity.

63. He is a wise man who sees the wives of others as his mother, the wealth of others like clod of earth and all beings as his own self.

64. Though the blue water lily, lotus, fish and white water lily are born in water, they have different odours.

65. The wealth that is not used for the gods, wise men, relatives or for oneself is destroyed by water, enemy, king and thieves.

66. One, who decides the course of action after intelligent contemplation when confronted with difficult situations, loss of wealth or life-threatening incidents, laughs at the lord of death.

67. The fruit of giving cloth in charity is attainment of kingdom; that of footwear is attainment of vehicle; that of Tamboolam (5) is enjoyment of pleasure. One gains all the above by giving food to the poor.

68. The virtue of cuckoo is voice; the virtue of women is chastity; virtue of Brahmin is knowledge and that of ascetics is patience.

69. The following three are the characteristics of a wicked person: lotus like face, speech as cool as sandal wood and a heart burning with fire (of evil thoughts).

70. Just as a coconut tree bears the weight of coconuts on its head and gives nectarine water throughout its life in return for a little water that was given to it during the first year, a saintly person never forgets the help that he had received.

71. Saints live to serve others just as a river flows, the trees bear fruits and the plants grow not for themselves but for others.

72. One should receive knowledge from a Brahmin (wise man), food at the hands of mother, betal leaves (tamboolam) from one's wife and bracelet (recognition) from the king.

73. Moon is cool. Sandal wood is cooler than the moon. The words of virtuous persons are cooler than moon and sandalwood.

74. Elephant shines by the rut (6), sky by rain clouds, woman by character, horse by speed, temple by regular festivals, speech by grammatical correctness, rivers by swan couples, an assembly by the presence of
scholars, a family by virtuous son, earth by king and the three worlds by the Sun.

75. One who is jealous, one who speaks untruth, one who is ungrateful and one who carries enmity for a long time – these four are karmachandalas (7)

76. Protect your fame by giving up life. Life is transitory while fame will exist as long as the moon and the stars exist.

{{Separation axioms}}

In [[topology]] and related branches of [[mathematics]], a '''normal space''' is a [[topological space]] ''X'' that satisfies '''Axiom T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''': every two disjoint [[closed set]]s of ''X'' have disjoint [[open neighborhood]]s. A normal [[Hausdorff space]] is also called a '''T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space'''. These conditions are examples of [[separation axiom]]s and their further strengthenings define '''completely normal Hausdorff spaces''', or '''T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; spaces''', and '''perfectly normal Hausdorff spaces''', or '''T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; spaces'''.

== Definitions ==

A [[topological space]] ''X'' is a '''normal space''' if, given any [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[closed set]]s ''E'' and ''F'', there are [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhoods]] ''U'' of ''E'' and ''V'' of ''F'' that are also disjoint. More intuitively, this condition says that ''E'' and ''F'' can be [[separated set|separated by neighbourhoods]].

[[File:Normal space.svg|thumb|203px|The closed sets E and F, here represented by closed disks on opposite sides of the picture, are separated by their respective neighbourhoods U and V, here represented by larger, but still disjoint, open disks.]]

A '''T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space''' is a [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]] ''X'' that is normal; this is equivalent to ''X'' being normal and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]].

A '''completely normal space''' or a '''{{visible anchor|hereditarily normal space}}''' is a topological space ''X'' such that every [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''X'' with subspace topology is a normal space. It turns out that ''X'' is completely normal if and only if every two [[separated set]]s can be separated by neighbourhoods.

A '''completely T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space''', or '''T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; space''' is a completely normal [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]] topological space ''X'', which implies that ''X'' is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]; equivalently, every subspace of ''X'' must be a T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space.

A '''perfectly normal space''' is a topological space ''X'' in which every two disjoint closed sets ''E'' and ''F'' can be precisely separated by a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from ''X'' to the [[real line]] '''R''': the [[preimage]]s of {0} and {1} under ''f'' are, respectively, ''E'' and ''F''. (In this definition, the real line can be replaced with the [[unit interval]] [0,1].)

It turns out that ''X'' is perfectly normal if and only if ''X'' is normal and every closed set is a [[G-delta set|''G''&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set]]. Equivalently, ''X'' is perfectly normal if and only if every closed set is a [[zero set]]. Every perfectly normal space is automatically completely normal.&lt;ref name="Munkres p213"&gt;{{harvnb|Munkres|2000|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Hausdorff perfectly normal space ''X'' is a '''T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; space''', or '''perfectly T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space'''.

Note that the terms "normal space" and "T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;" and derived concepts occasionally have a different meaning. (Nonetheless, "T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;" always means the same as "completely T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;", whatever that may be.) The definitions given here are the ones usually used today. For more on this issue, see [[History of the separation axioms]].

Terms like "normal [[regular space]]" and "normal Hausdorff space" also turn up in the literature&amp;nbsp;– they simply mean that the space both is normal and satisfies the other condition mentioned. In particular, a normal Hausdorff space is the same thing as a T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space. Given the historical confusion of the meaning of the terms, verbal descriptions when applicable are helpful, that is, "normal Hausdorff" instead of "T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;", or "completely normal Hausdorff" instead of "T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;".

[[Fully normal space]]s and [[paracompact Hausdorff space|fully T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space]]s are discussed elsewhere; they are related to [[paracompactness]].

A [[locally normal space]] is a topological space where every point has an open neighbourhood that is normal. Every normal space is locally normal, but the converse is not true. A classical example of a completely regular locally normal space that is not normal is the [[Nemytskii plane]].

== Examples of normal spaces ==
Most spaces encountered in [[mathematical analysis]] are normal Hausdorff spaces, or at least normal regular spaces:
* All [[metric spaces]] (and hence all [[metrizable space]]s) are perfectly normal Hausdorff;
* All [[pseudometric space]]s (and hence all [[pseudometrisable space]]s) are perfectly normal regular, although not in general Hausdorff;
* All [[compact space|compact]] Hausdorff spaces are normal;
* In particular, the [[Stone–Čech compactification]] of a [[Tychonoff space]] is normal Hausdorff;
* Generalizing the above examples, all [[paracompact]] Hausdorff spaces are normal, and all paracompact regular spaces are normal;
* All paracompact [[topological manifold]]s are perfectly normal Hausdorff. However, there exist non-paracompact manifolds which are not even normal.
* All [[order topology|order topologies]] on [[totally ordered set]]s are hereditarily normal and Hausdorff.
* Every regular [[second-countable space]] is completely normal, and every regular [[Lindelöf space]] is normal.

Also, all [[fully normal space]]s are normal (even if not regular). [[Sierpinski space]] is an example of a normal space that is not regular.

== Examples of non-normal spaces ==
An important example of a non-normal topology is given by the [[Zariski topology]] on an [[algebraic variety]] or on the [[spectrum of a ring]], which is used in [[algebraic geometry]].

A non-normal space of some relevance to analysis is the [[topological vector space]] of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from the [[real line]] '''R''' to itself, with the [[topology of pointwise convergence]].
More generally, a theorem of [[A. H. Stone]] states that the [[product topology|product]] of [[uncountable|uncountably many]] non-[[compact space|compact]] metric spaces is never normal.

== Properties ==
Every closed subset of a normal space is normal. The continuous and closed image of a normal space is normal.&lt;ref name=GenTop&gt;{{cite book|last=Willard|first=Stephen|title=General topology.|year=1970|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|location=Reading, Mass.|isbn=0486434796|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main significance of normal spaces lies in the fact that they admit "enough" [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[real number|real]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, as expressed by the following theorems valid for any normal space ''X''.

[[Urysohn's lemma]]:
If ''A'' and ''B'' are two [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] closed subsets of ''X'', then there exists a continuous function ''f'' from ''X'' to the real line '''R''' such that ''f''(''x'') = 0 for all ''x'' in ''A'' and ''f''(''x'') = 1 for all ''x'' in ''B''.
In fact, we can take the values of ''f'' to be entirely within the [[unit interval]] [0,1].
(In fancier terms, disjoint closed sets are not only separated by neighbourhoods, but also [[separated by a function]].)

More generally, the [[Tietze extension theorem]]:
If ''A'' is a closed subset of ''X'' and ''f'' is a continuous function from ''A'' to '''R''', then there exists a continuous function ''F'': ''X'' → '''R''' which extends ''f'' in the sense that ''F''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''A''.

If '''U''' is a locally finite [[open cover]] of a normal space ''X'', then there is a [[partition of unity]] precisely subordinate to '''U'''.
(This shows the relationship of normal spaces to [[paracompactness]].)

In fact, any space that satisfies any one of these three conditions must be normal.

A [[product space|product]] of normal spaces is not necessarily normal.  This fact was first proved by [[Robert Sorgenfrey]]. An example of this phenomenon is the [[Sorgenfrey plane]]. Also, a subset of a normal space need not be normal (i.e. not every normal Hausdorff space is a completely normal Hausdorff space), since every Tychonoff space is a subset of its Stone–Čech compactification (which is normal Hausdorff).  A more explicit example is the [[Tychonoff plank]]. The only large class of product spaces of normal spaces known to be normal are the products of compact Hausdorff spaces, since both compactness ([[Tychonoff's theorem]]) and the {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} axiom are preserved under arbitrary products.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willard|1970|loc=Section 17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships to other separation axioms ==
If a normal space is [[R0 space|R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]], then it is in fact [[completely regular]].
Thus, anything from "normal R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;" to "normal completely regular" is the same as what we usually call ''normal regular''.
Taking [[Kolmogorov quotient]]s, we see that all normal [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]]s are [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]].
These are what we usually call ''normal Hausdorff'' spaces.

A topological space is said to be [[pseudonormal space|pseudonormal]] if given two disjoint closed sets in it, one of which is countable, there are disjoint open sets containing them. Every normal space is pseudonormal, but not vice versa.

Counterexamples to some variations on these statements can be found in the lists above.
Specifically, [[Sierpinski space]] is normal but not regular, while the space of functions from '''R''' to itself is Tychonoff but not normal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">An '''obligation''' is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether [[legal obligation|legal]] or [[moral obligation|moral]].  There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of [[etiquette]], [[social]] obligations, [[religious]] and possibly in terms of [[politics]], where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally [[legal]] obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a [[tradition]] or for social reasons.

Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bear, ''Sacred Journey of the Medicine Wheel'' (2008), p. 393: "Adults have more obligations and are held to higher standards of accountability than children are".&lt;/ref&gt; Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.  For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit is not blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.

The word "obligation" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.

==Other uses==
The term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is [[facultative]], meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family [[Proteidae]] are obligate [[paedomorphs]], whereas species belonging to the [[Ambystomatidae]] are facultative paedomorphs.

In the Catholic Church, [[Holy Days of Obligation]] or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4479">'''Peace Love Unity Respect''', commonly shortened to '''PLUR''', is a set of principles that is associated with the [[rave]] culture. Originating from early online discussions about rave culture conducted on [[Usenet]], it has been commonly used since the early 1990s when it became commonplace in club flyers and especially on club paraphernalia advertising underground outdoor trance parties. It has since expanded to the larger rave dance music culture as well.

It may be interpreted as the essential philosophy of life for ravers and clubbers, at least insomuch as it relates to interpersonal relationships, with basic directions on how people are expected to behave at a rave gathering. This universalist philosophy underpinning the tribal dance culture which began circling the globe with the rise of the internet, theoretically takes precedence over any chemical or musical aspects of the rave scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rave Culture and Religion |last=St. John |first=Graham |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |page=149 |isbn=0-415-31449-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raves represent a modern ritualistic experience, promoting a strong communal sense, where PLUR is considered an ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall| first=Douglas| date=2002-11-01| title=Behavior, Belonging, and Belief: A Theory of Ritual Practice| jstor=3108616| journal=Sociological Theory| publisher=American Sociological Association| volume=20| issue=3| pages=360–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
* [[Peace]] – The avoidance of negative emotions and conflict.&lt;ref name=odyessy&gt;{{cite web |title=PLUR Isn't Just a Moment, It's a Lifestyle |author=Cree Bort |url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/plur-lifestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Love]] – Performing acts and sharing feelings of goodwill towards others. The exchange of gestures such as hugging occurs frequently at a rave, and is considered a way of "spreading the love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Frankie Bones Storm Rave Birthed The PLUR Movement|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/how-frankie-bones-storm-rave-birthed-the-plur-movement/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odyessy /&gt;
* Unity – Welcoming others into the community, and coming together regardless of personal differences.&lt;ref name=odyessy /&gt;
* [[Respect]] – Showing sensitivity for the feelings of others, and accepting one another with tolerance and without judgement. Treating each other as one would like to be treated.&lt;ref name=odyessy /&gt;

==Origins==
{{Synthesis|section|date=May 2012}}
PLUR is an aggregation of ideas synonymous with the earlier hippy and hip hop culture, with the peace movement being an essential starting point to any be-in encounter or rave. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Use of the term 'PLUR' dates to the late 1980s and early 1990s rave scene in the UK which incorporated [[House music|house]] and [[acid house]] music that originated in Chicago during the 1980s. The term began as an informal discussion on [[usenet]] lists alt.rave and alt.culture.zippies. SF-raves mailing list archived at hyper-real also noted the use of the term, and there is a flyer archive which might contain evidence of the existence of the term.

One of the earliest{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} uses of the term outside the internet, mostly anecdotal, appears to be [[Frankie Bones|DJ Frankie Bones]] in June 1993. Supposedly in response to a fight that broke out at one of his epic Storm Raves in Brooklyn, New York, Bones is said to have got on the microphone and yelled: "If you don't start showing some peace, love, and unity, I'll break your faces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/features/2015/ballad/index.html|title=The Graffiti Kids Who Became Raver Kings|author=Steve Powers|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
Later incarnations and variations of PLUR can be seen in the adoption of [[Pronoia (psychology)|Pronoia]] and also [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]], with PLUR and Pronoia often being interchangeable terms, depending upon one's company. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Several other variations on the same four words, but in a different order (e.g. LURP), have been proposed. However, none of these are commonly used.

'''''Planet Earth: The Future''''' is a 2006 [[BBC]] [[documentary]] series on the environment and conservation, produced by the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] as a companion to the multi-award winning [[nature documentary]] ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]''. The programmes were originally [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on [[BBC Four]] immediately after the final three episodes of ''Planet Earth'' on [[BBC One]]. Each episode highlights the conservation issues surrounding some of the [[species]] and environments featured in ''Planet Earth'', using interviews with the film-makers and eminent figures from the fields of [[science]], [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]], [[politics]], and [[theology]]. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was [[Fergus Beeley]].

==Background==
When the first episodes of ''Planet Earth'' were broadcast in the [[UK]], the producers were criticised by some green campaigners for glossing over the [[environmental problem]]s faced by the planet. Executive producer [[Alastair Fothergill]] defended the approach, explaining that a heavy-handed environmental message would not work on primetime [[BBC One]]. However, the ''Planet Earth'' film crews witnessed first-hand scenes of [[environmental degradation]] and the increasing scarcity of wildlife in some of the shooting locations. This experience formed the basis of ''Planet Earth - The Future'', which was designed to engage viewers in a mature debate about [[environmental issues]].

The following year, the BBC commissioned ''[[Saving Planet Earth]]'', the second overtly conservation-themed series to be shown on [[BBC One]]. The first BBC series to deal comprehensively with conservation was ''[[State of the Planet]]'' in 2000.

 |ShortSummary    = The first programme asks if there really is an [[extinction]] crisis facing certain species. Alastair Fothergill, executive producer of ''Planet Earth'', admits that making the series was a bittersweet experience since some creatures were filmed with the knowledge that their continued existence is under threat. David Attenborough believes that conservation of the [[natural environment|natural world]] is something that can unite humanity if people know enough about it. Cameraman Martyn Colbeck relates that every single day during a six-week [[Africa]]n visit to film for "Jungles", he and his crew were awakened by the sound of gunshots. [[Poaching]] can quickly wipe out a population, and David Greer of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] explains that in 2005 his team confiscated 70 guns in the area — a 700% increase from 1999. Other featured animals at risk include the [[walia ibex]], the [[snow leopard]], the [[boto]], and [[saiga antelope]]. The attack of a [[polar bear]] on a [[walrus]] colony on dry land in "Ice Worlds" was a rare occurrence. Footage from a 1997 ''[[BBC Wildlife Specials|BBC Wildlife Special]]'' shows the bears hunting smaller prey on sea ice. Species have always become extinct, but now, the viewer is told, the rate of extinction is accelerating (see [[Holocene extinction]]) and it will "really reach biblical proportions within a few decades." Mankind is urged to respect [[biodiversity]]: it is estimated that if a monetary value could be put on all that the world's [[ecosystem]]s do for humanity, it would total some [[US$]]30 trillion.

 |Title           = Into the Wilderness
 |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|12|03|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary    = The second part looks at man's potential effect on the world's areas of [[wilderness]]. As the [[human population]] has grown, only a quarter of Earth's land now remains uninhabited (aside from [[Antarctica]]). Although around 12% is protected, this may not be enough — providing such places are not just 'enclosures' and bordering territories are also managed. [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Semien Mountains]] are increasingly encroached upon for farming land, and this example leads to the question of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. Some interviewees argue that it is not just about numbers: how humans consume their [[natural resources]] is also important. However, others believe that the world would be greatly more sustainable if the population level was reduced to about half its current level. [[Jonathon Porritt]] believes that this could be achieved simply: by good education on [[family planning]]. Consumption of [[fresh water]] is highlighted: there are now 40,000 more dams in existence than in 1950. The controversy over drilling for oil in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is discussed by both its advocates and opponents. [[E. O. Wilson]]'s concept of [[Biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] is discussed, and David Attenborough believes that a child's innate love of wildlife, for whatever reason, is being lost in adulthood. An answer to [[deforestation]] is found in [[Costa Rica]], where farmers are paid to allow their pasture to revert to forest for its water [[ecosystem services]]. The also deals with [[climate change]] and related [[global warming]], which is now happening at a faster rate than ever before.

 |EpisodeNumber   = 3
 |Title           = Living Together
 |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|12|10|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary    = The last episode deals with the future of conservation. It begins by looking at previous efforts. The 'Save The Whales' campaign, which started in the 1960s, is seen to have had a limited effect, as [[whaling]] continues and fish stocks also decline. In the 1990s, as head of the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]], [[Richard Leakey]] took on the poachers by employing armed units. Although it was successful in saving [[elephant]]s, the policy was detrimental to the [[Maasai people]], who were forced from their land. The need for "fortress" areas is questioned, and the recently highlighted [[Raja Ampat]] [[coral reef]] in [[Indonesia]] is an example. The more [[tourism]] it generates, the greater the potential for damage — and inevitable coastal construction. [[Sustainable development]] is viewed as controversial, and one contributor perceives it to currently be a "contradiction in terms". [[Trophy hunting]] is also contentious. Those that support it argue that it generates wealth for local economies, while its opponents point to the reducing numbers of species such as the [[markhor]]. [[Ecotourism]] is shown to be beneficial, as it is in the interests of its providers to protect their environments. However, in some areas, such as the [[Borneo]] [[rainforest]]s, the great diversity of species is being replaced by [[monoculture]]s. The role of both [[Religion and environmentalism|religion]] and the media in conservation is argued to be extremely important. Contributors to the programme admit a degree of worry about the future, but also optimism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13413">[[Image:Operant_conditioning_diagram.png|thumb|400px|right|Diagram of operant conditioning]]

In [[operant conditioning]], '''punishment''' is any change in a human or animal's surroundings that occurs after a given behavior or response which reduces the likelihood of that behavior occurring again in the future. As with [[reinforcement]], it is the ''behavior'', not the animal, that is punished. Whether a change is or is not punishing is determined by its effect on the rate that the behavior occurs, not by any "hostile" or [[aversives|aversive]] features of the change. For example, a painful stimulus which would act as a punisher for most people may actually reinforce some behaviors of [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] individuals.

==Types==
{{See also|Operant conditioning}}
There are &lt;!-- basic types or models of punishment? --&gt; two types of punishment in operant conditioning:

*'''positive punishment''', '''punishment by application''', or '''type I punishment''', an experimenter punishes a response by presenting an aversive [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] into the animal's surroundings (a brief electric shock, for example).
*'''negative punishment''', '''punishment by removal''', or '''type II punishment''', a valued, appetitive stimulus is removed (as in the removal of a feeding dish). As with reinforcement, it is not usually necessary to speak of positive and negative in regard to punishment.

Punishment is not a mirror effect of reinforcement. In experiments with laboratory animals and studies with children, punishment decreases the likelihood of a previously reinforced response only temporarily, and it can produce other "emotional" behavior (wing-flapping in pigeons, for example) and physiological changes (increased heart rate, for example) that have no clear equivalents in reinforcement.

Punishment is considered by some behavioral psychologists to be a "primary process" – a completely independent phenomenon of learning, distinct from reinforcement. Others see it as a category of [[negative reinforcement]], creating a situation in which any punishment-avoiding behavior (even standing still) is reinforced.

=== Positive ===
Positive punishment occurs when a response produces a stimulus and that response decreases in probability in the future 
in similar circumstances.
* Example: A mother yells at a child when he or she runs into the street. If the child stops running into the street, the yelling ceases. The yelling acts as positive punishment because the mother presents (adds) an unpleasant stimulus in the form of yelling.
* Example: A barefoot person walks onto a hot asphalt surface, creating pain, a positive punishment. When the person leaves the asphalt, the pain subsides.  The pain acts as positive punishment because it is the addition of an unpleasant stimulus that reduces the future likelihood of the person walking barefoot on a hot surface.

=== Negative ===
Negative punishment occurs when a response produces the removal of a stimulus and that response decreases in probability in the future in similar circumstances.
* Example: A teenager comes home after curfew and the parents take away a privilege, such as cell phone usage. If the frequency of the child coming home late decreases, the privilege is gradually restored. The removal of the phone is negative punishment because the parents are taking away a pleasant stimulus (the phone) and motivating the child to return home earlier.
* Example: A child throws a temper tantrum because he wants ice cream.  His mother subsequently ignores him, making it less likely the child will throw a temper tantrum in the future when he wants something. The removal of attention from his mother is a negative punishment because a pleasant stimulus (attention) is taken away.

==Versus reinforcement==
Simply put, reinforcers serve to increase behaviors whereas punishers serve to decrease behaviors; thus, positive reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to attain, and negative reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to be rid of or to end.&lt;ref name="D'Amato"&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Amato|first=M. R.|title=Learning Processes: Instrumental Conditioning|year=1969|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=Toronto|editor=Melvin H. Marx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below illustrates the adding and subtracting of stimuli (pleasant or aversive) in relation to reinforcement vs. punishment.

! [[Aversives|Aversive]] (unpleasant) stimulus
|-

| Positive Reinforcement
| Positive Punishment
|-
! Removing/Taking Away
| Negative Punishment

|-
|}

==Aversives==
''Aversive stimulus'', ''punisher'', and ''punishing stimulus'' are somewhat synonymous. ''Punishment'' may be used for (a) an aversive stimulus or (b) the occurrence of any punishing change or (c) the part of an experiment in which a particular response is punished. However, some things considered aversive (such as [[spanking]]) can become [[reinforcement|reinforcing]]. In addition, some things that are aversive may not be punishing if accompanying changes are reinforcing. A classic example would be mis-behavior that is 'punished' by a teacher but actually increases over time due to the reinforcing effects of attention on the student.

== Primary versus secondary ==
Pain, loud noises, foul tastes, bright lights, and exclusion are all things that would pass the "caveman test" as an aversive stimulus, and are therefore primary punishers.  The sound of someone booing, the wrong-answer buzzer on a game show, and a ticket on your car windshield are all things you have learned to think about as negative, and are considered secondary punishers.

== Effectiveness ==
Contrary to suggestions by Skinner and others that punishment typically has weak or impermanent effects,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "Science and Human Behavior" (1953)McMIllan, New York&lt;/ref&gt;  a large body of research has shown that it can have a powerful and lasting effect in suppressing the punished behavior. However, it may also have powerful and lasting side effects.  For example, an aversive stimulus used to punish a particular behavior may also elicit a strong emotional response that may suppress unpunished behavior and become associated with situational stimuli through classical conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B, Wasserman, E. A., &amp; Robbins, S. J. "Psychology of Learning and Behavior" (5th Ed) (2002) Norton, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Such side effects suggest caution and restraint in the use of punishment to modify behavior. (Further reading:  {{cite web|last1=Ayotte|first1=R.|last2=Muster|first2=H.|last3=Morais|first3=F.|last4=PheonixEnder|title=Positive and negative reinforcement and punishment effectiveness|url=https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/510/positive-and-negative-reinforcement-and-punishment-effectiveness|website=Cognitive Sciences Stack Exchange|accessdate=10 May 2017|displayauthors=3}})

==Importance of contingency and contiguity==
One variable affecting punishment is [[Contingency (psychology)|contingency]], which is defined as the dependency of events. A behavior may be dependent on a stimulus or dependent on a response. The purpose of punishment is to reduce a behavior, and the degree to which punishment is effective in reducing a targeted behavior is dependent on the relationship between the behavior and a punishment. For example, if a rat receives an aversive stimulus, such as a shock each time it presses a lever, then it is clear that contingency occurs between lever pressing and shock. In this case, the punisher (shock) is contingent upon the appearance of the behavior (lever pressing). Punishment is most effective when contingency is present between a behavior and a punisher. A second variable affecting punishment is [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], which is the closeness of events in time and/or space. Contiguity is important to reducing behavior because the longer the time interval between an unwanted behavior and a punishing effect, the less effective the punishment will be. One major problem with a time delay between a behavior and a punishment is that other behaviors may present during that time delay. The subject may then associate the punishment given with the unintended behaviors, and thus suppressing those behaviors instead of the targeted behavior. Therefore, immediate punishment is more effective in reducing a targeted behavior than a delayed punishment would be.

==Applied behavior analysis==
{{main|Applied behavior analysis}}
Punishment is sometimes used for treatment programs in [[applied behavior analysis]] in the most extreme cases, to reduce dangerous behaviors such as head banging or biting exhibited most commonly by children or people with special needs or disabilities. Punishment is considered one of the [[ethical challenges to autism treatment]] and is one of the major reasons for discussion of professionalizing behavior analysis. Professionalizing behavior analysis through licensure would create a board to ensure that consumers or families had a place to air disputes. (see [[Professional practice of behavior analysis]])

Controversy regarding ABA persists in the autism community. A 2017 study found that 46% of people with autism spectrum undergoing ABA met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the risk of developing it as a result of ABA is more than 86% higher in people with autism spectrum than in non-obese people. type of therapy. According to the researchers, the risk of PTSD was increased when ABA was used regardless of the age of the patient (adults and children were examined).&lt;ref&gt;Henny Kupferstein. Evidence of increased PTSD symptoms in autism exposed to applied behavior analysis . "Advances in Autism". 4 (1), pp. 19-29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

===Psychological manipulation===
{{Main|Psychological manipulation}}
Braiker identified the following ways that manipulators [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes praise, [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, gifts, attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or [[smile]], and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: may involve removing one from a negative situation
* [[Reinforcement#Intermittent reinforcement.3B schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist - for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose money overall.
* [[Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], yelling, the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using [[verbal abuse]], explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

===Traumatic bonding===
{{Main|Traumatic bonding}}
Traumatic bonding occurs as the result of ongoing [[cycle of abuse|cycles of abuse]] in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Traumatic Bonding: The development of emotional attachments in battered women and other relationships of intermittent abuse|last = Dutton|first = |date = 1981|journal = Victimology: An International Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Painter|issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson2008"&gt;Chrissie Sanderson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1056">In mathematics, a '''Segal space''' is a [[simplicial space]] satisfying some [[pullback]] conditions, making it look like a [[Homotopy|homotopical]] version of a [[Category (mathematics)|category]]. More precisely, a [[simplicial set]], considered as a simplicial discrete space, satisfies the Segal conditions iff it is the [[Nerve (category theory)|nerve]] of a category. The condition for Segal spaces is a homotopical version of this. 

Complete Segal spaces were introduced by {{harvtxt|Rezk|2001}} as models for [[(infinity,1)-category|(∞,&amp;nbsp;1)-categories]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4073">In [[logic]], the term '''statement''' is variously understood to mean either: 
: (a) a meaningful [[declarative sentence]] that is [[Truth|true]] or [[false (logic)|false]], or
: (b) the ''assertion'' that is made by a true or false declarative [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]].
In the latter case, a statement is distinct from a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] in that a sentence is only one [[formulation (logic)|formulation]] of a statement, whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement.

==Overview==
[[Philosophy of language|Philosopher of language]], [[Peter Strawson]] advocated the use of the term "statement" in sense (b) in preference to [[proposition]].  Strawson used the term "Statement" to make the point that two declarative sentences can make the same statement if they say the same thing in different ways.  Thus in the usage advocated by Strawson, "All men are mortal."  and "Every man is mortal."  are two different sentences that make the same statement.

In either case a statement is viewed as a [[truthbearer|truth bearer]].

Examples of sentences that are (or make) statements:

*"Socrates is a man."
*"A triangle has three sides."
*"Madrid is the capital of Spain."

Examples of sentences that are not (or do not make) statements:

*"Who are you?"
*"Run!"
*"Greenness perambulates."
*"I had one grunch but the eggplant over there."
*"The King of France is wise."
*"Broccoli tastes good."
*"Pegasus exists."

The first two examples are not '''declarative''' sentences and therefore are not (or do not make) statements.
The third and fourth are declarative sentences but, lacking meaning, are neither true nor false and therefore are not (or do not make) statements.  The fifth and sixth examples are meaningful declarative sentences, but are not statements but rather matters of opinion or taste.  Whether or not the sentence "Pegasus exists." is a statement is a subject of debate among philosophers.  [[Bertrand Russell]] held that it is a (false) statement.  Strawson held it is not a statement at all.

== As an abstract entity ==
In some treatments "statement" is introduced in order to distinguish a sentence from its informational content. A statement is regarded as the information content of an information-bearing sentence. Thus, a sentence is related to the statement it bears like a numeral to the number it refers to. Statements are abstract [[logic|logical entities]], while sentences are [[grammar|grammatical entities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18250">'''Symbolic behavior''' is “a person’s capacity to respond to or use a system of significant symbols” (Faules &amp; Alexander, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;5).  The symbolic behavior perspective argues that the [[reality]] of an [[organization]] is socially constructed through [[communication]] ([[George Edward Cheney|Cheney]] &amp; Christensen, 2000; Putnam, Phillips, &amp; Chapman, 1996).  Symbolic [[messages]] are used by individuals to understand their [[Social environment|environment]] and create a [[social reality]] (Faules &amp; Alexander, 1978; Mills, 2002).  When faced with uncertainty, individuals continually organize themselves within their group based reality and respond within that reality (Weick, 1995).

==History==
Symbolic interactionism (SI), a phrase coined by Herbert Blumer as early as 1937, was derived from lectures of early philosophy and sociologist theorist George Herbert Mead’s student notes.  Mead’s notes from a course he taught in social psychology were posthumously transcribed into the book Mind, Self, and Society; 1934.  Mead, born in 1863, arguably laid the foundation for the symbolic interactionism concept of how the individual mind arises out of the social process.  Mead’s description of language as communication through significant symbols and concepts of “me” and “I” are examples of his contributions to symbolic behavior perspective.  Symbolic behavior perspective stems from [[symbolic interactionism]] perspective.  [[Blumer]] (1962) summarizes the perspective as how people act towards things based on the meaning those things have for them.  These meanings are derived from [[social interaction]] and modified through interpretation.  The symbolic interactionism perspective relates to the organization by describing how employees form a [[concept]] of self in relationship to their organization as they interact with individuals, subordinates, and superiors within the organizational architecture.  Individuals learn appropriate behavior within an organization as the [[code]] of [[values]], [[roles]], attitudes, and norms of behavior of that work environment become apparent (Wood, 1999).

==Symbolic behavior perspective viewpoints==
Symbolic behavior perspective proposes that individuals are faced with uncertainty when introduced to an organization.  This uncertainty creates a reliance on symbolic messages so individuals can make sense of their environment (Brown, 1986).  In order to reduce uncertainty, organizations create sets of [[standardized]] meanings depicted by [[symbols]].  As symbolic messages are [[Semantics|interpreted]] by individuals, they react collectively within the [[organizational culture]].  As organizational cultures are learned, shared, and transmitted a collective [[social reality]] emerges (Harris &amp; Nelson, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;225). Organizational cultures are created and maintained by symbolic behavior, giving managers an opportunity to create, articulate, and sustain the organization’s values as individuals focus on [shared values] (Colvin, 2000, p. F-9).  The symbolic nature of shared values can also reduce [[ambiguity]] and tension within an organization (Harris &amp; Nelson, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;233).
According to Mead's theory, a social act involves a three-part relationship:  an initial gesture from one person, a response to that gesture by another, and a result.  The result is what the act means for the communicator (Littlejohn &amp; Foss, p.&amp;nbsp;160).

==Symbolic behavior perspective propositions==
The above discussion can be summarized into 7 major propositions posited by Symbolic Behavior Perspective.  The issues of [[complexity]], uncertainty and [[organizing (management)|organizing]], cultural creation and maintenance, interpersonal reality, group behavior, [[leadership]], and managing incongruences are addressed in the following propositions (Harris &amp; Nelson, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;222):

===Complexity===

Proposition 1:  [[Organizational complexity]] creates a reliance on symbolic messages.

===Uncertainty and organizing===

Proposition 2:  Uncertainty promotes a continual process of organizing.

===Cultural creation and maintenance===

Proposition 3:  Symbolic behavior creates and maintains organizational [[cultures]].

===Interpersonal reality===

Proposition 4:  Symbols constitute the basis for [[interpersonal]] reality.

===Group behavior===

Proposition 5:  Groups reaffirm the importance of symbolic behavior.

===Leadership===

Proposition 6:  Leadership requires effective symbolic behavior.

===Managing incongruences===

Proposition 7:  Incongruences and paradoxes are managed through acculturation.

==Tools of symbolic behavior==
According to Harris &amp; Nelson (2008, p.&amp;nbsp;237), tools consist of anything that provides symbolic meaning to people.  Tools can be in the form of verbal or non-verbal communication.

===Examples communication tools===

Stories/myths: As stories are continually repeated, they provide [[analogies]] for individuals and serve to guide behavior within the organization.

[[Titles]]: The use of titles communicates the relationship of the employee in [[correlation]] to the organization.

[[Slogans]]:  Slogans can be used to [[reinforce]] established priorities or to bring attention to new priorities (Waterman, 1987).

Dress:  Clothing is very important to an organization because it communicates culture (Remland, 2003).  Because clothing can [[Social influence|influence]] [[perceptions]] of both behavior and intent (Galin, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;51), the dress code of an organization can impact their overall image.

Priorities:  The priorities within an organization and the way they are carried out on daily basis carry enormous impact.  Individuals can better identify with the organization when management’s priorities are in line with those of employees (Harris &amp; Nelson, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;238).

==Limitations of symbolic behavior==
An over-reliance on symbolic activities can lead to significant problems.  These include unethical [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]], empty or meaningless actions, [[omnipresence]], divisions, and unexpected interpretations (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;239).  Likewise, [[Blumer]] notes in advanced societies large group actions consist of highly recurrent, stable patterns that establish common, established meanings for the participants.  [[Blumer]] heads a warning to bear in mind that new situations present problems requiring adjustment and redefinition (Littlejohn &amp; Foss, p.&amp;nbsp;160).

===Unethical manipulation===
The use of gimmickry, using [[wiktionary:superficial|superficial]] pleasantness to cover up [[dishonest]] activities or intentions, providing misleading or incorrect advice regarding [[safety]], or providing untrue explanations for behaviors are means used by unethical organizations, managers, or coworkers in order to obtain some advantage (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;240).

===Empty or meaningless actions===
Without meaning individuals can get caught up in an activity trap, where styles gets substituted for substance (Robbins 1980).  [[Diversity (business)|Diversity]] efforts are criticized for focusing more on comparative statistics generated by sporadic efforts and less on the nature of the issues a clearly thought-out strategic solution (Harris, 1997).

===Omnipresence===
Symbolic messages can prevent effective change or realistic responses to environmental demands.  Cultures create identification and unity (Tompkins &amp; Cheney, 1983), these trained incapacities can occur when values are strong or the culture’s influence is too pervasive.  Specifically, [[obsolescence]], resistance to change, and inconsistency are the three [[risks]] posed by strong values (Deal &amp; Kennedy, 1982).  Strong cultures dictate roles and performances meaning individuals can be co-opted by the culture and its messages (Conrad, 1985). [[Mead]] called a gesture with shared meaning a "significant symbol", suggesting that once there is shared meaning the gesture takes on the value of a significant symbol (Littlejohn &amp; Foss, p.&amp;nbsp;161).

===Divisions===
Symbols can create great divisions in an organization.  Culture provides both division and unity, and the symbols used to reinforce the organization can create powerful [[social alienation]] between individuals and groups.  [[Subcultures]] develop between managers and workers, blue and white collars, or factory and sales creating the potential for a “them versus us” environment (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;243).

===Unexpected interpretations===
Can be unpredictable because individuals respond to symbolic behavior through their own [[frame of reference]], attempts to use symbolism can have unintended results (Harris and Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;244).  A judicious use of symbols is necessary or the wrong action based on the right intent can occur.  A powerful sense of organizational [[pride]] can lead to dysfunctional responses by employees and managers (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;244).

==Performances involved in symbolic behavior==
A dramatistic perspective views individuals as actors “who creatively play, [[improvise]], interpret, and re-present roles and scripts” (Conquergood, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;187).  Because the set of intangible activities that support the actual service itself provide a satisfying experience or a performance worth an increased financial burden (Pine &amp; Gilmore, 1999).

===Role performance===
Learning to act out appropriate roles is a fundamental aspect of [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and important to organizational success (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;244). One's own ability to use significant symbols to respond to one's self makes the thinking process possible.

===Appropriate front===
Putting on an appropriate front (e.g. choice of clothes, [[language]], [[facial expressions]], excellent [[customer service]]) provides messages to support the role (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p 245).  Some individuals seem more adept at saying and doing the right thing at the right time, thereby avoiding [[malapropisms]] with some regularity.  Individuals and group role abilities often determine the acceptability of the act (Pacanowsky &amp; O’Donnell-Trujillo, 1983).

===Dramatic realization===
Using [[Words|verbal]] and [[nonverbal]] symbols to fulfill the requirements of the role leads to dramatic realization (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;246).  Image presentation and impression management are popular concepts for these efforts (Lord &amp; Maher, 1991).  Although there may be legitimate concerns regarding unethical impression management, it is a useful tool “to secure leadership positions and to achieve goals” (Hackman &amp; Johnson, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;24).

===Mystification===
A certain amount of mystification is required to put distance between the actor and the audience (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;247).

==Types of Rituals==
[[Rituals]] are acted out by performances and encompass all repeated activities (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;248).  Rituals provide for organizational reality.

===Rituals of arrival===
The rituals of arrival include those processes that explain what we must learn in order to be a bonafide member of the organization (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;248).  [[Socialization]] is the process of indoctrinating [[Indoctrination]] new employees to a company’s [[policies]].  New members find that “taken-for-granted ways no longer fit; the familiar customs and practices of the previous job or role are inappropriate” (Gabriel et al., 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;16).  Many organizations have adopted a clear [[acculturation]] process to guarantee successful socialization (Harris, 1990).

===Rituals of belonging and exclusion===
Once an individual is a part of an organization, there are rituals of belonging and exclusion (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;248).  Belonging rituals are indications that one is being accepted within the organization and or work group (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;248).

===Organizational rites===
Organization rites are planned activities that have both practical and expressive consequences (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;250).  When this definition is applied to corporate life, such diverse activities as personnel testing, [[organizational development]] programs, and [[collective bargaining]] can be seen as rites that have not only practical consequences but also express important cultural meanings (Trice &amp; Beyer, 1985, pp.&amp;nbsp;372–373).

==Related theories==
As mentioned above, symbolic behavior perspective has strong roots in symbolic interactionism perspective.  SI described as a movement is devoted to exploring ways people come together, or come to share meaning.  Philosopher [[Susan Langer]] created the Symbol Theory which posits symbolism to be the central concern of philosophy because it underlies all human knowing and understanding (Littlejohn &amp; Foss, p.&amp;nbsp;105).  Langer believes that while all animal life is dominated by feeling, human feeling is mediated by conceptions, symbols and language.  Animals respond to signs, but humans' stimulus from a sign is significantly more complex. The perspective is also associated with [[symbolic communication]] where animal societies are studied to help understand how symbolic communication affects the conduct of members of cooperating group.  Symbolic behavior is also linked to the work of American anthropologist [[Leslie Alvin White]] (1940) who stated that “all human behavior originates in the use of symbols.”  He believed human behavior and symbolic behavior to be synonymous with one another.  Symbolic behavior perspective is also closely related to [[organizational communication]] and  [[interpersonal relationships]] which involve interaction between two or more people and how they work together to achieve goals.

'''Teachers Without Borders''' (''TWB'') is an international organization launched in 2000, with a mission to connect teachers to information and each other in order to close the education divide and based  upon the premise that teachers are community change agents and key catalysts of global development priorities. The organization was founded by [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/founder/ Dr. Fred Mednick]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} 

Teachers Without Borders received the '''[https://luxembourgpeaceprize.org/laureates/outstanding-peace-education/2018-teachers-without-borders/ 2018 Luxembourg Peace Prize]''' for Outstanding Peace Education, recognized for a free Peace Education program involving teachers from regions in conflict, for having embedded peace education into all TWB courses (see below), and its Voice of Teachers Radio Show in Nigeria. 

Teachers Without Borders received the [https://www.changemakers.com/champions-quality-education-africa '''Champions of African Education Award'''] (2010) for its use of radio and local educational capacity building to disseminate information about the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In 2018, TWB's membership has reached 177 countries. Teachers Without Borders membership is free and enables local educators the opportunity to connect with colleagues globally.

Teachers Without Borders also received the '''[http://peacesymposium.org.uk/the-ahmadiyya-muslim-peace-prize Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize]''' for "outstanding work in the promotion of peace through efforts to convene teachers from regions in conflict, provide unfettered access to courses and networks devoted to teacher professional development, and to ensure that peace education is integrated into all initiatives. The formal announcement can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viaSBMQxcAk&amp;t=9s '''here'''].

==Approach==
Teachers Without Borders claims that teachers represent the largest professional community in the world (over 65 million); that teachers are uniquely suited as local leaders to recognize and help address development needs; that professional isolation and inconsequential or missing teacher professional development undermines social change; and that the transformation of pre-service and in-service teacher development can bring about more sustainable, equitable, democratic, and economically stable societies.

==Initiatives and Courses==
Teachers Without Borders' initiatives and courses are offered in various formats and settings: online, in schools, as community workshops, in books and journals, and on the radio.

      <comment>correct unnecessarily arcane and pretentious "oeuvre" to "work": this is an English encyclopedia, created for the widest possible readership, not for an elite, effete, esoteric minority—there is no justification for using a pretentious and obscure French word when there is a universally understood exact English equivalent. Besides "works" is used later in the same sentence with regard to other directors—why use a less accessible word with regard to Reis, the subject of this article?</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8508">'''''The School of Reis''''' is a [[film theory]] [[concept]] relative to the teachings of Portuguese director [[António Reis]], to his [[Work of art|work]], conceived with his wife Margarida Cordeiro, and to the works of the directors influenced by theirs.&lt;ref name="The School of Reis official page at the Harvard Film Archive website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2012aprjun/reis.html|title=The School of Reis official page at the Harvard Film Archive website|accessdate=2012-07-01|work=ves.fas.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the Term==
The term ''School of Reis'' was coined by film historian [[Haden Guest]], director of the [[Harvard Film Archive]], when referring to the influence exerted by the school of thought of Portuguese director António Reis through his didactics at his classes as professor of the [[Escola Superior de Teatro e Cinema|Portuguese National Filmschool]], from 1977 to 1991,&lt;ref name="Official António Reis collection blog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antonioreis.blogspot.pt/2011/05/195-mestre-na-escola-superior-de-teatro.html|title=Post on Reis' period as professor at the National Film School at the Official António Reis collection blog|accessdate=2012-07-01|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; over generations of future Portuguese directors who learned under Reis' mentoring.

The term ''Reisian'' is sometimes applied in a similar fashion as ''Fordian'' or ''Tarkovskian'', relative to the style of both the American director [[John Ford]] or the Russian director [[Andrey Tarkovsky]].&lt;ref name="Article on Senses of Cinema concerning the term Fordian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2004/cteq/john_ford/|title=Article on Senses of Cinema on the term "Fordian"|accessdate=2012-07-01|work=sensesofcinema.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Teachings of António Reis===
António Reis lectioned at the Portuguese National Film School classes such as ''Filmic Space'', in 1977, and later ''Film Analysis'', ''History of Image'', ''Direction of Actors'' and ''Introduction to the Study of Image''.&lt;ref name="Official António Reis collection blog"/&gt;

One of the characteristics of his teaching method was that it was almost exclusively oral, existing very few written materials reataining his theory, in what could be stated to be a reflex of António Reis' beliefs in the ancient oral tradition.&lt;ref name="José Bogalheiro on António Reis classes at the official António Reis collection blog (in Portuguese)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antonioreis.blogspot.pt/2011/05/194-em-busca-das-suas-aulas.html|title=José Bogalheiro on António Reis classes at the official António Reis collection blog (in Portuguese)|accessdate=2012-07-01|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most recognizable aspects of António Reis' aesthetics was his structuring of the cinematographical unity around the exploration of the limits of the possibilities of the ''[[match cut]]''&lt;ref name="António Cabrita on António Reis classes at Expresso Newspaper (in Portuguese)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antonioreis.blogspot.pt/2005/07/090-evocao-do-pedagogo.html|title=António Cabrita on António Reis classes at Expresso Newspaper (in Portuguese)|accessdate=2012-07-01|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing visual rhymes, associations and understated meanings, clearly identifiable in works of his like ''Jaime'' or ''Trás-os-Montes''.

===Influence and Heirs of the School of Reis===
António Reis' works had a major impact on the practices of contemporaries of his like [[Manoel de Oliveira]], whom Reis assisted in his second feature, ''[[Rite of Spring (film)|Rite of Spring]]'',&lt;ref name="Rite of Spring at The School of Reis official page at the Harvard Film Archive website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2012aprjun/reis.html#rite|title=Rite of Spring at The School of Reis official page at the Harvard Film Archive website|accessdate=2012-07-01|work=ves.fas.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1963; [[Paulo Rocha (film director)|Paulo Rocha]], having Reis written the script for his feature ''Change of Life''; or [[João César Monteiro]], whose quotations of Reis are clear in films as ''Recollections of the Yellow House'', ''God's Comedy'' or ''Silvestre''.&lt;ref name="The School of Reis official page at the Harvard Film Archive website"/&gt;

However, Dennis Lim, in his article for the magazine [[Artforum]], points out that "for today’s preeminent Portuguese filmmakers, no single figure has been more influential than António Reis."&lt;ref name="Under The Influence, Dennis Lim article at ARTFORUM on The School of Reis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artforum.com/inprint/id=31085|title=Under The Influence, Dennis Lim article at ARTFORUM on The School of Reis|accessdate=2012-07-01|work=artforum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his teachings, Reis has had a major impact in the work of subsequent filmmakers of whom he was a professor, as [[Joaquim Sapinho]], [[Vítor Gonçalves]], [[Pedro Costa]], [[Manuela Viegas]] and [[João Pedro Rodrigues]]. Some of them, like Sapinho, Gonçalves or Viegas are today professors at the [[Escola Superior de Teatro e Cinema]], the current name for the former Portuguese National Film School.
