This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in '''1614'''.

*London sees a controversy between actors and watermen.

The watermen respond by proposing to limit the locations of the theatres around London, much to the actors' displeasure. The rebuilt [[Globe Theatre]] opens by June, and [[Philip Henslowe]]'s new [[Hope Theatre]] opens in October, negating the watermen's complaint. [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor the Water Poet]] describes the controversy in his ''The True Cause of the Watermen's Suit Concerning Players''.

[[File:Defending Portland (34939466302) (cropped).jpg|thumb|"All Lives Matter" sign at a rally in Portland, Oregon, on June 4, 2017]]
"'''All Lives Matter'''" ('''#AllLivesMatter''') is a slogan that has come to be associated with criticism of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Townes|first1=Carimah|title=Obama Explains The Problem With 'All Lives Matter'|url=http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/10/22/3715332/obama-explains-the-problem-with-all-lives-matter/|publisher=think progress|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan became a larger talking point in the [[2016 United States presidential election]]. 

== Supporters ==
Several notable individuals have supported All Lives Matter. Its proponents include Senator [[Tim Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Eugene|title=Tim Scott defends use of 'all lives matter'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/tim-scott-all-lives-matter/|publisher=CNN|date=September 3, 2015|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American football player [[Richard Sherman (American football)|Richard Sherman]] supported the All Lives Matter message, saying "I stand by what I said that All Lives Matter and that we are human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samuel|first1=Ebenezer|title=Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman explains why he stands by that All Lives Matter|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/richard-sherman-explains-stands-lives-matter-article-1.2728272|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, Democratic presidential nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] faced backlash after using the phrase "all lives matter" at an African-American church in Missouri during her presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rappeport|first1=Alan|title=Hillary Clinton's 'All Lives Matter' Remark Stirs Backlash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/24/hillary-clintons-all-lives-matter-remark-stirs-backlash/|accessdate=December 12, 2016|work=First Draft|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans have been stronger proponents in general of All Lives Matter and harsher critics of the Black Lives Matter movement in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/15/ben-carson-course-all-lives-matter-and-all-lives-i/|title=Ben Carson: 'Of course all lives matter — and all lives includes black lives'|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|newspaper=The Washington Times|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Rand Paul]] has argued that Black Lives Matter has focused on the wrong targets and has stated, "I think they should change their name maybe—if they were All Lives Matter, or Innocent Lives Matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marino|first=Gordon|year=2016|title=All Lives Matter Vs. Black Lives Matter|url=|journal=Commonweal|volume=15|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Donald Trump]] has stated that "Black Lives Matter" is a divisive term and that the term is inherently racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/three-words-that-republicans-wrestle-with-black-lives-matter/2016/07/12/f5a9dfdc-4878-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html|title=Three words that Republicans wrestle with: 'Black Lives Matter'|website=Washington Post|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an August 2015 poll, 78% of likely American voters said that the statement All Lives Matter was "close[r] to [their] own" point of view than Black Lives Matter was. Only 11% said that the statement Black Lives Matter was closer. Nine percent said that neither statement reflected their own point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2015/black_lives_matter_or_all_lives_matter |title=Black Lives Matter Or All Lives Matter? |date=August 20, 2015 |publisher=[[Rasmussen Reports]] |accessdate=July 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internet facilitates the spread of the message "All Lives Matter" as a response to the Black Lives Matter hashtag as well as the "[[Blue Lives Matter]]" hashtag as a response to Beyonce's halftime performance speaking out against police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joshua-adams/alllivesmatter-needs-to-e_b_8683982.html|title=The Troll Named #AllLivesMatter|date=December 2, 2015|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.policeone.com/officer-shootings/articles/177405006-Photo-Plane-flies-Blue-Lives-Matter-banner-over-Beyonce-concert|title=Photo: Plane flies 'Blue Lives Matter' banner over Beyonce concert|website=PoliceOne|access-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a performance during the [[2016 MLB All-Star Game]], Remigio Pereira, a member of [[The Tenors]], held up an "All Lives Matter" sign and altered some lyrics to the anthem "[[O Canada]]".&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shepherd|first1=Ken|title=Remigio Pereira, who worked 'All Lives Matter' into Canadian anthem, suspended from singing group|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/13/remigio-pereira-who-worked-all-lives-matter-into-c/|publisher=Washington Times|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pereira sang, "We're all brothers and sisters. All lives matter to the great," instead of the lines, "With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free."&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt; Even after criticism, he defended his statement, tweeting "I speak for the human race and the lives of all sentient beings. Love, peace, and harmony for ALL has always been my life's purpose."&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;

Some supporters have used the phrase as a way to bring communities together, feeling that the phrase "black lives matter" is too narrow. [[Max Muncy]], a professional baseball infielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers, tweeted the phrase in response to the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/11/16/why-saying-all-lives-matter-minimizes-the-black-lives-matter-movement/|title=Why saying "All lives matter" minimizes the Black Lives Matter movement|last=Opinion|first=D. P.|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Activists from Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter made news when they embraced during a "run-in" in Dallas. "We're all brothers and sisters," one of the protesters can be heard saying on CNN. "This is how you kick down a wall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gauthier|first1=Brendan|title=WATCH: "We're all brothers and sisters": Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter activists hug it out in Dallas|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/07/12/watch_were_all_brothers_and_sisters_black_lives_matter_and_all_lives_matter_activists_hug_it_out_in_dallas/|accessdate=August 10, 2016|publisher=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2, 2016, a fan at a [[Chicago Bears]] NFL game ran onto the field during a television timeout during the 4th quarter dressed in a gorilla costume, wearing a shirt that read "All Lives Matter" on the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/fan-in-gorilla-suitall-lives-matter-shirt-arrested-at-bears-game/|title=Fan in gorilla suit, All Lives Matter shirt arrested at Bears game|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:Rally Against the Immigration Ban (31797745824).jpg|thumb|"What happened to 'All Lives Matter'?" at a [[Protests against Donald Trump|protest against Donald Trump]].]]
According to professor [[David Theo Goldberg]], "All Lives Matter" reflects a view of "racial dismissal, ignoring, and denial".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why 'Black Lives Matter' Because All Lives Don't Matter in America|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-theo-goldberg/why-black-lives-matter_b_8191424.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=November 18, 2015|date=September 25, 2015|last=Goldberg|first=David Theo|authorlink=David Theo Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', [[Bill Maher]] expressed support for use of the "Black Lives Matter" phrase, stating that "'All Lives Matter' implies that all lives are equally at risk, and they're not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRxS2Rb8Mfk|title=Bill Maher: Why Is BlackLivesMatter Going After Sympathizers Like Hillary and Bernie?|date=August 22, 2015|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founders of the Black Lives Matter movement have responded to criticism of the movement's exclusivity, saying, "#BlackLivesMatter doesn't mean your life isn't important – it means that Black lives, which are seen without value within [[White supremacy]], are important to your liberation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Garza – The Feminist Wire|url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/|website=thefeministwire.com|accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video interview with [[Laura Flanders]], Black Lives Matter movement co-founder [[Alicia Garza]] said that "changing Black Lives Matter to All Lives Matter is a demonstration of how we don't actually understand [[Societal racism|structural racism]] in this country". She went on to say that other lives are valued more than black lives, and that to take blackness out of this equation is inappropriate.&lt;ref name=TruthOut&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flanders|first1=Laura|author-link=Laura Flanders|title=Building Movements Without Shedding Differences: Alicia Garza of #BlackLivesMatter|url=http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/29813-building-movements-without-shedding-differences-alicia-garza|accessdate=March 25, 2015|publisher=Truthout|date=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] spoke to the debate between Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=President Obama defends Black Lives Matter movement|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-barack-obama-defends-black-lives-matter-movement|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama said, "I think that the reason that the organizers used the phrase Black Lives Matter was not because they were suggesting that no one else's lives matter ... rather what they were suggesting was there is a specific problem that is happening in the African-American community that's not happening in other communities." He also said "that is a legitimate issue that we've got to address."&lt;ref name=tactics&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Bryan|title=Tactics of Black Lives Matter|url=http://kcts9.org/programs/in-close/tactics-black-lives-matter|publisher=KCTS9|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{external media |float=right |width=23em |image1=[http://chainsawsuit.com/comic/2016/07/07/all-houses-matter-the-extended-cut/ "All Houses Matter"], ''Chainsawsuit'', [[Kris Straub]], July 7, 2016. A cartoonist uses a house fire to illustrate criticism of the term "All Lives Matter."&lt;ref name="USAToday2016-07-13"/&gt; }}
In July 2016, ''[[USA Today]]'' concluded from the thoughts of [[Columbia University]] sociology professor Carla Shedd, that the phrase "'All Lives Matter' can actually be interpreted as racist". It also cited professor [[Joe Feagin]], who said that white people use the phrase "All Lives Matter" to ignore the Black Lives Matter movement, which he described as "already about liberty and justice for all." ''USA Today'' reported that some celebrities who had tweeted using the hashtag #AllLivesMatter, including [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Fetty Wap]], had deleted the tweets and apologized. It also mentioned cartoonist [[Kris Straub]], who tweeted a cartoon titled "All Houses Matter", showing a house fire, to illustrate what he saw as the problem with the term.&lt;ref name="USAToday2016-07-13"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/07/13/why-saying-all-lives-matter-opposite-black-lives-matter/87025190/ |title=#AllLivesMatter hashtag is racist, critics say |first=Ashley |last=May |date=July 13, 2016 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=July 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapper [[Fetty Wap]] apologized for using #AllLivesMatter, stating that he didn't fully understand the hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/us/all-lives-matter-black-lives-matter.html|title=Why 'All Lives Matter' Is Such a Perilous Phrase|last=Victor|first=Daniel|date=July 15, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facebook graffiti incident==
On February 24, 2016, [[Mark Zuckerberg]], CEO of Facebook, sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten "Black Lives Matter" phrases on the company walls and had written "All Lives Matter" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but "malicious as well".&lt;ref name="npr_zuckerberg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selyukh|first1=Alina|title=Zuckerberg tells Facebook staff to stop crossing out 'Black Lives Matter'|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/02/26/467985384/zuckerberg-tells-facebook-staff-to-stop-crossing-out-black-lives-matter|website=npr.org|publisher=NPR|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zuckerberg's memo, "''Black Lives Matter'' doesn't mean other lives don't – it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve". The memo also said that the act of crossing something out in itself, "means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's".&lt;ref name="shaunking-zuckerberg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Shaun|title=Mark Zuckerberg forced to address racism among Facebook staff after vandals target Black Lives Matter phrases|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-mark-zuckerberg-forced-address-racism-facebook-article-1.2543985|accessdate=February 26, 2016|agency=Daily News|location=New York|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guynn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jessica|first1=Guynn|title=Zuckerberg reprimands Facebook staff defacing 'Black Lives Matter' slogan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/25/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter-diversity/80933694/|accessdate=February 26, 2016|work=USA Today|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="benjaminsnyder"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snyder|first1=Benjamin|title=Mark Zuckerberg Takes Facebook Workers to Task Over 'All Lives Matter' Graffiti|url=http://fortune.com/2016/02/25/mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter/|accessdate=February 26, 2016|work=Fortune|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Alphyn''' (from the [[Germanic language|Germanic]] word for "chaser" or "wolf"), also known as ''awfyn'' or ''alfin'' in older writings,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chess player's chronicle''. Oxford Press, 1841. 67. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; is a rare [[heraldry|heraldic]] creature.

''Basic Heraldry''. 1st ed. W W Norton &amp; Co Inc, 1993. 166. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; Another notable characteristic is its knotted tail, reminiscent of [[Celtic knotwork|Celtic design]] and similar to that of the [[griffin]].&lt;ref name="heraldry"&gt;Heraldry Society.

University of Minnesota: 1954. &lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is depicted as having an [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle's]]&lt;ref name="heraldry" /&gt; or [[dragon]]'s talons on its forelegs, other times they are cloven, like a goat's. Occasionally all four feet are depicted as having the claws of a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]]. In English heraldry, the Alphyn was used as a [[heraldic badge]] of the [[Baron de la Warr|Lords de la Warr]], and also appeared on the [[guidon (heraldic flag)|guidon]] held by the knight in the [[Milleflour Tapestry]] in [[Somerset]].

In England's first printed book, [[William Caxton]]'s "[[Game and Playe of the Chesse]]" the chessmen now known as [[bishop (chess)|bishop]]s are described instead as Alphyns, representing judges: "The Alphyns ought to be made and formed in manere of Juges syttynge in a chayer wyth a book open to fore their eyen."

'''''Angela's Ashes: A Memoir''''' is a 1996 [[memoir]] by the Irish-American author Frank McCourt, with various anecdotes and stories of his childhood. It details his very early childhood in [[Brooklyn, New York]], but focuses primarily on his life in [[Limerick, Ireland]]. It also includes his struggles with poverty and his father's [[alcoholism]].

The book was published in 1996 and won the 1997 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]]. A sequel, ''[['Tis]]'', was published in 1999, followed by ''[[Teacher Man]]'' in 2005.

==Synopsis==
Born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on 19 August 1930, Frank (Francis) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt. Both of his parents emigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela's pregnancy with Frankie. Angela is originally from Limerick, Ireland, and is fond of music, singing, and dancing. Malachy, from Northern Ireland, is an alcoholic known for his "odd manner" and for telling fantastical stories about Irish heroes. Frankie is often said to closely resemble his father, having a hang-dog face and the same "odd manner." The narrative is told from the point of view of Frankie as a child.

In America, the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor, and a communal lavatory, with other immigrant families from Ireland, Italy, and the Jewish communities.

Frankie has four younger siblings: [[Malachy McCourt|Malachy]], born in 1931, who is often favored over Frankie for being an attractive, open child; blond twins Oliver and Eugene, born in 1932; and an infant sister, Margaret, in 1935.

The family often struggles with poverty as Malachy Sr. engages in an endless struggle to find work and alcohol. The family's prospects, and Angela's spirits, lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his first week's wages, but eventually he finds himself spending all of his pay in pubs, despite Angela's many schemes to prevent him from doing so, and losing his job after a few weeks.

Margaret's birth seems to instill new life into the family: the whole family falls in love with her, Malachy Sr most of all. He gives up drinking and finds steady work to support the family. However, due to her parents' ignorance of children's disease, Margaret lives for only seven weeks. With her death, Malachy Sr abandons his family for days to indulge in an alcoholic binge, while Angela falls into a severe, debilitating depression. Frank, age six, is forced to feed and care for his younger siblings, often with the kind intervention of the neighbors. The neighbors soon realize the family's dire straits and intervene, contacting Angela's cousins, who in turn recommend the family return to Ireland with Angela's family in [[Limerick, Ireland|Limerick]].

Angela is pregnant with a new baby, as they return to Ireland from America, and lose the child, shortly after moving to Limerick.

The [[Great Depression]] has struck Ireland, particularly Limerick, even harder than it did the United States. There is little work, and conditions for poor families are miserable. Malachy Sr finds it even more difficult to find work because of his Northern Ireland accent and mannerisms, the children are mocked for their American accents, and many neighbors, as well as Angela's family, look down on the McCourts for their return from America.

The family is forced to rely on [[Welfare|the dole]] and charity from the local [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]], which requires extensive, and humiliating application processes. Angela and Malachy Sr often argue about this as Malachy drinks the welfare money meant to feed the family, and views Angela's asking for charity as begging and degrading. For many years, the family subsists on little more than bread and tea.

Within a year of the family's arrival, Oliver and Eugene also die—Oliver of what is implied to be [[scarlet fever]] and Eugene, a few months later, from grieving the loss of his twin and malnutrition. After each death, Angela sinks into depression, and the family moves because she cannot bear being in the same house. Each move results in the McCourts sliding down into worse and worse circumstances. Eventually, they end up living in a slum house. The entire ground floor floods for half a year, requiring the family to live in an upstairs room together. Their house is located next to the only lavatory on the whole street. There is a constant traffic of families dumping chamber pots in the filthy lavatory, which often backs up and smells. Two additional baby brothers, Michael (born 1936), and [[Alphie McCourt|Alphie]] (Alphonsus, b.&amp;nbsp;1940), are born in Limerick.

Frankie grows up in Limerick as a sensitive and intelligent child. He often makes unique observations from those around him and has an emotional need to help. His strict Catholic upbringing preys on his imaginative nature and thoughts on whether he will be going to hell plague on his mind. Frankie must balance his Catholic beliefs against a church which frequently rejects him due to his poverty and family, his Irish upbringing against his desire to return to America once he's grown, and his desire for his father's attention against his loyalty to his mother. Strangers often prefer his more attractive and outgoing siblings, but Frankie wins over a few champions, mainly in the form of his school teachers and the various adults who hire him for odd jobs.

Frank develops [[typhoid fever]] and is taken to a Catholic hospital, where for the first time he has adequate food, warmth, and access to limitless books, and the time to read them, giving birth to his lifelong love of literature. Frankie additionally contracts chronic [[conjunctivitis]], which does little to improve his looks or perceived, sarcastic demeanor.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], many Limerick men find work at a defence plant in [[Coventry, England]], leaving their families behind and sending back money to support them. These good-paying jobs lift many of the McCourts' neighbors out of poverty. Malachy Sr leaves the family behind and secures a defence job. For several weeks, the payments allow the family to enjoy small luxuries such as candy and visits to the movies. But soon, the money stops coming and Malachy Sr abandons his family for good.

Frank and his brothers begin to scavenge the streets for [[coal]] or [[peat]] turf for fuel. They also steal leftover food from restaurants at the end of the day and grocery deliveries from doorsteps.

Eventually, the family is evicted and homeless. With few options, Angela and her children move in with her bachelor cousin, Laman Griffin. Laman is a petty tyrant who resents the presence of the children and enjoys degrading them and Angela. A preteen Frankie resents this treatment, but puts up with it for his mother and younger brothers. Upon discovering that part of Laman's deal for providing housing is a sexual relationship with Angela, Frankie has a fight with Laman and is thrown out of the house. Shortly after, Malachy Jr leaves Laman Griffin's to join the military as a bugle boy.

Frankie moves in with his maternal uncle, who was dropped on his head as a child and now lives in the house left to him by his deceased mother. Frank gets a job as a telegram delivery boy on his 14th birthday and begins to support himself while saving for his passage to America. The interesting people and situations Frankie meets on his deliveries cause him to grow as a person.

Frankie supports his youngest brothers by providing food and respite from Laman Griffin when they come to visit him. Eventually, his brothers ask if they can move in with him, which he allows, and they are shortly followed by Angela. Frankie must now turn over the majority of his wages to his mother as the bread winner of the family, though he still takes on various odd jobs to earn extra for his ticket to America, such as writing threatening collection letters on behalf of a local [[moneylender]].

On his sixteenth birthday, Frank's uncle takes him to the pub to buy him his first beer. Frank gets drunk and returns home, singing like his father used to. When his mother shames him for drinking the way his father did, Frank hits her, accusing her of being a whore for Laman Griffin, and is immediately ashamed of himself.

One day Frank returns to the moneylender's home to find she has died. Liberated, Frank takes money from her purse and throws her ledger of debtors into the river to free the neighborhood of their debts. The contents of the moneylender's purse give him enough money to return to America at the age of nineteen. Frank arrives in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], ready to begin a new life in the country of his birth.

[[File:Edward Anthony and Frank Buck.jpg|thumb|right|Co-authors Anthony (left) and Buck signing copies of the follow-up book, ''[[Wild Cargo (book)|Wild Cargo]]'' (1932)]]
'''''Bring ‘Em Back Alive''''' is a 1930 book by [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]]. His first book, it was a huge best seller that catapulted him to world fame and was translated into many languages. Buck tells of his adventures capturing exotic animals. 
Writing with [[Edward Anthony (writer)|Edward Anthony]], Buck relates some of his most frightening experiences, among them, his battle with an escaped king cobra. This venomous snake is the only jungle animal, Buck says, that has no fear of either man or beast. "Nowhere in the world is there an animal or reptile that can quite match its unfailing determination to wipe out
anything that crosses its path. This lust to kill invests the king cobra with a quality of fiendishness that puts it in a class by itself, almost making it a jungle synonym for death." When the escaped king cobra confronted him, Buck wrote, for an instant, mind and body were numb. He stripped off the white duck jacket he wore over his bare skin and as the snake struck he lunged forward, threw himself with the coat in front of him upon it and hit the ground with a bang, with the cobra, trapped in the jacket under him.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Bebaclassics.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Classics Illustrated]] edition.]] --&gt;

Buck describes many other fearsome encounters. A [[tapir]] he was trying to medicate made a sudden terrific charge, hitting him in the stomach with its head and knocking him down. Then the enraged beast jumped on him, pounded him with its hind legs, and dragged him around its pen. The tapir was trying to rip off Buck’s face with its huge jaws and powerful teeth when Buck's native helpers came running to his rescue. One of them shoved a two-by-four plank down the animal's throat, allowing Buck to escape.

“The book can be recommended to anybody who likes being made to sit on the edge of
his chair and gasp for breath as his eyes eat up the print to see what happens next,” wrote the New York Times Book Review.&lt;ref&gt;[[Florence Finch Kelly]]. Bring ‘Em Back Alive. ''New York Times Book Review''. December 14, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; Many decades later, these remarkable stories have lost none of their pace or their power to thrill.

War correspondent [[Floyd Gibbons]] suggested to Buck that he write a book about his experiences. Mutual friends introduced Buck to [[George T. Bye]], a New York literary agent, who represented Buck in the publication of ''Bring 'Em Back Alive'' and Buck's subsequent books.

In 2000, [[Steven Lehrer]] published a new collection of these stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:BetteMidler90cropped.jpg|thumb|Singer, actress and comedian [[Bette Midler]] is known for her camp stage shows and film characters.]]
'''Camp''' is an [[aesthetic]] style and sensibility that regards something as appealing because of its bad [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and [[irony|ironic]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Babuscio (1993, 20), Feil (2005, 478), Morrill (1994, 110), Shugart and Waggoner (2008, 33), and Van Leer (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Camp aesthetics disrupt many of [[modernism]]'s notions of what art is and what can be classified as [[high art]] by inverting aesthetic attributes such as beauty, value, and taste through an invitation of a different kind of apprehension and consumption.&lt;ref name="Mallan, Kerry 2005"&gt;Mallan, Kerry, McGills, Roderick (2005) "Between a Frock and a Hard Place: Camp Aesthetics and Children's Culture", ''Canadian Review of American Studies'' Vol.35 №1 pp. 1–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp can also be a social practice. For many it is considered a style and performance identity for several types of entertainment including film, cabaret, and [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallan, Kerry, McGills, Roderick. "Between a Frock and a Hard Place: Camp Aesthetics and Children's Culture". ''Canadian Review of American Studies'' (2005) 35:1 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Where high art necessarily incorporates beauty and value, camp necessarily needs to be lively, audacious and dynamic. "Camp aesthetics delights in impertinence." Camp opposes satisfaction and seeks to challenge.&lt;ref name="Mallan, Kerry 2005" /&gt;

Camp art is related to—and often confused with—[[kitsch]], and things with camp appeal may also be described as "cheesy". When the usage appeared in 1909, it denoted "ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical", or "[[effeminate]]" behaviour, and by the middle of the 1970s, the definition comprised "banality, mediocrity, artifice, [and] ostentation ... so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal".&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, 1976 edition, sense 6, [Slang, orig., homosexual jargon, Americanism] banality, mediocrity, artifice, ostentation, etc. so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal&lt;/ref&gt; The American writer [[Susan Sontag]]'s essay "[[Notes on 'Camp']]" (1964) emphasized its key elements as: artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and 'shocking' ''excess''. Camp as an aesthetic has been popular from the 1960s to the present.

Camp aesthetics were popularized by filmmakers [[George Kuchar|George]] and [[Mike Kuchar]], [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] and his film ''[[Flaming Creatures]]'', and later [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], including the last's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'', and ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]''. Celebrities that are associated with camp personas include [[drag queen]]s and performers such as [[Dame Edna Everage]], [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], [[RuPaul]], [[Paul Lynde]], and [[Liberace]]. Camp was a part of the anti-academic defence of [[popular culture]] in the 1960s and gained popularity in the 1980s with the widespread adoption of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] views on art and culture. Television programs as varied as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', and ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' have been described as camp.

== Origins and development ==
In 1909, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gave the first print citation of ''camp'' as
{{quote|ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical; effeminate or homosexual; pertaining to, characteristic of, homosexuals. So as a noun, 'camp' behaviour, mannerisms, et cetera. (cf. quot. 1909); a man exhibiting such behaviour.}}

[[File:Carmen Miranda in The Gang's All Here trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Carmen Miranda]] in the trailer for ''[[The Gang's All Here (1943 film)|The Gang's All Here]]'' (1943)]]

According to the dictionary, this sense is "etymologically obscure". ''Camp'' in this sense has been suggested to have possibly derived from the French term ''se camper'', meaning "to pose in an exaggerated fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=camp (adj.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camp|website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atilf.atilf.fr/academie9.htm Entry "camper"], in: ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]'', ninth edition (1992). "'''2.''' Fam: Placer avec fermeté, avec insolence ou selon ses aises.] ''Il me parlait, le chapeau campé sur la tête.'' Surtout pron. ''Se camper solidement dans son fauteuil. Se camper à la meilleure place. Il se campa devant son adversaire.'' '''3.''' En parlant d'un acteur, d'un artiste: Figurer avec force et relief. ''Camper son personnage sur la scène. Camper une figure dans un tableau, des caractères dans un roman''." ('''Familiar:''' To assume a defiant, insolent or [[wiktionary:devil-may-care|devil-may-care]] attitude. '''Theatre:''' To perform with forcefulness and exaggeration; [[wiktionary:overact|to overact]].{{indent|12}}To impose one's character assertively into a scene; [[wiktionary:upstage|to upstage]].)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it evolved into a general description of the aesthetic choices and behaviour of working-class homosexual men.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Esther Newton (1978): ''Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America'', University Of Chicago Press. {{worldcat|name=''Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America''|oclc=257048012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it was made mainstream, and [[adjective|adjectivized]], by [[Susan Sontag]] in a landmark essay (see below).

The rise of post-modernism made ''camp'' a common perspective on aesthetics, which was not identified with any specific group. The attitude was originally a distinctive factor in pre-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] [[gay]] male communities, where it was the dominant cultural pattern. It originated from the acceptance of gayness as [[effeminacy]].&lt;ref name=newton /&gt; Two key components of camp were originally feminine performances: [[Swish (slang)|swish]] and [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. With swish featuring extensive use of superlatives, and drag being exaggerated female impersonation, camp became extended to all things "over the top", including women posing as female impersonators ([[faux queen]]s), as in the exaggerated Hollywood version of [[Carmen Miranda]]. It was this version of the concept that was adopted by literary and art critics and became a part of the conceptual array of 1960s culture. Moe Meyer still defines ''camp'' as "queer parody".&lt;ref&gt;Moe Meyer (2010): ''An Archaeology of Posing: Essays on Camp, Drag, and Sexuality'', Macater Press, {{ISBN|978-0-9814924-5-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moe Meyer (2011): ''The Politics and Poetics of Camp'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-51489-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary culture ==
=== Television ===
Much of the cult following of camp today grew rapidly during the transition from black-and-white to [[colour television]] in the early 1960s. Network programming during that time sought entertainment content that would display the new medium with the use of bright colours and high stylization. The concept of the comicbook [[superhero]] (an individual in a highly stylized, outlandish and possibly impractical costume avenging otherwise serious matters such as murder) could be interpreted as camp. However, since it was aimed initially at children, it is camp only in a secondary perspective. It was not until the 1960s television version of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (one of the more famous examples of camp in popular culture, 1966–1968) that the link was made explicit, with the inherent ridiculousness of the concept exposed as a vehicle for comedy. The villains of series as divergent as ''Batman'' and ''[[The Mod Squad]]'' (1968–1973) were costumed as to take advantage of new colours and changing fashion styles, in ways that took advantage of camp. 

Ironically, even ''Batman'' fell victim to contemporaneous parodies, with the release of ''[[Captain Nice]]'' and ''[[Mister Terrific (TV series)|Mr. Terrific]]'', which layered extra camp onto the already overladen superhero concept. The stylized content of ''Batman'' may have possibly jump-started television campiness, to circumvent the strict censorship of comics at this time (after Dr. [[Fredric Wertham]]'s essay ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' which led to the comics' industry-sponsored [[Comics Code]]), as the ''Batman'' comic books were very dark and [[Film noir|noirish]] until the 1950s and from the 1970s onwards.

Television series such as ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' (1961–1969), ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'' (both 1964–1966), ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' (1964–1967), ''[[Lost in Space]]'' (1965–1968), ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (1965–1969), ''[[Get Smart (TV series)|Get Smart]]'' (1965–1970), ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' (1972–1985), ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (1976–1981), ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' (1977–1984) and ''[[CHiPs]]'' (1977–1983) are enjoyed into the 21st century for what are interpreted as their "camp" aspects. Some of these series were developed 'tongue-in-cheek' by their producers.

In a ''[[Monty Python]]'' sketch of their [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|television show]] (Episode 22, "Camp Square-Bashing", repeated in their film ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', 1971), the British Army's 2nd Armoured Division has a Military "Swanning About" Precision Drill unit in which soldiers "camp it up" in unison.

TV soap operas, especially those that air in primetime, are often considered camp. The over-the-top excess of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' (1978–1991)  and ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (1981–1989) were popular in the 1980s. The Channel 4 series ''[[Eurotrash (TV series)|Eurotrash]]'' (1993–2004) was a television programme produced using the inherent ridiculousness of its subject matter for comedic effect, often using camp dubbing in regional accents and overexaggerated stereotypical characterisations (such as an aristocratic artist based on [[Brian Sewell]]) to puncture the interviewees' pretence of seriousness. However, an obituary to [[Lolo Ferrari]] was given straight dubbing as a mark of respect at odds with its irreverence. However, the subject matter would have offended many British viewers and fallen foul of [[OFCOM]] if it was done with any seriousness. Again, this is an example of doing a programme in a camp manner to get around the likelihood of censorship. [[Mentos]] television commercials during the 1990s developed a [[cult following]] due to their camp "[[Eurotrash (term)|Eurotrash]]" humour. In the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|Season 8]] episode "[[Homer's Phobia]]" (1997) of the American [[animated comedy]] series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', gay secondary character John (played by gay director [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]) defines to [[Homer Simpson]] the meaning of the word ''camp'' to be "tragically ludicrous", or "ludicrously tragic": Homer gives a misinterpreted example of ''camp'' as "when a clown dies".

The [[Comedy Central]] television show ''[[Strangers with Candy]]'' (1999–2000), starring comedian [[Amy Sedaris]], was a camp spoof of the ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' genre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-PAURpOlB8C&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=%22strangers+with+candy+which+was%22+camp&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGsYeZ8sHVAhVl_IMKHVcbAyAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22strangers%20with%20candy%20which%20was%22%20camp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocregister.com/2006/07/06/strangers-with-candy-after-school-special-sedaris-style/]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ESPN Classic]] show ''[[Cheap Seats without Ron Parker]]'' (2004–2006) featured two Generation-X, real-life brothers making humorous observations while watching televised camp sporting events, which had often been featured on ''[[ABC's Wide World of Sports]]'' during the 1970s. Examples include a 1970s sport that attempted to combine [[ballet]] with skiing ([[ski ballet]]), the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] holding a televised exhibition game at the notorious [[Attica State Prison]] in upstate New York, small-time regional [[professional wrestling]] and [[roller derby]]. The television series ''[[Tim &amp; Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' (2007–2010) is a current example of camp, using inspiration from [[Public-access television]] productions, early morning [[infomercial]]s, and the use of celebrity status in [[telethon]]s and other televised charity appeals.

=== Film ===
[[File:Coca Sarli 1960s.jpg|thumb|upright|Argentine [[pop icon]] and [[sex symbol]] [[Isabel Sarli]], whose [[sexploitation film]]s made alongside [[Armando Bó]] are celebrated for their camp tone.]]
Some classic films noted for their camp tone include:
* [[John Huston]]'s ''[[Beat the Devil (1953 film)|Beat the Devil]]'' (1953, starring [[Humphrey Bogart]]), an exaggerated ''film noir'' send-up.
* Filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] directed a number of camp films such as ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972), ''[[Female Trouble]]'' (1974), ''[[Desperate Living]]'' (1977), ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981), ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' (1988), ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (1990), ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (2000) and ''[[A Dirty Shame]]'' (2004).
* Filmmaker [[Todd Solondz]] uses camp music to illustrate the absurdity and banality of bourgeois, suburban existence. In Solondz's [[cult film]] ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'' (1995), the eleven-year-old girl protagonist kisses a boy while [[Deborah Gibson]]'s "[[Lost in Your Eyes]]" plays on a [[Fisher-Price]] tape recorder.

Films such as ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1967), ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), and ''[[Burlesque (2010 musical film)|Burlesque]]'' (2010) gained camp status primarily due to the filmmakers' attempting to produce a serious film that wound up unintentionally comedic. Award-winning actresses, like [[Patty Duke]] in ''Valley of the Dolls'' and [[Faye Dunaway]] in ''Mommie Dearest'', gave such over-the-top performances that the films became camp classics, especially attracting fanfare from gay, male audiences.

The second part of the 1978 movie ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' set in fictional Metropolis takes on a campy [[Screwball comedy film|screwball]] tone after the seriousness of the origin story.

Educational and industrial films form an entire subgenre of camp films, with the most famous being the much-spoofed 1950s ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' film, in which an anthropomorphic, cartoon turtle explains how one can survive a nuclear attack by hiding under a school desk. Its British counterpart ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' could be seen as [[kitsch]], even though it is very chilling to watch (it was never shown on grounds of [[national security]] and would only be broadcast if an attack was deemed likely within 72 hours). Many British [[Public Information Film]]s gained a camp cult following, such as the famous [[Charley Says]] series. Charley's voice is performed by the camp surrealist comedian and Radio DJ [[Kenny Everett]], who came from an [[advertising]] background as a [[copywriter]].

Some films are intentionally and consciously camp, such as ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994). [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s black comedy crime film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994) has also fallen into this category, with film critic [[Nicholas Christopher]] calling it "more gangland Camp than neo-noir". In [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]] the archetypal camp film cult is the outrageous long-running, 30-film [[Carry On (film series)|''Carry On'' series]] (1958–1978). Another cult is built around ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975). ''[[Preaching to the Perverted (film)|Preaching to the Perverted]]'' (1997), written and directed by [[Stuart Urban]], broke out of traditional British comedy style to portray the fetish and [[BDSM]] scene under assault from Christian crusaders and the authorities. It portrayed both the fetish scene and the Establishment in a cartoon, stylized visual manner. Lambasted by most traditional critics, lauded by gay, music and fashion press, it went on to build a lasting cult reputation.

Movie versions of camp TV shows in recent years have made the camp nature of these shows a running gag throughout the films. In ''[[Grizzly Man]]'' (2005), a documentary by Werner Herzog, the protagonist, Timothy Treadwell, describes the wild life of bears with camp mannerisms. Inspired by the work of [[George Kuchar]] and his brother [[Mike Kuchar]], [[ASS Studios]], launched in 2011 by Courtney Fathom Sell and [[Jen Miller]], began making a series of short, no-budget camp films. Their feature film ''[[Satan, Hold My Hand]]'' (2013) features many elements recognized in camp pictures.&lt;ref&gt;filmmakermagazine.com/27295-courtney-fathom-sells-hi-8-hi...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/29016-so-you-wanna-be-an-underground-filmmaker/|title=COURTNEY FATHOM SELL: SO YOU WANNA BE AN UNDERGROUND FILMMAKER?|work=Filmmaker Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some challenge the perceived 'whiteness' of camp aesthetics, noting barriers for gender exploration in queer black communities relative to white LGBT communities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|url=|title=Nicki-aesthetics: the camp performance of Nicki Minaj|last=McMillan|first=Uri|date=2014|journal=Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uri McMillan]] identifies [[Nicki Minaj]] as a contemporary black icon of camp.

Retro-camp fashion is an example of modern [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] employing camp styles for the sake of humour. Yard decorations, popular in some parts of suburban and rural America, are examples of kitsch and are sometimes displayed as camp expressions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The classic camp yard ornament is the pink [[plastic flamingo]]. The [[yard globe]], [[garden gnome]], wooden cut-out of a fat lady bending over, the statue of a small black man holding a lantern (called a [[lawn jockey]]) and ceramic statues of [[white-tailed deer]] are also prevalent camp lawn decorations.

The [[Carvel (restaurant)|Carvel]] chain of soft-serve ice cream stores is famous for its camp style, camp low-budget TV commercials and camp ice-cream cakes such as [[Cookie Puss]] and [[Fudgie The Whale]].

== Distinguishing between kitsch and camp ==
The words "camp" and "[[kitsch]]" are often used interchangeably; both may relate to art, literature, music, or any object that carries an aesthetic value. However, "kitsch" refers specifically to the work itself, whereas "camp" is a mode of performance. Thus, a person may consume kitsch intentionally or unintentionally. Camp, as Susan Sontag observed, is always a way of consuming or performing culture "in quotation marks."&lt;ref name="Sontag2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Sontag|title=Against Interpretation and Other Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HLdQPwAACAAJ|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=2 July 2009|publisher=Penguin Modern Classics|isbn=978-0-14-119006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sontag also distinguishes the difference between "naive" and "deliberate" camp. Kitsch, as a form or style, certainly falls under the category "naive camp" as it is unaware that it is tasteless; "deliberate camp", on the other hand, can be seen as a subversive form of kitsch which deliberately exploits the whole notions of what it is to be kitsch. (Sontag, 1964)

== Around the world ==
[[File:Mika Glastonbury.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Pop singer [[Mika (singer)|Mika]] is known for his camp-styled performances]]

Thomas Hine identified 1954–1964 as the campiest period in modern US history. During this time, Americans had more money to spend, thanks to the post-war economic boom; but they often exercised poor taste. In the UK, on the other hand, camp is an adjective, often associated with a stereotypical view of [[Femininity|feminine]] gay men. The term has been in common use for many decades. Gay comedian [[Kenneth Williams]] wrote in a diary entry for 1 January 1947: "Went to Singapore with Stan—very camp evening, was followed, but tatty types so didn't bother to make overtures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Davies]] (1993) ''The Kenneth Williams Diaries'', Harper-Collins Publishers {{ISBN|978-0-00-255023-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it applies to gay men, it is a specific adjective used to describe a man that openly promotes the fact that he is gay by being outwardly garish or eccentric, for example, the character [[Daffyd Thomas]] in the English comedy skit show ''[[Little Britain]]''. "Camp" forms a strong element in UK culture, and many so-called gay-icons and objects are chosen as such because they are camp. People like [[Kylie Minogue]], [[John Inman]], [[Lawrence Llewelyn Bowen]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Mika (singer)|Mika]], [[Lesley Joseph]], [[Ruby Wax]], [[Dale Winton]], [[Cilla Black]], and the [[music hall]] tradition of the [[pantomime]] are camp elements in popular culture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The British tradition of the "[[Last Night of the Proms]]" has been said to glory in nostalgia, camp, and pastiche.&lt;ref&gt;Compare:

The Australian theatre and opera director [[Barrie Kosky]] is renowned for his use of camp in interpreting the works of the [[Western canon]] including [[Shakespeare]], [[Wagner]], [[Molière]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Kafka]] and his 2006 eight-hour production for the Sydney Theatre Company ''The Lost Echo'', based on [[Ovid]]'s ''Metamorphoses'' and [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''. In the first act ("The Song of Phaeton"), for instance, the goddess Juno takes the form of a highly stylized [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the musical arrangements feature [[Noël Coward]] and [[Cole Porter]]. Kosky's use of camp is also effectively employed to satirize the pretensions, manners, and cultural vacuity of Australia's suburban [[middle class]], which is suggestive of the style of [[Dame Edna Everage]]. For example, in ''The Lost Echo'' Kosky employs a chorus of [[Secondary school|high school]] girls and boys: one girl in the chorus takes leave from the goddess Diana, and begins to rehearse a dance routine, muttering to herself in a broad Australian accent, "Mum says I have to practise if I want to be on ''[[Australian Idol]]''." See also the works of Australian writer/director Baz Luhrmann, in particular "Strictly Ballroom".

Since 2000, the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], an annually televised competition of song performers from different countries, has shown an increased element of camp—since the contest has shown an increasing attraction within the gay communities—in their stage performances, especially during the televised finale, which is screened live across Europe. As it is a visual show, many [[Eurovision]] performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, which sometimes leads to bizarre onstage gimmicks, and what some critics have called "the Eurovision kitsch drive", with almost cartoonish novelty acts performing.

== Literature ==
The first post-World War II use of the word in print, marginally mentioned in the Sontag essay, may be [[Christopher Isherwood]]'s 1954 novel ''The World in the Evening'', where he comments: "You can't camp about something you don't take seriously. You're not making fun of it; you're making fun ''out'' of it. You're expressing what's basically serious to you in terms of fun and artifice and elegance."  In the American writer [[Susan Sontag]]'s 1964 essay "[[Notes on "Camp"|Notes on 'Camp']]", Sontag emphasized artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess as key elements of camp. Examples cited by Sontag included [[Tiffany lamp]]s, the drawings of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], Tchaikovsky's ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and Japanese science fiction films such as [[Rodan (film)|''Rodan'']], and ''[[The Mysterians]]'' of the 1950s.

In Mark Booth's 1983 book ''Camp'' he defines camp as "to present oneself as being committed to the marginal with a commitment greater than the marginal merits." He carefully discerns the distinction between genuine camp, and ''camp fads and fancies'', things that are not intrinsically camp, but display artificiality, stylization, theatricality, naivety, sexual ambiguity, tackiness, poor taste, stylishness, or portray camp people, and thus appeal to them. He considers Sontag's definition problematical because it lacks this distinction.

==Analysis==
As a cultural challenge, camp can also receive a political meaning, when minorities appropriate and ridicule the images of the dominant group, the kind of activism associated with [[multiculturalism]] and the [[New Left]]. The best known instance of this is the [[gay liberation]] movement, which used camp to confront society with its own preconceptions and their historicity.  The first positive portrayal of a gay secret agent in fiction appears in a series, ''[[The Man from C.A.M.P.]]'' in which the protagonist is, paradoxically, effeminate yet physically tough. Female camp actresses such as [[Mae West]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Joan Crawford]] also had an important influence on the development of feminist consciousness: by exaggerating certain stereotyped features of femininity, such as fragility, open emotionality or moodiness, they attempted to undermine the credibility of those preconceptions. The multiculturalist stance in cultural studies therefore presents camp as political and critical.

As a part of its adoption by the mainstream, camp has undergone a softening of its original subversive tone, and is often little more than the recognition that popular culture can also be enjoyed by a sophisticated sensibility.  Mainstream [[comic books]] and B [[Western (genre)|Western]]s, for example, have become standard subjects for academic analysis. The normalisation of the outrageous, common to many [[avant-garde|Vanguardist]] movements—has led some critics to argue the notion has lost its usefulness for critical art discourse.

According to the sociologist [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]], camp engages in a redefinition of cultural meaning through a juxtaposition of an outmoded past alongside that which is technologically, stylistically, and sartorially contemporary. Often characterized by the reappropriation of a "throwaway Pop aesthetic", camp works to intermingle the categories of "high" and "low" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects may become camp objects because of their historical association with a power now in decline. As opposed to kitsch, camp reappropriates culture in an ironic fashion, whereas kitsch is indelibly sincere. Additionally, kitsch may be seen as a quality of an object, while camp, "tends to refer to a subjective process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who identify objects as “camp” commemorate the distance mirrored in the process through which, "unexpected value can be located in some obscure or exorbitant object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of camp's irony is problematic, insofar as the agents of cultural redefinition are often of upper- or middle-class standing who could, "afford, literally, to redefine the life of consumerism and material affluence as a life of spiritual poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp-style performances may allow certain prejudices to be perpetuated by thinly veiling them as irony. Some feminist critics argue that drag queens are misogynistic because they make women seem ridiculous and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. This criticism posits that drag queens are the gay equivalent of the black and white minstrel. Some critics claim that camp comedians like Larry Grayson, Kenny Everett, Duncan Norvelle and Julian Clary perpetuate gay stereotypes and pander to homophobia. This sign of a privileged cultural position left the lower-class standing incapable of any cultural redefinition, thereby relegating them to a static position which could then only be lifted by those with enough capital.

Camp aesthetics became the curious site of personal liberation from the stranglehold of the corporate, capitalist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the capitalist environment of constant consumption, camp rediscovers history's waste, bringing back objects thought of as refuse or of bad taste. Camp liberates objects from the landfills of history and reinvokes them with a new charisma. In doing so camp creates an economy separate from that of the state. In Ross's words, camp, "is the re-creation of surplus value from forgotten forms of labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This is perhaps why camp often faces criticism from other political and aesthetic perspectives. For example, the most obvious argument is that camp is just an excuse for poor quality work and allows the tacky and vulgar to be recognized as valid art. In doing so, camp celebrates the trivial and superficial and form over content. This could be called the "yuck factor". The power of the camp object may be found in its ability to induce this reaction. In a sense objects that fill their beholders with disgust fulfill Sontag's definition of the ultimate camp statement, "it's good because it's awful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From flea markets to thrift stores, the 'bad taste' of camp has been increasingly reinculcated with the cultural capital that it had intended to break away from. In an attempt to "present a challenge to the mechanisms of control and containment that operate in the name of good taste", the camp aesthetic has fallen flat on its face and has been appropriated by artists such as [[Macklemore]] with his hit single "[[Thrift Shop]]".&lt;ref name="Ross 1989 153"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, his fame is only enjoyed at the expense of others, as Ross writes, "it [the pleasure of camp] is the result of the (hard) work of a producer of taste and 'taste' is only possible through exclusion and depreciation."&lt;ref name="Ross 1989 153" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6339">[[File:Prisme.jpg|thumb|right|White light split by a [[prism (optics)|prism]]. The additive primary colors are clearly visible.]]
There are two types of '''color mixing''': ''Additive'' and ''Subtractive''. In both cases, there are three [[primary colors]], three [[secondary colors]] (colors made from 2 of the three primary colors in equal amounts), and one tertiary color made from all three primary colors. This point is a common source of confusion, as there are different sets of primary colors depending on whether you are working with additive or subtractive mixing.

==Additive mixing==
[[File:Additive color mixing simulated.png|thumb|A simulated example of additive color mixing. Additive primaries act as sources of light.  The standard red, green, and blue combine pairwise to produce the additive secondaries cyan, magenta, and yellow. Combining all three primaries (center) produces yellow and white.]]
The additive mixing of colors is unintuitive as it does not correspond to the mixing of physical substances (such as paint) which would correspond to subtractive mixing. For instance, one can additively mix yellow and blue by shining yellow light together with blue light, which will result in not green but a white light. As in this example, one should always have the mixture of light in mind when considering additive color mixing as it is the only situation where it occurs. Despite being unintuitive, it is conceptually simpler than subtractive mixing. Two beams of light that are superimposed correspond to additive mixing.

By convention, the three primary colors in additive mixing are [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]. In the absence of color, when no colors are showing, the result is black. If all three primary colors are showing, the result is white. When red and green combine, the result is yellow. When red and blue combine, the result is magenta. When blue and green combine, the result is cyan. 

Additive mixing is used in television and computer [[Visual display unit|monitors]] to produce a wide range of colors using only three primary colors. A [[pixel]] is a juxtaposition of these three primary colors. Projection televisions typically have three projectors, one for each primary color.

==Subtractive mixing==
{{Main|Subtractive color}}
[[File:SubtractiveColorMixing.png|thumb|right|A simulated example of (idealized) subtractive color mixing.  An external source of illumination is assumed, and each primary attenuates (absorbs) some of that light.  The standard subtractive primaries cyan, magenta, and yellow combine pairwise to make subtractive secondaries red, green, and blue (which themselves are additive primaries, or in practice somewhat darker and less-saturated versions of typical additive primaries).  Combining all three primaries (center) absorbs all the light, resulting in black. For real pigments, the results would be somewhat complicated by opacity and mixing behavior, and in practice adding a fourth pigment such as black may be helpful.]]
The mixing of colored physical substances corresponds to subtractive color mixing, hence it corresponds to our intuition about mixing colors. To explain the mechanism, let us consider mixing red paint with yellow paint. The red paint is red because when the ambient light strikes it, the composition of the material is such that it absorbs all other colors in the visible spectrum except for red. The red light, not being absorbed, reflects off the paint and is what we see. This same mechanism describes the color of all material objects -- note that light is not a material object -- and so applies to the yellow paint as well. Making recourse to the figure above demonstrating additive color mixing, one sees that yellow light is composed of an (additive) mixture of red and green light. When we mix the two paints, the resulting substance has red paint and yellow paint. The yellow paint absorbs all colors except for red and green. However, the red paint will absorb the green reflected by the yellow paint. The red paint can be said to subtract the green from the yellow paint. The resulting paint reflects only red light and so appears red to our eyes. Note however that this description is theoretical and that the mixing of [[pigment]]s does not correspond to ideal subtractive color mixing because some light from the subtracted color is still being reflected by one component of the original paint. This results in a darker and desaturated color compared to the color that would be achieved with ideal filters.

The three primary colors in subtractive mixing that produce the largest [[gamut]] are [[yellow]], [[magenta]] and [[cyan]], leading to the [[CMYK color model]] widely used in color printing. Historically, painters have used [[RYB color model|yellow, red and blue]] in place of these, resulting in reduced gamut. In subtractive mixing of color, the absence of color is white and the presence of all three primary colors is black. The secondary colors are the same as the primary colors from additive mixing, and vice versa. This is not an accident. By mixing additive secondary colors subtractively one can reachieve the primary additive colors. Subtractive mixing is used to create a variety of colors when [[printing]] on paper by combining a small number of [[ink]] colors, and also when painting. Red is created by mixing magenta and yellow (removing green and blue). Green is created by mixing cyan and yellow (removing red and blue respectively). Blue is created by mixing cyan and magenta (removing red and green). Black can be approximated by mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow, although real pigments are not ideal and so pure black is nearly impossible to achieve.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12261">'''Communication Aesthetics''' was devised by [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] and [[Fred Forest]] at Mercato San Severino in Italy in 1983. It is a theory of [[aesthetics]] calling for artistic practise engaging with and working through the developments, evolutions and paradigms of late twentieth century communications technologies.  Observing the emerging supremacy of networks over subjects, it called for an artistic approach that was both adapted to, and invested in this changing techno-social arena.

==Background==

At the occasion of Artmedia, on Video Art organized by [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]], Professor of Aesthetics at the [[University of Salerno]], Fred Forest had been invited to enact a performance and installation involving the Italian National Television Broadcaster (RAI).  The ensuing encounter revealed their mutual enthusiasm and interest in the evolution of the place of art in society given then developing communications technologies.  Following an evening of intense discussion they wrote and signed a manifesto with Argentinian artist Horacio Zabala acting as witness.  From the next day onwards, they established a list of artists whose practises reflected the artistic movement they had thus established.  As a result, [[Roy Ascott]], [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Stéphan Barron]], Marc Denjean, Natan Karczmar, Jean-Claude Anglade, Mit Mitropoulos, Christian Sevette, Robert X Adrian, Jean-Marc Philippe, Wolfgang Ziemer Chrobatzek, [[Tom Klinkowstein]], Eric Gidney, Ugo la Petria, Horacio Zabala, Daniel Dewaele and Piotr Kowalski expressed their alignment with the informal international group.  [[Derrick de Kerckhove]], director of the Marshall McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the [[University of Toronto]], in direct communication with Fred Forest and [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]], then set up a Canadian group titled “Strategic Arts” responding to the same concepts and objectives and in which [[Norman White]] was involved.

Communication Aesthetics is currently intact, though for geographical reasons it is today broken up into three distinct spheres of thought, action and intercession:
* [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] holds positions and furthers action within the universities of Salerno and Naples in Italy
* while [[Fred Forest]] is active in France as professor at the [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis]] and currently the National Art School of Cergy, [[Sorbonne]] Paris 1
* and [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] upholds the North American connection as Director of the Marshall McLuhan programme at the [[University of Toronto]].

  | accessdate = 2007-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Forest outlines the purpose of Communication Aesthetics:

“Electrical, electronic and computer technology have now brought us firmly into communication society. This technology is at the heart of changes tha that have come about in social reorganization over a century, thus modifying not only our physical environment but also our mental system of representation. Electricity, electronics and computers today provide artists with new instruments of creation. The way our surroundings are being transformed in this direction a little more each day, together with our continually evolving adjustment with an ever-changing reality, is doubtless what is most important. This is why we must constantly reconsider our perceptions in order to apprehend the world in which we live.”&lt;ref name="Ibid"&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, Communication Aesthetics claims that a concomitant evolution in technologies of communication and strategies in art would have democratized (and thus demystified) the means of artistic production thus replacing the purpose of art as material production with the purpose of art as social interaction:  “the artist now intervenes directly on reality, that is to say the carries out his symbolic and aesthetic activity using different means from those he has used up to now.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;  But Communication Aesthetics pushing this position further, by calling for an interactive intervention on reality, one that plays with the spectator in both meanings of the phrase.

This play is in turn a form of power play as it questions the labelling and limitations of figures of authority.  The political ramifications of Communication Aesthetics are openly acknowledged by the founders, indeed they are called for: “In turn, the artist becomes a " social operative ", he becomes a social performer. The scaling down and the provocation of power, and its recuperation as a form of play, belong to the field of art. The responsible artist knows this power as his, and confronts the surrounding world with it.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;

The socio-political position-taking goes further still, as the artists call for the recognition of the formative as well as informative nature of technology, and particularly information technologies: “It must be admitted once and for all that the history and genesis of the configurations of the imaginary are indelibly engraved in the "technologies" upon which our perception is utterly dependent - and thus today engraved in the "technologies" of communication.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;  It is this analysis of the formal and functional aspects of communication that Communication Aesthetics calls for.

Communication Aesthetics pushes the psycho-physiological implications of technological innovations further still, elaborating on their concomitant modification of our concepts of Space and Time.  Just as the auto mobile changed our approach and experience of home and locality, so too Communication Aesthetics posited that IT innovations would change our approach to human interaction.  “The hooking-up of computers to each other, and also to other machines, is a fore-runner of the opening out of the telecommunications network and the abolition of certain constraints of distance.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;  And, once again, it is for the artist to understand and harness these modifications and constraints so as to engage with these evolutions in the name of communication:  “We can but remark that all these transformations brought about by media systems are, without our knowing it, reorganising our whole system of aesthetic representation.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;

Lastly, Communication Aesthetics engages with another more problematic implication of technological innovations, the increasing intangibility of perception and sensuality resulting from the rise of the virtual.  Indeed, far from encouraging this lapse into asociality or asensuality, Communication Aesthetics seeks to frame these emerging problems rather than shy away from them.  Once again, Communication Aesthetics seeks to lay claim to societal relevance and influence by allying communications innovations and artistic innovations on the levels both formally and functionally.

"The goal of Communication artists is certainly not to produce first level meanings, but above all to make us aware as to how, in the end, the generalised practice of Communication interreacts on the whole of our sensory system. This evolution is about to put into place the data for a " new awareness " at the edge of our perception, and then, along with new " ways of feeling ", it will open up new aesthetic paths."&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;

'''''The Couple in a Cage: Two Amerindians Visit the West''''' was a 1992-1993 performance art piece by artists [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]] and [[Coco Fusco]] for their exhibition ''The Year of the White Bear and Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West--''which toured five countries and was performing in nine different locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/760842/still-in-the-cage-thoughts-on-two-undiscovered-amerindians-20-years-later|title=Still in the Cage: Thoughts on "Two Undiscovered Amerindians," 20 Years Later|last=Fusco|first=Coco|date=2012|work=|newspaper=BlouinArtInfo|access-date=2018-06-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; First performed in honor of the [[quincentenary]] anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival to the Americas, the work sought to make visible the history of abuse, captivity and exploitation of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.walkerart.org/visualarts/2014/10/14/a-history-of-revisionism-contemporary-art-and-columbusindigenous-peoples-day/|title=A History of Revisionism: Contemporary Art and Columbus/Indigenous People’s Day|last=Lopez|first=Mia|date=October 14, 2014|work=|newspaper=Walker Art Center (Blog)|access-date=2016-12-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their inspiration drew heavily upon the history of [[othering]], the [[human zoo]], and life stories of historical figures such as [[Ota Benga]] and [[Sarah Baartman]]—beginning with the kidnapping of [[Arawak]] Indian by Columbus and his men to be displayed in the Spanish Court.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Staging and performance==
Presenting themselves as previously undiscovered Amerindians from the fictional uncolonized island of Guatinau, Fusco and Gómez-Peña presented a fabricated [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] entry on "Amerindians" and a corresponding map of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] island of Guatinau as part of the staging of their performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This information was further supplemented both by plaques or pedestals alluding to the history of peoples placed on exhibit over the last 500 years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Other texts provided also narrated their role as volunteer representatives of Guatinau, detailing the daily life activities of the Amerindians, and validating the habitat of the cage and its contents as their natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Aided by the students of the University of California-Irvine, the artists erected a cage and filled it with a ghetto blaster, candles, Polaroid camera and film, bed pans, ritual artifacts, spray paint, body paint, a television and hammock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Students and institutional staff members served as guards and assistants to the caged couple: feeding them, educating the audience about their origins, and assisting audience members in taking commemorative Polaroids with the caged performers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those acting as docents or guards also were responsible for the daily disposal of cage waste, feeding the performers, and escorting them to the bathroom on a leash.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gómez-Peña and Fusco were outfitted in primitive costumes:  designer sunglasses, a cheetah [[luchador]] mask, [[banda people|banda]] boots, face paint, long wigs, grass skirt, necklaces, a leopard bikini top and Converse low sneakers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The caged artists performed "traditional" Guatinau tasks:  watching television, sewing [[voodoo doll]]s, using a laptop computer, pacing back and forth, eating or being fed fruit, and drinking bottled water and Coca-Cola Classic.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/10/20/performance/64a5c70e-d3db-4cd6-ad7f-62596334d1b9/|title=PERFORMANCE|last=Sommers|first=Pamela|date=1992-10-20|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark contrast to works from their own practices and from other collaborations, the artists remained silent during the performances, apart from Gómez-Peña, who would recite traditional stories in a fictitious nonsensical language in return for donations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/1599/coco-fusco-and-guillermo-g-mez-pe-a|title=BOMB Magazine — Coco Fusco and Guillermo Gómez-Peña by Anna Johnson|website=bombmagazine.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the last performance, these "traditional stories" chronicled the Guatinaui tour of the West, with the nonsensical outpouring peppered with recognizable words like "Chicago", "Mexico", "Minnesota" and "America".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America|last=Chang|first=Jeff|publisher=St. Martin's Press|date=October 21, 2014|isbn=1250074894|location=New York, NY|pages=151|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contexts ==
===[[University of California-Irvine]]===
As "Take One" of ''The Year of the White Bear,'' held at the Fine Arts Gallery of UC-Irvine from February 24 - March 4, 1992, with performances held all day March 1, 2, 3 with "ritual events" at 7:30 on the 3rd and 4th&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ucisca.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/guillermo-gomez-pena-and-coco-fusco-in-1992/|title=Guillermo Gomez-Pena &amp; Coco Fusco The Year of the White Bear: Take One|last=Gomez-Pena|first=Guillermo|date=February 24, 1992|work=|access-date=October 11, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the performance the artists were contacted by the Health Department of UC-Irvine due to the misunderstanding that they were anthropologists bringing in "real aborigines" whose excrement could be hazardous.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One woman went so far as to ask for a rubber glove in order to fondle Gómez-Peña in a sexual manner.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Approximately 1,000 individuals saw these performances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== [[Plaza de Colón|Columbus Plaza]], Madrid  ===
Selected for the Edge Biennial, the artists took their performance to a much more public context in Columbus Plaza of May 1992.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Edge '92, taking place in both London and Madrid, was planned as a quincentennial celebration of Madrid as a hub of European culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Spanish businessmen reverted to childhood, mocking the performers with ape noises,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; while school children compared the performers to the wax [[Arawak]] figures housed in the museum across the street.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Teenagers also attempted to burn Gómez-Peña while handing him a beer bottle filled with urine.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Men donated to see Fusco dance, explaining that they wanted to see her breasts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; More than half of the people believed the performance to be a real display of Amerindians.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[Covent Gardens]], London ===
Three days after Madrid, the pair performed in Covent Gardens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Covent Gardens as a venue has a history as a location where people of color have been exhibited, starting from the 17th century through to the 18th century.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It was even the venue for the play [[Omai (play)|''Omai'']], inspired by the [[Omai]], a Tahitian native who embodied the idea of the [[noble savage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/the-savage-art-of-the-human-zoo/news-story/39b1994d89368a8dcad69f7161812a04|title=The savage art of the human zoo|last=Leetberg|first=Ilmar|date=2012-02-19|work=The Australian|access-date=2016-12-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the performance a group of neo-nazis attempted to rattle the cage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis ===
Exhibited as part of their show ''The Year of the White Bear'', the performance took place outside in the Sculpture Garden of the Walker Art Center in September 1992.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 15,000 visitors saw the performance and exhibition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many audience members believed the performance to be real.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is the first of two instances in which the work was clearly presented in an art context.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History]], Washington D.C. ===
On view from October 17-18th, 1992,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the performance reached approximately 120,000 visitors over a two-day period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The performance confused many museum goers who questioned the authenticity, and who were even more perplexed when docents continued to keep up the performance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One alarmed attendee even called the Humane Society to seek assistance in freeing the caged couple.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[Australian Museum]] of Natural History, Sydney ===
In December 1992 the artists performed at the Australian Museum of Natural History, with approximately 5,000 visitors; staff members here became uneasy after Japanese tourists left the museum deeply disturbed, fearing this would result in negative press for the museum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One woman sat down with her young child to loudly apologize to the performers for having "taken [their] land away".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===[[Field Museum of Natural History]], Chicago ===
From January 16–17, 1993 Gómez-Peña and Fusco performed at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, aided by Field Museum "docents" played by Paula Killen, Claire DeCoster and Pablo Helguera.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/specimens-from-the-new-world/Content?oid=881265|title=Specimens From the New World|last=Rago|first=Carmela|website=Chicago Reader|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a script written by the artists, DeCoster and Helguera encouraged the audience's questions and analysis while members of the museum's education department surveyed visitors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was a devastating experience for the docents, as they witnessed the large majority of the audience persistently ignore the plaques on either side of the cage and believe the Amerindians to be real.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Approximately 5,000 people attended, with the Field Museum receiving 48 phone calls regarding the misinformation the public believed was due to the Field Museum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== [[Whitney Biennial]], New York ===
''The Couple in the Cage: Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West'' ended its tour as a selection of the 1993 Whitney Biennial, an exhibition noted to be one of the most consciousness-raising in the history of the Biennial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artspace.com/magazine/art_101/in_focus/history_whitney_biennial-52098|title=A Brief History of the Whitney Biennial, America's Most Controversial Art Show|website=Artspace|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the traditional Guatinaui tasks Gómez-Peña and Fusco consistently performed, the artists offered views of Gómez-Peña's genitals for donations of five dollars a view, and a native dance to hip hop music for fifty cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-10/entertainment/ca-1335_1_art-world|title=ART REVIEW :  Crushed by Its Good Intentions :  Under the banner of opening up the institutional art world to expansive diversity, the Whitney Biennial has in fact perversely narrowed its scope to an almost excruciating degree.|last=KNIGHT|first=CHRISTOPHER|date=1993-03-10|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the one of the two instances in which the work was clearly presented and contextualized as artwork during the entirety of its tour.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Coco|date=1994-01-01|title=The Other History of Intercultural Performance|jstor=1146361|journal=TDR (1988-)|volume=38|issue=1|pages=143–167|doi=10.2307/1146361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some attendees assumed the artists were actors performing in a work by an artist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Criticism for ''The Couple in a Cage'' varied upon the location of the presentation, though what alarmed the artists most was the substantial public belief that their performances were reality and the substantial number of critics who critiqued their work as unethical due to its misrepresentation, rather than to fully discuss its cultural and institutional critique.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite a substantial number of intellectuals remaining critical towards the misinformation of the performances, performative scholar [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] points out that Gómez-Peña's and Fusco's were not the first to fictionalize ethnography, but rather participate inside a previously established history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|first=Barbara|year=Summer 1998|title=The Ethnographic Burlesque|url=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/bkg/web/couple.PDF|journal=The Drama Review: A Journal of Performative Studies|volume=42| issue =  2|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance gained further recognition and criticism through its participation in the 1993 Whitney Biennial; despite reflecting the political times, art critic [[Roberta Smith]] disparaged that the exhibition lost sight of art as a visual experience in its motivations to further a cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/arts/at-the-whitney-a-biennial-with-a-social-conscience.html|title=AT THE WHITNEY, A BIENNIAL WITH A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE|last=Smith|first=Roberta|date=1993-03-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark contrast to the Western response, people of color responded either in distaste due to the inauthenticity of the performance, discomfort in identifying with the experience, or solidarity in its symbolism:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"One Pueblo elder from Arizona who saw us in the Smithsonian went so far as to say that our display was more "real" than any other statement about the condition of Native peoples in the Museum." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;-Coco Fusco, ''The Other History of Intercultural Performance''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Cyprien Tokoudagba''' (1939 - 5 May 2012) was a sculptor from [[Abomey]], Benin.&lt;ref&gt;Palace Sculptures of Abomey: History Told on Walls Francesca Piqué, Leslie H. Rainer - 1999 - Page 108 "Cyprien Tokoudagba with several of his sculptures, which depict various deities and other folk figures. His art has been exhibited at the Pompidou Center in Paris.

Birgit Haehnel, Melanie Ulz - 2010 -- Page 230 "The choice of Cyprien Tokoudagba to create them speaks for itself. Cyprien Tokoudagba is as contemporary Beninese artist whose works of art are in the Pigozzi Collection as well as in many other cultural institutions around the world."&lt;/ref&gt;

He started to work as a restorer for the Abomey Museum in 1987, when he was hired to replicate the original [[bas-relief]]s that told many of Dahomey's legends and stories while celebrating the individual kings  for the new King Glelé royal palace façade, among the [[Royal Palaces of Abomey]] reconstructed by the government of Benin.

Tokoudagba continued the tradition of bas-relief though the use of cement and commercially available synthetic paint, while also producing works on canvas, frescoes and monumental sculptures. In 1989, Cyprien left Benin for the first time to exhibit at “Magiciens de la Terre” in Paris, France.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
Tokoudagba's work was exhibited at the "Ouidah '92" festival, which celebrated [[Vodun art]] from Benin and the African Diaspora in [[Ouidah]], Benin in February 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=33 |last=Rush|first=Dana |title=Contemporary Vodun Arts of Ouidah, Benin|journal=African Arts|volume=34|issue=4  |date=Winter 2001|publisher=UCLA James S.

'''Johan Didrik Frisch''' (4 May 1835, on a farm near [[Slagelse]] – 22 November 1867, [[Florence]]) was a Danish landscape and animal painter.

==Biography==
His father was a landowner. He began his education at the [[Sorø Academy]]; a private boarding school. While there, perhaps inspired by [[Frederik Vermehren]], who was a family friend, he started doing sketches.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=3747&amp;wsektion=alle Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; These drew the attention of the landscape painter [[Hans Harder]], who was sufficiently impressed that he helped him to begin his career as an artist.

After some time at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]], he went to Paris in 1857 to continue his studies.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; While there, he began to show his paintings. Originally, he depicted figures, but soon turned to landscapes, then combined the two.

By 1866, however, he had decided to devote himself to animal painting and spent a great deal of time painting en [[plein aire]] at the [[Jægersborg Dyrehave]] (Deer Park). The following year, he received a scholarship from the Academy to study in Italy. He briefly visited Rome, then went to Florence, where he took up with his fellow Danish painters, [[Otto Bache]] and  [[L.A. Schou]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; 

During a [[cholera]] epidemic later that year, he and Schou were both infected and died within days of each other.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

'''Dirty Rotten Imbeciles''' (often abbreviated, and referred to, as '''D.R.I.''') is an American [[crossover thrash]] band that formed in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] in 1982. The band is currently composed of two of its founding members, vocalist [[Kurt Brecht]] and guitarist [[Spike Cassidy]], as well as drummer Rob Rampy and bass player Greg Orr.

D.R.I. never gained a mainstream audience, but the integration of their [[hardcore punk]] roots with [[thrash metal]] influences was a stylistic catalyst for their contemporaries — most notably [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[Corrosion of Conformity]], [[Stormtroopers of Death]], the [[Cro-Mags]], [[Nuclear Assault]] and [[Cryptic Slaughter]] — alongside whom they are considered to be one of the major pioneers of what would later be called "[[crossover thrash]]", along with [[Adrenalin O.D.]], with both bands having a heavy influence on modern thrash metal.

To date, D.R.I. has released seven original studio albums. Despite having not released a studio album since ''[[Full Speed Ahead (D.R.I. album)|Full Speed Ahead]]'' in 1995, the band has continued to tour almost every year, and gone on hiatus intermittently, notably between 2004 and 2009, when Cassidy was diagnosed with colon cancer. For years, there has been talk of an eighth D.R.I. album, which has yet to materialize; however, they released an EP with new material, ''[[But Wait...There's More!]]'', on June 10, 2016.&lt;ref name="knac.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=19887 |title=D.R.I.

==History==
===Early days (1982–1986)===
The Dirty Rotten Imbeciles formed on May 2, 1982 in the city of [[Houston]], from the ashes of the hardcore punk band Suburbanites. The original line-up consisted of [[Spike Cassidy]] on guitar, [[Kurt Brecht]] on vocals, Eric Brecht on drums and Dennis Johnson on bass guitar, which was basically the Suburbanites with Cassidy on guitar. Cassidy's roommate played guitar in the Suburbanites.

The group started practicing at Kurt and Eric's parents' home. The noise made by the band allegedly drew regular complaints from Kurt and Eric's father. This led to the band gaining their name when they were described as a "bunch of dirty rotten imbeciles." This was also an inspiration for the song "Madman," which featured a clip of Kurt and Eric's father interrupting a band practice to complain about the noise. They initially went under the name U.S.D.R.I for a brief period of time before shortening it to D.R.I. Presumably, the "U.S." stood for the band, as mentioned in interviews off of the extended version on the ''Dirty Rotten CD.'' You can find photos of the band with the U.S.D.R.I logo. The "Skanker Man" logo was designed by original drummer Eric Brecht as a [[high school]] art assignment to create a "corporate" logo. He received an "A" on it. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Two months later, on July 2, 1982, the band played their first show at Joe Star's OMNI, in Houston.

On November 6 &amp; 7, 1982, D.R.I. recorded their first release, the ''Dirty Rotten EP'', fitting 22 songs into 18 minutes on a 7" EP. Only 1000 copies of this EP version were pressed, making it now a very rare collector's item. Demand caused this EP to be pressed into a 12" LP version, released in 1983, aptly titled ''[[Dirty Rotten LP]]''.

In 1983, D.R.I. relocated to San Francisco, where they lived in their van and ate at soup kitchens in between gigs. Dennis Johnson quit the band and returned home to Texas. He was replaced with Sebastion Amok, and within a few months D.R.I. found themselves on the "Rock Against [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]" tour with the [[Dead Kennedys]]. At the conclusion of the tour, Josh Pappe was brought in to replace Sebastian Amok who would eventually join [[The Dicks]], another Texas band.

Their next release was the 4 song 7" EP ''[[Violent Pacification]]'' in 1984. After touring in the summer of 1984, Eric Brecht got married and left the band. He was replaced with at the time, a 17-year-old Felix Griffin. Also in 1984, one of their songs, "Snap" appeared on the anti-war benefit compilation ''P.E.A.C.E.'' along with other famous hardcore and punk bands such as [[Crass]], [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], Dead Kennedys and [[MDC (band)|MDC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/comps/peace.html|title=KFTH - P.E.A.C.E. Compilation 2xLP|website=Homepages.nyu.edu|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D.R.I.'s second full-length release, ''[[Dealing with It!|Dealing With It]]'', came in March 1985. The group toured extensively in support of the album. During the recording of the album, Josh took a leave from the band. Mikey Offender (bass player of The Offenders) was asked to play for the album, although Spike played bass on the songs that Mikey didn't have time to learn.

The songs on ''Dealing With It'' leaned slightly towards a metal direction, but still kept the band's [[thrashcore]] sound.

On April 26, 1986, they recorded their show at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles and released the video, which was entitled ''Live at the Olympic''.

===Crossover thrash period (1987–1996)===
When Felix joined D.R.I. in 1984 he brought a new audience to the shows. The next three years the band toured and started developing a new genre, (along with other pioneers) [[crossover thrash|crossover]]. Their third album, ''[[Crossover (Dirty Rotten Imbeciles album)|Crossover]]'', released in 1987, was suitingly named since the songs on this album had a strong metal sound to them. As the band began to "crossover" to thrash, their songs became longer, slower, and more complex. The press has called D.R.I. the major band of the "[[crossover thrash|crossover]]" movement, a style that combined [[hardcore punk]] and [[thrash metal]]. This music invited a mixed audience of [[Punk Rock Movement|punks]], [[skinhead]]s, and [[Heavy Metal Subculture|metal fans]] to their shows.

The ''Live At The Ritz'' video was recorded next, on June 27, 1987, at The Ritz in New York, during the band's worldwide Crossover tour.

In February 1988, the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles returned to the studio to record ''[[4 of a Kind]]''. The songs on this album continued in the band's metal style. They released a music video for the song "Suit and Tie Guy", and the ''Dirty Rotten LP'' was remixed to include the songs from the ''Violent Pacification EP'', and was re-released.

The band toured Europe again to support the ''4 of a Kind'' album, then once home in the U.S., Josh Pappe left the band because of an offer to play for [[Gang Green]]. He was replaced by John Menor.

September 1989 brought the release of ''[[Thrash Zone]]''. Two music videos were released from this album, "Beneath the Wheel" and "Abduction". In 1990, Felix Griffin left the group and was replaced by Rob Rampy.

During early 1992, ''[[Definition (album)|Definition]]'' was released on Rotten Records. A music video was released for the song "Acid Rain". The video would later be featured in an episode of MTV's [[Beavis and Butt-Head|Beavis and Butthead]].

D.R.I. toured in 1992, opening for [[Testament (band)|Testament]], as well as headlining their own shows. During this tour, they recorded their gig at the Hollywood Palladium on November 27. It was released in 1994 as their first live album, appropriately entitled ''Live''. It was, more or less, "released as a stepping stone between ''Definition'' and ''[[Full Speed Ahead (D.R.I. album)|Full Speed Ahead]]''". Soon after recording the show, John Menor left D.R.I. and was replaced by the band's long time friend and roadie, Chumly Porter.

The group took part in headlining the Lolitabazooka Tour, in the fall of 1994.

In 1995, D.R.I. released ''Full Speed Ahead''. They also made another music video, this time for a song called "Syringes In The Sandbox".

In January 1996, they started touring North America with [[Acid Bath]] opening for them. But in April, Rob and Spike ran into some trouble trying to enter Canada because they had both been previously charged with driving under the influence in the U.S. This resulted in the cancellation of all their Canadian tour dates.

===Touring (1997–2005)===
During 1997 and 1998, D.R.I. continued to tour the world extensively, including European &amp; South American dates. In March 1998, D.R.I. launched their official web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.DirtyRottenImbeciles.com|title=D.R.I. (DIRTY ROTTEN IMBECILES) Official Website|website=Dirtyrottenimbeciles.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1999, D.R.I. appeared as one of the headlining bands on the "Social Chaos" in North America Tour. One of their songs, "I'm The Liar", is used for a Social Chaos Tour CD compilation. The CD contained one song from each band that appeared on the tour. During August 1999, in the middle of the tour, Chumly left the band after tiring of touring. He was replaced by Harald Oimoen. Oimoen had been working on and off with the band for years, doing everything from photography and merchandise to bass tech. The band resumed the tour missing only two shows.

The turn of the millennium saw the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles headline the "Millennium 2000 Tour".

The constant cycle of touring continued into 2001 with D.R.I. extensively touring the US on the "Old School Tour” culminating in a headlining appearance at the Milwaukee Metal Fest.

2002 marks D.R.I.'s 20th anniversary and the beginning of a new era for the band. D.R.I. signed with Beer City records agreeing to reissue their back catalog and a produce new studio CDs and DVDs.

To celebrate both of these occasions, DRI embarked on a huge world tour. This tour went all over the US, Japan, Europe and South America into 2003.

The first Beer City reissue came out in 2003. The ''Dirty Rotten CD'' featured the original full length ''[[Dirty Rotten LP]]'' and the ''[[Violent Pacification]]'' 7” EP as well as a number of never before released bonus tracks and interviews. Included within the bonus tracks were live recordings of D.R.I.’s first show ever and live computer video footage from the band's only performance at New York's famous [[CBGB]]’s from the 1984 "Violent Pacification" tour.

2003 also brought the second Beer City reissue for ''[[Dealing with It!|Dealing With It]]''. This CD contains the original album plus rare and never before heard bonus tracks as well as live video footage. The footage is from a mid 80’s interview from a San Francisco [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] show.

D.R.I. embarked on yet another tour in 2004 that would take them all over the US and all over Europe again. After completing the tour, they decided it was time to start working with Beer City on the ''Live At CBGB’s'' CD and DVD and the reissue of the ''[[Crossover (Dirty Rotten Imbeciles album)|Crossover]]'' album. The ''Live At CBGB’s'' DVD and CD was reissued and is available on Beer City Records.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020526055351/http://www.beercityrecords.com/] &lt;/ref&gt;
The reissue of ''Crossover'' was delayed due to Spike's illness (see below).

While touring in Europe in April 2004, D.R.I. demoed four new songs for their follow-up to ''[[Full Speed Ahead (D.R.I. album)|Full Speed Ahead]]''. No official title and release date have been set. One out of four of the demos, "Against Me", was to be found for downloading at the "record news" from their official web site. The track is at present unavailable.

===Hiatus, recovery of Spike Cassidy and continued touring (2006–2013)===
In March 2006, Spike was diagnosed with colon cancer, putting the band's current tour and future performances on hiatus until his recovery. Plans to release a new studio LP are also on hold until Spike has recovered.

In December 2006, Spike had completed all radiation and chemotherapy after being diagnosed with cancer in March 2006. A one-foot section of large intestine (colon) was removed through an eight-inch (20&amp;nbsp;cm) incision in his stomach. The surgery, which took place on March 27, 2006 was said to be successful in removing all traces of the cancer. His rehabilitation is going well and he is expected to make a full recovery.  The official website states Cassidy to be cancer free as of August 2008.&lt;ref name="dirtyrottenimbeciles.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dirtyrottenimbeciles.com/news.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913183718/http://www.dirtyrottenimbeciles.com/news.htm |archivedate=2008-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spike Cassidy]] commented on his return to the stage “I am very happy D.R.I. will be playing again, it has been far too long. We are currently setting up weekends to test the water and rebuild the stamina that we were known for. We all look forward to restarting up exactly where we left off."

D.R.I. is known for their high energy performances and their nonstop touring. Cassidy also adds “Right now it is 2 &amp; 3 day weekends until 2010, followed by some international work. We really are planning to be able to do a 4 week tour by late summer 2010."&lt;ref name="dirtyrottenimbeciles.com"/&gt;

April 13, 2010 Beer City records reissued ''Crossover - Millennium Edition'' on LP and CD. Finally after many years ''[[Crossover (Dirty Rotten Imbeciles album)|Crossover]]'' was once again available. This reissue was remastered by the original co-producer/engineer Bill Metoyer. This release also contains liner notes by all the band members who played on this release ([[Spike Cassidy]], [[Kurt Brecht]], Felix Griffin and Josh Pappe). The CD version also contains 11 bonus tracks including 5 songs from their famous performance at NYC 'The Ritz'.

June 15, 2010 Beer City records reissues ''The Dirty Rotten EP'', ''[[Dirty Rotten LP|The Dirty Rotten LP]]'', ''[[Violent Pacification]]'' 7" and ''[[Dealing with It!|Dealing With It]]'' on vinyl. All of these releases had been out of print on vinyl now for a very long time. The LP's were issued on red vinyl and both 7"s were issued on 5 colors of vinyl.

In 2011, D.R.I. went on a tour of the US, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenjunderground.com/blog/2010/12/22/dri-announce-2011-tour-dates-playing-starland-ballroom-the-t.html|title=D.R.I. announce 2011 tour dates.

===''But Wait...There's More!'' and lineup changes (2014–present)===
D.R.I. entered a Southern California studio in October 2014 to begin record an EP containing new material.&lt;ref name="newEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dirty-rotten-imbeciles-d-r-i-to-enter-studio-in-october/ |title=Dirty Rotten Imbeciles (D.R.I.) To Enter Studio In October |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=2014-09-11 |accessdate=2014-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by Bill Metoyer,&lt;ref name="newEP"/&gt; who produced the band's third, fourth and fifth studio albums ''[[Crossover (Dirty Rotten Imbeciles album)|Crossover]]'', ''[[4 of a Kind]]'' and ''[[Thrash Zone]]''. Vocalist [[Kurt Brecht]] has described the EP as "more punk rock than metal".&lt;ref name="newEP"/&gt; The EP, titled ''[[But Wait...There's More!]]'', was released on June 10, 2016.&lt;ref name="knac.com"/&gt;

On September 17, 2014, it was announced that Rob Rampy had departed from the band, citing serious injury as the reason. He was then replaced by Brandon Karns, who subsequently left the band shortly thereafter. Karns was then replaced by Walter "Monsta" Ryan. However, Rampy re-joined D.R.I in 2018. In 2017, the band parted ways with their longtime bassist Harald Oimoen, who was replaced by Greg Orr (ex Attitude Adjustment).

While the band has yet to release their first full-length studio album since 1995's ''[[Full Speed Ahead (D.R.I. album)|Full Speed Ahead]]'', they embarked on a series of world tours from 2016 to 2018 in support of ''But Wait...There's More!''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dirtyrottenimbeciles.com/tour.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dirtyrottenimbeciles.com/tour-archive.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright infringement==
The band's record company, Rotten Records, filed in the United States District Court for the District of 
Massachusetts.  Rotten Records is suing a Comcast user who allegedly downloaded and shared their sixth album.  According to the lawsuit, Rotten Records hired Rightscorp to monitor BitTorrent networks for infringement. The company claims it connected to the defendants’ BitTorrent clients and downloaded a full copy of the album, later verifying that they were identical to the original copyright works.  “Rightscorp sent Defendant 288 notices via their ISP Comcast Cable Communications, Inc. from December 14, 2014 to May 12, 2015 demanding that Defendant stop illegally distributing Plaintiff’s work. Defendant ignored each and every notice and continued to illegally distribute Plaintiff’s work,” the complaint reads.  Rotten Records demands an injunction forbidding further online infringement in both cases in addition to the deletion of both albums from each Comcast user’s computer.  The record label also wants statutory damages (potentially $150K per work if any infringement is deemed willful) plus attorneys’ fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-users-sued-after-ignoring-piracy-notices-150516/|title=Comcast Users Sued After Ignoring Piracy Notices - TorrentFreak|date=16 May 2015|website=Torrentfreak.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and influence==
D.R.I.'s music has combined elements of [[punk rock]], [[thrash metal]], [[speed metal]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], while their early material has been described as [[hardcore punk]]. They are often cited as one of the key bands that helped create the [[crossover thrash]] genre, along with [[Stormtroopers of Death|S.O.D.]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]] and [[Corrosion of Conformity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullinbloommusic.com/dri-biography-dirty-rotten-imbeciles-band.html|title=D.R.I. - Biography - Dirt Rotten Imbeciles - DRI - Crossover Thrash - Kurt Brecht - Spike Cassidy|website=Fullinbloommusic.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exitfest.org/en/blog/milan-rakic/legendary-dri-explosive-2012 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513212636/http://www.exitfest.org/en/blog/milan-rakic/legendary-dri-explosive-2012 |archivedate=2016-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllMusic|Allmusic.com]] has claimed that, "Starting off as a speedy, straight-ahead punk band, they gradually mixed more elements of heavy metal into their sound; as they did so, their songs got longer and featured more sections and more variety in tempo. D.R.I. managed the then-rare feat of crossing over to metal audiences while retaining their skatepunk and hardcore fan bases -- they had something for all those audiences to love (or hate)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dri-mn0000786360/biography|title=D.R.I. - Biography &amp; History|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:0 Galata Morente - Musei Capitolini (1).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''The Dying Galatian''&lt;ref name="Capitoline Museums" /&gt; is a Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic]] work of the late 3rd century BC. [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome.]]

'''''The Dying Gaul''''', also called '''''The Dying Galatian'''''&lt;ref name="Capitoline Museums"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of the Galatian|url=http://en.museicapitolini.org/collezioni/percorsi_per_sale/palazzo_nuovo/sala_del_gladiatore|author=Capitoline Museums|quote=The centre of the room features the so-called "Dying Galatian", one of the best-known and most important works in the museum. It is a replica of one of the sculptures in the ex-voto group dedicated to Pergamon by Attalus I to commemorate the victories over the Galatians in the III and II centuries BC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Galata Morente'') or '''''The Dying Gladiator''''', is an [[Roman art|Ancient Roman]] [[marble]] copy of a lost [[Hellenistic]] sculpture, thought to have been originally executed in [[bronze sculpture|bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Helbig, ''Führer durch die öffentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Altertümer in Rom'' (Tubingen 1963-71) vol. II, pp 240-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The original may have been commissioned some time between 230 and 220 BC by [[Attalus I]] of [[Pergamon]] to celebrate his victory over the [[Galatians (People)|Galatians]], the [[Celts|Celtic]] or [[Gaul]]ish people of parts of [[Anatolia]] (modern [[Turkey]]).  The identity of the sculptor of the original is unknown, but it has been suggested that [[Epigonus]], a court sculptor of the [[Attalid dynasty]] of Pergamon, may have been the creator.

The copy was most commonly known as ''The Dying Gladiator'' until the 20th century on the assumption that it depicted a wounded gladiator in a Roman amphitheatre.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Beauchamp Walters, ''The Art of the Greeks'', The Macmillan Company, 1906, p.130 notes that it is still most commonly called that because of the popularity of Byron's description.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars had identified it as a Gaul or Galatian by the mid-19th century, but it took many decades for the new title to achieve popular acceptance.

==Description==
The white marble statue which may have originally been painted depicts a wounded, slumping [[Celt]] with remarkable realism and [[pathos]], particularly as regards the face. A bleeding sword puncture is visible in his lower right chest. The figure is represented as a Celtic warrior with characteristic hairstyle and moustache and has a [[torc]] around his neck. He lies on his fallen shield while his sword, belt, and a curved trumpet lie beside him. The sword hilt bears a lion head. The present base was added after its 17th-century rediscovery.

==Discovery and expatriation==
[[File:Dying Gaul-Musei CapitoliniI-2.jpg|thumb|right|Back of the sculpture.]]
''The Dying Galatian'' is thought to have been rediscovered in the early 17th century during some excavations for the foundations of the [[Villa Ludovisi]], then a suburban villa in [[Rome]]. It was first recorded in a 1623 inventory of the collections of the powerful [[Ludovisi (family)|Ludovisi family]]. The villa was built in the area of the ancient [[Gardens of Sallust]] where, when the Ludovisi property was built over in the late 19th century, many other antiquities were discovered,&lt;ref&gt;Haskell and Penny 1981:224 provide the history of this sculpture.&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the "[[Ludovisi Throne]]". By 1633 it was in the Ludovisi Palazzo Grande on the [[Pincio]]. [[Pope Clement XII]] acquired it for the [[Capitoline Museums|Capitoline collections]]. It was then taken by Napoleon's forces under the terms of the [[Treaty of Tolentino]], and displayed with other Italian works of art in the [[Louvre Museum]] until 1816, when it was returned to Rome.

==Portrayal of Celts==

The statue serves both as a reminder of the Celts' defeat, thus demonstrating the might of the people who defeated them, and a memorial to their bravery as worthy adversaries. The statue may also provide evidence to corroborate ancient accounts of the fighting style—[[Diodorus Siculus]] reported that "Some of them have iron breastplates or chainmail while others fight naked".&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus in Stephen Allen (Author), Wayne Reynolds (Illustrator), ''Celtic Warrior: 300 BCE – 100 CE'' (Osprey: 25 April 2001), {{ISBN|1-84176-143-5}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M1RopeW8XQ4C&amp;pg=PA22 p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polybius]] wrote an evocative account of Galatian tactics against a Roman army at the [[Battle of Telamon]] of 225 BC:

{{blockquote|The [[Insubres]] and the [[Boii]] wore trousers and light cloaks, but the [[Gaesatae]], in their love of glory and defiant spirit, had thrown off their garments and taken up their position in front of the whole army naked and wearing nothing but their arms... The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.|Polybius, ''Histories'' II.28}}

The Roman historian [[Livy]] recorded that the Celts of [[Asia Minor]] fought naked and their wounds were plain to see on the whiteness of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History'' XXII.46 and XXXVIII.21&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] regarded this as a foolish tactic:{{blockquote|Our enemies fight naked. What injury could their long hair, their fierce looks, their clashing arms do us? These are mere symbols of barbarian boastfulness.|Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''History of Rome'' XIV.9}}
[[File:Dying GaulDSCF6738.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Detail showing the face, hair style and torc of the sculpture.]]
The depiction of this particular Galatian as naked may also have been intended to lend him the dignity of [[heroic nudity]] or [[pathos|pathetic]] nudity. It was not infrequent for Greek warriors to be likewise depicted as heroic nudes, as exemplified by the [[Temple of Aphaea#Pedimental sculptures|pedimental sculptures of the Temple of Aphaea]] at [[Aegina]]. The message conveyed by the sculpture, as [[H. W. Janson]] comments, is that "they knew how to die, barbarians that they were".&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Janson, "History of Art: A survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day", p. 141. H. N. Abrams, 1977. {{ISBN|0-13-389296-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Dying Galatian'' became one of the most celebrated works to have survived from antiquity and was engraved&lt;ref&gt;First by François Perrier, ''Segmenta nobilium signorum et statuarum que temporis dentem invidium evase'' (Rome and Paris 1638) plate 91 (noted by Haskell and Penny 225 and note 15).&lt;/ref&gt; and endlessly copied by artists, for whom it was a classic model for depiction of strong emotion, and by sculptors.  It shows signs of having been repaired, with the head seemingly having been broken off at the neck, though it is unclear whether the repairs were carried out in Roman times or after the statue's 17th century rediscovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kim J. Hartswick, ''The Gardens of Sallust: a Changing Landscape'', p. 107. University of Texas Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  As discovered, the [[proper left]] leg was in three pieces.  They are now pinned together with the pin concealed by the left kneecap. The Gaul's "spiky" hair is a 17th-century reworking of longer hair found as broken upon discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grout|first=James|title=The Dying Gaul|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/museums/dyinggaul.html|work=Encyclopædia Romana|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|accessdate=16 December 2013|location=[[Chicago, IL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the statue was widely interpreted as representing a defeated [[gladiator]], rather than a Galatian warrior. Hence it was known as the 'Dying' or 'Wounded Gladiator', 'Roman Gladiator', and '[[Murmillo]] Dying'. It has also been called the 'Dying Trumpeter', because one of the scattered objects lying beside the figure is a horn.

The artistic quality and expressive [[pathos]] of the statue aroused great admiration among the educated classes in the 17th and 18th centuries and was a "must-see" sight on the [[Grand Tour]] of Europe undertaken by young men of the day.  [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] was one such visitor, commemorating the statue in his poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'':
 
{{quotation|
I see before me the gladiator lie&lt;br&gt;
He leans upon his hand—his manly brow&lt;br&gt;
Consents to death, but conquers agony,&lt;br&gt;
And his drooped head sinks gradually low—&lt;br&gt;
And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow&lt;br&gt;
From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one...&lt;ref&gt;Byron, ''Childe Harold'', Canto IV (1818), stanzas 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was widely copied, with kings,&lt;ref&gt;A plaster cast was made for the King of Spain in 1650, and a marble copy by [[Michel Monnier]] for Louis XIV remains at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] (Haskell and Penny 1981:22).&lt;/ref&gt; academics and wealthy landowners&lt;ref&gt;A black marble copy for the Duke of Northumberland is in the entrance hall of [[Syon House]], designed by [[Robert Adam]]; there are copies in several gardens in England, including [[Rousham]], Oxfordshire (by [[Peter Scheemakers]], 1743, according to [[Rupert Gunnis]], ''[[Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660–1851]]'', rev.ed. 1968, ''s.v.'' "Scheemakers, Peter") and [[Wilton House]], Wiltshire (Simon Vierpyl, before 1769).&lt;/ref&gt; commissioning their own reproductions of the ''Dying Gaul''. [[Thomas Jefferson]] wanted the original or a reproduction at [[Monticello]].&lt;ref name=Kennicott /&gt; The less well-off could purchase copies of the statue in miniature for use as ornaments and paperweights.  Full-size plaster copies were also studied by art students.

It was requisitioned by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] by terms of the [[Treaty of Campoformio]] (1797) during his [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1796#Italy|invasion of Italy]] and taken in triumph to [[Paris]], where it was put on display. The piece was returned to Rome in 1816.&lt;ref name=Kennicott&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|title=Dying Gaul on view at National Gallery of Art|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/dying-gaul-on-view-at-national-gallery-of-art/2013/12/12/90ea4760-6358-11e3-91b3-f2bb96304e34_story.html|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=12 December 2013|location=[[Washington, DC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 12, 2013 until March 16, 2014 the work was on display in the main rotunda of the west wing of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington D.C.]].  This temporary tenure marked the first time the antiquity had left Italy since it was returned in the second decade of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Kennicott /&gt;&lt;!--in the [[Capitoline Museums]].--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15822">'''Everyday Aesthetics''' is a recent subfield of philosophical [[aesthetics]] focusing on everyday events, settings and activities in which the faculty of [[sensibility]] is saliently at stake. [[Alexander Baumgarten]] established Aesthetics as a discipline and defined it as ''scientia cognitionis sensitivae'', the science of sensory knowledge, in his foundational work ''Aesthetica'' (1750).&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/aestheticascrip00baumgoog&lt;/ref&gt; This field has been dedicated since then to the clarification of [[fine arts]], [[beauty]] and [[taste]] only marginally referring to the aesthetics in [[design]], [[crafts]], urban environments and social practice until the emergence of everyday aesthetics during the ‘90s. As other subfields like environmental aesthetics or the [[aesthetics of nature]], everyday aesthetics also attempts to countervail aesthetics' almost exclusive focus on the philosophy of art.

== Grounding aesthetics in experience ==

Aesthetic inquiry on everyday life owes much of its approach to [[John Dewey]]’s (1934) pragmatist aesthetics, even if he was interested in grounding mainly artistic experience. Dewey pointed at a variety of circumstances in which sensibility is present emphasizing the importance of feeling, energy, and rhythm in every creature’s intercourse with its environment. He thus stressed not only the artistic but the everyday doings and undergoings that involve alertness and intensity of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John ''Art as Experience'' (New York: Perigee,1934)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey explored aesthetics from the subjects' experience rather than from objects' status as artworks and museum collections. This turn would allow overcoming object-centric approaches to aesthetics that hindered any consideration of the aesthetic beyond artistic and beautiful things justifiable by intrinsic qualities categorized as aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Updating Dewey’s pragmatism, [[Richard Shusterman]] validates aesthetic experience and emphasizes the role of the body in what he defines as ''soma-aesthetics'' also related to everyday life. C.F. Shusterman, Richard ''Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics'' ( Cambridge University Press 2008). See also Shusterman, Richard. 1992. ''Pragmatist Aesthetics: Living Beauty, Rethinking Art''. Cambridge: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social dimension of everyday aesthetics ==

The neglect of aesthetic theory to consider the role of sensibility in everyday life was first pointed out by [[Katya Mandoki]] who in 1994 coined the word '''''Prosaics'''''&lt;ref&gt;Mandoki Katya, ''Prosaica; introducción a la estética de lo cotidiano'' (México: Grijalbo, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing a distinction from [[Aristotle]]’s '''''Poetics'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[Poetics (Aristotle)]]&lt;/ref&gt; focused on art) to denote a sub-discipline that would specifically inquire the aesthetics involved in daily activities emphasizing the styles and forms of expression in [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] and context determined interactions. Prosaics or the theory of everyday aesthetics analyzes in this and subsequent texts the social conventions on what is considered acceptable or not by implicit standards of taste in each institutional setting (school, family, religion, politics, artworld, medical practice, sports). Six books and several articles i.e. ''Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture'' (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Mandoki Katya, ''Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ''Estética cotidiana y juegos de la cultura: Prosaica I'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2006,  ''Prácticas estéticas e identidades sociales: Prosaica II'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2006), ''La construcción estética del Estado y de la identidad nacional: Prosaica III'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2007), ''Estética y comunicación; de acción, pasión y seducción'' (Bogotá: Norma, 2007), “Quotidian Aesthetics” ''New Perspectives in Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art. Annales d’ esthétique''. Volume 42/2003-2004. Athens: Panayotis and Effie Michelis Foundation. Pp. 103-110. ISSN 1105-0462. "L'esthétique du quotidien"  ''Diogène'' 2011/1-2 (n° 233-234). [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/ca/7523862.0008.004?rgn=main;view=fulltext]
&lt;/ref&gt; consistently analyze the wide spectrum of the non-artistic within personal and collective experience. The role of the aesthetic is examined through symbolic interaction, identity negotiation and dramaturgical performance to produce specific sensitive effects and impact upon sensibility. As a multi-sensorial phenomenon, prosaics pays attention to the whole range of sensorial display for affecting participants' sensibility (body language, the visual, setting and props, intonation and styles of language) and not only sight and hearing as has been customary in aesthetics.

== Political dimension, violence and negativity in everyday aesthetics ==

An approach to everyday aesthetics involves both the positive and negative, the enriching and the toxic effects operating on sensibility. Joseph H. Kupfer brought to the attention of aesthetic inquiry the importance of focusing on the effects of violence and ultraviolence in modern society. Kupfer makes explicit the aesthetic ground of violence in society and emphasizes destruction as an aesthetic process producing vivid sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Kupfer Joseph H., ''Experience as Art: Aesthetics in Everyday Life'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; He highlighted also the need of incorporating aesthetics to education not only by means of teaching art but aesthetically, i.e. in the manner itself of educating through the rhythm, organization of subject matter, and method of presentation to engage students with the content of study.  Mandoki points at the negative use of aesthetics for manipulating emotions in the political sphere and refers to Nazi propaganda as a case in point that exemplifies the deliberate use of aesthetics for exerting violence.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Mandoki, "Terror and Aesthetics: Nazi Strategies for Mass Organisation," in Fascism: Critical Concepts in Political Science, vol. III, Fascism and Culture, Part 7: Fascism as the Negation or Revolution of Culture, ed. Roger Griffin (New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 21-38.return to text&lt;/ref&gt; The utilization of aesthetics for political agendas, specifically in the legitimation of the nation-state is dealt by this author.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Mandoki, ''La construcción estética del estado y de la identidad nacional''. (Mexico: Siglo veintiuno editores, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Berleant]] has stressed the negative aspect of everyday aesthetics pointing at the importance of the aesthetic impact of terrorism as well as the use of aesthetics in the political sphere. Berleant brings up other extreme situations that provoke perceptual injury or damage as contemporary urban overcrowding and visual over stimulation, space pollution, claustrophobic and oppressive conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Berleant, Arnold ''Sensibility and Sense; The aesthetic transformation of the human world'' ( Imprint Academic 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; For Berleant, aesthetics implies active, intense aesthetic engagement and is thus involved in both positive and negative effects of everyday contemporary urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;Berleant, Arnold. 1991. Art and Engagement. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Berleant aesthetics of the environment has been a sustained object of research for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Berleant The Aesthetics of Environment (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1992. Paperback edition, 1994). Greek trans., (Athens: Michelis Institute, 2004). Chinese trans. (Hunan Publishing Group, 2006). {{ISBN|978-1-56639-084-2}}.

Arnold Berleant ''Living in the Landscape: Toward an Aesthetics of Environment'' (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1970, he has insisted on the importance of aesthetics as a field of experience and active engagement in which our quality of life depends.&lt;ref&gt;The Aesthetic Field: A Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience (Springfield, Ill.: C.

== Beauty in daily life, environmental aesthetics and artification ==
[[Yi-Fu Tuan]] proposed that we should apply the traditional aesthetic categories of beauty, contemplation, disinterestedness, and distancing in valuing daily life through different non artistic objects and locations.[http://www.yifutuan.org/]&lt;ref&gt;Tuan Yi–Fu ''Passing Strange and Wonderful; Aesthetics, Nature and Culture'' (New York, Tokyo, London: Kodansha 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1974 he insisted on the need of paying due attention to the environment as object of aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Tuan,Yi–Fu. ''Topophilia; A Study of Environmental Perception, Attitudes and Values''(Englewood Cliff, N.J.: Prentice Hall 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  Along this line Crispin Sartwell also proposed in 1995 applying aesthetics to life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sartwell, Crispin ''The Art of Living: Aesthetics of the Ordinary in World Spiritual Traditions''. (Albany: State University of New York Press 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Yuriko Saito, an environmentalist aesthetician specializing in Japanese aesthetics, argues for paying attention to weather as worthy of aesthetic appreciation and for making moral and aesthetic judgments on everyday artifacts, landscapes, lawns, and neighborhood eyesores&lt;ref&gt;[[Eyesore]]&lt;/ref&gt; that are conflicting with the harmony of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, Yuriko. 2008. ''Everyday Aesthetics''. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Saito advocates a self-critical artification of everyday life and warns about the risks of artificating business.[http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=640] Paulina Rautio has performed qualitative analysis by interviews and epistolary exchange with women in regards to their experience of beauty through non artistic items and their contexts such as hanging laundry in Lapland where the opportunity of drying clothes under the sun is rare.&lt;ref&gt;Rautio, Pauliina, Rautio, P. (2010). Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives. ''Journal of Aesthetic Education'', Vol 44, No4, Rautio, P. (2009). On hanging laundry. The place of beauty in managing everyday life. Contemporary Aesthetics, Vol 7, No9.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a common interest in this approach for understanding aesthetics as a theory of art and beauty following traditional categories and at the same time attempting to go beyond conventional borders of art by artificating the non art and extending its scope to everyday objects, environments and to living itself. That is the case of Horacio Pérez-Henao who tries to interpret literature under the scope of everyday aesthetics by pointing out how fictional characters experience aesthetics into their daily lives &lt;ref&gt;Pérez-Henao, Horacio. “Estética cotidiana y ficción: el clima como elemento
de significación en la novela Pequod de Vitor Ramil”. Anclajes XX. 1 (enero-abril
2016): 20-34.

== Sports and food as art ==

Every work of art has, since the Renaissance, tried to expand themes worthy of artistic expression and concepts of artistic value to include new subject matters, techniques and styles in painting and sculpture, new harmonies, consonances or dissonances in music, new attitudes, gestures, and different genres and requirements of quality. However the initiative of applying the concept of art literally to non artistic activities within a theoretical framework related to everyday aesthetics came from philosophers like David Best, Wolfgang Welsch and Lev Kreft proposing to consider sports as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;Best, David. 1988. “The Aesthetic in Sport,” in ''Philosophic Inquiry in Sport'', ed. William J. Morgan and Klaus V. Meier. Champaign: Human Kinetics Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welsch, Wolfgang "Sport–Viewed Aesthetically, and Even as Art?" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreft, Lev "Aesthetics of the beautiful game" ''Soccer &amp; Society'' 2012: 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist aestheticians are also advocating for the inclusion of other senses beyond the two traditional sight and hearing, as in taste ([[Carolyn Korsmeyer]]) and smell (Emily Brady), that can render aesthetic experiences in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Emily "Sniffing and Savoring: The Aesthetics of Smells and Tastes" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press 2005); Korsmeyer, Carolyn ''Making Sense of Taste: Food &amp; Philosophy'' (New York: Cornell University Press 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
Carolyn Korsmeyer, M. Quinet and Glenn Kuehn argue for including food among aesthetically relevant objects and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Quinet, M.L. 1981. “Food as Art: The Problem of Function”. ''British Journal of Aesthetic''s. 21, 1: 159-171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn, Glenn "How Can Food Be Art?" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The categories of the ordinary as aesthetic ==
Another line emerging from analytic aesthetics and the American Society of Aesthetics has been lately discussing the expansion of aesthetics’ category repertoire to include other qualities (cuteness, prettiness, messiness, neatness, cuddleness loveliness, organized, disorganized)&lt;ref&gt;Leddy, Thomas. 1995. 'Everyday Surface Aesthetic Qualities: "Neat", "Messy", "Clean", "Dirty"'''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', 53, 259-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Leddy, Thomas''The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (Broadview Press 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other types of ordinary experiences (i.e. scratching an itch, playing with a pencil).&lt;ref&gt;Irvin,Sherri “Scratching an Itch,” Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 66, 1 (2008), 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2449">[[File:French fifer.jpg|thumb|A fifer from the French [[Consular Guard]], 1801.]]
{{otheruses}}
A '''fifer''' is a [[non-combatant]] [[Military career|military occupation]] of a foot soldier who originally played the [[fife (musical instrument)|fife]] during [[combat]]. The practice was instituted during the period of [[Early Modern warfare]] to sound [[Signals (military)|signals]] during changes in formation, such as the [[Line (formation)|line]], and were also members of the [[regiment]]'s [[military band]] during [[Marching|marches]]. 

These soldiers, often boys too young to fight or sons of [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]'s, were used to help [[infantry]] [[battalion]]s to keep marching pace from the right of the formation in coordination with the [[drummers]] positioned at the centre,&lt;ref&gt;when deployed in a line, p.10, Nafziger&lt;/ref&gt; and relayed orders in the form of sequences of musical signals. The fife was particularly useful because of its high pitched sound, which could be heard over the sounds of [[battle]].

The usual allocation of fifers in a [[battalion]] during the Early Modern warfare period varied from five to eight.&lt;ref&gt;p.7, Nafziger&lt;/ref&gt; The [[regimental band]]s, particularly of the high prestige units such as the [[List of army units called Guards|guards]] had as many as 32 (in the [[Preobrazhensky regiment]]) or more fifers.&lt;ref&gt;p.39, Nafziger&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fifers, as part of the [[fife-and-drum corps]] that accompanied Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] and the [[First Fleet]], were present at important national historical events, such as the reading of the [[Governor's Commission]] on 2 February 1788 at [[Sydney Cove]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080905001852/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/military/ Military music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905001852/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/military/ |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[photography]] and [[graphic arts]] a '''flopped image''' is a technical term for a static or moving image that is generated by a mirror-reversal of an original image across a vertical axis.  This is opposed to a ''[[flipped image]]'', which means an image reversed across a horizontal axis.  ''Flopping'' can be used to improve the subjective [[aesthetic]] appeal of the image in question.

== Use in advertising ==
There are two main uses in advertising, one practical, and one subjective.  On a practical level, images of cars are often flopped to ensure cars look appropriate for left-hand-drive or right-hand-drive markets. This allows the results of a single production shoot to be used across markets, allowing a cost saving. On a subjective level, the direction in which a person is looking or a car appears to be travelling may be regarded as important. When placing a picture on a page of text, it is usual for depictions of people to face into the text, rather than off the page; thus, when compositing a page, a picture may be flopped so it may be placed either side of a column of text.

== Use in art ==
Cultural considerations come into play&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a picture of a person eating with their left hand may be flopped for publication in a Muslim publication, due to the strong taboo against eating with the left hand in Muslim society. Similarly, [[Vincent van Gogh]] took the trouble to etch some of his originals in mirror-reversed form so that when printed, people in the image would appear, correctly, as right-handed.

An example of ''flopping'' is the use of [[Joseph Southall|Joseph Edward Southall's]] painting ''Fishermen and Boat'' as part of the art associated with [[Kate Bush]]'s album [[Aerial (album)|Aerial]].  The picture is flopped, and the name "AERIAL" added to the boat.

== Image flipping ==
[[Image:Billykid.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Billy the Kid. ''(Flopped [[tintype]] photo)'']]
A common movie [[blooper]] is a flopped image, usually and erroneously called "[[flipped image]]s". Flopped images are common because they can be used to correct continuity errors between shots and are hard to see without extensive examination, whereas flipped images are very obvious. Examples of these can be found on several movie blooper sites.

One of the most famous flopped images is this picture of [[Billy the Kid]] carrying a [[Winchester Rifle|Model 1873 Winchester]] rifle and a pistol belt with the pistol on his left. This led people to believe he was left-handed, but it was later revealed to be a flopped image due to the cartridge loading gate on the rifle being on the wrong side.&lt;ref&gt;The loading gate on a Model 1873 Winchester lever action rifle is on the right side of the receiver.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Hakuin}}
{{Nihongo|'''Hakuin Ekaku'''|白隠 慧鶴||extra=January 19, 1686 - January 18, 1768}} was one of the most influential figures in [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]]. He is regarded as the reviver of the [[Rinzai school]] from a moribund period of stagnation, refocusing it on its traditionally rigorous training methods integrating [[meditation]] and [[koan]] practice.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hakuin was born in 1686 in the small village of [[Hara-juku (Tōkaidō)|Hara]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://nippon-kichi.jp/article_list.do?ml_lang=en&amp;p=2082 Shoinji Temple]&lt;/ref&gt; at the foot of [[Mount Fuji]]. His mother was a devout [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren Buddhist]], and it is likely that her piety was a major influence on his decision to become a Buddhist [[monk]]. As a child, Hakuin attended a lecture by a Nichiren monk on the topic of the [[Eight Hot Hells]]. This deeply impressed the young Hakuin, and he developed a pressing fear of [[hell]], seeking a way to escape it. He eventually came to the conclusion that it would be necessary to become a monk.

====Shōin-ji and Daishō-ji====
At the age of fifteen, he obtained consent from his parents to join the monastic life, and was ordained at the local Zen temple, [[Shōin-ji]]. When the head monk at Shōin-ji took ill, Hakuin was sent to a neighboring temple, Daishō-ji, where he served as a novice for three or four years, studying Buddhist texts. While at Daisho-ji, he read the [[Lotus Sutra]], considered by the Nichiren sect to be the king of all Buddhist sutras, and found it disappointing, saying "it consisted of nothing more than simple tales about [[causality|cause and effect]]".

====Zensō-ji====
At age eighteen, he left Daishō-ji for Zensō-ji, a temple close to Hara.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xv}} At the age of nineteen, he came across in his studies the story of the [[China|Chinese]] [[Ch'an]] master [[Yantou Quanhuo]], who had been brutally murdered by bandits. Hakuin despaired over this story, as it showed that even a great monk could not be saved from a bloody death in this life. How then could he, just a simple monk, hope to be saved from the tortures of hell in the next life? He gave up his goal of becoming an enlightened monk, and not wanting to return home in shame, traveled around studying literature and poetry.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xvi}}

====Zuiun-ji====
Travelling with twelve other monks, Hakuin made his way to Zuiun-ji, the residence of Baō Rōjin, a respected scholar but also a tough-minded teacher.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xvii}} While studying with the poet-monk Bao, he had an experience that put him back along the path of monasticism. He saw a number of books piled out in the temple courtyard, books from every school of Buddhism. Struck by the sight of all these volumes of literature, Hakuin prayed to the gods of the [[Dharma]] to help him choose a path. He then reached out and took a book; it was a collection of Zen stories from the [[Ming Dynasty]]. Inspired by this, he repented and dedicated himself to the practice of Zen.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xviii-xix}}

===First awakening===

====Eigen-ji====
He again went traveling for two years, settling down at the Eigen-ji temple when he was twenty-three. It was here that Hakuin had his first entrance into [[Kensho|enlightenment]] when he was twenty-four.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xvii}} He locked himself away in a shrine in the temple for seven days, and eventually reached an intense awakening upon hearing the ringing of the temple bell. However, his master refused to acknowledge this enlightenment, and Hakuin left the temple.
[[File:Hakuin.jpg|left|thumb|Hakuin Ekaku]]

====Shōju Rōjin====
Hakuin left again, to study for a mere eight months with Shōju Rōjin (Dokyu Etan, 1642–1721).{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxi-xxii}} Shoju was an intensely demanding teacher, who hurled insults and blows at Hakuin, in an attempt to free him from his limited understanding and self-centeredness. When asked why he had become a monk, Hakuin said that it was out of terror to fall into hell, to which Shōju replied "You're a self-centered rascal, aren't you!"{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii}} Shōju assigned him a series of "hard-to-pass" koans. These led to three isolated moments of [[satori]], but it was only eighteen years later that Hakuin really understood what Shōju meant with this.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii}}

Hakuin left Shoju after eight months of study,{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii-xxiii}} without receiving formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin,{{sfn|Mohr|2003|p=311-312}} nor from any other teacher,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2009/02/teaching-credentials-in-zen.html James Ford (2009), ''Teaching Credentials in Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; but Hakuin considered himself to be an heir of Shoju Rojin. Today Hakuin is considered to have received [[dharma transmission]] from Shoju.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.buddhapia.com/hmu/bcm/2/zen_soto_rinzai.html Zen Buddhism: from perspective of Japanese Soto &amp; Rinzai Zen Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717040105/http://www.buddhapia.com/hmu/bcm/2/zen_soto_rinzai.html |date=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Taigi'' - great doubt====
Hakuin realized that his attainment was incomplete.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxv}} He was unable to sustain the tranquility of mind of the Zen hall in the midst of daily life.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxv}} When he was twenty-six he read that "all wise men and eminent priests who lack the Bodhi-mind fall into Hell".{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}} This raised a "great doubt" (''taigi'') in him, since he thought that the formal entrance into monkhood and the daily enactment of rituals was the bodhi-mind.{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}} Only with his final awakening, at age 42, did he fully realize what "bodhi-mind" means, namely working for the good of others.{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}}

====Zen sickness====
Hakuin's early extreme exertions affected his health, and at one point in his young life he fell ill for almost two years, experiencing what would now probably be classified as a [[nervous breakdown]] by Western medicine. He called it [[Zen sickness]], and sought the advice of a [[Taoist]] cave dwelling hermit named Hakuyu, who prescribed a [[Mental image|visualization]] and breathing practice which eventually relieved his symptoms.  From this point on, Hakuin put a great deal of importance on physical strength and health in his Zen practice, and studying Hakuin-style Zen required a great deal of stamina. Hakuin often spoke of strengthening the body by concentrating the spirit, and followed this advice himself. Well into his seventies, he claimed to have more physical strength than he had at age thirty, being able to sit in zazen meditation or chant sutras for an entire day without fatigue.  The practices Hakuin learned from Hakuyu are still passed down within the Rinzai school.

===Head priest at Shōin-ji===
After another several years of travel, at age 31 Hakuin returned to Shoin-ji, the temple where he had been ordained. He was soon installed as head priest, a capacity in which he would serve for the next half-century. When he was installed as head priest of Shōin-ji in 1718, he had the title of ''Dai-ichiza'', "First Monk":{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxix}}
{{quote|It was the minimum rank required by government regulation for those installed as temple priests and seems to have been little more than a matter of paying a fee and registering Hakuin as the incumbent of Shōin-ji.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxix}}}}

It was around this time that he adopted the name "Hakuin", which means "concealed in white", referring to the state of being hidden in the clouds and snow of mount Fuji.{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=71}}

====Final awakening====
Although Hakuin had several "satori experiences", he did not feel free, and was unable to integrate his realization into his ordinary life.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}} At age 41, he experienced a final and total awakening, while reading the Lotus Sutra, the [[sutra]] that he had disregarded as a young student. He realized that the [[Bodhicitta|Bodhi-mind]] means working for the good of every sentient being:{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}}
{{quote|It was the chapter on parables, where the Buddha cautions his disciple Shariputra against savoring the joys of [[Pratyekabuddha|personal enlightenment]], and reveals to him the truth of the [[Bodhisattva]]'s mission, which is to continue practice beyond enlightenment, teaching and helping others until all beings have attained salvation.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}}}}

He wrote of this experience, saying "suddenly I penetrated to the perfect, true, ultimate meaning of the Lotus". This event marked a turning point in Hakuin's life. He dedicated the rest of his life to helping others achieve liberation.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}}

====Practicing the bodhi-mind====
He would spend the next forty years teaching at Shoin-ji, writing, and giving lectures. At first there were only a few monks there, but soon word spread, and Zen students began to come from all over the country to study with Hakuin. Eventually, an entire community of monks had built up in Hara and the surrounding areas, and Hakuin's students numbered in the hundreds. He eventually would certify over eighty disciples as successors.

====Is that so?====
A well-known anecdote took place in this period:
{{quote|A beautiful Japanese girl whose parents owned a food store lived near Hakuin. One day, without any warning, her parents discovered she was pregnant. This made her parents angry. She would not confess who the man was, but after much harassment at last named Hakuin.&lt;br&gt;
In great anger the parents went to the master. "Is that so?" was all he would say.&lt;br&gt;
After the child was born it was brought to Hakuin. By this time he had lost his reputation, which did not trouble him, but he took very good care of the child. He obtained milk from his neighbors and everything else the child needed by [[takuhatsu]].&lt;br&gt;
A year later the girl could stand it no longer. She told her parents the truth - the real father of the child was a young man who worked in the fish market.&lt;br&gt;
The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask forgiveness, to apologize at length, and to get the child back.&lt;br&gt;
Hakuin smiled and willingly yielded the child, saying: "Is that so? It's good to hear this baby has his/her father"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Reps|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kimihiko|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Death===
At the age of 83, Hakuin died in Hara, the same village in which he was born and which he had transformed into a center of Zen teaching.

==Teachings==
[[File:Daruma, Hakuin Ekaku - Indianapolis Museum of Art - DSC00771.JPG|thumb|right|Daruma by Hakuin]]

===Post-satori practice===
[[Hakuin]] saw "deep compassion and commitment to help all sentient beings everywhere"{{sfn|Low|2006|p=35}} as an indispensable part of the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Buddhist path to awakening]]. Hakuin emphasized the need for "post-satori training",{{sfn|Waddell|2010}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}} purifying the mind of karmic tendencies and 
{{quote|[W]hipping forward the wheel of the Four Universal Vows, pledging yourself to benefit and save all sentient beings while striving every minute of your life to practice the great Dharma giving.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}

The insight in the need of arousing [[bodhicitta]] formed Hakuin's final awakening:
{{quote|What is to be valued above all else is the practice that comes after satori is achieved. What is that practice? It is the practice that puts the [[Bodhicitta|Mind of Enlightenment]] first and foremost.&lt;br&gt;
[At] my forty-first year, [...] I at long last penetrated into the heart of this great matter. Suddenly, unexpectedly, I saw it — it was as clear as if it were right there in the hollow of my hand. What is the Mind of Enlightenment? It is, I realized, a matter of doing good — benefiting others by giving them the gift of the Dharma teaching.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}

===Koan practice===
Hakuin deeply believed that the most effective way for a student to achieve insight was through extensive [[meditation]] on a koan. Only with incessant investigation of his koan will a student be able to become one with the koan, and attain enlightenment. The psychological pressure and [[doubt]] that comes when one struggles with a koan is meant to create tension that leads to awakening. Hakuin called this the "great doubt", writing, "At the bottom of great doubt lies great awakening. If you doubt fully, you will awaken fully".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40980460|title=Sculpture in the age of doubt|last=1939-2013,|first=McEvilley, Thomas,|isbn=9781581150230|location=New York|oclc=40980460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hakuin used a fivefold classification system:{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148}}&lt;br&gt;
1. ''Hosshin'', dharma-body koans, are used to awaken the first insight into [[sunyata]].{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148}} They reveal the [[dharmakaya]], or Fundamental.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=136}} They introduce "the undifferentiated and the unconditional".{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=136-137}}&lt;br&gt;
2. ''Kikan'', dynamic action koans, help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view;{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148-149}} Where ''hosshin'' koans represent ''tai'', substance, ''kikan'' koans represent ''yu'', function.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=137}}&lt;br&gt;
3. ''Gonsen'', explication of word koans, aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters.{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=149}} They show how the Fundamental, though not depending on words, is nevertheless expressed in words, without getting stuck to words.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=138}}&lt;br&gt;
4. ''Hachi Nanto'', eight "difficult to pass" koans.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=135}} There are various explanations for this category, one being that these koans cut off clinging to the previous attainment. They create another Great Doubt, which shatters the self attained through ''satori''. {{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=139}} It is uncertain which are exactly those eight koans.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23}} Hori gives various sources, which altogether give ten ''hachi nanto'' koans.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23-24}}&lt;br&gt;
5.  ''Goi jujukin'' koans, the [[Five Ranks|Five Ranks of Tozan]] and the Ten Grave Precepts.{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=151}}{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=135}}

Hakuin's emphasis on koan practice had a strong influence in the Japanese Rinzai-school. In the system developed by his followers, students are assigned koans by their teacher and then meditate on them. Once they have broken through, they must demonstrate their insight in private interview with the teacher.  If the teacher feels the student has indeed attained a satisfactory insight into the koan, then another is assigned. Hakuin's main role in the development of this koan system was most likely the selection and creation of koans to be used. In this he didn't limit himself to the classic koan collections inherited from China; he himself originated one of the best-known koans, "You know the sound of two hands clapping; tell me, what is the sound of one hand?".  Hakuin preferred this new koan to the most commonly assigned first koan from the Chinese tradition, the [[Mu (Japanese word)|Mu]] koan. He believed his "Sound of One Hand" to be more effective in generating the great doubt, and remarked that "its superiority to the former methods is like the difference between cloud and mud".

===Four ways of knowing===
{{See also|Huayan school#Four Dharmadhatu|l1=Four Dharmadhatu|Five wisdoms}}

Asanga, one of the main proponents of [[Yogacara]], introduced the idea of four ways of knowing: the perfection of action, observing knowing, universal knowing, and great mirror knowing. He relates these to the [[Eight Consciousnesses]]: 
# The five senses are connected to the perfection of action,
# Samjna (cognition) is connected to observing knowing,
# Manas (mind) is related to universal knowing,
# Alaya-vijnana is connected to great mirror knowing.{{sfn|Low|2006|p=22}}
In time, these ways of knowing were also connected to the doctrine of the [[Trikaya|three bodies of the Buddha]] ([[Dharmakāya]], [[Sambhogakāya]] and Nirmanakaya), together forming the "Yuishiki doctrine".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=22}}

Hakuin related these four ways of knowing to four gates on the Buddhist path: the Gate of Inspiration, the Gate of Practice, the Gate of Awakening, and the Gate of Nirvana.{{sfn|Low|2006|p=32-39}}
# The Gate of Inspiration is initial awakening, [[kensho]], seeing into one's true nature.
# The Gate of Practice is the purification of oneself by continuous practice.
# The Gate of Awakening is the study of the ancient masters and the Buddhist sutras, to deepen the insight into the Buddhist teachings, and acquire the skills needed to help other sentient beings on the Buddhist path to awakening.
# The Gate of Nirvana is the "ultimate liberation", "knowing without any kind of defilement".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=32-39}}

===Opposition to "Do-nothing Zen"===
One of Hakuin's major concerns was the danger of what he called "Do-nothing Zen" teachers, who upon reaching some small experience of enlightenment devoted the rest of their life to, as he puts it, "passing day after day in a state of seated sleep".{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=3}} Quietist practices seeking simply to empty the mind, or teachers who taught that a tranquil "emptiness" was enlightenment, were Hakuin's constant targets. In this regard he was especially critical of  followers of the maverick Zen master [[Bankei]].{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=125, 126}} He stressed a never-ending and severe training to deepen the insight of enlightenment and forge one's ability to manifest it in all activities.{{sfn|Waddell|2010}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}} He urged his students to never be satisfied with shallow attainments, and truly believed that enlightenment was possible for anyone if they exerted themselves and approached their practice with real energy.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}

===Lay teachings===
An extremely well known and popular Zen master during his later life, Hakuin was a firm believer in bringing the wisdom of Zen to all people. Thanks to his upbringing as a commoner and his many travels around the country, he was able to relate to the [[rural]] population, and served as a sort of spiritual father to the people in the areas surrounding Shoin-ji. In fact, he turned down offers to serve in the great monasteries in [[Kyoto]], preferring to stay at Shoin-ji. Most of his instruction to the common people focused on living a morally virtuous life. Showing a surprising broad-mindedness, his ethical teachings drew on elements from [[Confucianism]], ancient Japanese traditions, and traditional Buddhist teachings. He also never sought to stop the rural population from observing non-Zen traditions, despite the seeming intolerance for other schools' practices in his writings.

In addition to this, Hakuin was also a popular Zen lecturer, traveling all over the country, often to Kyoto, to teach and speak on Zen. He wrote frequently in the last fifteen years of his life, trying to record his lessons and experiences for posterity. Much of his writing was in the [[vernacular]], and in popular forms of poetry that commoners would read.

===Calligraphy===
An important part of Hakuin's practice of Zen was his painting and [[calligraphy]]. He seriously took up painting only late in his life, at almost age sixty, but is recognized as one of the greatest Japanese Zen painters. His paintings were meant to capture Zen values, serving as sorts of "visual sermons" that were extremely popular among the laypeople of the time, many of whom were [[illiterate]]. Today, paintings of Bodhi Dharma by Hakuin Ekaku are sought after and displayed in a handful of the world's leading museums.

==Influence==
Through Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages are part of the [[Ōtōkan]] lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by [[Nanpo Jomyo]], who received dharma transmission in China in 1265.&lt;ref group=web name=ROZ&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/whats_zen/history.html#The%20Transmission%20of%20Zen%20to%20Japan Rinzai-Obaku Zen - What is Zen? - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

All contemporary Rinzai-lineages stem from Inzan Ien (1751–1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760–1833),{{sfn|Dumoulin-2005-B|p=392}}{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=90}} both students of Gasan Jito (1727–1797). Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, though "he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin's dharma heirs".{{sfn|Dumoulin-2005-B|p=391}}

==Writings==
Hakuin left a voluminous body of works, divided in Dharma Works (14 vols.) and [[Kanbun]] Works (4 vols.).&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.zenbunka.or.jp/en/investigation/entry/post_17.html Hakuin Study Group] has been researching the written works of Hakuin.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are the best known and edited in English.

[[File:GrammeS_-_Ultra_Lettrist_hypergraphics.jpg|thumb]]

'''Hypergraphy''', also called '''hypergraphics''' and '''metagraphics''', is a method, central to the [[Lettrist]] movement of the 1950s, which encompasses a synthesis of writing and other modalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Isou|first=Isidore|title='Les Champs de Force de la Peinture Lettriste|year=1964|publisher=Avant-Garde|location=Paris|chapter=The Force Fields of Letterist Painting|quote=If one places an [[abstract art|abstract]] composition—which is simply a fragmentary purification of the former object—in (or alongside) a figurative structure, this second composition digests the first one—transformed into a decorative motif—and then the whole work becomes figurative. However if one places a letterist notation on (or beside) a realist "form," it is the first one which assimilates the second to change the whole thing into a work of hypergraphics or super-writing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore Isou]], the founder of Lettrism, said that "Metagraphics or post-writing, encompassing all the means of ideographic, lexical and phonetic notation, supplements the means of expression based on sound by adding a specifically plastic dimension, a visual facet which is irreducible and escapes oral labelling..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Isou|first=Isidore|title=Les Champs de Force de la Peinture Lettriste|year=1964|publisher=Avant-Garde|location=Paris}} Excerpt found at [http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&amp;d/lettrist/isou-m.htm Selections from the Manifestosof Isidore Isou], ed. and trans.by David W. Seaman&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypergraphy merges poetry (text) with more visual (graphic) ways of communication such as painting, illustration or signs. The technique was first known as 'metagraphics', but later became known as 'hypergraphics'. Maurice Lemaître, a Lettrist theorist,  defined it as communicating through the union of various forms of communication, as an "ensemble of signs capable of transmitting the reality served by the consciousness more exactly than all the former fragmentary and partial practices (phonetic alphabets, algebra, geometry, painting, music, and so forth)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Stephen C.|title=The Situationist International|year=2005|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|pages=20|editor=Ford, Simon|chapter=Lettrism: A Point of Views}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was used in Lettrist painting and cinema, in which letters were drawn directly onto the film. As the Lettrists became more experimental in their use of media, the technique was applied more to everyday life in critiquing urbanism and architecture in the Lettrist field of [[psychogeography]].

The '''Ibero-American Exposition of 1929''' (Spanish: '''''Exposición iberoamericana de 1929''''') was a [[world's fair]] held in [[Seville]], [[Spain]], from 9 May 1929 until 21 June 1930. Countries in attendance of the exposition included: Portugal, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Chile, the Republic of Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. Each [[Spanish region]] and each of the [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] of [[Andalusia]] were also represented. Spain’s Dictator General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] gave the opening address. Primo de Rivera allowed the Spanish King [[Alfonso XIII]] to give the final words and officially open the exposition. The purpose of the exposition was to improve relations between Spain and the countries in attendance, all of which have historical ties with Spain through [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization]] (parts of [[Spanish America]] and the United States) or [[Iberian Union|political union]] (Portugal and its former colony Brazil). Other countries were represented at the ''[[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|International section]]'' in Barcelona.
 
The exposition was smaller in scale than the International Exposition held in Barcelona during that same year, but it was not lacking in style. The city of Seville had prepared for the Exposition over the course of 19 years.  The exhibition buildings were constructed in [[María Luisa Park]] along the [[Guadalquivir River]]. A majority of the buildings were built to remain permanent after the closing of the exposition.  Many of the foreign buildings, including the United States exhibition building, were to be used as consulates after the closing of the exhibits. By the opening of the exposition all of the buildings were complete, although many were no longer new. Not long before the opening of the Exposition, the Spanish government also began a modernization of the city in order to prepare for the expected crowds by erecting new hotels and widening the medieval streets to allow for the movement of automobiles.

== Spanish pavilions and exhibits ==

[[File:Estatua Aníbal González 2.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Aníbal González]]
Spain spent a large amount of money in developing its exhibits for the fair and constructed elaborate buildings to hold them. The exhibits were designed to show the social and economic progress of Spain as well as expressing its culture. Spanish architect [[Aníbal González Álvarez-Ossorio|Aníbal González]] designed the largest and most famous of the buildings, which surrounded the [[Plaza de España (Seville)|Plaza de España]]. The largest of the exhibits housed in this building was located in the “Salón del Descubrimento de América.” The ''Salón'' contained documents, maps, and other objects related to the discovery of the [[Americas]], including a set of 120 letters and manuscript that had belonged to [[Christopher Columbus]], the last testament of [[Hernán Cortés]], and detailed dioramas of historic moments. An exact replica of Columbus's ship the "[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]," complete with a costumed crew, floated on the Guadalquivir River. The cities of Spain contributed structures designed to reflect their unique cultures to be placed in the "Pabellones de las regiones españolas" ("Pavilions of the Spanish regions").  Spain’s exhibits also included a large collection of art located in the Palacio Mudéjar ("[[Mudéjar art]] palace"), Palacio Renacimiento ("[[Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance]] palace"), and the Palacio de la Casa Real ("Palace of the Royal House"). The Institute of Art from the [[University of Seville]] was moved to the Palacio Mudéjar for the duration of the exposition on the permission gained from the exposition committee by [[Count Columbi]]. The committee also set aside funds from their budget to purchase materials for the Institute.

== United States Exhibits ==
[[File:Pabellon de estados unidos 2.JPG|thumb|United States Pavilion (2013)]]
The United States' contribution to the exposition consisted of three buildings and marked the end to a several year period in which the United States did not construct buildings for foreign expositions. The main building was to serve as the U.S. consulate office after the closing of the Ibero-American exposition, and housed a menagerie of electrical appliances including oil furnaces, electric refrigerators, airplane models, and miniature wind tunnels. The other two structures housed a movie theatre and government exhibits, including contributions from the Departments of Agriculture, Treasury, and Labor, the Commission of Fine Arts, the Navy, and the Library of Congress.

== Ibero-American Exhibits ==
Of the Ibero-American nations in attendance of the exposition, 10 constructed pavilions to display their exhibits. Other nations, including Bolivia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Ecuador displayed their native products in the "Galerías comerciales americanas" ("Commercial galleries of the Americas").

[[File:Pabellón de Perú.jpg|thumb|Peruvian pavilion (2009)]]
The largest of the ten pavilions was the '''Peruvian pavilion''', which was designed by the architect Don [[Manuel Piqueras Cotolí]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Piqueras Cotolí (1885-1937): Arquitecto, escultor y urbanista entre España y el Perú. Luis Eduardo Wuffarden, Editor. Museo de Arte de Lima, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The pavilion contained a large archeology collection consisting of three halls filled with pre-Columbian era artifacts, which were to be kept on permanent display. The pavilion also contained an agricultural exhibit filled with stuffed [[vicuña]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[llama]]s, and [[guanaco]]s.  The exhibit was complemented by a pack of live llamas grazing on the pavilion grounds.

The '''Republic of Colombia''' constructed a pavilion designed by Seville architect [[José Granados]]. The pavilion included a collection of sculpture and artwork by Colombian artist [[Rómulo Rozo]], and of Colombian emeralds, and a coffee café that demonstrated all of the steps in coffee cultivation.

The '''Brazilian pavilion''' also contained a coffee cultivation exhibit complete with panoramas and models illustrating the different phases of cultivation. Architect [[Pedro Paulo Bernardes Bastos]] designed the pavilion, which also included a coffee bar.

'''Chilean''' architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Juan Martínez Gutiérrez|es|3=Juan Martínez Gutiérrez|lt=Juan Martínez}} designed the three-story building that served as home to Chile's exhibits. The exhibits included displays of Chilean industries, including detailed replicas of a nitrate mine and a copper plant, [[Araucanian]] arts and crafts, and galleries displaying Chilean art and history.

The [[Mexican Pavilion from Ibero-American Exposition of 1929|'''Mexican pavilion''']], designed by [[Manuel Amabilis]], included exhibits on archeology, education, and the history of Spanish accomplishments in Mexico. Students in Mexican schools prepared some of the education exhibits.

Architect [[Martin Noel]] designed '''Argentina's pavilion''', which included a movie theatre and displays focusing on Argentinean industries and products.

'''Uruguay's pavilion''' included displays of its industrial schools, including the Institute of Agronomy and an art gallery filled with paintings and bronze sculptures.

'''Cuba''' contributed demonstrations of the sugar and tobacco industries to the exposition in their pavilion.

The '''Dominican Republic''' pavilion included a reproduction of the [[Columbus's Alcázar]].

'''Guatemala''' signed up late for the exhibition and as a result rather than resembling a huge palace its pavilion looks more like a school portable building with blue and white tiles on the front. The building contained exhibits relating to the resources found in Guatemala.

'''Venezuela''' also erected a pavilion containing displays of its resources.

[[File:Plaza España 2.jpg|thumb|Ceramic provincial alcoves and benches at Plaza de España]]
Today, many of the pavilions from the exposition remain, notably the famous [[Plaza de España (Seville)|Plaza de España]], which chronicles each of the regions of Spain in ceramic provincial alcoves and benches, as well as some of the national pavilions, which have now been converted to Consulate-Generals. Many of the buildings have been converted into museums and the pavilion of Argentina is now a flamenco school. They have also been featured in a number of films, including ''[[Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'', among others.

For Sevillans, the exposition marked the acceptance by the upper class of the ''[[traje de flamenca]]'', an outfit worn by lower-class women.&lt;ref name="Abril"&gt;[http://www.altur.com/esp/psevilla/sevilla/trajegi.php3 Traje de flamenca en la feria de Abril] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501001724/http://www.altur.com/esp/psevilla/sevilla/trajegi.php3 |date=2010-05-01 }}, altur.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ifrit''', also spelled as '''efreet''', '''efrite''', '''ifreet''', '''afreet''', '''afrite''' and '''afrit''' ([[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]: ''{{transl|ar|ʻIfrīt}}'': {{lang|ar|عفريت}}, [[plural|pl]] ''{{transl|ar|ʻAfārīt}}'': {{lang|ar|عفاريت}}) are [[supernatural]] creatures in some [[Middle Eastern]] stories. In [[Islam]], this term refers to the most powerful and dangerous [[Jinn]].

==Description==
[[File:Kitab al-Bulhan --- devils talking.jpg|thumb|right|The Chief-Ifrit sitting on the right listening to the complaints of jinn; Al-Malik al-Aswad, from the late 14th&amp;nbsp;century [[Book of Wonders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Maximillien |last=de Lafayette |title=Early &amp; contemporary spirit artists, psychic artists, and medium painters from 5000&amp;nbsp;BC to the present day economy |website=Lulu.com |year=2017 |ISBN=978-1-365-97802-9 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Ifrits are a class of [[wikt:infernal|infernal]] [[djinn]] and also held to be a [[ghost|death spirit]] drawn to the life-force (or blood) of a murdered victim seeking revenge on the murderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=el-Sayed El-Aswad |title=Religion and Folk Cosmology: Scenarios of the visible and invisible in rural Egypt |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 |ISBN=978-0-897-89924-6 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Lebling"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Lebling |title=Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and genies from Arabia to Zanzibar |publisher=I.B.

Tauris |year=2013 |ISBN=978-1-848-85372-0 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; or desolated places on the surface, such as  in ruins or caves.

According to Islamic sources, the Ifrit has a fiery appearance with flames leaping from his mouth. It may be a danger to people, but can be destroyed if someone recites a [[Dua|Du'a]] (Islamic prayer) near it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hajjah Amina Adil |title=Muhammad the Messenger of Islam: His life &amp; prophecy |publisher=BookBaby |year=2012 |ISBN=978-1-618-42913-1 |chapter=Ezra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In folklore, they are commonly thought to take the shape of the deceased at the moment of death, or the appearance of the Shaitan. In the Islamic traditions of [[Cirebon]], the Afarit are known as ''Mrekayangan'', a subcategory of [[Shaitan|demon]]s. But their origin is different from the other demons, since the Mrekayangan appear after someone died improperly, while the demons are descendants of [[Iblis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A.G. |last=Muhaimin |title=The Islamic Traditions of Cirebon: Ibadat and Adat among Javanese muslims |publisher=ANU E Press |year=2006 |ISBN=978-1-920-94231-1 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:MakhanEmbracedByAnEfreeti.jpg|thumb|upright|Makhan embraced by an Ifrit. [[Persian miniature|Illustration]] to [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s poem ''Hamsa''. [[Bukhara]], 1648.]]
The word Ifrit seems to be of Arabic origin. Traditionally, Arab philologists trace the derivation of the word to {{lang|ar|عفر}} (''{{transl|ar|ʻafara}}'', "to rub with dust").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=J. |first1=Chelhod, |title=ʿIfrīt |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ifrit-SIM_3502?s.num=0&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=ifrit |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western philologists, such as [[Johann Jakob Hess]] and [[Karl Vollers]], attribute it to [[Middle Persian]] ''afritan'' which corresponds to [[Modern Persian]] {{Nastaliq|{{lang|fa|آفريدن}}}} (to create).

==Islam==
An Ifrit is mentioned in the [[Quran|Qur'an]], [[Sura]] [[An-Naml]] (27:38-40): &lt;blockquote&gt;[Solomon] said, "O assembly [of jinn], which of you will bring me her [the Queen of Sheba's] throne before they come to me in submission?" An Ifrit (strong one) from the jinn said: "I will bring it to you before you rise from your place. And verily, I am indeed strong, and trustworthy for such work." One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: "I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!" Then when Solomon saw it placed before him, he said: "This is by the Grace of my Lord - to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for (the good of) his own self; and whoever is ungrateful, (he is ungrateful only for the loss of his own self). Certainly, my Lord is Rich (Free of all needs), Bountiful."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a [[hadith]] from [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], an Ifrit tried to interrupt the prayers of [[Muhammed]]. Muhammed overpowered the Ifrit and wanted to fasten him to a pillar so that everyone can see him in the morning. Then, he remembered the statement of [[Süleyman|Solomon]] and he dismissed the Ifrit.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lebling ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinndemons.com/jinn-in-hadith-sahih-bukhari/|title=Jinn in Hadith Sahih Bukhari - Jinn &amp; Demons - Jinn &amp; Demons|website=www.jinndemons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a narration about [[Isra and Mi'raj|Muhammeds Night Journey]], an Ifrit sought Muhammed with a fiery torch. To get rid of him, he asked [[Gabriel#Islam|Jibraʾil]] for help. Jibraʾil then taught him how to seek refuge from [[God in Islam|God]], whereupon the Ifrit get away from him.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Olson Vuckovic ''Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi'raj in the Formation of Islam'' Routledge 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-135-88524-3}} p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ifrit, meeting [[Imam Ali]], is mentioned in different [[Shiism|Shi'i]] accounts. According to the [[Shabakism|Shabak]] community, Imam Ali became incensed against an Ifrit for his unbelieving. Consequently, he bound the Ifrit in chains. The Ifrit appealed to all prophets since [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] for his release. But no one was able to free him, until [[Muhammed]] found him and took the Ifrit to Imam Ali. He freed him on the condition that he would profess his faith for Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Moosa ''Extremist Shiites: The Ghulat Sects'' Matti Moosa 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-815-62411-0}} page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Qisas Al-Anbiya]] (Stories of the Prophets), Afarit perform the orders of [[Iblis]] to plague [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]]. Each of these Afarit are endowed with specific abilities such as turning into a firy storm or killing by shouting out.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Ashaq Ahmad At-Talabi, Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad Thaʻlabī ''Islamische Erzählungen von Propheten und Gottesmännern: Qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʼ'' Otto Harrassowitz Verlag 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-447-05266-5}} S. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arabic literature==
In ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in a tale called "The Porter and the Young Girls", there is a narrative about a prince who is attacked by pirates and takes refuge with a woodcutter. The prince finds an underground chamber in the forest leading to a beautiful woman who has been kidnapped by an Ifrit. The prince sleeps with the woman and both are attacked by the jealous Ifrit, who changes the prince into an ape. Later a princess restores the prince and fights a [[pitched battle]] with the Ifrit, who changes shape into various animals, fruit, and fire until being reduced to cinders. In the book, the word is used interchangeably with ''[[genie]]'' and the spirit is malevolent but easily tricked by the protagonist.&lt;ref name=Hale&gt;{{cite news|author = Leon Hale|title = Arabic mythology is worth revisiting|publisher = ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''|date = January 13, 2002|url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?di}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blind poet [[Al-Maʿarri]] mentioned in his narrations, a [[paradise]] for ''Afarit'' with "narrow straits" and "dark valleys".&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Amira El-Zein 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-815-65070-6}} page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In early folklore, the Ifrit is said to be formed from the blood of a murder victim. Driving an unused nail into the blood was supposed to stop their formation. The creatures were reported as being able to take the form of [[Satan]], the murder victim, or even a sandstorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Aeromancy | encyclopedia = The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World | volume = | pages = 10 | publisher = Harper Element | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In modern popular culture ==
An Ifrit plays a major role as a story element in bollywood film ''[[Pari: Not a Fairytale]]'' where the lead character played by Anushka Sharma is the progeny of an Ifrit and human, due to a cult practice. The film was based on a book series called ''An Ember in the Ashes'.

The trading card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' has featured several "efreet" since the earliest expansion sets.&lt;ref&gt;https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/arabian-nights&lt;/ref&gt;

Ifrit is a prominent Summon to fight with in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' video game series. Like their mythological counterparts, Ifrit's are spirits of fire and destruction, almost always appearing as a devilish monster that uses either fire, earth, or both to do damage to either the monster the player is fighting or as a boss against the player himself.

==Overview==
Linguistic film theory was proposed by [[Stanley Cavell]]&lt;ref name=Dualist/&gt; and it is based on the philosophical tradition begun by [[late Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. The theory itself is said to mirror aspects of the activity of Wittgenstein's own philosophising (e.g. Wittgenstein's thought experiments) as films are viewed capable of engaging the audience in a therapeutic process of 'dialogue' and even investigate the [[Absurdity|absurd]] and the limits of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Film as Philosophy: Essays in Cinema after Wittgenstein and Cavell|last=Read|first=Rupert|last2=Goodenough|first2=Jerry|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn=9781403997951|location=New York|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavell's framework is seen as a distinctive way of approaching film and [[philosophy]] since question of style - the finding of words adequate to our aesthetic experience - is central to the understanding of the meaning of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Daniel|date=2017|title=Stanley Cavell on the Magic of the Movies|url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/film.2017.0034|journal=Film-Philosophy|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=114–132|doi=10.3366/film.2017.0034|issn=1466-4615|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his ideas involved the position that "if one thinks of a grammar as a machine for generating sentences, then perhaps one will wish to speak of the camera and its film as a machine for generating idioms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Film|last=Cavell|first=Stanley|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1979|isbn=067496196X|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Lawrance''' (also known as '''Mary Kearse''') ([[floruit|fl.]] 1794–1830) was a British [[botanical illustrator]] who specialized in flowers. She also taught botanical illustration.&lt;ref name=MSU1&gt;{{cite web|title=Lester, Francis Edward. My Friend the Rose.

Her first known exhibition was at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1795. Between 1796 and 1799 she created and published ''The Various Kinds of Roses Cultivated in England''. The book featured paintings of [[rose]]s that were drawn from nature. In 1818, she married a man with a surname, Kearse. She exhibited work until 1830.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{DNB|wstitle=Lawrance, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is held in the collection of the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref name=NYPL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Mrs. Lawrance's Beautiful Roses|url=http://exhibitions.nypl.org/treasures/items/show/142|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705214752/http://exhibitions.nypl.org/treasures/items/show/142 |archive-date=2011-07-05 |dead-url=yes|website=Treasures|publisher=New York Public Library|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Olivier Zahm in 1979.jpg|thumb|333x333px|Zahm pictured in [[1979]] in [[Paris]]]]
Olivier Zahm was born and raised in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/olivier-zahm|title=Olivier Zahmis One of the 500 People Shaping the Global Fashion Industry|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of three children born to two university professors. His parents, who were both students at the time of his birth, raised Zahm and his other siblings in student quarters that were designed by [[Charlotte Perriand]] and [[Jean Prouvé]], located at [[:fr:Résidence_universitaire_Jean-Zay|Résidence Universitaire Jean-Zay]] in [[Antony, Hauts-de-Seine|Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of his early childhood was spent in academic settings, particularly- during the volatile period of civil unrest in France that broke out in [[May 1968]]''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution. The unrest began with a series of student occupation protests against [[capitalism]], [[consumerism]], [[American imperialism]], and traditional institutions, values and order. Many of the new and radical ideas surrounding Zahm, immersing his youth in tumultuous generational discord, stayed with him, shaping his views on art, philosophical ideas and lifestyle choices.  He leveraged his profound formative experience using it as a tool to build aspects and themes that remain prevalent in his personal and professional life in adulthood.  He told The [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in 2010 that he, “remembers summers spent vacationing in the South of France with his parents in a community of like minded free spirits”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/fashion/04ZAHM.html|title=Publisher in the Warhol Mold|last=Morgan|first=Spencer|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; - who he labeled hippies. It was the ''1970s'', the decade of sex revolution and Zahm's parents were committed to [[free love]]'','' [[Naturism|nudism]] and [[Polyamory|polyamourous]] relationships. "My parents had a lot of lovers, they had a lot of affairs. At the time, my parents were really part of this alternative movement in Paris but quite bourgeois too. It wasn't San Francisco or New York. It was the French way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt;." Zahm’s love of magazines began when he was a teenager in the Paris suburbs. “We used to steal porn magazines in the bookstores and shops and look at them during school,” he says. “It was fun and secret. This is where my obsession for magazines comes from. Magazines used to reveal and give us access to sex, fashion, music and art. TV never did that, and books are mostly academic. Magazines were a symbol of freedom.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/02/olivier-zahm-fashions-most-libidinal-editor.html|title=Riding Around Paris With Olivier Zahm, Fashion’s Most Libidinal Editor|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He studied [[Philosophy|philosophy,]] [[history]],  [[semiotics]] and [[literature]] at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Livres/Olivier-Zahm-l-anar-chic-purple-Fashion-156808|title=Olivier Zahm, l’anar chic|last=Match|first=Paris|access-date=2018-09-24|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. His father, Claude, taught philosophy, and Zahm was on track to do the same, before realizing, at 25, that he preferred life outside “la tour d’ ivoire.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/02/olivier-zahm-fashions-most-libidinal-editor.html|title=Riding Around Paris With Olivier Zahm, Fashion’s Most Libidinal Editor|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahm's youngest sister committed suicide in 1994 at the age of 20. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/02/olivier-zahm-fashions-most-libidinal-editor.html|title=Riding Around Paris With Olivier Zahm, Fashion’s Most Libidinal Editor|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Before entering the world of fashion, Zahm worked as an art critic with widespread recognition for his work as a curator as well as his participation in over 150 exhibitions featuring international contemporary art. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/2/|title=Purple Prose , #2|website=Magpile|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;In responding to the superficial glamour of the 1980s, Zahm co-founded Purple Prose magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/about/|title=Purple Prose  magazine on Magpile|website=magpile.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the introduction of Purple Anthology, Zahm shares why he chose to create Purple Prose:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847830206/|title=Purple Anthology: Art Prose Fashion Music Architecture Sex - Rizzoli New York|work=Rizzoli New York|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/fw-2008-issue-10/purple-anthology/|title=Purple Anthology - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"We launched Purple Prose in the early 1990s without any means, and without any experience, because we wanted to make a magazine that was radically different. We wanted to support the artists around us that no one else supported, much less talked about. It would be a form of opposition of our own".'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Purple Anthology|last=Zahm|first=Olivier|last2=Fleiss|first2=Elein|publisher=Rizzoli|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8478-3020-6|location=New York City|pages=introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Anthology-Prose-Fashion-Architecture/dp/0847830209|title=Purple Anthology: Art Prose Fashion Music Architecture Sex|date=2008-05-27|publisher=Rizzoli|isbn=9780847830206|editor-last=Zahm|editor-first=Olivier|location=New York|language=English|editor-last2=Fleiss|editor-first2=Elein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Art critic and curator (1985–1994) ===
During the beginning of the 80’s Zahm started to observe and take an interest in the art world. He liked the notion of “being everywhere and on the move”, following art fairs, meeting artists, educating himself in the universe of contemporary art while immersing himself into its social landscape.  Zahm’s gift of being a charismatic intellectual and having an eye for contemporary art made itself apparent early on. He found himself penning for the three leading art titles at the time [[Artforum|Art Forum]], Art Flash, [[Texte zur Kunst|Texte Zur Kunst]] and [[Art press|Art Presse]] and introduced a then unknown [[Jeff Koons]], [[Martin Kippenberger]], and [[Larry Clark]] to the European art world.   He started traveling to the United States and Japan, realizing he could set up his own operation and work agenda, 24/7. He told [[I-D|I-D magazine]] in 2010: 
[[File:Jan Van Osst, Sans titre, 1993.jpg|thumb|Jan Van Osst, Sans Titre, 1993 at L'Hiver De L'amour in [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville Paris]] curated by Zahm]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Freedom for me came from the art world because it was a place where I could meet the artists. I wanted to be a social critic. I was more interested in the category of intellectual, involving art and politics and writing sometimes. But I didn't want to be a writer necessarily, I just wanted to be part of an intellectual world." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1989, while working at [[Artforum]],  Elien Fleiss, then a young gallery curator received a phone call from Zahm. She was looking for an art critic to write a manifesto against a journalist from a daily newspaper who she felt was writing insanities about contemporary art in general. Zahm agreed to do it, and that was the beginning of the encounter, which then became a love story. Their romance was short-lived, but their professional relationship was fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/fashion/04ZAHM.html|title=Publisher in the Warhol Mold|last=Morgan|first=Spencer|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994, they curated “The Winter of Love,”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/4589&lt;/ref&gt; a hit show for the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Museum of Modern Art in Paris]] that they later took to [[MoMA PS1|P.S. 1]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/4589|title=The Winter of Love (L'Hiver de l'Amour) {{!}} MoMA|website=www.moma.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/france/art-press/20170521/282626032622730|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May of  2017, Zahm published a book in collaboration with Donation Grau titled,' Une avant-garde sans avant-garde'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lespressesdureel.com/ouvrage.php?id=3523|title=Olivier Zahm: Une avant-garde sans avant-garde – Les presses du réel (livre)|website=www.lespressesdureel.com|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/fr/article/3kbd8v/sans-dieu-ni-maitres-petite-lecon-davant-gardisme-par-olivier-zahm|title=sans dieu ni maitre, petite leçon d'avant-gardisme par olivier zahm|date=2017-04-25|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-24|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;The book is a collection of Zahm’s most significant texts written during the last 30 years. It is above all a radical reading of art from the 1990s to the present. The [[anthology]] tries to decipher this chaotic, contradictory, oppressive, and ultra-creative period. The introductions that precede each chapter contextualize the selected texts, and develop the idea that the 1990s invented an avant-garde without an avant-garde, the issues of which are increasing and intensifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lespressesdureel.com/ouvrage.php?id=3523|title=Olivier Zahm:  Une avant-garde sans avant-garde – Les presses du réel (livre)|website=www.lespressesdureel.com|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.fr/Une-avant-garde-sans-Olivier-Zahm/dp/2840665441|title=Une avant-garde sans avant-garde|last=recherche|first=résultats de|last2=Grau|first2=Donatien|date=2017-03-01|publisher=Les Presses du réel|isbn=9782840665441|location=Dijon; Zurich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&amp;id_t=&amp;id_p=18&amp;id_b=2748|title=Olivier Zahm - Une avant-garde sans avant-garde|website=jrp-ringier|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livre.fnac.com/a10494503/Olivier-Zahm-Une-avant-garde-sans-avant-garde|title=Une avant-garde sans avant-garde Essai sur l'art - broché - Olivier Zahm - Achat Livre {{!}} fnac|website=livre.fnac.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/olivier-zahms-new-book-une-avant-garde-sans-avant-garde-co-edited-with-donatien-grau-is-available-now-to-pre-order/|title=Olivier Zahm's new book "Une avant-garde sans avant-garde" co-edited with Donatien Grau is available now to pre-order! - purple DIARY|date=2017-02-23|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early day's of ''Purple'' (1992–2004) ====

Zahm gravitated towards the idea of working with magazines from the conception of his career in art.  In 1992 Zahm and his partner Elien Fleiss printed the first issue of Purple Prose, a Parisian literary art zine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ravelinmagazine.com/posts/les-chroniques-purple/|title=Les Chroniques Purple - Ravelin Magazine|date=2014-08-13|work=Ravelin Magazine|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/PURPLE-PROSE-MAGAZINE-ISSUE-1-1992-OLIVIER-ZAHM-ELEIN-FLEISS-RARE-/121033472335|title=PURPLE PROSE MAGAZINE ISSUE #1 1992 OLIVIER ZAHM, ELEIN FLEISS *RARE*  {{!}} eBay|website=eBay|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to create a new kind of space for artists to present their work and express their ideas; and to design a network through which people working in different disciplines, could easily access new information and each other and contributing to the early 90s alternative indie culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-colour-purple-1249204.html|title=The colour purple|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/creative-class/olivier-zahms-cocktail-of-intellect-sex-and-the-seventies|title=Olivier Zahm’s Cocktail of Intellect, Sex and the Seventies|date=2015-05-27|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahm liked the idea of a color sharing the title with an art magazine. [[Dike Blair]] an American artist suggested the title Purple Prose in reference to the literary term in which a prose text is so extravagent, ornate, or flowery that it breaks the flow and draws excessive attention to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/interview-olivier-zahm-on-the-purple-25th-anniversary.html|title=A French Fashion Editor on the Difference Between Paris, New York, and L.A.|last=Swanson|first=Carl|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the birth of Purple Prose, Zahm created spin-off publications like Purple Sexe, Purple Fiction and Purple Fashion. Zahm aimed at fusing together his two worlds, fashion and art, in creating Purple Fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/1/|title=Purple Prose , #1|website=Magpile|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical issue featured interviews, articles and presentations covering a wide range of topics and disciplines which include; film and video, politics, fashion, architecture, sexuality, science, photography and music. Each issue was built around a loose theme which serves to create a link between subjects-past examples have been: Indian Summer, Violet Violence, Post-Sex. With its international correspondents and cutting-edge design, Purple Prose had the distinctive feel of a truly global art zine. The texts were written in roughly equal parts French and English, without translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adaweb.walkerart.org/purple/info.html|title=Purple Prose|website=adaweb.walkerart.org|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For many years the magazine was associated with a realist esthetic, that of the new photography of the early 1990s- of photographers like [[Juergen Teller]], [[Terry Richardson]], [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], and [[Mario Sorrenti]].  From a visual standpoint, the magazine represented a break from 80s imagery (like [[Richard Avedon]]’s photography for [[Versace]], for example.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/fine-print-the-purple-anthology/?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=2D16E914473B5E10578FBC9B4FEF8E2C&amp;gwt=pay|title=Fine Print {{!}} 'The Purple Anthology'|last=Hruska|first=Jordan|work=T Magazine|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an artistic standpoint, the artists from the early 1990s were raising up against art as a capitalist fetish; they were aligning themselves with the artistic social and political practices of the 1970s-- those of performance, [[video art]], [[Fluxus]], and the conceptual and minimalist [[avant-garde]]. The magazine was an integral part of this burgeoning context, which included the deconstruction of fashion by [[Martin Margiela]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2007-issue-7/retrospective-maison-martin-margiela/|title=Retrospective Maison Martin Margiela - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Comme des Garçons|Comme des Garçsons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/fw-2012-issue-18/rei-kawakubo/|title=Rei Kawakubo - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the return of subtle political art, with that of [[Félix González-Torres|Felix Gonzalez- Torres]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], and [[Philippe Parreno]], among others; photography of [[Juergen Teller]]; and [[Harmony Korine]] and [[Larry Clark]]’s independent filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2013-issue-19/harmony-korine/|title=Harmony Korine - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2013-issue-19/larry-clark/|title=Larry Clark - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media now generally satisfy the need for images, contacts, and creativity. Publishing a magazine has become so expensive… An actual print object like Purple is a luxury item, which is why new alternative magazines don’t last more than a few years, are often bought, or simply disappear. Doing a luxury magazine today is one of the paradoxes of the Instagram era, when such things cost nothing… A magazine is not an ego trip… It’s a collective work by a group of creative people who believe in the artistic value of the print media and share a similar vision. (Thanks to all of them!) Every image, every single text, the choice of paper, the layout, even the choice of typefaces matters. Everything matters… Purple is made to last. Purple is made to capture a moment every season… In this period of global Internet obsession and digital amnesia, I think that means something&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/purple-25th-anniversary-issue-is-out-now/|title=PURPLE 25TH ANNIVERSARY ISSUE IS OUT NOW! - purple DIARY|date=2017-09-05|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2017 Purple moved their US based headquarters and offices from [[New York City]] to [[Los Angeles]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/business-news/media/purples-l-a-times-1202780271/|title=Purple’s L.A.

In 2009 [[Chanel]] launched its very first magazine: 31 Rue Cambon. Chanel’s goal was to combine sales and information. [[Karl Lagerfeld]] delegated the artistic direction of the magazine which was not available to the public, but instead only the private cliental of Chanel to Zahm &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tendances-de-mode.com/2009/11/17/1549-31-rue-cambon-le-magazine-chanel|title=31 Rue Cambon : le magazine Chanel - Tendances de Mode|website=www.tendances-de-mode.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/the-new-chanel-magazine-31-rue-cambon-issue-3/|title=THE NEW CHANEL MAGAZINE, 31 RUE CAMBON, issue #3 - purple DIARY|date=2011-02-05|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a5892/olivier-zahm-made-a-corporate-mag-for-chanel-16120/|title=Olivier Zahm Made A 'Corporate Mag' for Chanel|date=2011-02-23|work=ELLE|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Zahm designed a fanzine for [[Gucci]]’s FW2019 collection presented at [[Le Palace]] in Paris. The magazine was the 14th issue of Le Palace Magazine. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gucci.com/us/en/st/stories/inspirations-and-codes/article/spring-summer-2019-le-palace-magazine-fanzine|title=A new issue of Le Palace’s fanzine celebrating Gucci Spring Summer 2019 show by Alessandro Michele, with Purple’s Olivier Zahm and photos by Martin Parr.|website=www.gucci.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/french-press-gucci-releases-new-issue-of-cult-fanzine-le-palace|title=Gucci Caps Off Its Paris Takeover by Releasing a New Issue of the Cult Fanzine, Le Palace|work=Vogue|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zahm credited Lagerfeld for reigniting his sentiment for taking photos in 2005.  Zahm told WWD in an interview dedicated to Purple’s 25th Anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/eye/people/purple-reign-10970276/|title=Purple Reign|last=Foreman|first=Katya|date=2017-09-05|work=WWD|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“He (Lagerfeld) was buying these little digital cameras at the time, Sony Cyber-shots, a little pocket-size, flat, digital camera. He had a pile of them on his table and said: “Take this, if you’ll use it.” We had this long discussion about photography and I said, “Karl how can you want to be a photographer when you were friends with [[Helmut Newton]] because, me, I have [[Juergen Teller]] in my generation and I haven’t been able to do photography since I’ve known him, because he’s the best.” And he said: “Olivier, shut up. You don’t understand, photography is not about getting the right picture, it’s about documenting your everyday life. Remember [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]], do you think he was a good photographer? He always had a camera on him. Do like Warhol, do like me: Don’t let a day go by without taking a picture.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/eye/people/purple-reign-10970276/|title=Purple Reign|last=Foreman|first=Katya|date=2017-09-05|work=WWD|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2009, he began documenting his late-night partying escapades in high-contrast black-and-white photographs which appeared on Purple Diary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/09/fashion-s-naughtiest-photographer-olivier-zahm|title=Fashion’s Naughtiest Photographer, Olivier Zahm|last=Jones|first=Justin|date=2014-09-09|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a notorious photo blog that would become the seed for a full Purple website.

The '''Parable of the Ten Virgins''', also known as the '''Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins''' or the '''Parable of the ten bridesmaids''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Bible]]: Matthew 25:1-13&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the well known [[parables of Jesus]]. According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 25|25:1-13]], the five virgins who are prepared for the bridegroom's arrival are rewarded, while the five who are not prepared are [[disowned]]. The parable has a clear [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] theme: be prepared for the [[Day of Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;John Barton, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3surkLVdw3UC&amp;pg=PA878 The Oxford Bible Commentary]'', Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-875500-7}}, p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the most popular parables in the [[Middle Ages]], with enormous influence on [[Gothic art]], [[sculpture]] and the [[Sacred architecture|architecture]] of German and French [[cathedrals]].

==Narrative according to the [[Gospel of Matthew]]==
In the Parable of the Ten Virgins, [[Jesus]] tells a story about a party of virgins, perhaps bridesmaids &lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt; or torchbearers for a procession,&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; chosen to participate in a [[Jewish wedding|wedding]]. Each of the ten virgins is carrying a lamp or [[torch]]&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; as they await the coming of the [[bridegroom]], which they expect at some time during the night. Five of the virgins are wise and have brought oil for their lamps. Five are foolish and have only brought their lamps.

At midnight, all the virgins hear the call to come out to meet the bridegroom. Realising their lamps have gone out, the foolish virgins ask the wise ones for oil, but they refuse, saying that there will certainly not (Greek ''ou mē'')&lt;ref name="JN"&gt;John Nolland, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9cL_kpdUE-oC&amp;pg=PA1006 The Gospel of Matthew: A commentary on the Greek text]'', Eerdmans, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8028-2389-0}}, pp. 1006–1008.&lt;/ref&gt; be enough for them to share. While the foolish virgins are away trying to get more oil, the bridegroom arrives. The wise virgins then accompany him to the celebration. The others arrive too late and are excluded.

{{quotation|Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, "Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!" Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. The foolish said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out." But the wise answered, saying, "What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves." While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us." But he answered, "Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you." Watch therefore, for you don't know the day nor the hour in which the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]] is coming.|Matthew 25:1-13, [[World English Bible]]}}

==Interpretations==
The parable is one of a sequence of responses to a question in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 24|24:3]]:

{{quotation|And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?|Matthew 24:3, [[King James Version]]}}

Other parables in this sequence include the [[parable of the budding fig tree]] (Matthew 24:32–35) and the [[parable of the Faithful Servant]] (Matthew 24:42–51). The parable of the Ten Virgins reinforces the call for readiness in the face of the uncertain time of this second "coming."&lt;ref name="RTF"&gt;R. T. France, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ttTgacXnLV8C&amp;pg=PA349 The Gospel According to Matthew: An introduction and commentary]'', Eerdmans, 1985, {{ISBN|0-8028-0063-7}}, pp. 349-352.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a "watching parable."&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: PARABLES].&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[parable of the Lost Coin]], it is a parable about women which immediately follows, and makes the same point as, a preceding parable about men.&lt;ref&gt;The [[parable of the Lost Coin]] follows the [[parable of the Lost Sheep]] and this parable follows the [[parable of the Faithful Servant]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francken, Hieronymus the Younger - Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins - c. 1616.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This painting by Hieronymus [[Francken]] the Younger (c. 1616) gives a moralistic interpretation of the parable.]]
In this parable, Jesus Christ is the bridegroom,&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; echoing the [[Old Testament]] image of God as the bridegroom in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Jeremiah#Chapter 2|2:2]] and similar passages.&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt; The awaited event is the [[Second Coming of Christ]].&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; [[R. T. France]] writes that the parable is "a warning addressed specifically to those inside the professing  church who are not to assume that their future is unconditionally assured."&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt;

The parable does not criticise the virgins for sleeping, since both groups do that,&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;[[Ben Witherington III|Ben Witherington]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xGePuntVBhgC&amp;pg=PA43 Women in the Ministry of Jesus: A study of Jesus' attitudes to women and their roles as reflected in his earthly life]'', Cambridge University Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-521-34781-5}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; but for being unprepared as they brought no oil (it is unclear as to whether the foolish virgins succeed in purchasing any oil that night:&lt;ref&gt;John R. Donahue, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ArODuoyndAC&amp;pg=PA134 Hearing the Word of God: Reflections on the Sunday Readings: Year A]'', Liturgical Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8146-2785-4}}, p. 134: "We never know whether they found it, but when they return, the feast has started and the door is barred."&lt;/ref&gt; most shops would not have been open&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig S. Keener]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8C2Y_HaL5W0C&amp;pg=PA597 The Gospel of Matthew: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary]'', Eerdmans, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8028-6498-8}}, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Dwight Pentecost]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k_VVxjLkN2UC&amp;pg=PA150 The Parables of Jesus: Lessons in life from the Master Teacher]'', Kregel Publications, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8254-3458-0}}, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The parable is not written in praise of virginity,&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; and indeed [[Louis of Granada]], in his ''The Sinner's Guide'' of 1555, writes "No one makes intercession with the Bridegroom for the five foolish virgins who, after despising the pleasures of the flesh and stifling in their hearts the fire of concupiscence, nay, after observing the great counsel of virginity, neglected the precept of humility and became inflated with pride on account of their virginity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis of Granada]], ''[http://www.ewtn.org/library/SPIRIT/granada1-9.htm The Sinner's Guide]'', 1555.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spencer W. Kimball]] gave an [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] perspective on the difference between the wise and the foolish virgins, and why they could not share the oil: "This was not selfishness or unkindness. The kind of oil that is needed to illuminate the way and light up the darkness is not shareable. How can one share obedience to the principle of tithing; a mind at peace from righteous living; an accumulation of knowledge? How can one share faith or testimony? How can one share attitudes or chastity.... Each must obtain that kind of oil for himself .... In the parable, oil can be purchased at the market. In our lives the oil of preparedness is accumulated drop by drop in righteous living."&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer W. Kimball]], ''Faith Precedes the Miracle'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LDS Business College - 14Jul2010 - LDS interpretation "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldsbc.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1235:preparation-a-learning-model-discovery&amp;catid=9:devotionals&amp;Itemid=554|title=LDS Business College Devotional - Preparation: A Learning Model Discovery|last=Henrie|first=Lynda|date=July 14, 2010|publisher=[[LDS Business College]]|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
While "a considerable number of exegetes in fact suppose that the parable of 'The Wise and Foolish Virgins' ultimately goes back to Jesus,"&lt;ref name="JL"&gt;[[Jan Lambrecht (New Testament scholar)|Jan Lambrecht]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PXfgMs0FIbgC&amp;pg=PA204 Out of the Treasure: The parables in the Gospel of Matthew]'', Peeters, 1991, {{ISBN|90-6831-161-1}}, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; some Bible commentators, because of its [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] nature,  doubt that Jesus ever told this parable and that, instead, it is a parable created by the very early church. A large majority of fellows on the [[Jesus Seminar]], for example, designated the parable as merely similar to something Jesus might have said or simply inauthentic ("gray" or "black").&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. ''The Five Gospels.'' Harper:San Francisco, 1993, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars believe that this parable has only been lightly edited, and is an excellent example of Jesus' skill in telling parables.&lt;ref&gt;[[Klyne Snodgrass]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kFyt0VhErywC&amp;pg=PA505 Stories with Intent: A comprehensive guide to the parables of Jesus]'', Eerdmans, 2008, {{ISBN|0-8028-4241-0}}, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; The parable occurs in all ancient [[New Testament manuscripts]], with only slight variations in some words.&lt;ref&gt;United Bible Societies, ''The Greek New Testament'', 1983, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liturgical use==
In the [[Catholic Church]], the parable is the Gospel reading for the 32nd Sunday in [[Ordinary Time]] in Cycle A; in the extraordinary form of the Roman rite (Tridentine Mass), the parable is the Gospel reading for Masses of virgins and virgin martyrs (including, by coincidence, St. [[Cecilia of Rome|Cecily]] on November 22 and St. [[Catherine of Alexandria|Catherine]] on November 25, giving it a certain prominence at the fitting time of the end of the liturgical year). The parable is the Gospel reading for the 27th Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]] in the traditional [[Lutheran]] lectionary. In the [[Revised Common Lectionary]], the parable is read in ''[[Proper (liturgy)|Proper]] 27 (32nd Sunday in Ordinary Time)''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=168 |website=https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/ |publisher=Vanderbilt University |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]] the parable is the main theme of [[Holy Monday]]. A special Church service enacting the parable of the ten virgins is celebrated on Tuesday evening of the [[Holy Week]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the parable is used to commemorate the Sunday [[vespers]] service of [[Nahire]]. Nahire symbolizes our lives in accordance with the 10 virgins that only through a life of dedication, vigilance, fasting and prayer can we be ready for the Bridegroom himself.

==In the arts==
This parable has been a popular subject for painting, sculpture, music, and drama.

[[File:Schadow,FW-Die klugen und törichten Jungfrauen-1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], ''The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins'', 1838–1842 (detail), [[Städel|Städel Museum]],  Frankfurt am Main.]]

===Painting===
The parable has been depicted in several paintings, including altarpieces in Northern Europe.  A recent example, from 1954, is by [[Tove Jansson]]. In the 19th century, the artists of the [[Nazarene movement]] also took up this theme.

===Sculpture===
Sculptures of the wise and foolish virgins were a common motif in mediaeval ecclesial architecture in Europe, especially for the decoration of doorways, and carved figures representing them appear on many of the mediaeval churches and cathedrals of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], including:
[[File:France Strasbourg Cathedral Wise virgins and Christ.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Three wise virgins appear with [[Christ]] on [[Strasbourg Cathedral]].]]
* [[Amiens Cathedral]]
* [[Auxerre Cathedral]]
* [[Laon Cathedral]]
* [[Notre Dame de Paris]]
* [[Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims]]
* [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]
* [[Erfurt Cathedral]]
* [[Cathedral of Magdeburg|Magdeburg Cathedral]]

The virgins are also depicted on cathedrals in Switzerland and other countries; the portal leading into the main church of [[Hovhannavank]] (1216-1221) in Armenia has carved scenes from the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins.

The ubiquity of such sculptures has inspired fictional descriptions, such as the carvings on the doors of Kingsbridge cathedral in [[Ken Follett|Ken Follett's]] novel ''[[World Without End (Follett novel)|World Without End]]'', set in the [[Late Middle Ages]].

===Music===
Several religious musical compositions have been inspired by the parable. Its message was formed into a [[hymn]], "[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme]]", by [[Philipp Nicolai]], which [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] used for his [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|chorale cantata]] [[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140|''Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme'', BWV 140]]. The parable forms the theme for several hymns, including the 19th century hymn "Behold the Bridegroom Cometh" by [[George Frederick Root]], which begins:
[[File:StAnnen DieKlugenJungfrauen.jpg|thumb|The five wise virgins together with a personification of the Church (c. 1400), [[St. Anne's Museum Quarter, Lübeck#St. Anne's museum (Museum for history of art and culture)|St. Anne's museum]], Lübeck]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our lamps are trimmed and burning,&lt;br&gt;
Our robes are white and clean;&lt;br&gt;
We’ve tarried for the Bridegroom,&lt;br&gt;
Oh, may we enter in?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Wise Virgins]] is a one-act ballet, written in 1941 by [[William Walton]], based on the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], with choreography by Frederick Ashton.  It is based on the biblical Parable of the Ten Virgins.

"[[Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning]]" is a [[gospel blues]] song based on the parable. It has been recorded by such artists as [[Blind Willie Johnson]], [[Pearly Brown|Reverend Pearly Brown]], and [[Reverend Gary Davis|Rev. "Blind" Gary Davis]].

Non-religious music has also used the parable as a theme, such as the ballet "The wise and the foolish virgins" by Swedish composer [[Kurt Atterberg]] (1887–1974), written in 1920.

A reference is made to the parable in the 2002 [[Johnny Cash]] song "[[The Man Comes Around (song)|The Man Comes Around]]," which draws heavily on the Bible.

On the 1974 album by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] - ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', a reference to the parable is made in the song ''[[The Carpet Crawlers]]'': "and the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright."

American composer [[Emily Freeman-Brown]] has also composed an [[oratorio]] based on the parable. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Drama===
From early Christian times, the story of the ten virgins has been told as a [[mystery play]]. [[Methodius of Olympus|St Methodius]] wrote the ''Banquet of the Ten Virgins'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0623.htm Banquet of the Ten Virgins]''&lt;/ref&gt; a mystery play in Greek. ''[[Sponsus]]'', a mid-11th-century play, was performed in both Latin and Occitan. The German play ''[[Ludus de decem virginibus]]'' was first performed on 4 May 1321. There was also a Dutch play of the late Middle Ages.

'''''Pastoral Pleasure''''' (French - ''Le Plaisir pastoral'') is a c.1714-1716 [[fête galante]] painting by [[Jean Antoine Watteau]], now in the [[musée Condé]] in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=00000076655|title=JOCONDE entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://srv225.hosteur.com/musee/conde02/voir.xsp?id=00101-4064&amp;qid=sdx_q0&amp;n=7&amp;e=|title=Museum catalogue entry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other Watteau paintings survive with extremely similar compositions - the largest and most finished is ''[[The Shepherds (Watteau)|The Shepherds]]'' ([[Schloss Charlottenburg]]), whilst another seems to be a reworking of the Charlottenburg painting (Wildenstein collection). [[Pierre Rosenberg]] argues that the Chantilly version was an oil sketch for the Charlottenburg work. Three other copies of the Chantilly version appeared in 19th and 20th century auctions, but their locations are now unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{fr icon}} Nicole Garnier-Pelle, ''Chantilly, musée Condé. Peintures du xviiie siècle'', Réunion des musées nationaux, coll. « Inventaire des collections publiques de France » (no 38), 1995, 222 p. (OCLC 300738204), p. 149-151 (notice 111).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chantilly work belonged to [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]], a great Watteau collector - it is mentioned as being in his house from at least 1729, around which time [[Nicolas-Henri Tardieu]] made an engraving after it. On 1 February 1775 it was sold after Mariette's death. According to Edmond Goncourt, it was resold in Paris on 11 May 1789, entering the marquis de Maison's collection, which was acquired in its entirety by the [[Henri d'Orléans (1822-1897)|duc d'Aumale]] in 1868 whilst in exile in the United Kingdom. After moving back to France he hung the work in his [[château de Chantilly]], where it still hangs in the [[musée Condé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Nicole Garnier-Pelle, ''Chantilly, musée Condé. Peintures du xviiie siècle'', Réunion des musées nationaux, coll. « Inventaire des collections publiques de France » (no 38), 1995, 222 p. (OCLC 300738204), p. 149 (notice 111).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
It shows French aristocrats dressed as shepherds - one couple dances to the right and a young couple court each other on a balcony to the left. The painting also includes real peasants in simpler clothes and with simpler gestures, making it easier to distinguish between them and the aristocrats than in other Watteau paintings such as ''The Shepherds''.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Wyngaard, "Switching Codes: Class, Clothing, and Cultural Change in the Works of Marivaux and Watteau", ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, vol. 33, no. 4, Summer 2000, p. 523-541&lt;/ref&gt; Several details are directly inspired by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s paintings - the musician, the man next to him, the shepherd embracing the woman next to him and the dog in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Nicole Garnier-Pelle, ''Chantilly, musée Condé.

'''Paul Virilio''' ({{IPA-fr|viʁiljo|lang}}; 4 January 1932 – 10 September 2018)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.liberation.fr/debats/2018/09/18/mort-de-paul-virilio-penseur-de-l-acceleration-du-monde_1679527 Mort de Paul Virilio, penseur de l'accélération du monde] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French [[Culture theory|cultural theorist]], [[Urban planning|urbanist]], and [[aesthetic]] philosopher. He is best known for his writings about [[technology]] as it has developed in relation to speed and power, with diverse references to architecture, the arts, the city and the military.

According to two geographers, Virilio was a "historian of warfare, technology and photography, a philosopher of architecture, military strategy and cinema, and a politically engaged provocative commentator on history, terrorism, mass media and human-machine relations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Luke]] &amp; [[Gearóid Ó Tuathail]] (2000) "Thinking Geopolitical Space: The spatiality of war, speed and vision in the work of Paul Virilio", in ''Thinking Space'', [[Mike Crang]] &amp; [[Nigel Thrift]] editors, Routledge, page 361&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Paul Virilio was born in [[Paris]] in 1932 to an Italian communist father and a Catholic [[Bretons|Breton]] mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berthou|first1=Benoît|last2=Chautard|first2=Sophie|last3=Guislain|first3=Gilbert|title=100 hommes qui ont fait la France du XXe siècle|date=2003|publisher=Studyrama|page=193|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=NqCdJX6KuPAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the northern coastal French region of Brittany. The Second World War made a big impression on him as the city of [[Nantes]] fell victim to the German [[Blitzkrieg]], became a port for the German navy and was bombarded by British and American planes. The "war was his university". After training at the [[École des métiers d'art]], Virilio specialised in stained-glass artwork, and worked alongside [[Henri Matisse]] in churches in Paris. In 1950, he converted to [[Christianity]]. After being conscripted into the army during the [[Algerian war of independence]], Virilio attended lectures in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name=school&gt;[http://www.egs.edu/faculty/paul-virilio Paul Virilio]. Faculty page at [[European Graduate School]]. Accessed: March 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Virilio conducted a [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenological]] inquiry into military space and the organization of territory, particularly concerning the [[Atlantic Wall]]—the 15,000 Nazi bunkers built during [[World War II]] along the coastline of France and designed to repel any Allied assault. In 1963 he began collaborating with the architect [[Claude Parent]] and formed the [[Architecture Principe]] group (Among the small group of interns were the architects Francois Seigneur and [[Jean Nouvel]]). After participating in the [[May 1968 protests in France|May 1968 uprising in Paris]], Virilio was nominated Professor by the students at the [[École Spéciale d'Architecture]]. In 1973 he became Director of Studies. In the same year, Virilio became director of the magazine ''[[L'Espace Critique]]''. In 1975 he co-organized the [[Bunker Archéologie]] exhibition at the [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Decorative Arts Museum]] in Paris, a collection of texts and images relating to the Atlantic Wall. Since then he has been widely published, translated and anthologised.

Since 1998, Virilio was teaching intensive seminars at [[European Graduate School]].&lt;ref name=school/&gt; His last projects involved working with homeless groups in Paris and building the first Museum of the Accident.&lt;ref name=school/&gt;

==Theoretical arguments==

===The war model===
{{unsourced section|date=September 2014}}
Virilio developed what he called the "war model" of the modern city and of human society in general and is the inventor of the term 'dromology', meaning the logic of speed that is the foundation of technological society. His major works include ''[[War and Cinema]]'', ''Speed and Politics'' and ''The Information Bomb'' in which he argues, among many other things, that military projects and technologies drive history.  Like some other cultural theorists, he rejects labels - including 'cultural theorist' - yet he has been linked by others with post-structuralism and postmodernism. Some people describe Virilio's work as being positioned in the realm of the 'hypermodern'.  He has repeatedly affirmed his links with [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], for example, and offers humanist critiques of [[modernist art movements]] such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]]. Throughout his books the political and theological themes of [[anarchism]], [[pacifism]] and [[Catholicism]] reappear as central influences to his self-proclaimed 'marginal' approach to the question of technology.  His work has been compared to that of [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Jacques Ellul]],  and others. Virilio was also an [[urbanist]]. After having been a longtime resident of the city of Paris, he moved to [[La Rochelle]].

Virilio's predictions about 'logistics of perception' - the use of images and information in war - (in ''[[War and Cinema]]'', 1984) were so accurate that during the [[Gulf War]] he was invited to discuss his ideas with French military officers. Virilio argued that it was a 'world war in miniature'.

===The integral accident===

Virilio believed that [[technology]] cannot exist without the potential for accidents. For example, Virilio argued that the invention of the locomotive also contained the invention of [[derailment]].&lt;ref name="shipwreck" /&gt; He saw the Accident as a rather negative growth of [[social positivism]] and [[scientific progress]]. He believed the growth of technology, namely [[television]], separates us directly from the events of real space and real time. In it he suggested we lose wisdom and sight of our immediate horizon and resort to the indirect horizon of our dissimulated environment. From this angle, the Accident can be mentally pictured as a sort of "fractal meteorite" whose impact is prepared in the propitious darkness, a landscape of events concealing future collisions. [[Aristotle]] claimed that "there is no science of the accident", but Virilio disagreed, pointing to the growing credibility of [[simulator]]s designed to escape the accident— which he argued is an industry that is born from the unholy marriage of post-WW2 science and the [[military-industrial complex]].
:The first deterrence, nuclear deterrence, is presently being superseded by the second deterrence: a type of deterrence based on what I call 'the information bomb' associated with the new weaponry of information and communications technologies. Thus, in the very near future, and I stress this important point, it will no longer be war that is the continuation of politics by other means, it will be what I have dubbed 'the integral accident' that is the continuation of politics by other means.&lt;ref name=kosovo&gt;John Armitage (October 18, 2000) [http://www.ctheory.net/text_file.asp?pick=132 The Kosovo War Took Place In Orbital Space: Paul Virilio in Conversation], ''Ctheory''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dromology===

''[[wikt:δρόμος|Dromos]]'' is an Ancient Greek noun for race or racetrack, which Virilio applied the activity of racing (Virilio 1977:47). It is with this meaning in mind that he coined the term 'dromology', which he defined as the "science (or logic) of speed“. Dromology is important when considering the structuring of society in relation to warfare and modern media. He noted that the speed at which something happens may change its essential nature, and that which moves with speed quickly comes to dominate that which is slower.  'Whoever controls the territory possesses it. Possession of territory is not primarily about laws and contracts, but first and foremost a matter of movement and circulation.' &lt;ref name=kosovo/&gt;

===Logistics of perception===

In contemporary warfare, logistics does not just imply the movement of personnel, tanks, fuel and so on, but also the movement of images both to and from the battlefield. Virilio talked a lot about the creation of [[CNN]] and the concept of the newshound. The newshound will capture images which will then be sent to CNN, which may then be broadcast to the public. This movement of images can start a conflict (Virilio uses the example of the events following the broadcasting of the [[Rodney King]] footage).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Virilio (1995) ''The Art of the Motor'', Julie Rose translator, page 20, [[University of Minnesota Press]] {{ISBN|0-8166-2571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logistics of perception relates also to the televising of military maneuvers and the images of conflict that are watched not only by people at home, but also by the military personnel involved in the conflict. The 'field of battle' also exists as a 'field of perception'.

===War of movement===

For Virilio, the [[transition from feudalism to capitalism]] was driven not primarily by the politics of wealth and production techniques but by the mechanics of war. Virilio argued that the traditional feudal fortified city disappeared because of the increasing sophistication of weapons and possibilities for warfare. For Virilio, the concept of siege warfare became rather a war of movement. In ''[[Speed and Politics]]'', he argues that 'history progresses at the speed of its weapons systems'.

==Reception==
Virilio was one of the many cultural theorists (and other [[postmodernists]]) criticized by physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] in 1997 for what they characterize as misunderstanding and misuse of science and mathematics.&lt;ref name=SoBr&gt;[[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] (1998) ''[[Fashionable Nonsense|Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science]]'', first published in French as ''Impostures Intellectuelles'' in 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan (2008) ''[[Beyond the Hoax|Beyond the Hoax: Science, Philosophy and Culture]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Virilio's works are the subject of chapter 10 of [[Fashionable Nonsense]]. Their criticism consists of a series of quotes (often long) from Virilio's works, and then explanations of how Vilirio confuses basic physics concepts and abuses scientific terminology, to the point of absurdity. In the authors' words:

:The writings of Paul Virilio revolve principally around the themes of technology, communication, and speed. They contain a plethora of references to physics, particularly the theory of relativity. Though Virilio’s sentences are slightly more meaningful than those of Deleuze-Guattari, what is presented as "science" is a mixture of monumental confusions and wild fantasies. Furthermore, his analogies between physics and social questions are the most arbitrary imaginable, when he does not simply become intoxicated with his own words. We confess our sympathy with many of Virilio’s political and social views; but the cause is not, alas, helped by his pseudo-physics.&lt;ref name=SoBr/&gt;{{rp|169}}

A criticism of a passage often reads something like this:
:Here Virilio mixes up [[velocity]] (vitesse) and [[acceleration]], the two basic concepts of [[kinematics]] (the description of motion), which are introduced and carefully distinguished at the beginning of every introductory physics course.[221] Perhaps this confusion isn’t worth stressing; but for a purported specialist in the philosophy of speed, it is nonetheless a bit surprising.&lt;ref name=SoBr/&gt;{{rp|170}}

They end their chapter with a long quote followed by this comment:
:This paragraph — which in the French original is a single 193-word sentence, whose "poetry" is unfortunately not fully captured by the translation — is the most perfect example of diarrhea of the pen that we have ever encountered. And as far as we can see, it means precisely nothing.&lt;ref name=SoBr/&gt;{{rp|175}}

A book-length cricism of Virilio’s work to 2004 was written by [[Steve Redhead]].&lt;ref name=SR&gt;[[Steve Redhead]] (2004) ''Paul Virilio: Theorist for an Accelerated Culture'', [[Edinburgh University Press]] {{ISBN|0-7486-1927-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed:
:His scattergun writing style is not always easy to follow, often provoking disorientation and dislocation at the very least. Insights, personal memories, detailed histories, major theoretical leaps and banalities sit side by side.&lt;ref name=SR/&gt;{{rp|137}}
He also notes that Virilio does not pass the grade in [[academic studies]]:
:Reading Virilio thoroughly does leave the reader with the feeling of many dislocated, undeveloped ideas swirling around often at the level of great generality. The content is often not particularly logical if viewed from a conventional academic perspective in the human or social sciences.&lt;ref name=SR/&gt;{{rp|138}}
However, for Law and Popular Culture, Redhead concedes Virilio as a factor:
:Paul Virilio’s writing have long had a major role in the theoretical socio-legal studies subdiscipline of law and popular culture which has operated at the intersection of [[critical legal studies]] and [[cultural studies]] for over two decades.&lt;ref name=SR/&gt;{{rp|149}}

In 2014 an analyst of security, technology and global politics noted:
:Virilio is unlikely to be read in the 'mainstream' of academia (although one might find his works on the reading lists of a [[military academy]]).&lt;ref name=Lacy&gt;Mark Lacy (2014) ''Security, Technology and Global Politics, thinking with Virilio'', [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|978-0-415-57604-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}
He credits Virilio with balancing the propaganda of progress against the management of fear at some cost:
:Virilio draws on and develops points that are made by many critical thinkers from (predominantly) the twentieth century (most notably [[Walter Benjamin]]), assembling ideas in new contexts, creating a vision of the world through concepts and language that is often unsettling, a (re)description that makes the world feel strange and unfamiliar. Virilio’s often alien-sounding concepts attempt to enable us to see the world anew, to view a world that is presented to us in terms of fear and progress as something alien (and alienating), to give a form to feelings and suspicions that remain vague, unclear, uncertain, out of place.&lt;ref name=Lacy/&gt;{{rp|17}}

==Quotes==
: 'War was my university. Everything has proceeded from there.'&lt;ref&gt;James Der Derian. [https://web.archive.org/web/20030504135718/http://www.watsoninstitute.org/infopeace/vy2k/futurewar.cfm Future War. A discussion with Paul Virilio] In: virtually2k. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

: 'The invention of the ship was also the invention of the shipwreck.'&lt;ref name=shipwreck&gt;There are a least two different instances of this quote: 1) "When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck; when you invent the plane you also invent the plane crash; and when you invent electricity, you invent electrocution...Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress." (''Politics of the Very Worst'', New York: Semiotext(e), 1999, p. 89); 2) “To invent the sailing ship or the steamer is to invent the shipwreck. To invent the train is to invent the rail accident of derailment.  To invent the family automobile is to produce the pile-up on the highway.” (''The Original Accident'', Cambridge: Polity, 2007, p. 10).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[speed of light]] and [[globalization]] figure in Virilio's writing. At one point he wrote:
: 'The speed of light does not merely transform the world. It becomes the world. Globalization is the speed of light.'&lt;ref name=kosovo/&gt;
Virilio is also quoted as saying,
:'There is no such thing as globalization, there is only virtualization. What is being effectively globalized by instantaneity is time.'&lt;ref name=SR/&gt;{{rp|149}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">A '''re-recording''' is a recording produced following a new performance of a work of music. This is most commonly, but not exclusively, by a popular artist or group. It differs from a [[reissue]], which involves a second or subsequent release of a previously-recorded piece of music.

Re-recordings are often produced decades after the original recordings were released, usually under contract terms more favorable to the artists. This is especially common among acts that originally agreed to [[Recording contract|contracts]] that would be considered unfair and exploitative today.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/05/re_recordings_runaway_and_other_classic_songs_redone_in_the_studio_can_we.html| last=Mandl| first=Dave| title=Same old song?

[[Jeff Lynne]] of the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] released [[Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra|a solo best-of album]] with new versions of previous hits like "[[Mr. Blue Sky]]", the original of which Lynne described as "[not] quite how I meant it".&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/20/artists-rerecording-old-hits |date=October 19, 2012 |last=Pattison | first=Louis |title=From Patrick Wolf to Def Leppard, why do artists keep re-recording their old hits? |newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-recordings commonly appear in [[online music store]]s and [[streaming media|streaming]] services, such as the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Spotify]];&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt; the original recording may or may not be available.

[[File:1940 Kyiv Art School graduation class.jpg|thumb|The first graduation class from the Shevchenko State Art School, 1940.]]
'''Taras Shevchenko State Art School''' ({{lang-uk|Державна художня середня школа імені Тараса Шевченка}}) is a [[Selective school|selective high school]] (5th through 12th grade) specializing in [[fine arts]] (painting, sculpture and architecture), in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; 
The school is part of the complex that also includes schools of [[ballet]] and [[music]]. It is located adjoining a historic park overlooking the Southern end of [[Babi Yar]].

The school was established on August 12, 1937, and was originally located at 2 Volodymyrska Street, Kiev (now the [[National Museum of the History of Ukraine]]). The first pupils graduated in 1940. Due to the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, all the graduates from this class as well as the directors of the school were conscripted into the [[Soviet Army]] and sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

There are many notable artists among its graduates.

'''Sophie the Giraffe''' is a [[teether]] – a toy for [[teething]] infants to chew on – in the form of a {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=mid|-high}} [[Hevea brasiliensis|hevea rubber]] [[giraffe]].&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Levin|first=Josh|title=I'm French, Chew on Me: Sophie the Giraffe, the European teething toy that's sweeping America.|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/number_1/2011/03/im_french_chew_on_me.html|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=[[Slate magazine]]|date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The toy has been made in France (as ''Sophie la Girafe'') since 1961, first in [[Asnières-sur-Oise]], near [[Paris]], by [[Delacoste]], then from 1991 by [[Vulli]], based in [[Rumilly, Haute-Savoie|Rumilly]] in the [[French Alps]]. Its name refers to its launch on 25 May 1961, the feast day of [[Madeleine Sophie Barat|Saint Madeline Sophie Barat]]. It has achieved national icon status in France, according to ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', with more sold each year (816,000 in 2010) than babies are born (796,000).

Sophie is also popular in the United States, where the toy has been available for decades and even appeared in the movie ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'' (1987), and where it has become the best-selling baby product offered by [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt; Launched in [[California]] in the trendy [[Hollywood]] area,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/features/home/la-hm-sophie3-2009oct03,0,2251259.story ''How Sophie the giraffe became a status teether''] in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' October 3rd 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; it became popular through [[word of mouth]], especially on Amazon.com since 2008. The reasons proposed for this success are that it is marketed as eco-friendly&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; and a growing consumer mistrust of the security and health standards of products made in China since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/business/worldbusiness/19toys.html?_r=1 ''As More Toys Are Recalled, Trail Ends in China ''], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 19th 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Sophie was recognized as Product of the Year by the [[American Specialty Toy Retailing Association]].

The November 2011 issue of German consumer magazine ''Öko-Test'' reported that Sophie the Giraffe should not be sold in Germany due to a violation of statutory limit values for [[nitrosatable]] substances. The test found 0.781&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, while the German ''Bedarfsgegenständeverordnung'' (BedGgstV) consumer food and product standard provides for a limit of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. Vulli initially said that another regulation applies, the EU guidelines for toys, with a limit of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, and obtained a preliminary injunction of the District Court in Berlin banning publication of ''Öko-Test''{{'}}s report. The story was removed from the magazine's website. This injunction was lifted in January 2012. The ''Chemische und Veterinäruntersuchungsamt Stuttgart'' (CVUA) reproduced ''Öko-Test''{{'}}s claims resulting in the German [[Technischer Überwachungsverein]] (TÜV) safety agency pressing charges against Vulli, and ''Öko-Test'' restored the online report to their web site. Vulli responded by recalling Sophie the Giraffe and similar products from German retailers, and offering to exchange it with one produced on or after March 2012, which Vulli says adhere to the stricter German limit.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://oekotest.de/cgi/index.cgi?artnr=11331;gartnr=90;bernr=07;co= ''Öko-Test''{{'}}s summary of the claims, response, court actions and recall (in German)]",''''Öko-Test'''', June 9, 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017073422/http://oekotest.de/cgi/index.cgi?artnr=11331;gartnr=90;bernr=07;co= |date=October 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spectrum Awards''' were established in 1994 by Cathy Fenner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?10622|title = Cathy Fenner - Summary Bibliography|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arnie Fenner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?10621|title = Arnie Fenner - Summary Bibliography|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize the best in fantasy, science fiction, and horror artwork created each year.

In 1993, they announced a call for entries to the arts community to submit work. Beginning in 1994, works selected by jury have been compiled in the anthology, '''''Spectrum – The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art''''', published annually by Underwood Books. The jury selects two award winners (Gold and Silver) in each category while the Spectrum Fantastic Art advisory board selects the recipient of the Grand Master award.

Spectrum Award winners receive an award statue and a full page showcasing their award winning artwork in the anthology. Starting with Spectrum 21, the artist also receives an additional full page dedicated to them. The second page includes a photograph of the artist, an excerpt from their award acceptance speech and a short biography.

Spectrum is open to every artist who wishes to participate and can adhere to the competition's rules: international entrants are welcome. Students, fine artists, and illustrators are all treated equally. There are no limits on the number of pieces an artist can submit and there is no pre-screening prior to judging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://spectrumfantasticart.com/about.php|title = Spectrum, About Us|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnie and Cathy Fenner, who for twenty years had spearheaded the ongoing ''Spectrum'' annual publications, announced at the second '''Spectrum Fantastic Art Live''' event in May 2013 the transition of the book to a new director, editor and publisher. Beginning with ''Spectrum'' 21, John Fleskes of Flesk Publications will assume those responsibilities.

'''Terrain.org: A Journal of the Built + Natural Environments''' is an online journal publishing editorials, poetry, essays, fiction, articles, reviews, an interview, the ARTerrain gallery, and the Unsprawl case study on a rolling schedule, with up to five new contributions per week. Terrain.org also hosts an annual contest in fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.

''Terrain.org'' was founded in 1997 by Simmons Buntin and Todd Ziebarth. The first issue appeared in summer 1998 and featured work by R.T. Smith, David Rothenberg, Rick Cole, [[James Howard Kunstler]], Sherry Saye, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terrain.org/archives/archives-issue-1/ Terrain.org first issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors and interview subjects since then include [[Alison Hawthorne Deming]], [[David Quammen]], Lauret Savoy, [[Terry Tempest Williams]], [[Joy Harjo]], [[Sandra Steingraber]], [[Scott Russell Sanders]], Kathryn Miles, [[Gary Snyder]], [[Wendell Berry]], [[Andres Duany]], and many others. Each issue is archived.

''Terrain.org'' appears to be the first completely online environmentally oriented journal, and continues to be one of the most comprehensive journals with original content exploring the nexus between the built and natural environments where it exists, and attempting to generate a discourse where that nexus does not exist.

In March 2009 ''Web del Sol'' called ''Terrain.org'' a "Top 50 Literary Magazine and Metazine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://webdelsol.com/index-new-magazines2.htm Web del Sol Top 50 Literary Magazines and Metazines]&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards include [[Dzanc Books]] Best of the Web selections in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2008.html Dzanc Books Best of the Web 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910053830/http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2008.html |date=2009-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2009.html Dzanc Books Best of the Web 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615075618/http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2009.html |date=2010-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2010.html Dzanc Books Best of the Web 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529170240/http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2010.html |date=2010-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Top 100 Architectural Blogs listing by International Listings (though ''Terrain.org'' is not a blog, it does offer the [http://blog.terrain.org/ Terrain.org Blog]); Planetizen Top 50 Website;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetizen.com/websites/2003 Planetizen Top 50 Websites for 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Utne Reader'' Best of the Alternative Web.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrain.org/about/kudos.htm Terrain.org Awards and Good Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010041624/http://www.terrain.org/about/kudos.htm |date=2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Terrain.org'' has editors as well as an international [http://terrain.org/about/editors/editorial board] that serves primarily in an advisory capacity.

The online journal also has a partnership with the journal / book series ''Terra Nova: Nature &amp; Culture'', published by [[MIT Press]]. ''Terra Nova's'' editor David Rothenberg is a ''Terrain.org'' editorial board member and contributing editor. ''Terrain.org'' occasionally republishes work originally appearing in print editions of ''Terra Nova''.

''Terrain.org'' often conducts readings, occasionally in conjunction with sponsors. For example, ''Terrain.org's'' 24th issue, with the theme of "Borders &amp; Bridges,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://terrain.org/archives/archives-issue-24/ Terrain.org's 24th issue]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched with a reading featuring [[David Rothenberg]], Christopher Cokinos, Pamela Uschuk, and Deborah Fries in September 2009. It was hosted by the [[University of Arizona Poetry Center]] and co-sponsored by the [[Center for Biological Diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://poetrycenter.arizona.edu/events/fallreadings_09.shtml Terrain.org Issue Launch and Reading Announcing on University of Arizona Poetry Center website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9785">'''''The Best American Short Stories'''''{{italic title}} yearly [[anthology]] is a part of ''[[The Best American Series]]'' published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]].  Since 1915, the BASS anthology has striven to contain the best [[short stories]] by some of the best-known writers in contemporary American literature.

==Edward O'Brien==

The series began in 1915, when [[Edward Joseph Harrington O'Brien|Edward O'Brien]] edited his selection of the previous year's stories. This first edition was serialized in a magazine; however, it caught the attention of the publishing company [[Small, Maynard &amp; Company]], which published subsequent editions until 1926, when the title was transferred to [[Dodd, Mead and Company]].

The time appeared to be a propitious one for such a collection. The most popular magazines of the day featured short fiction prominently and frequently; the best authors were well-known and well-paid. More importantly, there was a nascent movement toward higher standards and greater experimentation among certain American writers. O'Brien capitalized on this moment. He was deeply and vocally skeptical of the value of commercial short fiction, which tended to the formulaic and sentimental; he insisted, in introduction after introduction, on the need for a consciously literary development of the short story. He used his selections to reinforce this call. Over the years of his editorship, he drew attention to two generations of American authors, from [[Sherwood Anderson]] and [[Edna Ferber]] to [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] and [[Irwin Shaw]]. Perhaps the most significant instance of O'Brien's instincts involves [[Ernest Hemingway]]; O'Brien published that author's "My Old Man" when it had not even been published yet, and was, moreover, instrumental in finding an American publisher for ''In Our Time''. O'Brien was known to work indefatigably: he claimed to read around 8,000 stories a year, and his editions contained lengthy tabulations of stories and magazines, ranked on a scale of three stars (representing O'Brien's notion of their "literary permanence.")

Though the series attained a degree of fame and popularity, it was never universally accepted. Fans of the period's popular fiction often found his selections precious or willfully obscure. On the other hand, many critics who accepted "literary" fiction objected to O'Brien's occasionally strident and pedantic tone. After his death, for instance, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' compared him to the recently deceased editor of the ''Social Register'', suggesting that they shared a form of snobbery.

==Martha Foley==

O'Brien died of a heart attack in London in 1941. He was replaced as editor of the series by [[Martha Foley]], founder and former editor of ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine. O'Brien, who had once called ''Story'' one of the most important events in literary history since the publication of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', presumably would have approved the choice. Foley edited the publication, at first alone and then with the assistance of her son, David Burnett, until 1977. These years witnessed both the ascendancy and eclipse of the type of short story  favored by O'Brien: writers as diverse as [[John Cheever]], [[Bernard Malamud]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], and [[Tillie Olsen]] offered sharply observed, generally realistic stories that eschewed trite conventions. At the same time, Foley evinced some degree of awareness of the new currents in fiction. [[Donald Barthelme]], for instance, was chosen for ''The School'' in 1976. Foley also attended to the rise of so-called minority literature, dedicating the 1975 volume to [[Leslie Marmon Silko]], although it has been argued that the series was less perceptive in this area than it might have been.

==Since 1978==

After Foley's death, the publisher—by that time, [[Houghton Mifflin]]—elected to take the series in a new direction. Under the guidance of a series editor (Shannon Ravenel 1978-1990, Katrina Kenison 1991-2006, Heidi Pitlor 2007- ), a different writer of reputation would select the contents and introduce the volume each year. The editor would choose the best twenty stories from 120 stories recommended by the series editor. This format has been followed since, although the guest editor has occasionally gone beyond what the series editor recommended (e.g., John Gardner in 1982).

In 2002, Houghton-Mifflin made the series part of its broader ''[[Best American series]]''.

'''''The Extremists''''' is a 2009 [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[C.J. Hopkins]], published by [[Broadway Play Publishing]]. A political satire&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Extremists-CJ-Hopkins/dp/0881454419|title=The Extremists|last=Hopkins|first=C. J.|date=2010-11-01|publisher=Broadway Play Pub|isbn=9780881454413|edition= first |location=NY, NY|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing  [[United States|American]] views on [[extremism]] and foreign [[terrorism]], it revolves around a television talk show host interviewing a counterterrorist expert on the imminent danger of the extremist threat. The play first premiered at the English Theatre Berlin, in [[Berlin, Germany]], in February 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etberlin.de/production/the-extremists/|title=The Extremists {{!}} English Theatre Berlin|website=www.etberlin.de|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a production at Seven Stages Theatre in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in March 2009.

==Plot==
The play begins by welcoming audiences to "Issues in Focus," a political news and talk program based out of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and introduces them to the show's host, self-described Washington insider Dick Hedgerow. Dick announces the entirety of the night's program will be devoted to an in-depth discussion on the threat of extremism and welcomes his guest; Norman "Norm" Krieger, a co-founder of the fictitious polling and counterterrorism organization, the Center of Advanced Strategic Studies. Norm has been invited on the show to discuss his newly-published book, ''Extremism in the 21st Century'', which focuses on the mindset of extremists and their psychological motivations, as well as how they're able to spread their beliefs globally. Norm explains that he believes extremism should be considered the final threat to a democratic world (albeit there are other, manageable threats that are easy to handle), and tells Dick that while the government should be constantly fighting back against this threat, it's important to keep the public placated, and allow them to carry on with their normal lives.

Norm further elaborates that as the threat of extremism is combated, the public's understanding of it will be skewed, and it will ultimately become too difficult to keep up with the narrative, and the majority of the details will be indiscernible. Dick insists that this isn't an issue, suggesting that they refrain from complete transparency with the American people, citing security concerns, and instead try and help them adjust the way they see things, which Norm claims were his motivations for writing his book. As their discussion continues, Dick inquires about a concrete definition of the word "extremism," which Norm initially struggles with; he eventually decides that extremism is primarily defined by violence, or advocating for its use. When Dick asks if this definition transcends political leanings, such as [[conservativism|conservative]] or [[liberalism|liberal]] views, Norm proposes that these labels have lost their meaning beyond the competition aspect, but later contradicts himself when he says it is absolutely necessary for America to maintain the two-party system, as a country with no ideological opposition would be undemocratic.

The interview then shifts gears as it begins to investigate the extremists' intentions, which Norm believes is not only to incite violence but to make people think, asking complicated and dangerous questions that will only lead to insanity. Instead of engaging in the destructive act of thinking, Norm insists that the viewers need to stick to the facts provided by those in power in the government and the media and unquestionably devote their minds to the programming that "freedom-loving people" such as himself are trying to ensure all of society conforms to. When Dick objects to this concept, claiming it is nothing better than the brainwashing that extremists are guilty of, Norm reassures him that this is brainwashing people with the truth, while the other option is to be brainwashed with "made-up extremist nonsense." As the play carries on, Dick and Norm constantly renege on their stances and their beliefs, and at its conclusion, they nearly break the [[fourth wall]], seemingly aware that they are actors in an elaborate performance and are no less extremists than the terrorists they have warned the audience of.

==Production History==
''The Extremists'' was first produced at the English Theatre Berlin, in February 2009, directed by [[Walter D. Asmus]]. It was followed by a production at Seven Stages Theatre, who co-produced the original showing, in Atlanta, Georgia, in March of the same year.

In 2010, a staged reading of the play was performed at the [[Schauspielhaus Bochum]] in [[Bochum, Germany|Bochum]], Germany, as well as the Acker Stadt Palast performing arts center in Berlin, 2012. A German translation of the play translated by Jasna Miletic was used for both productions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cjhopkins.com/stage-plays/the-extremists/|title=The Extremists|date=2013-01-09|work=CJ Hopkins|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy Productions &amp; Assembly produced the play at the 2013 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], with David Calvitto in the role of Norman Krieger, and Carol Scudder playing Jane Woolwraith, a female counterpart to the script's Dick Hedgerow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alledinburghtheatre.com/the-extremists-c-j-hopkins-interviewed/|title=The Extremists’ C.J. Hopkins interviewed  : All Edinburgh Theatre.com|website=www.alledinburghtheatre.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 production was performed at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], directed by Raymond Munro, with Jake Rosenthal as Norman Krieger, and Brett Iarrobino as Dick Hedgerow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovercentralma.org/sp/the-extremists/|title=The Extremists - ClarkArts|date=2018-04-18|work=CJ Hopkins|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Reception==
Critics have praised the play for its complex and intricate text; a review of the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe production describes Hopkins' script as a "fiendishly complex rollercoaster."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critics found the performances of Calvitto and Scudder dazzling, citing an incredible pace, and noting that audiences would leave the show questioning their understanding of western democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/the-extremists-assembly-roxy-9151|title=Theatre review: The Extremists at Assembly Roxy|website=www.britishtheatreguide.info|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolja Reichert of the German newspaper [[Der Tagesspiegel]] called the performance at the English Theatre Berlin "heady theater in the truest sense," and focused on the question of reality: "Hopkins builds a construct of ideas out of rhetoric until everything revolves around one thing - what is the truth for the good guys and what is it for the bad guys?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/kurz-und-kritisch/1447974.html|title=KURZ &amp; KRITISCH|language=de|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the production in [[Die Tageszeitung]] claimed the play was an excellent example of the advantages theater holds over film, in that it lays bare the mechanisms of the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''The Ray''''' is a still life painting by [[Jean Simeon Chardin]], first exhibited at the Exposition de la Jeunesse on 3 June 1728, the day of the Petite Fête-Dieu. Chardin later exhibited it and ''[[The Buffet (painting)|The Buffet]]'' as his [[reception piece]]s to the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] on 25 September the same year. Both works are now in the [[Louvre]].

When Marcel Proust saw ''The Ray'', he likened it to the nave of a polychromatic cathedral.

'''Three perfections''' is the gathering of [[poet]]s, [[calligrapher]]s and [[painter (artist)|painters]] to create an artwork in ancient [[China]]. The resulting product would be a painting that would include the work of a calligrapher to write a poem.

Legend holds that the [[Tang dynasty]] poets [[Du Fu]] and [[Li Bai]] were the first to introduce the combination of painting and poetry into one artwork. Several hundred years later, [[Su Shi]], a poet and painter, promoted the use of poetry and painting together. Instruction of artists at the [[Northern Song]] Imperial Painting Academy included the integration of poetry and painting. As a result of the prevalence of the merged arts into the "Three perfections" a common expression emerged, the "soundless poem" to describe how one might experience a painting with sound, sight, smell, touch, and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schillerinstitute.org/fid_97-01/99sp_leni_rubenstein_chinese_art.pdf ''The Great Art of China's 'Soundless Poems'.''] The Schiller Institute. p. 45, 70.

{{Nihongo|'''''Toba-e'''''|鳥羽絵||}} is a style of [[Japanese painting]] based on works from the 12th century that are attributed to [[Toba Sōjō]]. These “Toba-style” images were [[caricature]]s sometimes involving animals performing human tasks. Toba-e style images gained popularity as a commercial medium in mid-eighteenth century [[Edo]]. Though their popularity did not stay strong, Toba-e images have left a lasting impact through today, particularly in [[manga]].

== Style ==
Toba-e style paintings, as were popular in the [[Edo period]] are marked by their comedy over just their visual content. The images should be cheerful and relaxed, but yet humorous. An sense of sarcasm is understood. Color is used light and conservatively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/c/comic_pictures_and_verses_tob.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the image is on the simplicity and precision of the brushwork forming outlines. Strokes for the outlines and details are all applied with very crisp edges, but the shapes those outlines take are extremely playful and organic.

==History==

===Toba Sōjō===
Toba-e is given its name because it is stylistically based on works which have been attributed to a priest from the 12th century, [[Toba Sōjō]]. The most prominent of these works is the ''[[Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga]]'', or "Scroll of Frolicking Animals and People". Historical accounts and written attributions pin Toba Sōjō as the painter of these works, but there is much speculation as to whether or not the works in question were actually by him. Nonetheless, the style takes after him in name.&lt;ref&gt;Toda, Kenji. Japanese Scroll Painting. New York: Greenwood press, 1969. p48.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' ===

Much of the style of toba-e is based on the ''[[Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga]]''. This is series of four long scrolls, intended to be read from right to left. The first, and most popular,  depicts animals behaving in human ways in a very satirical manner.&lt;ref&gt;Okudaira, Hideo. Choju giga. Scrolls of animal caricatures. Honolulu, East-West Center Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; This work is considered to be the first [[manga]], and is said to be the inspiration for the right to left reading of modern manga. The scroll appears to move through time as well as space as it is viewed, creating a [[synoptic narrative]], or [[iji-dozu]], which means “different time, same illustration.” The animals use bows and fishing poles, ride mules, engage in commerce, participate in [[Buddhist]] practices, and more. The intent of the images is debated and left a mystery, but they have a sense of whimsy and fun to them, as we would now still expect from [[caricature]].

Visually, ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' takes off of ''[[otoko-e]]'', known as the “masculine style” of painting, as opposed to ''[[onna-e]]'', the feminine, which was practiced by the imperial courts. Images in these styles utilize heavy outlines, a strong sense of gesture, a focus on creating drama and in depicting the interactions between subjects, as well as a focus on individualizing characters from each other, as was not done in other styles. The lines are painted very crisply with no evidence of any sketching beforehand for planning. The strokes on the first scroll are very fluid and playful. They help carry a whimsical and carefree tone to match that of the light-hearted and satirical subject matter. All the while, recognition of form and a consistent level of [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]], though cartoonish, is not sacrificed as it often is as a cost for emotion and character. Animation still today bases some visual styles off of descending from the ''[[Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga]]'' because of how effective the line-work is.

=== Toba-e in Edo ===

Through the 18th century in [[Edo]], Toba-e images became very popular. Earlier collections of prints being bound together to be sold opened the door for the creation of a [[comic]]-style book. Toba-e was created using [[accordion]]-style books to present a large amount of image in a compact and manageable format.&lt;ref&gt;http://manga.about.com/od/historyofmanga/a/mangahistory1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed painters to create longer narratives than before in a reproducible size. This is in contrast to earlier books of pictures, which were nothing more than an assembly of random or pre-existing prints with no narrative, or a weak one added after the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Gresh, Louis H., Weinberg, Robert. The Science of Anime. Running Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These continuous narratives would bleed into other mediums, such as [[Panel (comics)|panel comics]], and still continue even though Toba-e would die out. These narratives maintained many traits from [[Toba Sōjō]]’s earlier works. They generally maintained the right to left viewing style, but also included very little or no text. These books also maintained much of the visual style of Toba-e. The used strong outlines to represent the forms, very fluid strokes, and maintained the same playfulness but attention to drama. In terms of subject matter, Toba-e did diverge greatly from the works that were attributed to Toba. These books were sold in the entertainment districts, and as such were chosen to depict subjects that would be appealing to the people who would visit there, such as an image of a [[kabuki]] star or of city folk, rather than the far out quirkiness depicted in ''[[Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga]]''.

=== Katsushika Hokusai’s manga ===

[[Katsushika Hokusai]] earned himself a notable career as a [[woodblock print]]maker, both in [[Japan]] and throughout the world. He took medium to an all new level and brought it to such a wide audience because of his interest in, and ability to adapt to, western art styles. Even today people with no background in the arts may still be able to recognize his famous [[Great Wave off Kanagawa]], from the “[[36 Views of Mount Fuji (Hokusai)|Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji]]” series. However, though not as commonly recognized for it, he was also very instrumental in the birth of [[manga]] and in spreading the styles of Toba-e. His note as a woodblock artist brought great attention to his work when he released his [[manga]] in 1814. "Manga" was essentially Hokusai’s made-up word for Toba-e style art.&lt;ref&gt;Gresh, Louis H., Weinberg, Robert. The Science of Anime. Running Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Hokusai, in his manga, focused primarily on the technical aspects of the style rather than on building a narrative. The collection was mainly a [[clip art]] collection of all sorts of different types of images that could be used as reference material. The manga was a huge success anyway. Hokusai’s fame brought attention to the lesser known, but very interesting, style and helped spread it throughout the world. Hokusai’s manga was reprinted in the west and also sparked influence in China and elsewhere. The fact that he coined the term "manga" may lead some to believe Hokusai was the founder of manga in general, but this was just not the case. He did, however, help greatly in spreading it.

===Spread of influence to China===
[[Japan]] overturning its [[isolationist]] policies not only allowed it to be influenced by foreign powers, but allowed it to influence others as well. The poet and painter [[Feng Zikai]] studied for a time in Japan where he was introduced to many of their different styles of art. He was influenced by Japanese artists who were influenced by the West’s more painterly styles of art, such as [[Takehisa Yumeji]], but more importantly he was exposed to the works of [[Hokusai]] and his manga.  These inspired Zikai to work in a much looser and more playful and whimsical style like Toba-e and the western inspired artworks, and also inspired him to work with some comics as well. Zikai called his images “[[manhua]],” an offshoot of the word “[[manga]].” Manhua was defined as [[doodle]]s and sketches that are done impulsively and without planning. This sense of spontaneity has been a key element in Toba-style painting since the seemingly perfect, though unplanned, strokes of Toba’s ''[[Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga]]''. Feng Zikai transferred away from the lighter subjects that were more common place for toba-e and its descendants to face the grim realities of the world war that was raging. This was one of early manga’s first plunges into very dark subject matter, which would become near common place in contemporary [[comics]]. In the 1940s, Zikai made the transition into comics with multiple [[Panel (comics)|panels]]. This transition would be very important for manga and comics to become what we now see them as today.

[[Liao Bingxiong]] incorporated an interesting mix of the newer incarnations of Toba-e like styles and the traditional imagery of the original ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' scrolls. In his series titled “[[The Cat Kingdom]]” he used [[anthropomorphized]] versions of animals playing the roles of humans in his dark and deeply political multi-panel comics. Bingxiong used his comics as political cartoons to point out corruption and other such flaws in the government. Political cartoons were outlawed in [[China]], so he could not publish his works and needed to exhibit them as works of art in a gallery so people could see them. He used the animal figures to create a sense of chaos and upheaval somewhat similar to the joyful frolicking in ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga’s'' sense of animal vitality. Ultimately Bingxiong was forced to stop creating art for over 20 years during the [[cultural revolution]], despite his attempt at going through loopholes.

== Effect on modern manga ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
{{Original research|date=May 2009}}
The style of Toba-e has gone through many incarnations on its way to involving into and influencing modern manga, but still many of the key original elements remain present. From the ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'', the use of anthropomorphized animals and creatures is still ever present. It is not a hard and fast rule, but a sense of communication and mutual understanding with animals or creatures seems commonplace. Anthropomorphizing is also extremely commonplace in [[United States|American]] [[animation]] as a possible extension. This also plays into a Toba-e sense of whimsy and lightness. Modern [[anime]] and [[manga]] can be very dark, but the [[Superflat]] ideal of ''[[kawaii]]'', or cute, plays right into a sort of scene like the frolicking animals. The whimsical world of toba-e has been taken to an extreme, almost unrelatable, level in modern manga. A sense of, and focus on, motion has remained as well. Toba-e captured some dramatic images of animals in motion and exerting force, and the same drive for [[wikt:dynamism|dynamism]] can be seen in some modern manga, such as the dramatic depictions of travel through [[Akira (manga)|Neo-Tokyo]] in [[Akira (manga)|Akira]].

'''''X-TRA Contemporary Art Quarterly''''' is an independent journal published quarterly to promote and provoke engaged critical discourse about contemporary visual art in Los Angeles. '''X-TRA''' is composed of features, long-form reviews, columns, and artist projects.

In 1997 artists Stephen Berens and Ellen Birrell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Berkeley Environmental Design Frameworks|volume=3|issue=2|page=55|publisher=University of California, Berkeley. College of Environmental Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilcox|first1=Brica|title=From X to XV: Conversation with '''X-TRA''' Founders Ellen Birrell and Stephen Berens|url=http://x-traonline.org/article/from-x-to-xv-conversation-with-x-tra-founders-ellen-birrell-and-stephen-berens/|work=X-TRA|date=Summer 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded X-TRA to address a need for in-depth dialogue about art in Los Angeles, which was rapidly becoming an international art capital. For nearly eighteen years, '''X-TRA''' has steadily published articles and artist projects for a growing audience, making it the longest running contemporary art journal in Los Angeles. Project X Foundation for Art and Criticism (a 501c3 nonprofit corporation) was created in 2002 to act as publisher for '''X-TRA'''.

'''X-TRA'''’s audience includes a broad range of practicing artists, art curators, art dealers, critics and writers, the general art audience and students. Current readership for '''X-TRA''' is estimated to be about 7,000 people per issue, or 28,000 people per year.
Project X Foundation for Art and Criticism and '''X-TRA''' receive funding and support from public and private sources. Current and recent institutional donors include The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts 20-year Report, 1987-2007|date=2007|publisher=Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Endowment of the Arts]], [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]] through the [[Los Angeles County Arts Commission]], City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, Isambard Kingdom Brunel Society of North America, The Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts, The [[Getty Foundation]], and the Pasadena Art Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;http://x-traonline.org/support/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editors==

'''X-TRA''' is collaboratively edited by the Editorial Board, which is composed of Los Angeles-based artists and writers, all of whom work on a volunteer basis. This collaborative editorial process insures that '''X-TRA''' presents an array of perspectives and ideas. Current Editorial Board members are Stephen Berens, Ellen Birrell, [[Leslie Dick]], Travis Diehl, Karen Dunbar, Jon Leaver, Shana Lutker, Mario Ontiveros, Elizabeth Pulsinelli, Nizan Shaked, and Brica Wilcox.

'''X-TRA''' also has a board of contributing editors from around the country that help recruit writers and suggest artists and exhibitions. Current contributing editors are Ken Allan (Seattle), Neha Choksi (Bombay and Los Angeles), Allan deSouza (San Francisco), Jae Emerling (Charlotte), Michelle Grabner (Chicago), Micol Hebron (Los Angeles), Aram Moshayedi (Los Angeles), Kristina Newhouse (Los Angeles), Jan Tumlir (Los Angeles) Anne Walsh (Berkeley) and Damon Willick (Los Angeles).&lt;ref&gt;http://x-traonline.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The design and printing process of the magazine has changed over the years. '''X-TRA''' has worked with different designers over the course of its history. Starting as a folded newspaper, its current incarnation is as a full color, perfect-bound journal, '''X-TRA''' is currently designed by Brian Roettinger and the '''X-TRA'''’s website, [http://x-traonline.org x-traonline.org], by Takumi Akin and Jon Gacnik.&lt;ref&gt;http://x-traonline.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

'''X-TRA''' hosts a range of events, supplementing the journal with programming to enhance community building.  Some recent examples include:

· "Chinese Cocktail", a concert by Robert Wilhite at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre as part of the Pacific Standard Time Performance and Public Art Festival organized by the [[Getty Foundation]] and LAXART. January 24, 2012

· "Kitchen Table", reprise, a re-imagining of the series of conversations organized by Eugenia P. Butler in 1993 at the ART/LA art fair. Situated within the College Art Association Conference at the same [[LA Convention Center]] that was the site for the ’93 talks, these talks brought together a group of cultural thinkers—primarily artists—seated around a table over lunch to speak freely about art, politics, and whatever come to the fore. February 22–24, 2012

· '''X-TRA''' has staged five 1 IMAGE 1 MINUTE events, most recently at the LA Art Book Fair in 2015. Based on the artist [[Agnès Varda]]'s series for French television in which members of the art community were invited on stage to speak for one minute about an image of their choosing. This event references a column of the same name, conceived by [[Micol Hebron]], which ran in '''X-TRA''' from 2006 to 2010.
