The '''AMC Institute''' (AMCI) is the global membership organization of the [[association management company]], or AMC, industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/03/22/822214/10161241/en/PSAV-Announces-Partnership-with-AMCI.html|title=PSAV Announces Partnership with AMCI|last=Services|first=PSAV Presentation|website=GlobeNewswire News Room|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Start a Home-Based Event Planning Business|last=Moran|first=Jill S.|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-1493011704|location=|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S., AMCI counts as members more than 180 AMC member organizations employing 3,500 people and representing 2.8 million individual members throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amcinstitute.org/?page=amcinfographic|title=AMCs: A Growing Global Industry - AMC Institute (AMCI)|website=www.amcinstitute.org|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, AMCI represents both the world's largest association management company, [[SmithBucklin]], as well as the world's largest professional conference organiser, [[MCI Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amcinstitute.org/members/?id=16926818|title=SmithBucklin - AMC Institute (AMCI)|website=www.amcinstitute.org|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amcinstitute.org/members/?id=16928186|title=MCI Group - AMC Institute (AMCI)|website=www.amcinstitute.org|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total budget for associations managed by AMCI members is more than $1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amcinstitute.org/?page=history|title=History - AMC Institute (AMCI)|website=www.amcinstitute.org|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/03/22/822214/10161241/en/PSAV-Announces-Partnership-with-AMCI.html|title=PSAV Announces Partnership with AMCI|last=Services|first=PSAV Presentation|website=GlobeNewswire News Room|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMCI's accreditation program is based upon the [[American National Standards Institute]]-approved standard for good AMC practices. In May 2007, to provide clearer direction to associations interested in being managed by AMCs, the institute and the [[American Society of Association Executives]] (ASAE) agreed to support a single AMC accreditation program run by the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amcinstitute.org/?page=history|title=History - AMC Institute (AMCI)|website=www.amcinstitute.org|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
AMCI was founded in 1963 as the Multiple Association Management Institute. It since has undergone several name changes, including the Institute of Association Management Companies (IAMC) in 1976 and the International Association of Association Management Companies (IAAMC) in 1996. In the early 2000s, AMCs from ASAE and IAAMC joined to form the AMC Institute, a marketing arm to support the promotion of the AMC model. AMCs could purchase a partnership with the AMC Institute, regardless of their membership in IAAMC or ASAE. In 2005, IAAMC changed its name to AMC Institute, assumed the AMC marketing responsibilities and, in 2006, the organization as a whole assumed the AMC Institute name to more clearly brand the AMC concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amcinstitute.org/?page=history|title=History - AMC Institute (AMCI)|website=www.amcinstitute.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This includes energy from [[Tidal power|tides]], [[wave power|waves]] and [[Marine current power|ocean currents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.awatea.org.nz/|title=Aotearoa Wave and Tidal Energy Association| publisher=AWATEA| accessdate=3 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081002020228/http://awatea.org.nz/| archivedate= 2 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisations involved in New Zealand include [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]], [[Meridian Energy]] and Crest Energy.  Several projects are being developed, including [[Kaipara Tidal Power Station]] and another in [[Cook Strait]].

Speaking at the 2007 conference, [[Jeanette Fitzsimons]], then NZ Government spokesperson for Energy Efficiency stated that: "I remain very positive, and excited, at the prospects for marine energy in NZ. It is a perfect fit with our history as a maritime nation; the NZ love of the sea and sea going craft; the goals of the NZ Energy Strategy to get as close to 100% renewable electricity as we can; and to the Prime Minister’s aspirational goal to be carbon neutral and truly sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://beehive.govt.nz/speech/awatea+conference+2007| title=AWATEA Conference 2007| author=Jeanette Fitzsimons| publisher=New Zealand Parliament| date=15 March 2007| accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIR represents Australian owned record labels and independent artists based in Australia.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.air.org.au/index.php?apply=&amp;webpage=default&amp;cID=1967&amp;PHPSESSID=&amp;menuID=207 |title=About Us |accessdate=8 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075843/http://www.air.org.au/index.php?apply=&amp;webpage=default&amp;cID=1967&amp;PHPSESSID=&amp;menuID=207| archivedate= 6 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIR's primary purpose is to foster an increasing marketplace for Australian independent music and assist in the long-term development, growth and success of Australia 's independent recording industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.air.org.au/index.php?apply=&amp;webpage=default&amp;cID=1967&amp;PHPSESSID=&amp;menuID=207, Australian Independent Record Labels Association Ltd (AIR) 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

AIR was started by a group of Sydney and Melbourne music industry professionals and labels, who began meeting regularly to formulate ideas on how to start an industry association that would assist the ongoing development of Australia's independent record industry. The association was incorporated in 1996 thanks to a small donation from [[Phantom Records]], and received its first operation funding grant from the [[Australia Council for the Arts]] in 1998.

Additional Australia Council funding was received in 2000, and in this same year, members also voted to change AIR's legal status from Incorporated Association to Company Limited by Guarantee.&lt;ref name="About Us" /&gt;

AIR moved its base from [[Sydney]], New South Wales, to [[Brisbane]], Queensland, in 2004 when Stuart Watters (formerly of Q Music, Queensland's state music council) took over as its Chief Executive Officer. In 2007 AIR moved its operations from Brisbane to [[Melbourne]], Victoria, where it is now based in the Rubber Records and Media Arts Lawyers building in North Melbourne.

== Members ==

AIR began as a small association with 25 members to a company with over 200 financial members across all sectors of the Australian music industry.&lt;ref name="About Us" /&gt; AIR's membership of significant Australian Independent Record Labels includes but is not limited to Head Records, [[Shock Records]], [[Elefant Traks]], [[Obese Records]], [[Dew Process]], [[Liberation Music]], Plus One Records, [[Remote Control Records]] Pty Ltd, [[MGM Distribution]], UNFD – We Are Unified, [[Ivy League Records]], Vitamin Records, [[Eleven: A Music Company]], Red Cat Records, [[Illusive Sounds]], Future Classic, Casadeldisco Records and [[Jarrah Records]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.air.org.au/index.php?apply=&amp;webpage=default&amp;cID=2197&amp;PHPSESSID=&amp;menuID=614, Australian Independent Record Labels Association Ltd (AIR) List of Members&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independent Music Charts ==

In 2000, AIR inaugurated the Independent Music Charts which track the sales of Australia's highest selling independent artists. The top 20 independent singles and albums are published on a weekly basis but genre charts for Jazz, Hip Hop, Blues and Roots, Hard Rock/Punk, Country are published once a month. The AIR Charts differ from the [[ARIA Charts]] because they focus on Australian artists represented only by Australian independent labels.

Titles are eligible to be included in the [[AIR Charts]] if they are Australian, the title is released on an independent label / or, self-released and where it is either distributed through an independent distributor or where an independent label uses the services of a major or its subsidiary to distribute the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.air.org.au/index.php?apply=&amp;webpage=default&amp;cID=1966&amp;PHPSESSID=&amp;menuID=210|title=About the AIR Charts|accessdate=9 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205061440/http://www.air.org.au/index.php?apply=&amp;webpage=default&amp;cID=1966&amp;PHPSESSID=&amp;menuID=210|archivedate=5 December 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
{{Update|section|date=October 2017|reason=Award winners after 2014 need to be added.}}
The association's annual Independent Music Awards are run in conjunction with the AIR Charts and celebrate the year's highest charting independently released Australian singles and albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airawards.com.au|title=2008 Jägermeister AIR Awards|publisher=Australian Independent Record Labels Association Ltd (AIR)|year=2009|accessdate=2 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716122508/http://www.airawards.com.au/|archive-date=16 July 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection of the 10 finalists for each category is based upon a total score calculated across all 20 AIR independent chart positions over that year. The winner is voted for by a judging panel consisting of approximately 350 members of the retail and media sectors of the Australian independent music industry.&lt;ref name="AIRawardsGuide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airawards.com.au/about-the-awards/guidelines.html|title=Awards Guidelines|publisher=Australian Independent Record Labels Association Ltd (AIR)|year=2009|accessdate=2 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031041127/http://www.airawards.com.au/about-the-awards/guidelines.html|archive-date=31 October 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the son of [[Bancha Lamsam]] and M.R. Sam-angwan Lamsam (maiden name Devakula; half-sister of M.R. [[Pridiyathorn Devakula]]). The [[Lamsam family]] is one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Thailand.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.uru.ac.th/webdb/images/sakulthai13.htm|title=สกุลไทย (Sakul Thai Magazine). ชีวิตและงานของ บัณฑูร ล่ำซำ กรรมการผู้จัดการและประธานเจ้าหน้าที่บริหารธนาคารกสิกรไทย (Life and Work of Bantoon Lamsam, President and CEO of KBank).|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bantoon is Lamsam 5th generation and heading family's banking and insurance flagship. He is currently the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of [[Kasikornbank]], the top financial service provider group in Thailand.

== Early life ==
Banthoon Lamsam was born on 15 January 1953, a son of Bancha Lamsam and [[Thanphuying]] Sam-angwan Lamsam (maiden name [[Mom Rajawongse]] Sam-angwan Devakula; daughter of Prince [[Priditheppong Devakula]] and Mom Rajawongse Sa-ang Pramoj). Bantoon has two younger sisters. Bantoon is a grandson of [[Choti Lamsam]] who founded [[Kasikornbank]] in 1945 as Thai Farmers Bank. Banthoon graduated from [[Saint Gabriel's College]] and [[Srinakharinwirot University Prasarnmit Demonstration School]]. He studied at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] from 1967 to 1971&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/07/entertainment/data/entertainment_19080450.html&lt;/ref&gt; before going on to earn a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Princeton University and a masters of business administration (MBA) from [[Harvard Business School]] (HBS).&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

After graduation, he spent two years with the military's Directorate of Joint Intelligence in the Ministry of Defence. In 1979, Banthoon joined Thai Farmers Bank (later changed to Kasikornbank) in the international banking department, where he was promoted to first vice president in 1986. In 1987 he moved to the domestic banking department as a senior vice president. In 1992, Banthoon was nominated president as of Thai Farmers Bank (TFB).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kasikornbank.com/picture1/BoardofDirecter/Documents/BANTHOON_EN.pdf|title = Bantoon Lamsam, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Kasikornbank|date = |accessdate = September 26, 2014|website = Kasikorn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] (known as วิกฤตต้มยำกุ้ง, literally translated as [[Tom Yam|Tom Yam Kung]]  crisis), he was the first to introduce the term "reengineering" to Thailand's banking industry. The Lamsam family became a minority shareholder of Kasikornbank. Banthoon Lamsam is an important contributor to the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democratic Party]]. Banthoon was skeptical of the country's economic policies during [[Thaksin Shinawatra|Pol. Lt. Col Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s term as the prime minister of Thailand, and it was rumored that he had been approached by the Democratic Party for the position of the party leader in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/content/432603|title=Thairath Online. เปิดประวัติผู้ทรงคุณวุฒิ 'ซุปเปอร์บอร์ด รสก.' เป็นใครมาจากไหน?.|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Banthoon became president and CEO of TFB. In 2003, he changed the logo and name of the bank from Thai Farmers Bank (TFB) to the current name, Kasikornbank (KBank), improvising Chinese characters style into the logo, "K".&lt;ref name="Matichon" /&gt; In 2010, after Dr. Prasarn Trairatvorakul, then the president of KBank, left to become the Governor of the [[Bank of Thailand]], Banthoon assumed the role of both president and CEO of KBank. He also instituted a senior executive position called "domain coordinator" and nominated four executive vice presidents to assume the positions of business domain, risk domain, infrastructure domain, and resource domain. Two of these executives later became the presidents of KBank and the other two became board directors.

In May 2013, Banthoon published a 608-page novel, ''Sinaeha Montra Lanna'', which he wrote in 13 months. The publisher printed 20,000 copies in the first two months.&lt;ref&gt;รายงานพิเศษ มติชนสุดสัปดาห์ (Matichon Weekend Special Report). Volume 33, No. 1716. 5–11 July 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27784">A '''biosimilar''' (also known as '''follow-on biologic''' or '''subsequent entry biologic''') is a [[biopharmaceutical|biologic medical product]] that is almost an identical copy of an original product that is manufactured by a different company.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, A., Helene D'Iorio and Robert Ford. "What you need to know to succeed: Key trends in Canada's biotech industry " Insights, spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Biosimilars are officially approved versions of original "innovator" products and can be manufactured when the original product's [[chemical patent|patent]] expires.&lt;ref name="biosimilars2012" /&gt; Reference to the innovator product is an integral component of the approval.

Unlike with [[generic drug]]s of the more common [[small molecule|small-molecule]] type, biologics generally exhibit high molecular complexity and may be quite sensitive to changes in manufacturing processes. Despite that heterogeneity, all [[biopharmaceutical]]s, including biosimilars, must maintain consistent quality and clinical performance throughout their lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamanna|first=William C.|last2=Holzmann|first2=Johann|last3=Cohen|first3=Hillel P.|last4=Guo|first4=Xinghua|last5=Schweigler|first5=Monika|last6=Stangler|first6=Thomas|last7=Seidl|first7=Andreas|last8=Schiestl|first8=Martin|date=2018-01-10|title=Maintaining consistent quality and clinical performance of biopharmaceuticals|journal=Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=369–379|doi=10.1080/14712598.2018.1421169|issn=1744-7682|pmid=29285958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-on manufacturers do not have access to the originator's molecular clone and original cell bank, to the exact fermentation and purification process, or to the active drug substance, but they have access to the commercialized innovator product. Overall, it is harder to ascertain [[fungibility]] between generics and innovators among biologics than it is among [[total synthesis|totally synthesized]] and [[semisynthesis|semisynthesized]] drugs. That is why the name "biosimilar" was coined to differentiate them from small-molecule generics. A simple analogy, often used to explain the difference, is to compare wine with soda pop. It is harder to say objectively that two bottles of [[wine]] from two wineries are "sufficiently interchangeable," because of differences in yeast [[strain (biology)|strain]], weather, and year of grape harvest, than it is to say that two bottles of soda pop of the same flavor coming from two bottling plants are "sufficiently interchangeable" because they contain the same flavoring powder.

Drug-related authorities such as the EU's [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA), the US's [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[Health Products and Food Branch]] of [[Health Canada]] hold their own guidance on requirements for demonstration of the similar nature of two biological products in terms of safety and efficacy. According to them, analytical studies demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product, despite minor differences in clinically inactive components, animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity), and a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics). They are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and is intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.

In case of a [[monoclonal antibody]]-containing medicinal product, such as [[Remsima]], extensive physicochemical and biological characterization for it and its reference product Remicade was conducted to demonstrate their highly-similar properties. Therefore, EMA has granted a marketing authorisation for only a few biosimilars since 2006, including a [[monoclonal antibody]], that was recently approved. Meanwhile, on March 6, 2015, the FDA approved the United States's first biosimilar product, the biosimilar of [[filgrastim]] called filgrastim-sndz (trade name Zarxio) by Sandoz.

==Approval processes ==
The European regulatory authorities led with a specially adapted approval procedure to authorize subsequent versions of previously approved biologics, termed "similar biological medicinal products", or biosimilars. This procedure is based on a thorough demonstration of "comparability" of the "similar" product to an existing approved product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/pages/includes/document/open_document.jsp?webContentId=WC500003517|title=EMEA Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products, CHMP/437/04 London, 30 October 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) held that new legislation was required to enable them to approve biosimilars to those biologics originally approved through the PHS Act pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1239&amp;wit_id=3623|title=US Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Testimony of Dr. Lester Crawford, Acting Commissioner, FDA June 23, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional Congressional hearings have been held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-he-hrg.050207.Biosimilar.shtml Hearing: Assessing the Impact of a Safe and Equitable Biosimilar Policy in the United States.

Since 2004 the FDA has held a series of public meetings on biosimilars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/ucm085854.htm|title=FDA page on "Follow-On Protein Products: Regulatory and Scientific Issues Related to Developing"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm221688.htm|title=FDA page on "Approval Pathway for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products Public Meeting"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA gained the authority to approve biosimilars (including interchangeables that are substitutable with their reference product) as part of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] signed by President Obama on March 23, 2010.

The FDA has previously approved biologic products using comparability, for example, [[Omnitrope]] in May 2006, but this like [[Enoxaparin]] was also to a reference product, [[Genotropin]], originally approved as a [[biologic drug]] under the FD&amp;C Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04P0231/04P-0231-pdn0001.pdf|title=FDA Response to three Citizen Petitions against biosimilars|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2015, [[Zarxio]] obtained the first approval of FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm436648.htm|title=FDA page on "FDA approves first biosimilar product Zarxio"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandoz’s Zarxio is biosimilar to Amgen’s Neupogen (filgrastim), which was originally licensed in 1991. This is the first product to be passed under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act), which was passed as part of the Affordable Healthcare Act. But Zarxio was approved as a biosimilar, not as an interchangeable product, the FDA notes. And under the BPCI Act, only a biologic that has been approved as an “interchangeable” may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The FDA said its approval of Zarxio is based on review of evidence that included structural and functional characterization, animal study data, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data, clinical immunogenicity data and other clinical safety and effectiveness data that demonstrates [[Zarxio]] is biosimilar to Neupogen.

==Background==
Cloning of human genetic material and development of in vitro biological production systems has allowed the production of virtually any [[recombinant DNA]] based biological substance for eventual development of a drug. [[Monoclonal antibody]] technology combined with recombinant DNA technology has paved the way for tailor-made and targeted medicines. [[gene therapy|Gene-]] and [[cell therapy|cell-based]] therapies are emerging as new approaches.

Recombinant therapeutic [[proteins]] are of a complex nature (composed of a long chain of amino acids, modified amino acids, derivatized by sugar moieties, folded by complex mechanisms). These proteins are made in living cells (bacteria, yeast, animal or human cell lines). The ultimate characteristics of a drug containing a recombinant therapeutic protein are to a large part determined by the process through which they are produced: choice of the cell type, development of the genetically modified cell for production, production process,  purification process, formulation of the therapeutic protein into a drug.

After the expiry of the patent of approved recombinant drugs (e.g., [[insulin]],  human [[growth hormone]], [[interferons]], [[erythropoietin]], monoclonal antibodies and more) any other biotech company can develop and market these [[biologic medical product|biologics]] (thus called biosimilars).
Every biological (or biopharmaceutical products) displays a certain degree of variability, even between different batches of the same product, which is due to the inherent variability of the biological expression system and the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name="pmid25298038"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/early/2014/10/08/blood-2014-06-583617 | author = Martina Weise | title = Biosimilars: the science of extrapolation | journal = Blood |date=October 8, 2014 | pmid = 25298038 | doi=10.1182/blood-2014-06-583617 | volume=124 | issue = 22 | pages=3191–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any kind of reference product has undergone numerous changes in its manufacturing processes, and such changes in the manufacturing process (ranging from a change in the supplier of cell culture media to new purification methods or new manufacturing sites) was substantiated with appropriate data and was approved by the EMA. In contrast, it is mandatory for biosimilars to take a both non-clinical and clinical test that the most sensitive clinical models are asked to show to enable detection of differences between the two products in terms of human [[pharmacokinetics]] (PK) and [[pharmacodynamics]] (PD), efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.

The current concept of development of biosimilar mAbs follows the principle that an extensive state of the art physicochemical, analytical and functional comparison of the molecules is complemented by comparative non-clinical and clinical data that establish equivalent efficacy and safety in a clinical "model" indication that is most sensitive to detect any minor differences (if these exist) between biosimilar and its reference mAb also at the clinical level.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) has recognized this fact, which has resulted in the establishment of the term "biosimilar" in recognition that, whilst biosimilar products are similar to the original product, they are not exactly the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/biosimilar/043704en.pdf  EMEA  guideline on similar biological medicinal products] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630132050/http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/biosimilar/043704en.pdf |date=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Every biological displays a certain degree of variability. However, provided that structure and function(s), pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic effect(s) and/or efficacy can be shown to be comparable for the biosimilar and the reference product, those adverse drug reactions which are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects can also be expected at similar frequencies.

Originally the complexity of biological molecules led to requests for substantial efficacy and safety data for a biosimilar approval. This has been progressively replaced with a greater dependence on assays, from quality through to clinical, that show assay sensitivity sufficient to detect any significant difference in dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=JB|title=Generics, chemisimilars and biosimilars: is clinical testing fit for purpose?|journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol|year=2013|volume=75|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04323.x|pmid=22574725|pmc=3555041}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the safe application of biologics depends on an informed and appropriate use by healthcare professionals and patients. Introduction of biosimilars also requires a specifically designed [[pharmacovigilance]] plan. It is difficult and costly to recreate biologics because the complex proteins are derived from living organisms that are genetically modified. In contrast, small molecule drugs made up of a chemically based compound can be easily replicated and are considerably less expensive to reproduce. In order to be released to the public, biosimilars must be shown to be as close to identical to the parent innovator biologic product based on data compiled through clinical, animal, analytical studies and conformational status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.bioprocessintl.com/manufacturing/biosimilars/higher-order-structure-comparability/|title = Higher-Order Structure Comparability: Case Studies of Biosimilar Monoclonal Antibodies|last = Wang|first = X.|date = June 1, 2014|journal = BioProcess International|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |issue = 6|volume = 12|pages=32–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23286777"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Declerck PJ | title = Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies: a science-based regulatory challenge | journal = Expert Opin Biol Ther | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–6 |date=February 2013 | pmid = 23286777 | doi = 10.1517/14712598.2012.758710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, once a drug is released in the market by FDA, it has to be re-evaluated for its safety and efficacy once every six months for the first and second years. Afterward, re-evaluations are conducted yearly, and the result of the assessment should be reported to authorities such as FDA. Biosimilars are required to undergo pharmacovigilance (PVG) regulations as its reference product. Thus biosimilars approved by EMEA (European Medicines Agency) are required to submit a risk management plan (RMP) along with the marketing application and have to provide regular safety update reports after the product is in the market. The RMP includes the safety profile of the drug and proposes the prospective pharmacovigilance studies.

Several PK studies, such as studies conducted by Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), have been conducted under various ranges of conditions; Antibodies from an originator’s product versus antibodies from an biosimilar; combination therapy and monotherapy; various diseases, etc. on the purpose to verify comparability in pharmacokinetics of the biosimilar with the reference medicinal product in a sufficiently sensitive and homogeneous population. Importantly, provided that structure and function(s), pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic effect(s) and/or efficacy can be shown to be comparable for the biosimilar and the reference product, those adverse drug reactions which are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects can also be expected at similar frequencies.

==European approvals of biosimilars==
It has approved (in Jan 2016) [[Benepali]] a biosimilar to [[Enbrel]] (etanercept).&lt;ref name="bp-Pf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Markets-Regulations/Pfizer-expects-major-biosimilar-impact-but-not-immediately/|title=Pfizer expects major biosimilar impact... but not immediately|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BPCI Act===
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) was originally sponsored and introduced on June 26, 2007, by Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] (D-MA).  It was formally passed under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPAC Act), signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act was an amendment to the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be highly similar (biosimilar) to a [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved biological product. The BPCI Act is similar, conceptually, to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (also referred to as the "Hatch-Waxman Act") which created biological drug approval through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&amp;C Act). The BPCI Act aligns with the FDA's longstanding policy of permitting appropriate reliance on what is already known about a drug, thereby saving time and resources and avoiding unnecessary duplication of human or animal testing. The FDA has released a total of four draft guidelines related to biosimilar or follow-on biologics development. Upon the release of the first three guidance documents the FDA held a public hearing on May 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=MS|last2=Ehrenpreis|first2=ED|last3=Kulkarni|first3=PM|last4=FDA-Related Matters Committee of the American College of|first4=Gastroenterology|title=Biosimilars: the need, the challenge, the future: the FDA perspective.|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology|date=December 2014|volume=109|issue=12|pages=1856–9|pmid=24957160|url=http://gi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FDA_Biosimilars_December_2014.pdf|doi=10.1038/ajg.2014.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data exclusivity ===
[[Data exclusivity]] is an important piece of the amendment in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for biosimilars. It is the period of time between FDA approval and an abbreviated filing for a biosimilar on the original producer's data. Data exclusivity is designed to preserve innovation and recognize the long, costly, and risky process involved while the innovator waits to gain FDA approval. The time allowed for data exclusivity is critical for the future of biologics. A number of provisions for data exclusivity in recent legislative proposals ranged up to 14 years, however, the passing of the PPAC Act guarantees a 12-year time period from the time of FDA approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/262|title=42 U.S. Code § 262 - Regulation of biological products|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supposed to compensate for perceived shortcomings in patent protection for biologics. Data exclusivity extends from the date of product approval, and this protection period runs concurrently with any remaining patent term protection for the biologic. That is to say, data exclusivity provides additional protection to the innovator when the remaining patent length is shorter than the data exclusivity period at the time of approval (which can occur due to lengthy pre-clinical and clinical research required to obtain FDA approval), or to the extent that the patent term is circumvented by a biosimilar prior to its expiry.

=== Nomenclature ===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the FDA have been working for years on the [[drug nomenclature#Nonproprietary names|nonproprietary naming]] of biosimilars. In August 2015, the FDA published a draft guideline on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Naming and Biological Products {{!}} FDA Voice|url = http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2015/08/naming-and-biological-products|website = blogs.fda.gov|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In brief, the guideline calls for the assignment of a four character alphabetic suffix to the nonproprietary name of the original product to distinguish between innovator drugs and their biosimilars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federal Register {{!}} Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability|url = https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/08/28/2015-21383/nonproprietary-naming-of-biological-products-draft-guidance-for-industry-availability|website = www.federalregister.gov|accessdate = 2015-08-29|date = 2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO INN system calls this suffix a biologic modifier.&lt;ref name="who_inn_bio"&gt;{{Citation |author=World Health Organization |authorlink=World Health Organization |title=INN and Biologicals |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/services/inn/inn_bio/en/ |accessdate=2016-08-05 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market implications ==
[[File:Biosimilars Patent Cliff.png|thumb|The 2012–2019 [[patent cliff]].&lt;ref name=biosimilars /&gt; Period of market exclusivity up to date of patent expiration for the ten top-selling biologics for 2011. *Enbrel has been granted approval in 2011 for a patent filed in 1995, extending its patent life further 17 years.]]
The legal requirements of approval pathways, together with the costly manufacturing processes, escalates the developing costs for biosimilars that could be between $75–$250 million per molecule.&lt;ref name=biosimilars&gt;{{cite journal | author = Calo-Fernández B, Martínez-Hurtado J | title = Biosimilars: Company Strategies to Capture Value from the Biologics Market | journal = Pharmaceuticals |date=December 2012 | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 1393–1408 | doi = 10.3390/ph5121393 | pmid=24281342 | pmc=3816668}}&lt;/ref&gt; This market entry barrier affects not only the companies willing to produce them but could also delay availability of inexpensive alternatives for public healthcare institutions that subsidize treatment for their patients. Even though the biosimilars market is rising, the price drop for biological drugs at risk of patent expiration will not be as great as for other generic drugs; in fact it has been estimated that the price for biosimilar products will be 65%-85% of their originators.&lt;ref name=biosimilars /&gt; Biosimilars are drawing market's attention since there is an upcoming [[patent cliff]], which will put nearly 36% of the $140 billion market for biologic drugs at risk (as of 2011), this considering only the top 10 selling products.&lt;ref name=biosimilars /&gt;

The global biosimilars market was $1.3 billion in 2013 and is expected to reach $35 billion by 2020 driven by the patent expiration of additional ten blockbuster biologic drugs.&lt;ref name="urlBiosimilars and Follow-on-Biologics Market to Hit $35 Billion Globally by 2020 | Pharmaceutical Technology"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pharmtech.com/biosimilars-and-follow-biologics-market-hit-35-billion-globally-2020 | title = Biosimilars and Follow-on-Biologics Market to Hit $35 Billion Globally by 2020 | work = Pharmaceutical Technology | date = 28 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Financial risk types}}

'''Concentration risk''' is a [[bank]]ing term describing the level of risk in a bank's portfolio arising from concentration to a single counterparty, sector or country. 

The risk arises from the observation that more concentrated portfolios are less [[Diversification (finance)|diverse]] and therefore the returns on the underlying assets are more correlated.  

Concentration risk can be calculated for a single bank loan or whole portfolio using a "concentration ratio". For a single loan, the concentration ratio is simply the proportion of the portfolio the loan represents (e.g. a $100 loan in a $1000 portfolio would have a ratio of 0.1 or 10%) 

For a whole portfolio, a [[herfindahl index]] is used to calculate the degree of concentration to a single name, sector of the economy or country.  Separate concentratio ratios must be calculated for each type of concentration. 

To illustrate, a portfolio with 10 equally sized loans would have a concentration ratio of 0.1 or 10%, whereas a portfolio of 10 loans - 9 equally sized and 1 equal to half the value of the portfolio would have a concentration ratio of 0.27 or 27%.

The ratio is useful for bankers or investors at large to identify when a portfolio may be excessively exposed to the risk that a [[recession]] or downturn in one sector of the economy or another country may cause a high proportion of the bank's outstanding loans to [[Default (finance)|default]]. 

Concentration risk is usually monitored by risk functions, committees and boards within commercial banks and is normally only allowed to operate within proscribed limits.  It is also monitored by banking regulators and generally attracts a higher [[Risk-weighted asset|capital charge]] in banking regulation. 

==Types==
There are two types of concentration risk. These types are based on the sources of the risk. Concentration risk can arise from uneven distribution of exposures (or loan) to its borrowers. Such a risk is called ''name concentration risk''. Another type is ''sectoral concentration risk'', which can arise from uneven distribution of exposures to particular sectors, regions, industries or products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visibleequity.com/creditrisksoftware/Learn/concentration-risk-methodology.jsp|title=Concentration Risk|work=Visible Equity|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206112845/http://www.visibleequity.com/creditrisksoftware/Learn/concentration-risk-methodology.jsp|archivedate=December 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring and management==
Most financial institutions have policies to identify and limit concentration risk. This typically involves setting certain thresholds for various types of risk. Once these thresholds are set, they are managed by frequent and diligent reporting to assess concentration areas and identify elevated thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mfsa.com.mt%2Fpages%2Freadfile.aspx%3Ff%3D%2Ffiles%2FLegislationRegulation%2Fregulation%2Fbanking%2FcreditInstitutions%2Frules%2FBR_12_14%2FAnnex%25202G%2520-%2520Principles%2520for%2520the%2520Management%2520of%2520Concentration%2520Risk.pdf|title=Principles for the Management of Concentration Risk|publisher=Malta Financial Services Authority|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key component to the management of concentration risk is accurately defining thresholds across various concentrations to minimize the combined risks across concentrations.

&lt;!--- Don't mess with this line! ---&gt;&lt;!--- Write your article below this line ---&gt;

'''Uncertain Tax Position''' refers to the uncertainties involving tax items claimed or intended to be claimed on an income tax return with a taxing authority. Companies will often take less than certain positions regarding the amount of tax expense they have to pay and/or the amount of tax benefit they are receiving. These uncertain tax positions may be the result of unclear tax law or uncertainties regarding their own circumstances.

Because of the difference in treating the uncertainties, the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] {FASB) issued in 2006 Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” to standardize the accounting for uncertain tax positions (now covered in FASB ASC 740).

{{nihongo|'''Keita Gotō'''|五島慶太|Gotō Keita|18 April 1882 – 14 August 1959}} was a Japanese businessman who built the [[Tokyu Group]] into one of the leading corporate groups in Japan.

== Education and civil service career ==
Gotō was born as Keita Kobayashi in the village of Aoki in [[Nagano Prefecture]]. After graduating from high school in the nearby city of [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]], he returned to his native village as a grade school teacher. In 1902 he entered what is now the [[University of Tsukuba]], and in 1907 entered the law department of [[Tokyo Imperial University]]. After graduating, he entered the Agriculture Ministry at the relatively late age of 29, and three years later transferred to the Ministry of Transport, where he was involved in supervising the [[Japanese Government Railways|national railway system]].

In 1912, while still working in the Agriculture Ministry, he married the daughter of an engineer and subsequently assumed her family name, Gotō.

== Business career ==
In 1920, Gotō was offered the post of Director of the Musashi Railway, a struggling company in need of capital to finance its expansion. He accepted and by 1924 had acquired a controlling interest in the company, using the profits from other railway ventures in the Tokyo area. This was the first of many acquisitions in which Gotō bought weak companies and transformed them into profitable members of a growing railway and real estate group.
It was also around this time that he persuaded the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] to relocate along his railway from its former campus, which had been damaged in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]]. Over the next 10 years, this was followed by relocation assistance to several other schools and universities, including the [[Nippon Medical School]] and the high school of [[Tokyo Gakugei University]]. Together with numerous new residential developments along the railways, this strategy brought steady passengers and increased the value of the company's real estate holdings.

By the time of his death in 1959, his strategy of aggressive acquisitions had built the Tokyu Group into one of Japan's largest corporate empires, with businesses ranging from railways and department stores to hospitals, schools, and leisure and entertainment companies.

== Gotoh Educational Corporation ==
The Gotoh Educational Corporation which Gotō established and served as the first Director-General continues his philanthropic legacy managing eight private educational schools including [[Tokyo City University]]. The Tokyo City University and affiliated schools currently serve the educational needs of over 12,000 students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tokyo City University|url=https://www.goto-ikuei.ac.jp/53guidebook/2012/files2013GOTOikueikai_En_0125.pdf|website=Gotō Ikuei|publisher=Gotoh Educational Corporation|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Art collection ==
In his later years, Gotō was a noted collector of Japanese and Asian art. His collection included several [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasures]], including calligraphy, ceramics, and one of the four surviving 13th-century [[Tale of Genji]] illustrated handscrolls. The collection is now preserved in the [[Gotoh Museum]] in Tokyo.

'''Kostas Tsalikidis''' (Κώστας Τσαλικίδης) died on March 9, 2005 at the age of 39 during the [[Greek telephone tapping case 2004-2005]] scandal- it looked like a suicide.

Tsalikidis was [[Vodafone Greece]]'s Network Planning Manager when it was uncovered that Vodafone Greece was involved in one of the biggest political scandals of recent [[Greece|Greek]] history - tapping mobile phones of members of the cabinet, the Prime Minister, and hundreds of others.

The authorities and the media strongly feel that Tsalikidis‘s death 
was associated with his position 
in the company.

==Background==
Kostas Tsalikidis was born on July 23, 1966. He worked for Vodafone Greece for almost 11 years, beginning as Switching Planning and Technology Manager. From 2001 till his death, he was responsible for all planning activities for the [[GSM]], [[GPRS]] and [[UMTS]] Vodafone Panafon Core Network (Design, Architecture, Dimensioning, Ordering, Rollout, Interconnect, Optimisation). He was also responsible for all technology issues of the Core Network (GSM, GPRS functionalities implementation and Roadmap), and liaison with Vodafone Global regarding Vodafone Networks Evolution road-maps.

Tsalikidis received his diploma from the [[National Technical University of Athens]] (NTUA), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. His specialization was in Telecommunications and dissertation topic on “Air Interface Measurements Collection for Mobile Telephony Systems.” He has attended seminars at the Athens University, on Management and Business Administration, technical seminars on Telecommunications, GSM Systems, Data Networks, Transport Techniques, and a number of Skills Development seminars on Team Work, Team Building, Communication Skills, Project Management and Negotiation capabilities.

As a person he was a warm, giving, honest and sharing human being. He was in an 8-year relationship to Sarra and planning to get married in June – three months after he died. They were a cheerful couple who loved travelling in their spare time all over Greece and abroad.
Some of Kostas’ hobbies were to collect vintage rock records from the 60’s and 70’s and children’s toys from the same epoch.

As a professional, he was extremely responsible and conscientious, and according to his senior colleagues he really loved his job.

==Timeline of events according to the press==

'''March 4, 2005'''
Vodafone discovers (as per company statements) foreign “interception” software in its network. Vodafone Greece doesn’t formally take the position that [[Ericsson]] installed before the [[Olympic games]] a “legal interception” software, which was subsequently locked and shut down.

'''March 5, 2005'''
Vodafone decides to remove the foreign interception software without finding the culprits of the [[wire tapping]]. Thus, according to many experts the culprits can no longer be traced. Mr. Koronias, CEO of Vodafone Greece, claimed before the Parliamentary Committee on Transparency that no one had asked him to reactivate the illegal software in order to trace the phones that intercepted the conversations in question.

The company claims that they have back up copies of the deleted data and that they committed no illegal act within the boundaries of the Act for the Protection of the Privacy of Telecommunications.

'''March 9, 2005'''
Costantinos Tsalikidis, Network Planning Supervisor for Vodafone and top level manager for the company, is found hanged in his apartment. He never left a (suicide) note nor any indication that he was suffering from any personal problems. No autopsy was conducted in situ, and the forensic report was inconclusive.

The circumstances around the death of Tsalikidis, were pronounced a year later as questionable and directly connected to his professional position at Vodafone, and the Athens Prosecutor re-opened the case. Vodafone Greece never sent a condolence telegraph to the deceased’s family, despite the fact that Mr. Tsalikidis worked at Vodafone for over a decade.
'''
March 10, 2005'''
The CEO of Vodafone Greece, Mr. Koronias, briefs the Prime Minister of Greece in the presence of a Prosecutor about the wire tapping. Among the phones that were tapped was that of the Prime Minister as well as all the ministers of the current government, Members of the Parliamentary Opposition, as well as other non-parliamentary officials. He also mentions the «suicide» without however, connecting it to the wire tapping incident.

The following year however, in the context of the legal proceedings that began on February 8, 2006,  Mr. Giorgos Koronias claimed that he had the complete approval of the government, especially the Prime Minister himself, for his actions. The matter was deemed one of top national security and top secret by the government. The question at hand is why the Greek Authority for the Assurance of Information and Communication Privacy was not informed and why regular legal procedures were not followed before deactivating the software.

'''March 11, 2005'''
The Prosecutor for the Supreme Court, Mr. Dimitris Linos gives a direct order for an urgent and secret preliminary investigation to the Head Prosecutor in person. In this order there is no written mention of the suicide.

The question at hand concerns what are the findings of this 11-month investigation that has been conducted since 11 March 2005 until today, and why the entire case seems to be re-examined from scratch.

'''June 11, 2005'''
The local police precinct that investigated the death of Tsalikidis, closes the case on the suicide and sends the files to the Prosecutor’s office. According to the police, no evidence of a break-in was found, therefore, they did not see the need to conduct an autopsy nor to take fingerprints.

Vodafone Greece did not hand over any personal effects of Tsalikidis nor any data from his personal computer to his family or to the authorities, which would have greatly assisted in any investigation by the local precinct.

'''January 30, 2006'''
The Head Prosecutor, Mr. Papagelopoulos, claims to have been informed about the suicide case from the Major General, who mentioned the suicide outside of the court proceedings. A year later Vodafone Greece remained silent on the type of internal investigation that took place, on whether suspects were located and what type of sanctions were imposed on them relating to what is possibly the biggest political scandal in the modern history of Greece.

'''February 1, 2006'''
The preliminary investigation conducted by Mr. Papangelopoulos regarding the wire tapping is concluded with the closing statement that he was awaiting evidence from the State authorities.

'''February 2, 2006'''
Criminal charges are filed against unknown perpetrators for wire tapping. On the same day, three ministers make statements to the press where they congratulate Mr. Koronias for his stance to erase the software program. The next day the press characterizes the handling of this case as a huge political and communication blunder.

'''February 3, 2006'''
The press widely believes that the wire tapping case is related to the suicide of Tsalikidis. This is first page news in all the press and mass media of the country for the next two weeks. Countless news programs are assuming that the suicide of Tsalikidis may not have been a suicide.

'''February 8, 2006'''
The investigation of Tsalikidis’ death is handed over to the highly experienced Prosecutor, Mr. Diotis. For the first time in a year since the death of Tsalikidis an investigation of his apartment is conducted. The results have not been made public yet.

'''March 9, 2006'''
The day of the anniversary of Tsalikidis’ death, Mr. Koronias is cross-examined by the Parliamentary Committee on Institutions and Transparency. He stated that he did not order or receive the «lawful interception» software program. He also said that as the producer of the software, Ericsson was responsible since they had fully trained personnel on the functioning of the software program.

Mr. Koronias stated that Vodafone has a very technologically elaborate security system and that it was because of his diligence that the incident was considered to be of «national security.» Parliament also suppoenaed the head of Ericsson to appear in a future hearing.

With regard to the death of Tsalikidis, Mr. Koronias said that he mentioned the «suicide» to the ministers that he met with in March 2005 and that Vodafone was assisting authorities in any way possible with their investigation. The question here is whether an internal investigation file exists on Tsalikidis, and if so why the family members have never been informed of its findings.

'''September 7, 2011'''
Tsalikidis' family and their lawyers asked for the case to be reopened, claiming that forensic medical examination results prove that Tsalikidis' death could not have been suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=307811|title=Ελευθεροτυπία, ""Δεν αυτοκτόνησε ο Κώστας Τσαλικίδης""|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Batman's treaty ===
In April 1835, [[John Batman]], a prominent [[wiktionary:grazier|grazier]] and a member of the Geelong and Dutigalla Association (later [[Port Phillip Association]]),&lt;ref name="Batman"&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=John|Last=Batman|shortlink=0-dict-biogBa.html#batman1 | accessdate = 2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PPA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Port Phillip Association | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | year = 2009 | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/470938/Port-Phillip-Association | format = Web | accessdate = 2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; sailed from [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] on the island of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now the State of [[Tasmania]]), aboard the [[schooner]] ''[[Schooner Rebecca|Rebecca]]'', in search of fresh [[grazing]] land in the south-east of the Colony of [[New South Wales]] (the mainland [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]]). He sailed across [[Bass Strait]], into the bay of [[Port Phillip]], and arrived at the mouth of the [[Yarra River]] in May.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of John Batman |publisher=[[State Library of Victoria]] |date= |url=http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/portphillip/inter/3565.shtml |format=Web |accessdate=2009-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921234032/http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/portphillip/inter/3565.shtml |archivedate=21 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After exploring the surrounding area, he met with the elders of the indigenous Aboriginal group, the [[Wurundjeri]] of the [[Kulin]] nation alliance, and negotiated a transaction for 600,000 [[acres]] (2,400&amp;nbsp;km²; 940&amp;nbsp;mi²) which later became known as ''[[Batman's Treaty]]''.&lt;ref name=Deed&gt;{{cite web|title=The Deed |work=Batmania |publisher=[[National Museum of Australia]] |date= |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/kidz/batmania/batmania_html_version/the_deed/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726201049/http://www.nma.gov.au/kidz/batmania/batmania_html_version/the_deed/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-26 |format=Web |accessdate=2009-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction, which is believed to have taken place on the bank of [[Merri Creek]] (near the modern day suburb of [[Northcote, Victoria|Northcote]]),&lt;ref name="MerriMerri"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ellender | last2 = Christiansen | first1 = Isabel | first2 = Peter | title = People of the Merri Merri.

Upon returning to Van Diemen's Land, Batman's [[treaty]] was deemed invalid by the [[Governor of New South Wales]], Sir [[Richard Bourke]], under the ''[[wikisource:Governor Bourke's Proclamation, 26 August 1835|Proclamation of Governor Bourke]]'' in August 1835.&lt;ref name="Bourke"&gt;{{cite web|title=Governor Bourke's Proclamation 1835 |work=Documenting Democracy |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |date= |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=42&amp;aID=8&amp;pID=73/ |format=Web |accessdate=2009-09-25 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the belief of Governor Bourke, as well as the [[Governor of Tasmania|Governor of Van Diemen's Land]], Sir [[Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet|George Arthur]], that the Aboriginal people did not have any official claims to the lands of the Australian continent. The [[proclamation]] formally declared, under the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'', that [[The Crown]] owned the whole of the Australian continent and that only it alone could sell and distribute land.&lt;ref name="Bourke" /&gt; It therefore voided any contracts or treaties made without the consent of the government, and declared any person attempting to rely on such a treaty to be [[trespass]]ing.&lt;ref name="Bourke" /&gt; However, at the time the proclamation was being drawn up, a prominent [[Businessperson|businessman]] from Van Diemen's Land, [[John Pascoe Fawkner]], had also funded an [[wiktionary:expedition|expedition]] to the area; which sailed from [[George Town, Tasmania|George Town]] aboard the schooner ''[[Enterprize (1829)|Enterprize]]''.&lt;ref name="Fawkner"&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=John Pascoe|Last=Fawkner|shortlink=0-dict-biogF.html#Fawkner1 | accessdate = 2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Port Phillip Association had also funded a second expedition; which sailed from Launceston aboard the ''Rebecca''.&lt;ref name="Batman" /&gt;

[[File:Ac.fawkner.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[John Pascoe Fawkner]]]]

=== Fawkner's fait accompli ===
The settlement party aboard the ''Enterprize'' entered the Yarra River, and anchored close to the site chosen by Batman, on 29 August.&lt;ref name="settlement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation of the Settlement |work=History of the City of Melbourne |publisher=[[City of Melbourne]] |year=1997 |url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/History/HistoryMelbourne.PDF |format=PDF |pages=8–10 |accessdate=2009-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922180717/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/History/HistoryMelbourne.PDF |archivedate=22 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party went ashore the following day (near what is today [[William Street, Melbourne|William Street]]; and is now celebrated as [[Melbourne Day]]) and landed their stores, livestock and began to construct the settlement.&lt;ref name="Fawkner" /&gt; The Association party aboard the ''Rebecca'' arrived in September after spending time at a temporary camp at [[Indented Head, Victoria|Indented Head]], where they encountered [[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]] – an escaped convict, believed dead, who had been living for 32 years with the indigenous Aboriginal group, the [[Wathaurong]] of the Kulin nation alliance.&lt;ref name="Buckley"&gt;{{cite book | last = Morgan | first = John | title = The Life and Times of William Buckley | publisher = Archibald MacDougall | format = Web | year = 1852 | location = Hobart | pages = 116 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AM4NAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | isbn = | accessdate = 2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman was dismayed to discover the settlers of the ''Enterprize'' had established a settlement in the area and informed the settlers that they were trespassing on the Association's land. However, according to the ''Proclamation of Governor Bourke'', both the parties were in fact trespassing on [[Crown land]].&lt;ref name="Bourke" /&gt; When Fawkner (who was noted for his [[wiktionary:democratic|democratic]] nature)&lt;ref name="Fawkner" /&gt; arrived in October, and following tense arguments between the two parties, negotiation were made for land to be shared equally.

As Fawkner had arrived after the two parties, he was aware of the ''Proclamation of Governor Bourke'', which had gained approval from the [[Colonial Office]] in October.&lt;ref name="Bourke" /&gt; He knew that cooperation would be vital if the settlement was to continue to exist ''[[wiktionary:fait accompli|fait accompli]]''. Land was then divided, and the settlement existed peacefully, but without a formal system of governance.&lt;ref name="settlement" /&gt; It was referred to by a number of names, including: "Batmania" and "Bearbrass"&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bearbrass"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reed | first = Alexander Wyclif | title = Place names of Australia | publisher = Reed | year = 1973 | location = Sydney | pages = 149 | isbn = 0-589-50128-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which the latter was agreed upon by Batman and Fawkner.&lt;ref name="Bearbrass" /&gt; Fawkner assumed a leading role in the establishment of Bearbrass;&lt;ref name="Fawkner" /&gt; which, by early 1836, consisted of 177 [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|European settlers]] (142 male and 35 female settlers).&lt;ref name="settlement" /&gt; The [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies|Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Charles Grant]], recognised the settlement's ''fait accompli'' that same year, and authorised Governor Bourke to transfer Bearbrass to a Crown settlement.&lt;ref name="settlement" /&gt; Batman and the Port Phillip Association were compensated [[Australian pound|£]]7,000 for the land.&lt;ref name="Batman" /&gt; And, in March 1837, it was officially renamed "Melbourne" by Governor Bourke in honour of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] of the day, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|William Lamb]] (the Lord Melbourne).&lt;ref name="settlement" /&gt;

== Boundaries and geography ==
[[File:Melbourne, 1903.jpg|thumb|left|280px|The Melbourne central business district, 1903]]
[[File:Map of central Melbourne 3384553.PNG|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Map of Melbourne City Centre]]
The City Centre is bordered by [[Spencer Street]] to the west and extends north as far as [[Grattan Street]] which borders [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]]. The border extends along [[La Trobe Street]], [[William Street, Melbourne|William Street]], Peel Street, Grattan Street, taking in the [[Queen Victoria Market]], Berkeley Street, [[Victoria Street, Melbourne|Victoria Street]]. To the east it is bordered by [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]], however the area extends east to take in parts of Wellington Parade, Brunton Avenue, [[Hoddle Highway|Punt Road]] and the Yarra River.

It borders [[South Yarra]] to the south east at Anderson Street, Domain Road, Domain Street, Arnold Street, [[Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park]], Commercial Road, High Street. It also borders both [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] along [[St Kilda Road]] and [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]] along Queens Road, Lakeside Drive and [[South Melbourne]] along Albert Road, [[Princes Highway|Kings Way]], Palmerston Crescent, Wells Place and finally [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]] along St Kilda Road and the south side of [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]] (Northbank) which includes [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] and the [[Melbourne Aquarium]].

Although these are the borders on official maps, there are several adjoining areas that function as part of the Central Activities District. This includes [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]] (with [[Docklands Stadium]]), [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[South Wharf, Victoria|South Wharf]] and [[East Melbourne]]/Jolimont (with the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]). Despite the area being described as the ''centre'', it is neither the geographic or demographic centre of Melbourne, due to an [[urban sprawl]] to the south east; the geographic centre is currently{{when|date=December 2011}} located at Bourne Street, [[Glen Iris, Victoria|Glen Iris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/08/04/1028157880515.html Glen Iris still the heart of city's sprawl], ''[[The Age]], 5 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hoddle Grid ===

[[File:Queen Street Melbourne underground public toilet.jpg|thumb|right|A public underground toilet on [[Queen Street, Melbourne|Queen Street]]]]
The Hoddle Grid is the layout of the streets in the centre of the original Melbourne City Centre. The [[Grid plan|grid]] was laid out in 1837 by [[Robert Hoddle]]. All major streets are one and half [[chain (unit)|chains]] (99&amp;nbsp;ft or 30&amp;nbsp;m) in width, while all blocks are exactly 10 chains square (10 [[acre]]s, 201&amp;nbsp;m × 201&amp;nbsp;m). It is one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) long by half a mile wide (0.80&amp;nbsp;km). The grid's longest axis is oriented 70 degrees clockwise from true north, to align better with the course of the [[Yarra River]]. The majority of Melbourne is oriented at 8 degrees clockwise from true north–noting that magnetic north was 8° 3' E in 1900, increasing to 11° 42' E in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomagmodels/Declination.jsp Magnetic Declination]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the area from [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]] to [[Queen Victoria Market]], and from [[Spencer Street]] to [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]].

From the 1870s to 1920s, the central part of Melbourne was home to mostly medical professionals who had established practices along [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] and [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=53&amp;pg=728 Collins Street] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003232706/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=53&amp;pg=728 |date=3 October 2006 }} from the City of Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1960s, only a handful of permanent residents lived in the Spring Street area and St Kilda Road. The area was largely unpopular for residents and Council policies did not permit development of apartment style housing in the area. 

St Kilda Road was annexed in the 1960s and given the postcode of Melbourne 3004 to stimulate office development along the strip and reduce pressure on overdevelopment of the Hoddle Grid. The result was the demolition of many of the street's grand mansions.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

During Melbourne's colonial formation, no space in the city was given to [[public square]]s or [[piazza]]s, as was common in European and North American cities, because colonial planning in Australia was designed to avoid any facilitation of protests or public loitering.&lt;ref name="Colonial control"&gt;{{cite news|title=Australians don't loiter in public space – the legacy of colonial control by design|url=https://theconversation.com/australians-dont-loiter-in-public-space-the-legacy-of-colonial-control-by-design-76979|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in the 20th century, the majority of Melbourne's inhabitants would commute into the CBD purely for work purposes, and thus little time was spent in the city recreationally. In the 1970s, one commentator remarked that [[Little Lonsdale Street]] was "as deserted as war-torn Berlin”.&lt;ref name="Colonial control" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare house in Melbourne's CBD to return to its commercial roots|work=Commercial Real Estate|url=https://www.commercialrealestate.com.au/news/rare-house-in-melbournes-cbd-set-to-return-to-its-commercial-roots/|date=16 March 2017|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public planning policy shifted in the 1980s and interest in the CBD was renewed. In the 2000s and the 2010s, inner-city living has increased, attracting international investors particularly those from China.

== Demographics ==
According to the {{CensusAU|2016}}, there were 47,285 residents. 20.0% of residents were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were China 21.5%, Malaysia 7.2%, India 5.7%, Indonesia 3.9% and South Korea 3.4%. 28.8% of residents spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 26.4%, Cantonese 4.9%, Indonesian 3.5%, Korean 3.1% and Thai 2.3%. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 43.6%&lt;ref name="ABS"/&gt;

Central Melbourne has one of the fastest growing residential populations in Australia. Residents of the city centre are of mixed social status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=91&amp;pg=866#social City of Melbourne – Research – Who lives in the city?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003191022/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=91&amp;pg=866 |date=3 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, living in the centre of the city offers proximity to work and the best access to [[public transport]]. On the other hand, there are many [[strata title]]d [[studio apartment]]s that have no carparks and limited space. As a result, there is a mix of students and young urban professionals living in the locality of Melbourne, with a relatively low [[car dependency]].

== Economy ==
[[File:Melbourne by night.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Eureka Tower]] and [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]] on the [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]]]]
The City Centre is the core [[Central Activities District|central activities district]] (CAD) of Melbourne's [[inner suburb]]s. It encompasses a number of places of significance, which include the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]], [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]], [[Federation Square]], [[Flinders Street railway station]], [[Melbourne Aquarium]], [[Melbourne Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre]], [[Melbourne Town Hall]], [[National Gallery of Victoria]], [[Arts Centre Melbourne]], [[State Library of Victoria]], [[Parliament House, Melbourne|State Parliament of Victoria]] and [[Supreme Court of Victoria]]. Bordering its north-east perimeter is the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]]-listed [[Royal Exhibition Building]] and [[Carlton Gardens]] as well as the [[Melbourne Museum]]. It is also the main [[Terminal train station|terminus]] for the [[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne metropolitan]] and [[Rail transport in Victoria|Victorian regional]] passenger rail networks–being [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street]] and [[Southern Cross railway station|Southern Cross]] stations respectively, as well as the most dense section of the [[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne tram network]].
[[File:Town hall administration buildings melbourne.jpg|thumb|left|Town Hall administration buildings]]
The City Centre is the major [[central business district]] (CBD) of Greater Melbourne's [[metropolitan area]], and a major [[financial centre]] in Australia and the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, John (1997), [http://www.unesco.org/most/friedman.htm "Cities Unbound: The Intercity Network in the Asia-Pacific Region"], ''Management of Social Transformations'', [[UNESCO]], retrieved: 5 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to the corporate headquarters of the World's two largest mining companies: [[BHP]] and [[Rio Tinto Group]]; as well as two of Australia's "big four" banks: [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]] and the [[National Australia Bank]], its two largest gaming companies: [[Crown Limited|Crown]] and [[Tabcorp Holdings|Tabcorp]], largest telecommunications company [[Telstra]], two largest transport management companies: [[Toll Holdings|Toll]] and [[Transurban]] and the iconic brewing company [[Foster's Group]].

It also serves as the main [[administrative centre]] for the [[City of Melbourne]] as well as the [[Government of Victoria|State Government of Victoria]] – the latter with the suburb of [[East Melbourne]]. Three universities have major campuses in the area: Three campuses for [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] (City King, Queen, Flinders campuses) in Center, One campus for the [[RMIT University]] ([[RMIT Melbourne City campus|city campus]]) in Northern and the [[University of Melbourne]] ([[Victorian College of the Arts]]) in Southern.

Melbourne City Centre, compared with other Australian cities, has comparatively unrestricted height limits and as a result of waves of post-war development contains five of the six [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|tallest buildings in Australia]], the tallest of which is the [[Eureka Tower]], situated in Southbank. It has an observation deck near the top from where you can see above all of Melbourne's structures.&lt;ref name="Eureka1"&gt;{{cite web

=== Arts ===
{{Further|List of theatres in the Melbourne City Centre}}
Notable theatres and performance venues in the City Centre include [[Arts Centre Melbourne]] (which includes the [[State Theatre (Melbourne)|State Theatre]], [[Hamer Hall, Melbourne|Hamer Hall]], the Playhouse and the Fairfax Studio), [[Melbourne Recital Centre]], [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]], [[Princess Theatre, Melbourne|Princess Theatre]], [[Regent Theatre, Melbourne|Regent Theatre]], [[Forum Theatre]], [[Palace Theatre, Melbourne|Palace Theatre]], [[Comedy Theatre, Melbourne|Comedy Theatre]], [[Athenaeum, Melbourne|Athenaeum Theatre]], [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne|Her Majesty's Theatre]], [[Capitol Theatre, Melbourne|Capitol Theatre]], [[Palais Theatre]] and the [[Australian Centre for Contemporary Art]].

It is also the literary centre of Australia, and has more bookshops and publishing companies per capita than any other city in Australia, and includes the headquarters of the World's largest travel guidebook publisher ''[[Lonely Planet]]''. In 2008, it was designated a "City of Literature" by [[UNESCO]] in its [[Creative Cities Network]].&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org" /&gt; Melbourne has been placed alongside New York and Berlin as one of the world's great street art meccas,&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Jessica.

Retrieved 16 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and its extensive street art-laden laneways, alleys and arcades were voted by ''[[Lonely Planet]]'' readers as Australia's top cultural attraction.&lt;ref name="Graff"&gt;Topsfield, Jewel.

=== Sports ===
Most professional sporting clubs represent Greater Melbourne (e.g. [[Melbourne Victory]], [[Melbourne Storm]]). An exception is the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] and [[Melbourne Football Club]] (its offshoot), both based at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] which was built in Jolimont, adjacent to the city but a locality of the suburb of East Melbourne. Both were the first clubs of their respective sports and established in a time when the city's population was still very small and limited to a handful of inner suburbs. As a result, the Melbourne Cricket Club has a fairly exclusive membership, whilst the Melbourne Football Club, although bearing the name Melbourne, is associated by the supporters of other suburban clubs as representing the central suburb and perceive its supporters to represent the locality and not the entire city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.convictcreations.com/football/melbourne.htm Melbourne Demons – The rust bucket of Australia] from ConvictCreations.com&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, despite its rich tradition and early success, it is one of the least supported clubs in the [[VFL/AFL]]. The lack of identity resulted in a push for the [[Melbourne Hawks]], which was stopped by intervention from [[Joseph Gutnick]] and the majority of the [[Hawthorn Football Club]] members. It has had intense rivalries with younger clubs from the adjacent inner suburbs such as the [[Collingwood Football Club]] and early inter-town rival [[Geelong Football Club]]. The Melbourne Football Club has recently made efforts to shed its suburban tag and be embraced by the whole metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/realfooty/news/AFL/A-new-base-for-Demons/2005/03/01/1109546868430.html A new base for Demons?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708054346/http://www.theage.com.au/realfooty/news/AFL/A-new-base-for-Demons/2005/03/01/1109546868430.html |date=8 July 2006 }} from the Age&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this, the club recently employed strategies such as establishing ''Team Melbourne'', (a group of sporting teams which bear the name "Melbourne"), and a strategy for promoting the brand as representing the city in [[China]] through club supporter and former Lord Mayor [[John So]].

Golf is played at the course of the Albert Park Golf Club on Queens Road.&lt;ref name="golf"&gt;{{Citation  | author= Golf Select | title = Albert Park | url = http://www.golfselect.com.au/armchair/courseView.aspx?course_id=255 | accessdate = 2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Events ===
The City Centre has hosted a number of events of significance, which include: the [[Australian federal election, 1901|1901 inauguration]] of the [[Government of Australia]], [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympic Games]], [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|1981 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]], [[World Police and Fire Games|1995 World Police and Fire Games]], [[World Economic Forum|2000 World Economic Forum]], [[2006 Commonwealth Games]], [[2015 Cricket World Cup]] and [[2006 G20 ministerial meeting|G20 Ministerial Meeting]] – among others. It is also recognised for the substantial number of [[Culture of Melbourne|cultural and sports events and festivals]] it holds annually – many being the largest in Australia and the World.

== Transport ==
{{Main|Transport in Melbourne}}
[[File:C2.5113 bourke, 2014(3).jpg|thumb|right|A C2 tram on [[Bourke Street]]]]

The Melbourne City Centre is the transport hub of the city.

The city is serviced by five railway stations as part of the [[City Loop|Melbourne Underground Rail Loop]]: [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]], which is the hub for [[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne's suburban train network]] and the busiest station,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ptv.vic.gov.au/about-ptv/ptv-data-and-reports/research-and-statistics/|title=Research and statistics|last=|first=|date=2013–2014|website=|publisher=Public Transport Victoria|access-date=23 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523190157/http://ptv.vic.gov.au/about-ptv/ptv-data-and-reports/research-and-statistics|archive-date=23 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southern Cross railway station|Southern Cross station]], which is the hub for regional and interstate transit located on Spencer Street, and three underground stations–[[Parliament railway station|Parliament]], [[Melbourne Central railway station|Melbourne Central]] and [[Flagstaff railway station|Flagstaff]] stations.
[[File:The Yarra River and Flinders Street Station.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] across the [[Yarra River]]]]
[[Trams in Melbourne|Trams]] run down the main streets of Flinders, Collins, Bourke and [[La Trobe Street|La Trobe]] as well as Spencer, [[Market Street, Melbourne|Market]], [[Elizabeth Street, Melbourne|Elizabeth]], [[Swanston Street|Swanston]], Spring and [[Swan Street]]s and St Kilda Road. There are several large accessibility tram "superstops" located in Flinders Street, Collins Street, Swanston Street and Bourke Street Mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ptv.vic.gov.au/getting-around/accessible-transport/accessible-trams|title=Accessible trams|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Public Transport Victoria|access-date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is also well connected by bus services, with majority of buses running down [[Lonsdale Street]]. Major bus stops include Melbourne Central and [[Queen Victoria Village]]. Most bus routes service suburbs north and east of the city given the lack of train lines to these areas.

Major bicycle trails lead to the CBD and a main bicycle path down Swanston Street.

Ferries dock along the northbank of the Yarra at [[Federation Wharf]] and the [[turning basin]] at the [[Melbourne Sports &amp;Aquatic Centre|Aquatic Centre]]. There is also a water taxi service to Melbourne and Olympic Parks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1739">'''MicroVacuum''' Ltd. is a Hungarian biotechnology company based in [[Budapest]]. MicroVacuum is a global supplier of label-free [[biosensor]] systems for the [[Biology|life-science]] research market to provide real-time, label free detection and characterization of surface adsorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/events/conferences/international-conference-on-label-free-technologies/exhibitors-and-sponsors/microvacuum|title=MicroVacuum|publisher=Elsevier|access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MicroVacuum develops, manufactures, and markets the OWLS label-free, real-time biosensor system based on the grating coupler waveguide technology. The OW optical sensors and OWLS analytical system allow the determination of the affinity and kinetics of a wide variety of molecular interactions in real time, without the need for a molecular tag or label. 

Applications include protein quantification, classification of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, [[Drug test|drug screening]], and immunosensing. 

The main biosensing applications of the OWLS technology are as follows:

* Adsorption of proteins at surfaces
* Immunosensing
* Drug screening
* Ligand / receptor binding
* Kinetics of adhesion, growth and spreading of living cells
* Protein - [[lipid bilayer]] interactions
* Protein - DNA interactions
* Molecular [[self-assembly]] &amp; nanoscience
* Analysis of association and dissociation kinetics

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3664">'''NZNOG''' is the '''New Zealand Network Operators' Group'''. Originally formed as a [[mailing list]] hosted by the [[University of Waikato]] and intended to provide a means of easy collaboration between [[Internet service provider]] network operations staff, its role has expanded to that of an online community of network operators, predominantly in the ISP space, allowing for the discussion of topics of a technical and operational nature. NZNOG has existed as a legal entity in the form of the NZNOG Trust since 2009.

NZNOG runs a yearly [[Academic conference|conference]], during which workshops, tutorials and presentations on various topics of interest to the network operations community in New Zealand. It also provides an excellent opportunity to network with others in the industry - there is usually at least one evening which provides a catered dinner, as well as opportunity for [[Birds of a Feather (computing)|BoF]]'s.

The ongoing success of the NZNOG Conference owes much to the enthusiastic support of its participants, being key staff of various [[New Zealand]] Internet service providers, IT companies and tertiary education institutions.

As an example of the role NZNOG has had in the Internet world in New Zealand, it played a major part in the formation of the first of the vendor-neutral Peering Exchanges in New Zealand - such as the [[Wellington Internet Exchange]] (WIX) and the [[Auckland Peering Exchange]] (APE).

The NZNOG mailing list remains a fairly influential aspect of the New Zealand Internet service provider community, and a useful communications channel for the participants.

The '''National Digital Newspaper Program''' is a joint project between the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[Library of Congress]] to create and maintain a publicly available, online digital archive of historically significant newspapers published in the United States between 1836 and 1922.  Additionally, the program will make available bibliographic records and holdings information for some 140,000 newspaper titles from the 17th century to the present.  Further, it will include scope notes and encyclopedia-style entries discussing the historical significance of specific newspapers. Added content will also include contextually relevant historical information. "One organization within each U.S. state or territory will receive an award to collaborate with relevant state partners in this effort."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/ndnp.html National Digital Newspaper Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007 more than 226,000 pages of newspapers from California, Florida, Kentucky, New York, Utah, Virginia and the District of Columbia published between 1900 and 1910 were put online at a fully searchable site called "[[Chronicling America]]." [https://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/] As of December 2007, the total number of pages is about 413,000. This further expanded to be 1 million pages in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-123.html|title=Library of Congress, National Endowment for the Humanities Celebrate Millionth Page in Chronicling America Program|date=June 16, 2009 |publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding through the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] is carried out through their "We The People" initiative.

== Purpose ==
This project dovetails with the [[United States Newspaper Program]] which was a massive project to microfilm newspaper collections. The initiators of that earlier project asserted that the intellectual content of newspapers serves an important role for researchers as it is for all intents and purposes the first draft of history. Newspapers also provide unique access to "diverse geographic viewpoints at the community level."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlcnet.org/objects/rte/mediaupload/File/eventsdocs/events/05newspapers/05Sweeney-2_files/frame.htm The U.S. Newspaper Program – Scope, Achievement, and Progress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Problematically, since the middle of the 19th century this "first draft" has been recorded on poor quality [[newsprint]] which is decaying rapidly. This digitization project's purpose is to continue preserving newspaper and newspaper collections while addressing the inadequacies of the prior program. Through digitization, it is more likely that images will be copied with fidelity and that the records will be more richly searchable. This latter point is huge as newspapers traditionally posed a research challenge due to density of text and inadequate cataloging of content.

== History ==
On March 31, 2004, [[Bruce Cole]], the directory of the NEH, and [[James H. Billington|James Billington]], the Librarian of Congress, signed an agreement creating the National Digital Newspaper Program.  The NDNP follows in the footsteps of the successful [[United States Newspaper Program]], a several-decade effort to catalog and microfilm the bulk of America's historic newspapers. The program is broken down into two phases. Each successive phase will both increase the scope of the program and refine the requirements for data collection.

=== Phase 1 ===
In July 2004 the award guidelines were issued. Applications were due in October and awardees were announced the following March. The first phase took newspapers from a small subset of the states, limited to 1900 through 1910.  After using this phase to improve technical requirements and specifications, the program was opened to other awardees in [[#Phase 2|Phase 2]].

The awardees for Phase 1 are:
* [[University of California, Riverside]]
* [[University of Florida Digital Collections|University of Florida Libraries]], Gainesville
* [[University of Kentucky#Libraries|University of Kentucky Libraries]], Lexington
* [[New York Public Library]], New York City
* University of Utah, Salt Lake City [http://www.lib.utah.edu/digital/unews/]
* Library of Virginia, Richmond

The General-access Phase 1 website prototype was implemented in March 2007 and that May it was announced that phase 1 was completed.

=== Phase 2 ===
Phase 2 of NDNP expanded grants to an additional group of institutions. Awards granted in 2007 and 2008 included the following institutions:

* [[Arizona State Library, Archives and Records Management]]
* [[University of Hawaii]]
* [[Minnesota Historical Society]]
* [[University of Nebraska, Lincoln]]
* [[University of North Texas]]
* [[Ohio Historical Society]], Columbus
* [[Pennsylvania State University]]
* [[State Historical Society of Missouri]]
* [[Washington State Library]]

== Program Technology ==
Participants must follow the technical guidelines laid out in a 64-page PDF.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/pdf/NDNP_200709TechNotes.pdf Ndnp: Technical Notes On Formats For Digital Reproductions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The technology for the NDNP digital repository is being built using largely [[Open-source software|open source]] software, including:
* [[Fedora (software)|Fedora]]
* [[Apache Cocoon]]
* [[Gentoo Linux]]
* [[Apache Lucene]]
Digital objects are stored in .TIFF 6.0, .JPEG 2000, and .PDF formats. Metadata is provided in the METS/MODS version of XML and XML provides the basis for larger hierarchical structures as well.

== Alternatives ==
The scanning efforts of the government entity has been dwarfed by the private efforts [[newspapers.com]] and [[newspaperarchive.com]] which as of March 2018 claim to each have scanned more than 350 million pages.  Publishers, libraries and historical organizations find the private sector faster, less complicated and cheaper than the National Digital Newspaper Program.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Both private organizations charge readers to read, but do not charge publishers to scan items.&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.com/blog/2014/05/18/a-retiree-digitizes-27-million-old-newsp&lt;/ref&gt;

Its primary index is the [[Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index]].

The other indices are
* New Orders
* Employment
* Supplier Deliveries
* Inventories
* Prices 
* Backlog of Orders 
* New Export Orders
* Imports
* Inventory Sentiment

Business Activity, New Orders, Imports, and Employment indices are seasonally adjusted.

==Background==
Born in [[Simrishamn]] in southern Sweden, the youngest of three children, he grew up in [[Uddevalla]], north of [[Gothenburg]], where his parents operated a small printing company. Barnevik was educated at the [[University of Gothenburg]]'s [[School of Business, Economics and Law]] and at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]. He has received seven [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]] in Sweden, Finland and the U.S., including from [[Linköping University]] (1989) and the [[University of Gothenburg]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary doctors at Linköping University|url=https://liu.se/en/article/honorary-doctors|publisher=Linköping University|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hedersdoktorer [Honorary Doctors]|url=https://handels.gu.se/om_handelshogskolan/fakta_+och+_historia/hedersdoktorer|publisher=University of Gothenburg, School of Business, Economics and Law|accessdate=1 February 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In 1993, Barnevik received the [[IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/weber_rl.pdf |title=IEEE Ernst Weber Engineering Leadership Recognition Recipients |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Barnevik started his professional career in the Swedish company Datema, but soon moved to [[Sandvik]]. In [[Sandviken]], where between the years 1969 and 1970 he hired over 150 people, his employees said "he has some kind of magic in him—you just can't refuse his offer." He developed unique relationships with many of his colleagues which helped him to improve the communication. In 1975, he was promoted to CEO of Sandvik's American operations, Sandvik Steel. Within the next four years he tripled the revenues, grossing $250 million, and turned the company profitable. During his work in the United States, Sandvik started competing against the industry leaders, such as [[General Electric]] and [[U.S. Steel]].

In 1979 he joined [[ASEA]], a leading Swedish heavy industrial company based in [[Västerås]]. In 1987 he decided to merge with its Swiss competitor – [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]]. It was the largest merger at that time. He held the position of CEO of ASEA 1980–87, was CEO of ABB from  1988 to 1996. He was Chairman of Sandvik 1983–2002, Chairman of [[Skanska]] 1992–1997, Chairman of [[Investor AB]] 1997–2002, Chairman of [[AstraZeneca]] 1999–2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrazeneca.at/Documents/AZNews/L040311LouisSchweitzer.doc ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202004831/http://www.astrazeneca.at/Documents/AZNews/L040311LouisSchweitzer.doc |date=2 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman of ABB 1996–2002, Member of the Board of [[DuPont]], USA 1991–1998 and Member of the Board of [[General Motors]], USA 1996-2009. He was also a regular [[Bilderberg Group]] [[List of Bilderberg attendees|attendee]] 1992–2001 and belonged to the group's Steering Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html|title=Former Steering Committee Members|work=bilderbergmeetings.org|publisher=[[Bilderberg Group]]|accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his eight years as CEO of ASEA followed by the nine years as CEO of ABB, the company achieved an increase of stock value of 87 times or 30% average per year over the 17 years. Net profit increased 60 times and sales 30 times. Based upon these extraordinary results Barnevik received a one-off payment of 148 million Swiss francs when he retired as CEO in 1996. 2002, six years later under a second succeeding CEO, ABB stock market value plummeted from 54.50 francs in 2000 to just under 15 francs. When ABB's board made the pension payment public, a huge scandal ensued and Barnevik was forced to resign as chairman of Investor, the Swedish investment company controlled by the powerful [[Wallenberg family]], and to hand back a large chunk of his pension to ABB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1866190.stm |work=BBC News | title=ABB ex-bosses pay back benefits | date=11 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/C1256C290031524BC1256B0B003B8C36.aspx |title=Jürgen Dormann succeeds Percy Barnevik as chairman of ABB |publisher=Abb.com |date=21 November 2001 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 2003, Barnevik co-founded charity [[:en:Hand in Hand International|Hand in Hand]] with Dr Kalpana Sankar in Tamil Nadu, India. The charity, which fights poverty through job and business creation, has since grown to include programs in 10 countries: Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, India, Afghanistan and, more recently, Cambodia and Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HiH Where We Work|url=http://www.hihinternational.org/Where-We-Do-It/Where-We-Do-It.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand in Hand’s mission is to work for economic and social empowerment of the poorest and most marginalized people by supporting the development of businesses and jobs. Since 2003, the Hand in Hand network has helped start and sustain 1.3 million businesses and has generated 1.9 million jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hand in Hand International]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Barnevik lives in London. In an interview he once stated that he took a test which stated he was unsuitable for a managerial position.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/percy-barnevik-jag-var-olamplig-som-chef&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnevik|first1=Percy|title=Percy Barnevik on Leadership|publisher=Sanoma|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piercing the corporate veil''' or '''lifting the corporate veil''' is a legal decision to treat the rights or duties of a [[corporation]] as the rights or liabilities of its [[shareholder]]s. Usually a corporation is treated as a [[Corporate personhood|separate legal person]], which is solely responsible for the debts it incurs and the sole beneficiary of the credit it is owed. [[Common law]] countries usually uphold this principle of separate [[personhood]], but in exceptional situations may "pierce" or "lift" the corporate veil.&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Piercing the Corporate Veil|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/corporate_veil.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example would be where a businessman has left his job as a director and has signed a [[contract]] to not compete with the company he has just left for a period of time. If he sets up a company which competed with his former company, technically it would be the company and not the person competing.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite book|last1=Henn|first1=Harry G.|last2=Alexander|first2=John R.|title=Law of Corporations|date=1983|publisher=West Group|isbn=0314092293|edition=3}}, ch 7, 344, n 2 for a list of terms the court uses. They are, mere adjunct, agent, alias, alter ego, alter idem, arm, blind, branch, buffer, cloak, coat, corporate double, cover, creature, curious reminiscence, delusion, department, dry shell, dummy, fiction, form, formality, fraud on the law, instrumentality, mouthpiece, name, [[nominal identity]], phrase, puppet, screen, sham, simulacrum, snare, stooge, subterfuge, tool.&lt;/ref&gt; But it is likely a court would say that the new company was just a "sham", a "cover" or some other phrase, and would still allow the old company to sue the man for breach of contract.

Despite the terminology used which makes it appear as though a shareholder's [[limited liability]] emanates from the view that a corporation is a separate legal entity, the reality is that the entity status of corporations has almost nothing to do with shareholder limited liability.&lt;ref name="MelvinAron"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Melvin A.|title=Corporations and Other Business Organizations, Cases and Materials|date=2005|publisher=Foundation Press|isbn=1587788799|edition=9}}, ch 4, 171&lt;/ref&gt; For example, English law conferred entity status on corporations long before shareholders were afforded limited liability. Similarly, the [[Revised Uniform Partnership Act]] confers entity status on partnerships, but also provides that partners are individually liable for all partnership obligations.  Therefore, this shareholder limited liability emanates mainly from statute.&lt;ref name="MelvinAron"/&gt;

==Basis for limited liability==
{{See also|Limited liability}}
Corporations exist in part to shield the personal assets of [[shareholders]] from personal liability for the debts or actions of a corporation. Unlike a [[general partnership]] or sole proprietorship in which the owner could be held responsible for all the debts of the company, a corporation traditionally limited the personal liability of the shareholders.

Piercing the corporate veil typically is most effective with smaller privately held business entities (close corporations) in which the corporation has a small number of shareholders, limited assets, and recognition of separateness of the corporation from its shareholders would promote fraud or an inequitable result.

There is no record of a successful piercing of the corporate veil for a publicly traded corporation because of the large number of shareholders and the extensive mandatory filings entailed in  qualifying for listing on an exchange.

==Germany==
{{See also|German company law}}
German corporate law developed a number of theories in the early 1920s for lifting the corporate veil on the basis of "domination" by a parent company over a subsidiary. Today, shareholders can be held liable in the case of an interference destroying the corporation. The corporation is entitled to a minimum of equitable funds. If these are taken away by the shareholder the corporation may claim compensation, even in an insolvency proceeding.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1166&amp;context=tjcil ''Piercing the Corporate Veil in American and German Law - Liability of Individuals and Entities: A Comparative View''] in: Tulsa Journal of Comparative and International Law,  from 3-1-1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{Clist personality}}
{{See also|UK company law|Corporate veil in the United Kingdom}}
The corporate veil in UK company law is pierced very rarely. After a series of attempts by the Court of Appeal during the late 1960s and early 1970s to establish a theory of economic reality, and a doctrine of control for lifting the veil, the House of Lords reasserted an orthodox approach.  According to a 1990 case at the Court of Appeal, ''[[Adams v Cape Industries plc]]'', the only true "veil piercing" may take place when a company is set up for fraudulent purposes, or where it is established to avoid an existing obligation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Gilford Motor Ltd v Horne]]'' and ''[[Jones v Lipman]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The veil is also often ignored in the process of interpreting a statute,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Daimler v Continental Tyre]]'' and ''[[Re FG Films Ltd]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and as a matter of tort law it is open as a matter of authority that a direct duty of care may be owed by the managers of a parent company to accident victims of a subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Lubbe v Cape Plc]]''&lt;/ref&gt; There are also significant statements still among the judiciary in support of a broader veil lifting approach in the interests of "justice".

The issue is discussed at length in a 2013 UK Supreme Court case, ''[[Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd]]''.&lt;ref name="MacLeod"&gt;{{cite journal |last= MacLeod|first= Ceit-Anna |date= January 2014|title= Case Commentary: ''Prest v Petrodel''|url= |journal= Scottish Parliamentary Review|location= Edinburgh|publisher= Blacket Avenue Press|volume= I|issue= 2|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tort victims and employees===
Tort victims and employees, who did not contract with a company or have very [[unequal bargaining power]], have been held to be exempted from the rules of limited liability in ''[[Chandler v Cape plc]]''. In this case, the claimant was an employee of Cape plc's wholly owned subsidiary, which had gone insolvent. He successfully brought a claim in tort against Cape plc for causing him an asbestos disease, [[asbestosis]]. [[Arden LJ]] in the Court of Appeal held that if the parent had interfered in the operations of the subsidiary in any way, such as over trading issues, then it would be attached with responsibility for health and safety issues.&lt;ref&gt;See further, E McGaughey, 'Donoghue v Salomon in the High Court' (2011) 4 Journal of Personal Injury Law 249, on [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2237965 SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; Arden LJ emphasised that piercing the corporate veil was not necessary. There would be direct liability in tort for the parent company if it had interfered in the subsidiary's affairs. The High Court before it had held that liability would exist if the parent exercised control, all applying ordinary principles of tort law about liability of a third party for the actions of a tortfeasor. The restrictions on lifting the veil, found in contractual cases made no difference.

==="Single economic unit" theory===
It is an axiomatic principle of [[English law|English company law]] that a company is an entity separate and distinct from its members, who are liable only to the extent that they have contributed to the company's capital: ''[[Salomon v Salomon]]'' [1897]. The effect of this rule is that the individual subsidiaries within a conglomerate will be treated as separate entities and the parent cannot be made liable for the subsidiaries' debts on insolvency. Furthermore, it can create subsidiaries with inadequate capitalisation and secure loans to the subsidiaries with fixed charges over their assets, despite the fact that this is "not necessarily the most honest way of trading".&lt;ref&gt;see ''[[The Coral Rose (No 1)]]'' [1991], per [[Christopher Staughton|Staughton LJ]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule also applies in Scotland.&lt;ref name="MacLeod"/&gt;

While the secondary literature refers to different means of "lifting" or "piercing" the veil (see Ottolenghi (1959)), judicial dicta supporting the view that the rule in Salomon is subject to exceptions are thin on the ground. [[Lord Denning MR]] outlined the theory of the "single economic unit" - wherein the court examined the overall business operation as an economic unit, rather than strict legal form - in ''[[DHN Food Distributors v Tower Hamlets]]''.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;[1976]&lt;/ref&gt; However this has largely been repudiated and has been treated with caution in subsequent judgments.

In ''[[Woolfson v Strathclyde BC]]'',&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt; the [[House of Lords]] held that it was a decision to be confined to its facts (the question in DHN had been whether the subsidiary of the plaintiff, the former owning the premises on which the parent carried out its business, could receive compensation for loss of business under a [[compulsory purchase order]] notwithstanding that under the rule in Salomon, it was the parent and not the subsidiary that had lost the business). Likewise, in ''[[Bank of Tokyo v Karoon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1987] (PC)&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Goff, who had concurred in the result in ''DHN'', held that the legal conception of the corporate structure was entirely distinct from the economic realities.

The "single economic unit" theory was likewise rejected by the CA in ''[[Adams v Cape Industries]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1990]&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Christopher Slade|Slade LJ]] held that cases where the rule in Salomon had been circumvented were merely instances where they didn't know what to do. The view expressed at first instance by HHJ Southwell QC in ''[[Creasey v Breachwood]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992]&lt;/ref&gt; that English law "definitely" recognised the principle that the corporate veil could be lifted was described as a heresy by Hobhouse LJ in ''[[Ord v Bellhaven]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1998]&lt;/ref&gt; and these doubts were shared by Moritt V-C in ''[[Trustor v Smallbone (No 2)]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[2001]&lt;/ref&gt; the corporate veil cannot be lifted merely because justice requires it. Despite the rejection of the "justice of the case" test, it is observed from judicial reasoning in veil piercing cases that the courts employ "equitable discretion" guided by general principles such as mala fides to test whether the corporate structure has been used as a mere device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Capuano  | first = Angelo  | title = The Realist's Guide to Piercing the Corporate Veil   | ssrn = 1369110  | journal = Australian Journal of Corporate Law  | volume = 23  | pages = 56–94 | year = 2009 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfect obligation===
The cases of ''[[Tan v Lim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1962]&lt;/ref&gt; where a company was used as a [[Facade|"façade"]] (per Russell J.) to [[fraud|defraud]] the creditors of the defendant and ''[[Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1933]&lt;/ref&gt; where an injunction was granted against a trader setting up a business which was merely as a vehicle allowing him to circumvent a covenant in restraint of trade are often said to create a "[[fraud]]" exception to the separate corporate personality. Similarly, in ''[[Gencor v Dalby]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2000]&lt;/ref&gt; the tentative suggestion was made that the corporate veil was being lifted where the company was the "alter ego" of the defendant. In truth, as Lord Cooke (1997) has noted extrajudicially, it is because of the separate identity of the company concerned and not despite it that equity intervened in all of these cases. They are not instances of the corporate veil being pierced but instead involve the application of other rules of law.

===Reverse piercing===
There have been cases in which it is to the advantage of the shareholder to have the corporate structure ignored.  Courts have been reluctant to agree to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Lindgren  | first = Kevin E. |author2=R. B. Vermeesch | title = Business Law of Australia | publisher = Butterworths | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-409-30675-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The often cited case ''[[Macaura v Northern Assurance Co Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1925] AC 619&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of that. Mr Macaura was the sole owner of a company he had set up to grow timber. The trees were destroyed by fire but the insurer refused to pay since the policy was with Macaura (not the company) and he was not the owner of the trees. The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] upheld that refusal based on the separate [[legal personality]] of the company.

===Criminal law===
In English criminal law there have been cases in which the courts have been prepared to pierce the veil of incorporation.  For example, in confiscation proceedings under the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]] monies received by a company can, depending upon the particular facts of the case as found by the court, be regarded as having been 'obtained' by an individual (who is usually, but not always, a director of the company).  In consequence those monies may become an element in the individual's 'benefit' obtained from criminal conduct (and hence subject to confiscation from him).&lt;ref&gt;David Winch, [http://www.accountingevidence.com/blog/2013/01/confiscation-lifting-the-veil-of-incorporation "Confiscation: lifting the veil of incorporation"] (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The position regarding 'piercing the veil' in English criminal law was given in the Court of Appeal judgment in the case of ''[[R v Seager]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2009] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2009/1303.html EWCA Crim 1303]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the court said (at para 76):

{{quote|There was no major disagreement between counsel on the legal principles by reference to which a court is entitled to "pierce" or "rend" or "remove" the "corporate veil". It is "hornbook" law that a duly formed and registered company is a separate legal entity from those who are its shareholders and it has rights and liabilities that are separate from its shareholders. A court can "pierce" the carapace of the corporate entity and look at what lies behind it only in certain circumstances. It cannot do so simply because it considers it might be just to do so. Each of these circumstances involves impropriety and dishonesty. The court will then be entitled to look for the legal substance, not the just the form. In the context of criminal cases the courts have identified at least three situations when the corporate veil can be pierced. First if an offender attempts to shelter behind a corporate façade, or veil to hide his crime and his benefits from it. Secondly, where an offender does acts in the name of a company which (with the necessary [[mens rea]]) constitute a criminal offence which leads to the offender's conviction, then "the veil of incorporation is not so much pierced as rudely torn away": per Lord Bingham in [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/29.html Jennings v CPS], paragraph 16. Thirdly, where the transaction or business structures constitute a "device", "cloak" or "sham", i.e. an attempt to disguise the true nature of the transaction or structure so as to deceive third parties or the courts.}}

In the United States, corporate veil piercing is the most litigated issue in corporate law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Thompson  | first =Robert B.  | title=Piercing the Corporate Veil: An Empirical Study | journal=Cornell Law Review  | volume=76  | pages=1036–1074 | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although courts are reluctant to hold an active shareholder liable for actions that are legally the responsibility of the corporation, even if the corporation has a single shareholder, they will often do so if the corporation was markedly noncompliant with corporate formalities, to prevent fraud, or to achieve equity in certain cases of undercapitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelb|first1=Harvey|title=Piercing the Corporate Veil - The Undercapitalization Factor|journal=Chicago Kent Law Review|date=December 1982|volume=59|issue=1|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2470&amp;context=cklawreview|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macey|first1=Jonathan|last2=Mitts|first2=Joshua|title=Finding Order in the Morass: The Three Real Justifications for Piercing the Corporate Veil|journal=Cornell Law Review|date=2014|volume=100|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/clqv100&amp;div=6&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most jurisdictions, no [[bright-line rule]] exists and the ruling is based on common law precedents. In the United States, different theories, most important "alter ego" or "instrumentality rule", attempted to create a piercing standard. Mostly, they rest upon three basic prongs—namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rands|first1=William J.|title=Domination of a Subsidiary by a Parent|journal=Indiana Law Review|date=1998|volume=32|page=421|url=https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/ilr/pdf/vol32p421.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"unity of interest and ownership": the separate personalities of the shareholder and corporation cease to exist,
*"wrongful conduct": wrongful action taken by the corporation, and
*"proximate cause": as a reasonably foreseeable result of the wrongful action, harm was caused to the party that is seeking to pierce the corporate veil.
However, the theories failed to articulate a real-world approach which courts could directly apply to their cases. Thus, courts struggle with the proof of each prong and rather analyze all given factors. This is known as "totality of circumstances".&lt;ref name="DHB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barber|first1=David H.|title=Piercing the Corporate Veil|journal=Williamette Law Review|volume=17|page=371|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/willr17&amp;div=35&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the matter of what [[jurisdiction]] the corporation is incorporated in if the corporation is authorized to do business in more than one state. All corporations have one specific state (their "home" state) to which they are incorporated as a [[domestic corporation|"domestic" corporation]], and if they operate in other states, they would apply for authority to do business in those other states as a [[foreign corporation|"foreign" corporation]].  In determining whether or not the corporate veil may be pierced, the courts are required to use the laws of the corporation's home state.  This issue can be significant; for example, [[California]] law is more liberal in allowing a corporate veil to be pierced, while the laws of neighboring [[Nevada]] makes doing so more difficult. Thus, the owner(s) of a corporation operating in California would be subject to different potential for the corporation's veil to be pierced if the corporation was to be sued, depending on whether the corporation was a California domestic corporation or was a Nevada foreign corporation operating in California.

Generally, the plaintiff has to prove that the incorporation was merely a formality and that the corporation neglected corporate formalities and protocols, such as voting to approve major [[corporate action]]s in the context of a duly authorized corporate meeting. This is quite often the case when a corporation facing legal liability transfers its assets and business to another corporation with the same management and shareholders. It also happens with single person corporations that are managed in a haphazard manner. As such, the veil can be pierced in both civil cases and where regulatory proceedings are taken against a shell corporation.

===Factors for courts to consider===
Factors that a court may consider when determining whether or not to pierce the corporate veil include the following:&lt;ref name="DHB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="al"/&gt;

*Absence or inaccuracy of corporate records;
*Concealment or misrepresentation of members;
*Failure to maintain arm's length relationships with related entities;
*Failure to observe corporate formalities in terms of behavior and documentation;
*Intermingling of [[assets]] of the corporation and of the shareholder;
*Manipulation of assets or liabilities to concentrate the assets or liabilities;
*Non-functioning corporate officers and/or directors;
*Significant undercapitalization of the business entity (capitalization requirements vary based on industry, location, and specific company circumstances);
*Siphoning of corporate funds by the dominant shareholder(s);
*Treatment by an individual of the assets of corporation as his/her own;
*Was the corporation being used as a "façade" for dominant shareholder(s) personal dealings; alter ego theory;

It is important to note that not all of these factors need to be met in order for the court to pierce the corporate veil. Further, some courts might find that one factor is so compelling in a particular case that it will find the shareholders personally liable. For example, many large corporations do not pay dividends, without any suggestion of corporate impropriety, but particularly for a small or close corporation the failure to pay dividends may suggest financial impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macey|first1=Jonathan R.|title=The Three Justifications for Piercing the Corporate Veil|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/03/27/the-three-justifications-for-piercing-the-corporate-veil/|website=Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====

Here a corporation was undercapitalized and was only used to shield a shareholder's other company from debts.

===Internal Revenue Service===
{{See also|United States Internal Revenue Service}}
In recent years, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) in the United States has made use of corporate veil piercing arguments and logic as a means of recapturing [[Income tax in the United States|income]], [[Estate tax (United States)|estate]], or [[gift tax]] revenue, particularly from business entities created primarily for [[estate planning]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice CC-2012-002|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-ccdm/cc-2012-002.pdf|website=Office of Chief Counsel|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[U.S. Tax Court]] cases involving [[Family Limited Partnership]]s (FLPs) illustrate the IRS's use of veil-piercing arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gans|first1=Mitchell M.|last2=Blattmachr|first2=Jonathan G.|title=Family Limited Partnership Formation: Dueling Dicta|journal=Capital University Law Review|date=2006|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/capulr35&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since owners of U.S. business entities created for asset protection and estate purposes often fail to maintain proper corporate compliance, the IRS has achieved multiple high-profile court victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higham|first1=Scott|title=For U.S. tax cheats, Panama Papers reveal a perilous new world|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/for-us-tax-cheats-panama-papers-reveals-a-perilous-new-world/2016/04/08/a3467e9a-fd9f-11e5-886f-a037dba38301_story.html|accessdate=9 September 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blank|first1=Joshua D.|last2=Staudt|first2=Nancy C.|title=Corporate Shams|url=http://gould.usc.edu/centers/class/class-workshops/cleo-working-papers/documents/C12_8_paper.pdf|website=NYU Center for Law, Economics and Organization|publisher=New York University School of Law|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reverse piercing ===
Reverse veil piercing is when the debt of a shareholder is imputed onto the corporation. Throughout the United States, the general rule is that reverse veil piercing is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaertner|first1=M.J.|title=Reverse Piercing the Corporate Veil: Should Corporation Owners Have It Both Ways|journal=William and Mary Law Review|date=1988|volume=30|page=667|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wmlr30&amp;div=37&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the California Court of Appeals has allowed reverse veil piercing against a [[limited liability company]] (LLC) based largely on the difference in remedies available to creditors when it comes to attaching assets of a debtors' LLC as compared to attaching assets of a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curci Investments, LLC v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7304">'''Product data management''' ('''PDM''') or [[Product information management|Product information management (PIM)]] is the business function often within [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) that is responsible for the management and publication of [[Product (business)|product]] data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npd-solutions.com/pdm.html Product Data Management/Product information management], Kenneth Crow&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivica Crnkovic, Ulf Asklund, Annita Persson Dahlqvist "Implementing and Integrating Product Data Management and Software Configuration Management" {{ISBN|978-1580534987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In software engineering, this is known as [[version control]]. The goals of product data management include ensuring all stakeholders share a common understanding, that confusion during the execution of the processes is minimized, and that the highest standards of quality controls are maintained.

== Introduction ==
Product data management is the use of software or other tools to track and control data related to a particular product. The data tracked usually involves the technical specifications of the product, specifications for manufacture and development, and the types of materials that will be required to produce goods. The use of product data management allows a company to track the various costs associated with the creation and launch of a product. Product data management is part of product lifecycle management and [[configuration management]], and is primarily used by engineers.

Within PDM the focus is on managing and tracking the creation, change and archive of all information related to a product. The information being stored and managed (on one or more file servers) will include engineering data such as [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) models, drawings and their associated documents.

Product data management (PDM) serves as a central knowledge repository for process and product history, and promotes integration and data exchange among all business users who interact with products — including project managers, engineers, sales people, buyers, and quality assurance teams.

The central database will also manage [[metadata]] such as owner of a file and release status of the components. The package will: control check-in and check-out of the product data to multi-user; carry out [[Change management (engineering)|engineering change management]] and release control on all versions/issues of components in a product; build and manipulate the product structure [[bill of materials]] (BOM) for assemblies; and assist in configurations management of product variants.

This enables automatic reports on product costs, etc. Furthermore, PDM enables companies producing complex products to spread product data into the entire [[product lifecycle management|PLM]] launch-process. This significantly enhances the effectiveness of the launch process.

Product data management is focused on capturing and maintaining information on products and/or services through its development and useful life.  Typical information managed in the PDM module include
*Brand name
*Part number
*Part description
*Supplier/vendor
*Vendor part number and description
*Unit of measure
*Cost/price
*Schematic or CAD drawing
*Material data-sheets

==Advantages==

* Track and manage all changes to product related data
* Spend less time organizing and tracking design data
* Improve productivity through reuse of product design data
* Enhance collaboration
* Helps using visual management

== Industrial Applications ==
Product Data Management is closely related and often used interchangeably with Product Information Management (PIM).  PDM software applications are commonly used by companies involved with manufacturing and retailing. Examples of PDM software vendors include CMPRO,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psasys.com/cmpro/|title=CMPRO - PSA, Inc.|work=PSA, Inc.|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOLIDWORKS,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solidworks.com/sw/products/product-data-management/packages.htm|title=Packages|website=www.solidworks.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zentail&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zentail.com|title=Sell on Jet.com, Walmart, Amazon, eBay, Google Shopping {{!}} Zentail|website=www.zentail.com|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bintime/Gepard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bintime.com|title=BINTIME provides a e-commerce development team, dedicated to your business goals|website=bintime.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from those providers, in the market exist other kind of vendors that offer [https://saleslayer.com/product-data-management-pdm PDM systems] with extra functionalities such as Sales Layer.

== History ==

PDM stems from traditional engineering design activities that created product drawings and schematics on paper and using CAD tools to create parts lists (Bills of Material structures – BOM).  The PDM and BOM data is used in enterprise resource planning ([[enterprise resource planning|ERP]]) systems to plan and coordinate all transactional operations of a company (sales order management, purchasing, cost accounting, logistics, etc.)

PDM is a subset of a larger concept of product lifecycle management ([[product lifecycle management|PLM]]).  PLM encompasses the processes needed to launch new products ([[New product introduction|NPI]]), manage changes to existing products ([[engineering change notice|ECN]]/[[Engineering change order|ECO]]) and retire products at the end of their life ([[End-of-life (product)|EoL]]).

A '''small cap company''' is a company whose [[market capitalization]] ([[share (finance)|share]]s x value of each share) is small, under $1 billion.

==Overview==

A small cap company typically has under $1 billion under control and are hence considered small companies. Small companies generally are not able to secure the best ([[prime rate|prime]]) borrowing rates and wield reduced power, including a smaller [[market share]]. Being small, they are also less financially stable than larger companies, and are more likely to become [[bankrupt]]. However, they do generally have more [[growth potential]] and over time have greater but more volatile expected returns.

Northampton (Sywell) Aerodrome has a [[United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority|CAA]] Ordinary Licence (Number P496) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Sywell Aerodrome Limited).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/375/srg_asd_ordinarylicences.pdf | format= PDF | publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|CAA]] SRG | title=  Aerodrome Ordinary Licences | accessdate= 23 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628053955/http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/375/srg_asd_ordinarylicences.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A viewing area is provided for [[Aircraft spotting|aircraft spotters]].

==Second World War==
The aerodrome opened in 1928 and during the [[Second World War]] the aerodrome as RAF Sywell, was used as a training facility ([[de Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]]s) and later an important centre for the repair of [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington bombers]] and extensive sheds from this time still remain on the site. Among World War II pilots who underwent training at Sywell were [[Pierre Clostermann]]&lt;ref&gt;Clostermann, Pierre. The Big Show. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004. {{ISBN|0-297-84619-1}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paddy Finucane]], who soloed here.

Many aerial shots for the film [[Battle of Britain (film)|''Battle of Britain'']] were taken over the airport and nearby area.

==Expansion==
Since 1999, the aerodrome sought planning permission for a hard runway, which was intended to allow operations to continue over the winter, when the grass runways often become waterlogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Plans to improve aerodrome site | work = [[BBC News]] |date = 26 April 2006 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4937822.stm |accessdate = 24 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisations STARE (Stop The Aerodrome Runway Expansion) and CPRE ([[Campaign to Protect Rural England]]) campaigned against this change, arguing that it would lead to more and larger aircraft flying over the area and disturb its "rural tranquility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = £1m to sort out runway debate |work = Evening Telegraph |date = 14 August 2006 |url = http://www.ketteringtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=661&amp;ArticleID=1695015 |accessdate = 24 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Permission was granted for the runway on 22 November 2007 by the [[Department for Transport]], and though campaigners vowed to fight the decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Campaigners-fight-on-despite-Sywell39s.3513780.jp | date= 22 November 2007 | work= Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo | title= Campaigners fight on despite Sywell's runway approval | accessdate= 22 November 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071125071429/http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Campaigners-fight-on-despite-Sywell39s.3513780.jp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were unsuccessful and construction of the runway began in 2008. It opened during summer 2009 and enabled safe operations during the winter of 2009/2010 and onwards. In February 2010, the final inspection of the newly completed all-weather hard runway was carried out by the CAA who confirmed that it could be licensed for use.
 
== Operations ==
Sywell has three all-grass operational runways and a fourth all-weather concrete runway. The aerodrome's operational hours are 0900-1700 during winter and 0800-1700 during summer. The aerodrome offers an [[Flight Information Service|Aerodrome Flight Information Service]] to pilots.

===Sywell Aviation Museum===
The aerodrome also houses the [[Sywell Aviation Museum]] dedicated to telling the wartime history of the site and the airmen that used it.

===Brooklands Flying Club===
Brooklands Flying Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklandsflyingclub.co.uk|title=HOME|website=HOME}}&lt;/ref&gt; was based at Sywell, with a fleet of four [[Aero AT-3]] aircraft and a [[Cessna 172]]. The club offered training for a [[Private Pilot's Licence]] (PPL), night rating and IMC rating.

The club opened in 2005 under the same name of the previous company that had been located on the airfield.
The flying school closed down at the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club has since reopened as 2Excel Training, operated in partnership with [[2Excel Aviation]], owners of [[The Blades (aerobatic team)|The Blades]] aerobatics team, who are also based at the airfield.

===Training===
Other flight training organisations on the airfield include:
*Sloane Helicopters
*Flylight Airsports

===The Blades===
[[The Blades (aerobatic team)|The Blades]] aerobatic display team are based at Sywell, where their five [[Extra EA-300]] aircraft are hangared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblades.com/Blades-corporate-homepage/Blades-corporate-site/Contact.aspx|title={title}|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204154/http://www.theblades.com/Blades-corporate-homepage/Blades-corporate-site/Contact.aspx|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They perform aerobatic displays at major events around the country, in Europe, and in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{url=http://www.theblades.com/Blades-public-homepage/Blades-public-site/About/The-Display.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is the only one fully licensed by the CAA to carry paying 'passengers' in aerobatic displays, out of Sywell, or at many other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblades.com/Blades-public-homepage/Blades-public-site/Fly-with-The-Blades.aspx|title={title}|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707002828/http://www.theblades.com/Blades-public-homepage/Blades-public-site/Fly-with-The-Blades.aspx|archive-date=7 July 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sywell Airshow===
The aerodrome now hosts a bi-annual charity airshow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sywellairshow.co.uk|title=Sywell Airshow|first=Handmade by Machine|last=Ltd|website=www.sywellairshow.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; in aid of the local [[Air Ambulance]] where there are many classic aircraft flying and on display such as the [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]], Mustang, [[T-6 Texan|North American Harvards]].

===Light Aircraft Association Rally===
The [[Light Aircraft Association]] (LAA - formerly the Popular Flying Association), is the UK's body for amateur aircraft construction, and recreational and sport flying. It used to hold its annual rally at [[Cranfield Airport]], and then at [[Kemble Airport]]. In 2006, the LAA lost so much money through poor attendances resulting from poor weather that in 2007 and 2008, much smaller (and cheaper)  "regional rallies" were held. These were unpopular and in September 2009 a revived (if cut-down) LAA Rally was held at Sywell. This proved successful, and as further well-attended rallies took place at Sywell since&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aviatoruk.ga/sywell-aerodrome/|title=Sywell Aerodrome EGBK/ORM - AviatorUK|publisher=|date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the long-term future of the LAA Rally seems secure.

===Music in Flight===
[[Music in Flight]] is an airshow held at Sywell, in which an orchestra plays [[classical music]] to accompany flying aircraft, [[hot air balloon]]s, the [[Red Devils (Parachute Regiment)|Red Devils]] parachute display team and a fireworks display.

==Business park==
An industrial area in the complex accommodates firms, agencies and other commercial businesses.

{{Governance}}

'''Technology governance''' means the [[governance]], i.e., the [[steering]] between the different sectors&amp;mdash;state, business, and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s&amp;mdash;of the development of [[technology]]. The concept is based on the notion of [[innovation]] and of techno-economic paradigm shifts according to the theories of [[Joseph Alois Schumpeter|Joseph A. Schumpeter]], [[Christopher Freeman]], [[Carlota Perez]], etc.  

The idea is that certain periods in [[economic development]] are dominated by a paradigm-leading technology that influences through [[finance]] mechanisms, organizational change, greater returns, etc. Also, the economic and social sphere to such an extent that an entire [[paradigm]] is coined by them. Currently, that paradigm-leading technology is [[information and communications technology]] (ICT). According to Innovation Theory (and empirical findings as well), states, regions, or other communities do not automatically promote, or even go into, these key technologies, but rather need to be guided there by active [[wikt:intervene|intervention]], by the State sector (in close cooperation and coordination). Technology governance, (as a field of scholarly inquiry and academic instruction) is therefore about how this is theoretically and practically done, which [[institutions]] are optimal for such a venue, how the [[education]] of [[Academic administration|administrator]]s have to look like if they are going to have the administrative capacity to deal with such matters, etc.

Technology governance is a [[public policy]] concept; it is not to be confused with inner-corporate arrangements of organisation ([[corporate governance]]) and IT arrangements, sometimes called "Information Technology Governance".

[[File:Tomás Terry.jpg|thumbnail|Marble statue of Tomás Terry in the lobby of the Terry theatre, [[Cienfuegos]], [[Cuba]]; sculptor [[Tommaso Solari]]]]

'''Tomás Terry y Adán''' (24 February 1808 in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] – 5 July 1886 in [[Paris]], [[France]])&lt;ref name="thomas140"&gt;Thomas, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Cuba]]n [[business magnate]].

==Family origins==
Of [[Irish people|Irish]] paternal descent, Terry was born in Caracas to [[Spain|Spanish]]-born José Antonio Terry y Mendoza, who had settled in Venezuela from [[Cádiz]], and wife Tomasa Adán y España. Following the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], the Terrys had fled their hometown of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] for [[Catholic]] countries such as Spain, [[France]] and the states of the [[Italian peninsula]]. The Spanish branch, established in Cádiz and [[El Puerto de Santa María]], became involved in trade with the [[Spanish West Indies|Indies]] and [[Sherry]] production quite successfully, as in less than a decade from their arrival many of its members were knighted in the [[Order of Santiago]] and Guillermo Terry was granted the title of Marquis of la Cañada by King [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], on 8 September 1729.

==Life==
[[File:Père-Lachaise - Division 92 - Terry y Dorticos 08.jpg|thumb|[[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]].]]
Terry initially became involved in the [[slave trade]] in Cuba, making his first $10,000 by buying sick slaves, nursing them back to health, and then reselling them healthy for a large profit.&lt;ref name="thomas137"&gt;Thomas, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; He bought the ''Caracas'' [[sugar mill]] for $23,000, and upgraded it to be the first in Cuba to use [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="thomas137" /&gt; He went on to make a fortune through involvement in all aspects of the economy, from the sugar trade and slave trade to banking and imports, becoming the dominant businessman in [[Cienfuegos]] and earning the nickname the "Cuban [[Croesus]]".&lt;ref name="thomas140" /&gt; His fortune grew to be among the largest in the world, with a net worth of about $725,000 in 1851, $3,090,00 in 1860, $7,890,000 in 1870, $13,760,000 in 1880, and over $25,000,000 at his death in 1886, which occurred in Paris, where he was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] (division 92).&lt;ref name="thomas140" /&gt;

==Descendants==

The tentative proposal of the university was approved in the ECNEC meeting held on May 2011, allocation of Rs. 1518.751 million allocated by the HEC as per PC-1.

It was initially run under UoB administration for almost four years.

Later on, it was declared a full-fledged university with the promulgation of the University of Loralai Act No.VI of 2012, passed by the Baluchistan Provincial Assembly on 24 September 2012 and assented to by Governor, Baluchistan on 27 September 2012.

Prof. Dr. Abdullah Khan Kakar was appointed as first Vice Chancellor of the University, on 19 December 2014 and Noor-ul-Amin kakar was appointed 1st Registrar on 25 December 2014.

The new logo for the University of Loralrai was designed by Engr. Abdullah Naseer &amp; Amir Zaman with the approval of Honorable Vice Chancellor  Prof. Engr. Dr. Maqsood Ahmad. The logo was approved on 10-October-2018 in presence of review committee.

A '''vacuum fryer''' is a [[deep-frying]] device housed inside a [[vacuum]] chamber.

Vacuum fryers are fit to process low-quality [[potato]]es that contain higher sugar levels than normal, as they frequently have to be processed in spring and early summer before the potatoes from the new [[harvest]] become available. With vacuum frying it is easier to maintain natural colors and flavours of the finished product. Due to the lower [[temperature]]s applied (approx. {{convert|130|°C|°F}}), the formation of suspected [[carcinogen]] [[acrylamide]] is significantly lower than in standard atmospheric fryers, where the frying temperature is approx. {{convert|170|°C|°F}}. The [[fat]] absorption of the products is also reported to be lower than in atmospheric fryers. In South East Asia (mainly [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Indonesia]]) batch type vacuum fryers are mainly used for the production of fruit chips. However, these machines are only appropriate for relatively small production companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granda|first=C.|last2=Moreira|first2=R.g.|last3=Tichy|first3=S.e.|date=2004-10-01|title=Reduction of Acrylamide Formation in Potato Chips by Low-temperature Vacuum Frying|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2004.tb09903.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Food Science|language=en|volume=69|issue=8|pages=E405–E411|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2004.tb09903.x|issn=1750-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous vacuum fryers==
For larger production quantities, continuous vacuum fryers are available. In these installations, the [[vacuum]] [[frying pan]] is installed in a [[stainless steel]] vacuum tube. The infeed of the raw product is carried out through a rotary [[airlock]].
Depending on the application, the frying pan itself is designed to meet the different product specifications. A transport belt takes the finished product out of the fryer and towards the outfeed system. A lock chamber at the exit of the vacuum tube prevents air from entering the vacuum zone, and a belt system takes the product from one zone to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ift.confex.com/ift/2002/techprogram/paper_10613.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311024700/http://ift.confex.com/ift/2002/techprogram/paper_10613.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-11|title=91C-19 Vacuum frying of potato chips|date=2012-03-11|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airfryervergelijken.nl/|title=Airfryer, gezonder frituren - alle informatie op airfryervergelijken.nl|website=Airfryervergelijken.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vacuum is created by [[vacuum pump]]s, and the whole system is controlled by a [[programmable logic controller]].

In batch fryers, the frying oil has to be replaced quite often as it is sensitive to temperature changes. Continuous vacuum fryers lead to a longer lifetime of the frying oil and therefore lower the production costs. Vacuum fryers can also reduce oil content in fried foods. The amount of reduced oil content, usually 1–3%, depends on the type of vacuum fryer.&lt;ref&gt; Journal of Food Engineering
