'''Andrey Melnichenko''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Игоревич Мельниченко}}, {{lang-be|Андрэй Мельнічэнка}}, born 8 March 1972 in [[Gomel]], [[Belarus]]) is a self-made [[Russia]]n industrialist and philanthropist&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;.
 
He is the main beneficiary of fertilizer producer [[EuroChem|EuroChem Group]], coal producer [[Siberian Coal Energy Company|SUEK]], and power generator SGC&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aimfoundation.info/page0001#amen|title=About the Foundation: Andrey Melnichenko|last=|first=|date=|website=aimfoundation.info|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He is the Chairman of the Strategy Committees (Non-Executive Director) in all three companies. With an estimated personal wealth of $15.5 billion, in 2018 he ranked 88th in the [[Forbes]] World's billionaires list (7th in Russia).&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/andrey-melnichenko/ Biography Andrey Melnichenko], ''Forbes'', February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bloomberg, as of September 2018, Melnichenko's net worth is estimated at $15.9 billion (67th in the world, 5th in Russia).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/andrey-melnichenko/|title=Andrey Melnichenko|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Too young to gain from the 1990s privatizations that made many oligarch's fortunes, he began trading currency with two friends while a physics student at Moscow State University, taking advantage of the unique opportunities that opened up in a newly capitalist Russia&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. After the Soviet Union fell, the trio registered a bank, before Melnichenko began buying assets including in thermal coal and fertilizers. Branching out at the turn of the millennium, he took an interest in the commodities markets with the acquisition of plants and mines, many of which were distressed, transforming them into modern enterprises. He sold his banking interests in 2007, just before the global financial crisis, allowing him to focus on those industrial investments. Melnichenko turned EuroChem into Russia's largest manufacturer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and one of largest fertilizers exporters globally, and SUEK into one of the world's largest coal companies that produces higher-quality thermal coal&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. 

Melnichenko is one of the main social investors and philanthropists in Russia&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.donorsforum.ru/projects/lkb/proekt-2016/pobediteli-renkinga-2016/|title=Winners 2016 / Leaders of Corporate Philanthropy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Apart from his companies' own charitable and social investment programs, the [[Andrey Melnichenko Foundation]] runs projects in science and education, supporting gifted children from the regions where his companies operate aiming to create social mobility in Russia&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Melnichenko's companies reportedly spent over $400 million on social and charitable projects in Russia in the last decade&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;.

==Early life and education==
Andrey Melnichenko was born on March 8, 1972 in Gomel, Belarus. His parents were teachers. As a gifted student, he attended the Advanced Education and Science Centre of the [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov Moscow State University]], and in 1989, became a student of the Faculty of Physics at [[Moscow State University]]. He then transferred to the [[Plekhanov Russian University of Economics]], from which he graduated in Finance&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrey Melnichenko Didn't Miss His Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/08/26/andrey-melnichenko-from-college-dropout-to-one-of.aspx|website=The Motley Fool|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Career history ==

=== Banking and investments ===
While at university, Melnichenko began his entrepreneurial ventures opening a currency exchange booth on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/andrey-melnichenko/|title=The World's Billionaires: Andrey Melnichenko|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having made their first US$50,000 through a chain of the currency exchange booths, Melnichenko and his partners, two like-minded fellow students, received a banking licence from the Bank of Russia. In 1993, at the age of 21, Melnichenko co-founded the [[MDM Bank]] which grew to become one of Russia's largest private banks within ten years. The bank moved onto buying currency at the interbank foreign exchange, developing a derivatives market and debt instruments&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. From 1993 to 1997, Melnichenko chaired the Board of Directors of MDM Bank&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=22864661&amp;privcapId=231846677&amp;previousCapId=231846677&amp;previousTitle=SUEK%20LTD.|title=Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, MDM Bank expanded through acquisition, integrating seven regional banks. MDM Bank did not participate in any post-Soviet privatization programs or the loans-for-shares auctions of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/young-russian-billionaire-seeks-plain-sailing-in-commodity-waves|title=A Young Russian Billionaire Plants the Seeds of Future Success|date=2016-09-29|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Euro am Sonntag, 26th April 2008" /&gt; In 1997, Melnichenko bought out MDM Bank shares from his partners and became the sole shareholder of the Bank and the Chairman of the Management Board. It gradually became one of Russia's largest private banks, based on total assets, and the first in book running of Russian corporate Eurobonds&lt;ref name="Euro am Sonntag, 26th April 2008"&gt;Euro am Sonntag, 26 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;. From 2001 to 2005, he chaired MDM Bank's Board of Directors&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. MDM Bank was named the "Bank of the Year" by [[The Banker]] in 2002 and 2003. In 2003, [[Euromoney]] and, in 2004, [[Global Finance (magazine)|Global Finance]], named it the “Best Russian Bank”&lt;ref name="Euro am Sonntag, 26th April 2008" /&gt;.

In 2000, Melnichenko, together with [[Sergei Viktorovich Popov|Sergei Popov]], a former metals trader from Ural, co-founded the MDM Group for industrial investments into three areas: pipeline manufacturing, coal production and processing, production and processing of fertilizers&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;. It was done through the acquisition of more than 50 independently-run and -owned businesses: joint-stock companies, plants and mines, which enabled to form three separate companies: [[Siberian Coal Energy Company|SUEK]], [[EuroChem]] and TMK (which he exited in 2006 through an IPO at the London Stock Exchange)&lt;ref&gt;TMK-Group {{cite web|url=http://www.tmk-group.com/invest_faq.php#_-On_which_stock|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224032618/http://tmk-group.com/invest_faq.php|archivedate=24 February 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2009-03-26|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These industries were derelict and risky and not subject to the political influence that dominated other sectors&lt;ref name="Euro am Sonntag, 26th April 2008" /&gt;. With the process of post-Soviet era privatizations having finished five years earlier, no more than 5% of the assets purchased were acquired from the state&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. From 2001 to 2004, Melnichenko was the President of the MDM Group&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. 

From 2004 to 2007, Melnichenko sold shares of MDM Bank to his MDM Group partner [[Sergei Viktorovich Popov|Sergei Popov]], and focused on the development of the industrial assets in fertilizers and coal.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea-coal.org.uk/site/2010/news-section/news-items/russia-interview-with-suek-owner-mr-andrey-melnichenko?|title=Russia: Interview with SUEK owner, Mr. Andrey Melnichenko|website=IEA News Centre|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512181519/http://www.iea-coal.org.uk/site/2010/news-section/news-items/russia-interview-with-suek-owner-mr-andrey-melnichenko|archivedate=12 May 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Global Finance named it the “Best Russian Bank” in four categories: corporate management, FOREX, the best organizer of Eurobond loans in the Russian market, and the best consultant in the Russian M&amp;A market. Following Melnichenko's decision to step down from MDM Bank in 2007, the International Financial Corporation (IFC) purchased 5% of MDM Bank shares for US$185 million, valuing the bank at US$3.7 billion&lt;ref name="Euro am Sonntag, 26th April 2008" /&gt;. Having served its consolidating purpose, MDM Group ceased to exist.

Andrey Melnichenko became the Chairman of the Board of Directors mineral and chemical company OJSC [[EuroChem]] in April 2004&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. In 2007, he became EuroChem's majority shareholder&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.  

When EuroChem was founded, the purchased assets included several nitrogen plants and a phosphate mine with Soviet-era equipment. Melnichenko built EuroChem to become one of the world's largest high-tech fertilizer manufacturers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/eurochem-in-the-news/|title=SNL Financial - Eurochem's expansion into mining could double company size, boost it to top 5 potash player|last=Ben|first=Seeder|date=|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

One of EuroChem's key enterprises, Novomoskovsky Azot, became the largest urea plant in Europe, where production of granulated urea began for the first time in Russia. New modern manufacturing facilities were built in Nevinnomyssk (including the first melamine production plant in Russia) and Kovdor (including an apatite and shtaffelite ores processing complex). Modern terminal was launched in Sillamae (Estonia), and Murmansk port was rebuilt. It acquired laboratories in Germany in 2011, which led to creation of similar facilities in Russia, Ukraine, and other countries, which are working on the development of second-generation fertilizers, including advanced slow-release products that help reduce the environmental footprint of the agricultural sector&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/who-we-are/history/|title=History – EuroChem|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

EuroChem bought licenses for potash deposits in Volgograd (2005) and Perm (2008), launching plans to develop two large potash industrial plants&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. 

In 2015, EuroChem moved its headquarters to Switzerland for access to the capital markets and international operations. It has manufacturing, logistic and distributing facilities in Russia, Belgium, Lithuania, Estonia, China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the USA&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. EuroChem products are sold in more than 100 countries. EuroChem Group has raised funds on the international capital markets. In 2016, EuroChem invested in biological crop nutrition company Agrinos to invest in research and development for a new generation of products. Elsewhere, EuroChem expanded its distribution network, buying operations in the US, Argentina, Brazil and Hungary. It is developing second-generation fertilizers, including advanced slow-release products that help reduce the environmental footprint of the agricultural sector. One EuroChem fertilizer, Entec 26, became the only such product to be recognized by a carbon exchange foundation in Switzerland, marking the first time that the contribution of advanced fertilizers to reducing agricultural emissions was acknowledged.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/press-releases/agrinos-and-eurochem-sign-equity-investment-and-two-collaboration-agreements/|title=Agrinos and EuroChem sign equity investment and two collaboration agreements – EuroChem|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/our-world/|title=Global Fertilizer Day – EuroChem|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

EuroChem is Russia's largest manufacturer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and one of largest fertilizers exporters globally&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. It produces higher-value specialty fertilizers including inhibitor products that allow slow release of nutrients into crops, and is launching two Russian potash mines planning to produce 8 million metric tons of the fertilizer a year, a 10th of current world output, as well as eyeing an ammonia and urea plant in Louisiana. According to Melnichenko, EuroChem aims to transform itself "into a company that creates and promotes high-tech products"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/at-a-glance-2/|title=At a glance – EuroChem|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/press-releases/eurochem-announces-fertiliser-project-in-louisiana/|title=EuroChem announces fertiliser project in Louisiana – EuroChem|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Since April 2015, Andrey Melnichenko is the Chairman of the Strategy Committee (Non-Executive Director) of EuroChem Group AG&lt;ref name="EuroChem Board &amp; Management"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/board-managment/|title=EuroChem Board &amp; Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2018, Melnichenko controls 90 percent of EuroChem&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

=== SUEK ===
Andrey Melnichenko became Member of the Board of Directors of [[Siberian Coal Energy Company|SUEK]] JSC (Siberian Coal Energy Company) in February 2005, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors in June 2011&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. The same year, he created the Siberian Generating Company (SGC) on the basis of electricity assets of SUEK and became the Chairman of its Board of Directors. In 2013, he became the primary shareholder of SUEK and SGC after he has bought his ex-partner's shares&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.  

The assets that formed SUEK were distressed – production capacity was less than 30 million tons per year, the enterprises employed 70,000 miners yet productivity was low, and virtually none of its output was exported. The average equipment depreciation was 90%. During the early years of the business, SUEK's assets were modernized, debts were repaid, wages and taxes were paid, and a modernization program was launched with new machinery. The old mines and worn-out equipment were transformed into modern enterprises. Several enrichment factories and modules were put into operation with the latest processing technologies that allowed SUEK to produce highly enriched coal with low impurity levels. SUEK built modern coal bulk terminals and upgraded seaports, and built Russia's first coal mine methane processing station to generate power within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. Russia's first smart mining management control center was built to run all SUEK's operations, monitoring the location and well-being of miners working underground&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suek.com/about-us/history/|title=SUEK - History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.suek.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

After the consolidation of electric power assets, Melnichenko created the Siberian Generating Company (SGC) as a part of SUEK, and then spun it out as a separate company. SGC provides between 35% and 78% of electrical power in the Russian regions of its operation. It is the fourth largest heat producer in the world&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Melnichenko led SUEK to become Russia's largest coal producer with operations in seven Russian regions, as well as the world's third largest coal exporter by reserves and sales with distribution in 38 countries worldwide, including the Asia Pacific where coal plays a key role in energy access. SUEK assets produce more than 100 million tons of coal annually, with assured coal reserves of 5.4 billion tons. SUEK is Russia's largest coal producer and a global leader in exporting higher-quality thermal coal. As reported in Financial Times in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency's Clean Coal Centre, "SUEK, Russia's main exporter of higher-quality thermal coal, has invested in modern high-capacity washing plants and has ash control technologies at all its coal ports".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/79394d9e-d07a-11e7-9dbb-291a884dd8c6|title=Clean coal is part of the answer to the Paris Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bloomberg, SUEK is Russia's largest producer of higher quality thermal coal which, according to Melnichenko, focusses on “high-quality and less-emitting coal”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suek.com/media/Melnichenko-in-media/suek-owner-says-fossil-fuels-won-t-be-replaced-by-alternatives/|title=Bloomberg: SUEK owner says fossil fuels won’t be replaced by alternatives|last=|first=|date=|website=www.suek.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Andrey Melnichenko is the main beneficiary of SUEK and SGC. As of 2018, he owns 92.2 percent stake in SUEK and 92.2 percent of SGC&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. 

He is the Chairman of the Strategy Committee (Non-Executive Director) in SUEK OJSC since April 2015, and in Siberian Generating Company LLC - since September 2016&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

The '''Administration of the Autonomous Communities''', also known as '''Autonomous Administration''', is a [[Public Administration of Spain]]. It belongs to the second level of the Public Administrations, because it exerts its powers within the limits of each [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Community]].

It is integrated by:

* Central Organization (Government of the Autonomous Community or Council of Government, the President of the Autonomous Communities, the Vicepresident and the Councilors).
* Peripheral Administration (Territorial Delegations of the Autonomous Communities, Sectoral Delegations of the Government Departments).

The Autonomic Administration has a very broad level of competence, based on the [[decentralization |decentralization]] of the State or through the State of Autonomies. As for the level of competences, they are not always the same, and are regulated in each [[Statute of Autonomy]] for each [[Autonomous Community]], making in some cases the level of competences is higher than those of a [[Federal state]].

It should also be taken into account that the Autonomous Community has its own [[legislative body]], and that the autonomous administration must behave before it like any other [[executive power]], respecting the rules issued by its autonomous parliament.

In the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] it is regulated in Chapter Three, entitled "of the Autonomous Communities". This Chapter regulates the form of creation and authorization of the Autonomous Communities, the elaboration of its Statutes, the powers transferred to the Autonomous Communities, the powers of the State, its resources and its financing.

==Structure==
Like the [[General State Administration]], the Autonomous Administration is regulated by Law 40/2015 and the structure is practically the same.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10566 Ley 40/2015, de 1 de octubre, de Régimen Jurídico del Sector Público.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can vary from one Autonomous Community to another depending on the provisions in the Statute of Autonomy. Here the common organs are exposed:

===Central Organization===
====Government====
The Autonomous Government is the executive power of the [[Autonomous community of Spain|Autonomous Community]]. As in the [[Government of Spain|Central Government]] it responds before its [[parliament]] (autonomic parliament). The Government directs the Autonomous Administration within its competences. 

Contrary to what happens with the Central Government, the decisions taken by the Executive are not sanctioned by the [[King of spain|King]], and it is the President of the Autonomous Community who signs the laws and decisions on his behalf.

====President====
The President of the Autonomous Community is the head of the executive power as well as the highest authority of the Autonomous Community. He directs the Autonomous Government, elects its Vice President and Councilors and decides the policies that the government carries out.

As at the State level, the President may elect more than one Vice President and may freely separate his Vice-Presidents and Councilors. If the President is ceased, they cease with him.

====Councilors====
The Councilors of the Autonomous Community are like the [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] of the Central Government. They lead a ''Consejería'' (government department as a [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]]). Councilor work in their governamental area and appoint the members of their department like Vice Councilors, General Directors...etc

The figure of the Vice Councilor or Deputy Councilor is not always present, because it is the decision of the Councilor to exist or not this position and, in Autonomous Communities of small size where the work is not much, often these positions do not exist.

====General Directors====
The General Directorates are management departmental bodies and steering bodies, hierarchically inferior to the Councilors or Vice Councirlos (if they exist). The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent. It should be noted that the Royal Decree on the structure of the Department may omit the first requirement because it is a General Directorate whose exceptional characteristics require that the holder does not have the status of official of the State.

====Cabinets====
They are consultation bodies generally composed of a technical secretary and several technicians who support the President, Vicepresident, Councilors, ect. in their relations with institutions, in making decisions and performing special advisory tasks in a particular branch of knowledge.

===Peripheral Administration===
====Territorial Delegations====
The Territorial Delegations of the Autonomous Communities carry out the same activity as the Delegations of the Central Government. They are administrative bodies whose head is a high position appointed in the discretion of the Autonomous Government. He is in charge of the management of the Autonomous Administration in some of the territorial divisions of the Autonomous Communities, such as the [[Provinces of Spain|Province]].

====Sectoral Delegations====
The Sectoral Delegations of the Consejerías are organs that represent the different Departments of an autonomous government. The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent

'''Robert Allen Iger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|ɡ|ər}}; born February 10, 1951) is an American businessman who is [[chairman]] and [[Chief Executive Officer|chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Before working for Disney, Iger served as the president of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] from 1994–95, and as president/[[chief operating officer|COO]] of [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.]] from 1995 until Disney's acquisition of the company in 1996.&lt;!-- The lack of citations is purposeful. Refer to Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#Citations for more information. Wikipedia allows there to be little to no citations in the lead area if it is cited within the main body. If there is something in the lede not cited in the main part drop a {{not found in body}} citation needed tag and it will be addressed.  --&gt; 

He was named president and COO of Disney in 2000, and later succeeded [[Michael Eisner]] as CEO in 2005, after [[Roy E. Disney|a successful effort]] by [[Roy E. Disney]] to shake up the management of the company. As part of his yearly compensation, Iger earned $44.9 million in 2015. During Iger’s tenure, Disney broadened the company's roster of [[Intellectual property|intellectual properties]] and its presence in international markets; Iger oversaw the acquisitions of [[Pixar]] in 2006 for $7.4 billion, [[Marvel Entertainment]] in 2009 for $4 billion, [[Lucasfilm]] in 2012 for $4.06 billion, and a forthcoming takeover of [[21st Century Fox]] for $71.3 billion, as well as the expansion of the company's [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme park resorts]] in [[East Asia]], with the introduction of [[Hong Kong Disneyland Resort]] and [[Shanghai Disney Resort]] in 2005 and 2016, respectively. 

Iger was a driving force behind the reinvigoration of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and the branded-release strategy of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|its film studio]]'s output. Under Iger, Disney has experienced increases in revenue across its various divisions, with the company's [[market capitalization]] value increasing from $48.4 billion to $163 billion over a period of eleven years.

==Career==
Iger began his media career in 1972 as the host of “Campus Probe,” an Ithaca College television show. He dreamed of becoming a [[news anchor]] while he worked as a [[weather presenter|weatherman]] in Ithaca for five months, before shifting his career goals.&lt;ref name="disneybc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-chairman-and-ceo-robert-a-iger-enters-broadcasting-cable-hall-of-fame/|title=Disney Press Release|date=May 4, 2015|accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2010&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/business/11iger.html| title= Is Disney’s Chief Having a Cinderella Moment?| work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Brooks| last=Barnes| date=April 10, 2010|accessdate= April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Broadcasting Company (ABC)===
In 1974, Iger joined the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC).&lt;ref name="rfbbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/biography/F-L/Iger-Robert-1951.html|title=Robert Iger biography|work=referenceforbusiness.com|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5442077 | work=[[The Economist]] | title=Looking Beyond the Mouse | date=January 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he was named head of [[ABC Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/24/arts/abc-names-its-president-of-entertainment.html|title=ABC Names Its President of Entertainment|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=1989-03-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as president of the ABC Network Television Group from January 1993 to 1994, and was appointed as [[Capital Cities/ABC]] senior vice president in March 1993 and executive vice president in July 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowry|first1=Brian|title=ABC ups Iger, regroups divisions|url=https://variety.com/1993/scene/news/abc-ups-iger-regroups-divisions-108981/|accessdate=May 19, 2015|work=Variety|date=July 27, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Iger was named president and chief operating officer of ABC's corporate parent, Capital Cities/ABC.&lt;ref name="cspandates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/person/?robertiger|title=C-SPAN Biography of Mr. Robert A. Iger|publisher=C-SPAN.org|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Walt Disney Company===
In 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC and renamed it [[ABC, Inc.]], where Iger remained president until 1999.&lt;ref name=encyclopediaoftelevision /&gt;

On February 25, 1999, Disney named Iger the president of Walt Disney International, the business unit that oversees Disney's international operations, as well as chairman of the ABC Group, removing him from day-to-day authority at ABC. Disney called the change a promotion for Iger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/25/business/disney-names-new-president-in-reshuffling.html | work=The New York Times | title=Disney Names New President In Reshuffling | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=January 25, 2000 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney named Iger the president and chief operating officer (COO) on January 24, 2000, making him Disney's No. 2 executive under chairman and CEO, [[Michael Eisner]]. Disney had been without a separate president since Eisner assumed the role following the departure of [[Michael Ovitz]] in 1997, after sixteen months at Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Jill|title=Iger tapped No. 2 as Mouse TV booms|url=https://variety.com/2000/biz/news/iger-tapped-no-2-as-mouse-tv-booms-1117765636/|accessdate=June 7, 2014|work=Variety|date=January 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of [[Roy E. Disney#Second "Save Disney" campaign (2003–05)|a successful effort]] by [[Roy E. Disney]] to shake up the management of the company, Disney began a search for the next CEO to replace Eisner. On March 13, 2005, Disney announced that Iger would succeed Michael Eisner as CEO, and Iger was placed in charge of day-to-day operations, though Eisner held the title of CEO until he resigned on September 30, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32493-2005Mar13.html|title=Disney Chooses Successor to Chief Executive Eisner (washingtonpost.com)|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Iger's first major decisions as CEO was to reassign Disney's chief strategic officer, [[Peter Murphy (executive)|Peter Murphy]], and disband the company's [[Strategic Planning]] division.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e9791412-9ee3-11d9-82f0-00000e2511c8|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Iger being named CEO, board members [[Roy E. Disney]] and [[Stanley Gold]] began a campaign called "save Disney" against Eisner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/stories/2004/03/22/daily57.html|title=Disney launches more anti-Eisner sentiment|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2005, Disney and Gold dropped the campaign and agreed to work with Iger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/08/AR2005070801789.html|title=Roy Disney, Company Resolve Their Disputes|last=Gentile|first=Gary|date=2005-07-09|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2006, under Iger’s leadership, Disney announced it would acquire [[Pixar]] for $7.4 billion in an all-stock transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/disney_pixar_deal/|title=Disney buys Pixar - Jan. 25, 2006|last=writer|first=By Paul R. La Monica, CNNMoney.com senior|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Iger also re-acquired the rights to [[Walt Disney]]'s first star, [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], from [[NBCUniversal]] by releasing sportscaster [[Al Michaels]] from [[ABC Sports]] to [[NBC Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/12750497/how-espn-traded-al-michaels-oswald-rabbit|title=An excerpt from former ESPN president George Bodenheimer's book|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:BobIgerJun10.jpg|thumb|right|Iger at the [[World of Color]] Premiere, [[Disney California Adventure]], June 2010]]

Also in 2006, Roy E. Disney issued this statement regarding Iger:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Animation has always been the heart and soul of The Walt Disney Company, and it is wonderful to see Bob Iger and the company embraces that heritage by bringing the outstanding animation talent of the Pixar team back into the fold. This clearly solidifies The Walt Disney Company's position as the dominant leader in motion picture animation and we applaud and support Bob Iger's vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countingdown.com/movies/30929/news?item_id=3822596|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224194554/http://www.countingdown.com/movies/30929/news?item_id=3822596|title=Disney Forum (TBA)        : News|archivedate=24 December 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2009, Iger spearheaded negotiations that led Disney to acquire [[Marvel Entertainment]] and its associated assets for $4 billion. As of August 2014, Disney has recouped over $4 billion at the box office through the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|Marvel movies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/disneys-bob-iger-on-success-of-marvel-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014-8?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Bob Iger: The Marvel Brand Is On Fire|last1=Weisman|first1=Aly|date=August 6, 2014|accessdate=May 21, 2016|publisher=[[Business Insider Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, 2011, Disney announced that Iger would become chairman of the board, following [[John E.

Iger was responsible for making the late Steve Jobs Disney's largest shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-bob-iger-apple-board-261834|title=Disney Chief Bob Iger Joins Apple Board|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2012, Iger signed a deal with film producer [[George Lucas]] to purchase [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]] for $4 billion following several months of negotiations. As a result, Disney acquired the rights to the [[Star Wars]] multimedia franchise and [[Indiana Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leonard|first1=Devin|title=How Disney Bought Lucasfilm&amp;mdash;and Its Plans for Star Wars|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-07/how-disney-bought-lucasfilm-and-its-plans-for-star-wars|accessdate=May 21, 2016|publisher=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=March 8, 2013|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following its release on December 18, 2015, ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' grossed over $2 billion at the box office. In March 2016, Iger announced that the $5.5 billion [[Shanghai Disney Resort]] would open its doors on June 16, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=David|title=Disney's Bob Iger discusses Shanghai resort, 'Star Wars' and ESPN at media conference|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-star-wars-shanghai-disney-20160308-story.html|accessdate=May 21, 2016|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Iger wrote in a Facebook post claiming that Disney has hired 11,000 new employees in the past decade at Disneyland, and 18,000 in the past decade. Iger specifically targeted Vermont Senator, Bernie Sanders, asking him how much he has contributed to job growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/25/media/bob-iger-bernie-sanders/index.html|title=Bob Iger fires back at Bernie Sanders: 'How many jobs have you created?'|last1=Byers|first1=Dylan|date=May 25, 2016|website=CNN|accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FrontLeft3.jpg|thumb|300px|Coach Euro Test 2007]]
The title '''Bus of the Year''' and '''Coach of the Year''', also known as '''International Bus of the Year''' and '''International Coach of the Year''', is on alternate years awarded to bus and coach models on the European market. The competition has been organized by several European bus-related publications since 1989.

== The competition ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
In early summer, three to six bus or coach models that have been submitted by their manufacturers undergo the ''Bus Euro Test'' or the ''Coach Euro Test''. The jury consists of around 20 (currently 19) journalists from bus and coach related publications from all over Europe. In odd years the coaches are tested and in even years the buses are tested, and the winner receives the award entitled for the following year. So at ''Coach Euro Test 2015'', the ''Coach of the Year 2016'' is chosen, and at ''Bus Euro Test 2016'', the ''Bus of the Year 2017'' is chosen. Only the winner is presented, no runners-up.

The award ceremonies take place at exhibitions in the autumn, with ''Bus of the Year'' at the [[Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung|IAA Nutzfahrzeuge]] in [[Hanover]] and ''Coach of the Year'' at Busworld [[Kortrijk Xpo|Kortrijk]].

== Jury members ==
The following 19 European publications each appoint a journalist to the jury in ''Bus &amp; Coach of the Year''. (List as of November 2014.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bus-of-the-year.com/mitglieder/ Members] Bus of the Year Award (Referenced: 13 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Howard Hughes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Howard Hughes]] was a major American aviation and film maverick during the 20th century.]]
A '''business magnate''' or '''industrialist''' is an [[entrepreneur]] of great influence, importance, or standing in a particular enterprise or field of business. The term characteristically refers to a wealthy entrepreneur or investor who controls, through personal business ownership or dominant shareholding position, a firm or industry whose goods or services are widely consumed. Such individuals may also be called ''[[Tsar|czar]]s'', ''[[Magnate|mogul]]s'', ''proprietors'', ''tycoons'', ''taipans'', ''[[baron]]s'', or ''[[Business oligarch|oligarch]]s''.

==Etymology==
The word ''[[magnate]]'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''magnates'' (plural of ''magnas''), meaning "a great man" or "great nobleman".

]]
The word '''''tycoon''''' derives from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word {{Nihongo|[[taikun]]|大君}}, which means "great lord", used as a title for the ''[[shōgun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American English Spelling: An Informal Description |last=Cummings |first= Donald Wayne |year=1988 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-3443-1 |page=277 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OVIqCV57pYC |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tycoon |title=tycoon |work=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=22 May 2012 |quote=Origin of TYCOON Japanese taikun}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word entered the English language in 1857&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tycoon |title=tycoon |work=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=22 May 2012 |quote=First Known Use: 1857}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the return of [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]] to the United States.  U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was humorously referred to as ''the Tycoon'' by his aides [[John Nicolay]] and [[John Hay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Return of the Samurai |first=Adam |last=Goodheart |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/return-of-the-samurai/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 November 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term spread to the business community, where it has been used ever since.

The word ''mogul'' is an English corruption of ''mughal'', Persian or Arabic for "Mongol".  It alludes to emperors of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Medieval India]], who possessed great power and storied riches capable of producing wonders of opulence such as the [[Taj Mahal]].

==Usage==
Modern business magnates are entrepreneurs that amass on their own or wield substantial family fortunes in the process of building or running their own businesses. Some are widely known in connection with these entrepreneurial activities, others through high-visibility secondary pursuits such as [[philanthropy]], political fundraising and campaign financing, and sports team ownership or sponsorship.

The terms ''mogul'', ''tycoon'' and ''baron'' were often applied to late 19th and early 20th century [[North America]]n business magnates in [[natural resource|extractive industries]] such as [[mining]], [[logging]] and [[petroleum]], transportation fields such as [[shipping]] and [[rail transport|railroad]]s, manufacturing such as [[Automobile manufacturing|automaking]] and [[steel]]making, in [[banking]], as well as newspaper publishing. Their dominance was known as the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], the [[Gilded Age]], or the [[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber Baron Era]].

&lt;!--Please discuss additions to the below list on the talk page so it does not become unwieldy--&gt;
Examples of well-known business magnates in the western world include historical figures such as oilman [[John D. Rockefeller]], automobile pioneer [[Henry Ford]], shipping and railroad veterans [[Aristotle Onassis]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], [[Jay Gould]], and [[James J. Hill]], steel innovator [[Andrew Carnegie]], newspaper publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]], retail merchant [[Sam Walton]], and banker [[J. P. Morgan]]. Contemporary industrial tycoons include e-commerce entrepreneur [[Jeff Bezos]], real estate developer [[Donald Trump]], investor [[Warren Buffett]], computer programmer [[Bill Gates]], technology innovator [[Steve Jobs]], steel investor [[Lakshmi Mittal]], telecommunications investor [[Carlos Slim]], airline owner Sir [[Richard Branson]], technology entrepreneur [[Elon Musk]], Formula 1 manager [[Bernie Ecclestone]], media entrepreneur [[Rupert Murdoch]], and poultry technologist [[Frank Perdue]].&lt;!--Please discuss additions to the above list on the talk page so it does not become unwieldy--&gt;

'''Johan Carl Kempe''' (8 December 1884 – 8 July 1967) was leader of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[pulp and paper industry]] [[Mo och Domsjö AB]] and involved in several other companies in the large economic sphere of the Kempe family. He was also a silver medalist in tennis at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="sports-reference"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ke/carl-kempe-1.html |title=Carl Kempe |work=sports-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sok&gt;[http://sok.se/idrottare/idrottare/c/carl-kempe.html Carl Kempe]. Swedish Olympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Kempe was born in Stockholm, son of [[Frans Kempe]]. He finished secondary school at [[Norra latinläroverket]] in Stockholm, studied at [[Uppsala University]] 1903–1905 and started to work for [[Mo och Domsjö]] in 1906. He succeeded his father as CEO of Mo och Domsjö in 1917. While the company he took over from his father had retained many traits of a traditional [[lumber]] producer, Carl Kempe was, through large investments in research and development, chiefly responsible for its transformation into a modern [[chemical industry]].&lt;ref name=sok/&gt;

Kempe himself claimed that he spent his time at university in Uppsala mostly with playing tennis, attending dancing lessons and playing cards; the first of these pastimes, at least, led to his winning a [[tennis]] silver medal at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]] in the men's indoor doubles event (with [[Gunnar Setterwall]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4593">The '''chief sustainability officer''', sometimes known by other titles, is the [[corporate title]] of an executive position within a [[corporation]] that is in charge of the corporation's "[[environmental ethic|environmental]]" programmes.  Several companies have created such [[Environmental Manager|environmental manager]] positions in the 21st century to formalize their commitment to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=January–February 2008|title=Adding Sustainability to the C-Suite|author=Lianne R.

However, as sustainability initiatives have expanded beyond the facility — so has the importance of the position to what is now a C-level executive role.

As of 2005, nearly all of the 150 largest companies in the world had a sustainability officer with the rank of [[vice president]] or higher, and numerous [[Green MBA|MBA programs]] had incorporated sustainability training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Confederation of Finnish Industries''' (EK, {{lang-fi|Elinkeinoelämän Keskusliitto}}, {{lang-sv|Finlands Näringsliv}}) is the largest business organisation in [[Finland]]. It was formed in the beginning of 2005 when two private sector organisations, ''Palvelutyönantajat'' (Employers of the Service Sector) and ''Teollisuuden ja Työnantajain Keskusliitto'' (Union of Industries and Employers), united. EK's member companies collectively contribute over 70% of Finland's GDP, and over 95% of Finland's exports. It has considerable negotiating power, since Finland has [[universal validity of collective labour agreements]], and often a [[Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement]] is reached.

EK focuses its activity on the following goals:
* A business environment which stimulates growth and success for companies
* Securing the competitiveness of Finnish work
* Ways to benefit from the opportunities offered by globalisation
* Economic policies promoting competitiveness
* Efficient member services

The organisation consists of:
* 43 branch associations
* About 15,000 member companies, 96% of which are [[small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs)
* About 900,000 employees

{{Taxation}}
A '''corporate tax''', also called '''corporation tax''' or '''company tax''', is a [[direct tax]]* imposed by a jurisdiction on the income or capital of corporations or analogous legal entities. Many countries impose such taxes at the national level, and a similar tax may be imposed at state or local levels. The taxes may also be referred to as [[income tax]] or [[capital tax]]. [[Partnership]]s are generally not taxed at the entity level. A country's corporate tax may apply to:
* [[Incorporation (business)|corporations incorporated]] in the country,
* corporations doing business in the country on income from that country,
* foreign corporations who have a [[permanent establishment]] in the country, or 
* corporations deemed to be [[tax residence|resident for tax purposes]] in the country.

Company income subject to tax is often determined much like taxable income for individual taxpayers. Generally, the tax is imposed on net profits. In some jurisdictions, rules for taxing companies may differ significantly from rules for taxing individuals. Certain corporate acts, like reorganizations, may not be taxed. Some types of entities may be exempt from tax.

Countries may tax corporations on its net profit and may also tax shareholders when the corporation pays a [[dividend]]. Where dividends are taxed, a corporation may be required to [[withholding tax|withhold tax]] before the dividend is distributed.

Economists disagree as to how much of the burden of the corporate tax falls on owners, workers consumers and landowners, and how the corporate tax affects economic growth and economic inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://microeconomicinsights.org/benefits-corporate-tax-cuts-evidence-local-us-labour-markets/|title=Who benefits from corporate tax cuts? Evidence from local US labour markets {{!}} Microeconomic Insights|date=2017-11-02|work=Microeconomic Insights|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note:*Considered indirect because the cost of the tax can transferred to the consumer.

==Legal framework==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
A corporate tax is a tax imposed on the net profit of a corporation that are taxed at the entity level in a particular jurisdiction. Net profit for corporate tax is generally the financial statement net profit with modifications, and may be defined in great detail within each country's tax system. Such taxes may include income or other taxes. The tax systems of most countries impose an [[income tax]] at the entity level on certain type(s) of entities (company or [[corporation]]). The rate of tax varies by jurisdiction. The tax may have an alternative base, such as assets, payroll, or income computed in an alternative manner.

Most countries exempt certain types of corporate events or transactions from income tax. For example, events related to formation or reorganization of the corporation, which are treated as capital costs. In addition, most systems provide specific rules for taxation of the entity and/or its members upon winding up or dissolution of the entity.

In systems where financing costs are allowed as reductions of the tax base ([[tax deductions]]), rules may apply that differentiate between classes of member-provided financing. In such systems, items characterized as [[interest]] may be deductible, perhaps subject to limitations, while items characterized as dividends are not. Some systems limit deductions based on simple formulas, such as a [[debt-to-equity ratio]], while other systems have more complex rules.

Some systems provide a mechanism whereby groups of related corporations may obtain benefit from losses, credits, or other items of all members within the group. Mechanisms include combined or consolidated returns as well as group relief (direct benefit from items of another member).

Many systems additionally tax shareholders of those entities on [[dividends]] or other distributions by the corporation. A few systems provide for partial integration of entity and member taxation. This may be accomplished by "imputation systems" or [[franking credit]]s. In the past, mechanisms have existed for advance payment of member tax by corporations, with such payment offsetting entity level tax.

Many systems (particularly sub-country level systems) impose a tax on particular corporate attributes.  Such non-income taxes may be based on capital stock issued or authorized (either by number of shares or value), total equity, net capital, or other measures unique to corporations.

Corporations, like other entities, may be subject to [[withholding tax]] obligations upon making certain varieties of payments to others.  These obligations are generally not the tax of the corporation, but the system may impose penalties on the corporation or its officers or employees for failing to withhold and pay over such taxes. A company has been defined as a juristic person having an independent and separate existence from its shareholders. Income of the company is computed and assessed separately in the hands of the company. In certain cases, distributions from the company to its shareholders as dividends are taxed as income to the shareholders.

Corporations [[property tax]], [[payroll tax]], [[withholding tax]], [[excise tax]], [[customs duties]], [[value added tax]], and other common taxes, are generally not referred to as “corporate tax.”

===Definition of corporation===
{{Main|Corporation}}
Characterization as a [[corporation]] for tax purposes is based on the form of organization, with the exception of United States Federal&lt;ref&gt;See United States tax regulations at [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/aprqtr/pdf/26cfr301.7701-2.pdf 26 CFR 301.7701-2] and [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/aprqtr/pdf/26cfr301.7701-3.pdf -3].&lt;/ref&gt; and most states income taxes, under which an entity may elect to be treated as a corporation and taxed at the entity level or taxed only at the member level.&lt;ref name=26usc11&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/11 26 USC 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[Limited liability company]],  [[Partnership taxation]], [[S corporation]], [[Sole proprietorship]].

==Types==
Most jurisdictions tax corporations on their income, like the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880001_en_2 Income and Corporation Taxes Act of 1988] as amended (UK ICTA88) section 6&lt;/ref&gt; or the United States.&lt;ref name=26usc11/&gt; The United States taxes all types of corporate income for a given company at the same rate, but provide different rates of tax depending on income levels or size of the company.&lt;ref name=26usc11/&gt;

The United States taxes corporations under the same framework of tax law as individuals, with differences related to the inherent natures of corporations and individuals or unincorporated entities.  Individuals are not formed, amalgamated, or acquired; and corporations do not incur medical expenses except by way of compensating individuals.&lt;ref&gt;United States [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_B_40_VII.html itemized deductions for individuals] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_B_40_VIII.html special deductions for corporations].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most systems tax both domestic and [[Foreign corporation|foreign corporations]].  Often, domestic corporations are taxed on worldwide income while foreign corporations are taxed only on income from sources within the jurisdiction. 

===Taxable income===
The United States defines taxable income for a corporation as all [[gross income]], i.e. sales plus other income minus cost of goods sold and tax exempt income less allowable [[Tax deduction|tax deductions]], without the allowance of the [[standard deduction]] applicable to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/63|title=26 U.S. Code § 63 - Taxable income defined|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' system requires that differences in principles for recognizing income and deductions differing from financial accounting principles like the timing of income or deduction, [[tax exemption]] for certain income, and disallowance or limitation of certain [[tax deductions]]  be disclosed in considerable detail for non-small corporations on Schedule M-3 to Form 1120.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120sm3.pdf|title=M-3 to Form 1120|date=|journal=United States Internal Revenue Service|via=|author-link=irs.gov|last=United States Internal Revenue Service|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States taxes resident corporations, i.e. those organized within the country, on their worldwide income, and nonresident, foreign corporations only on their income from sources within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_N_40_II_50_B.html|title=26 U.S. Code Subpart B - Foreign Corporations|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Hong Kong taxes resident and nonresident corporations only on income from sources within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/tax/bus_pft.htm#03 |title=Profits Tax |publisher=Ird.gov.hk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate tax rates generally are the same for differing types of income, yet the US graduated its tax rate system where corporations with lower levels of income pay a lower rate of tax, with rates varying from 15% on the first $50,000 of income to 35% on incomes over $10,000,000, with phase-outs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/11|title=26 U.S. Code § 11 - Tax imposed|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian system imposes tax at different rates for different types of corporations, allowing lower rates for some smaller corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/type-corporation.html|title=Type of corporation - Canada.ca|last=Canada Revenue Agency|first=|date=|website=www.canada.ca|language=en-ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax rates vary by jurisdiction and some countries have sub-country level jurisdictions like provinces, cantons, prefectures, cities, or other that also impose corporate income tax like Canada, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peachwilkinson.com/taxing-terms-corporation-tax-explained/ |title=Corporation Tax Explained |publisher=Peach Wilkinson Accountants}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions impose tax at a different rate on an alternative tax base.

Some cities:  up to 9%, deductible in computing Federal taxable income.  The Federal Alternative Minimum Tax of 20% is imposed on regular taxable income with adjustments.

===International corporate tax rates===

Corporate tax rates vary widely by country, leading some corporations to shield earnings within offshore subsidiaries or to redomicile within countries with lower tax rates. 

In comparing national corporate tax rates one should also take into account the taxes on dividends paid to shareholders. For example, the overall U.S. tax on corporate profits of 35% is less than or similar to that of European countries such as Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which have lower corporate tax rates but higher taxes on dividends paid to shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/5k3wh96w246k.pdf?expires=1448516536&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=19E09DD7567FF1DA85E0EC999665FA0B|title=OECD iLibrary|last=|first=|date=|work=OECD i-Library|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|format=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=October 2018}} 

Corporate tax rates across the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) are shown in the table. Rates within the OECD vary from a low of 8.5% in Switzerland to a high of 34.43% in France, since the United States had recently decreased corporation tax to 22%.  The OECD average is 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Table II.1. Corporate income tax rate |publisher=OECD |url=http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=58204 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170702060453/http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=58204 |archivedate=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first column in the table below represents corporate income tax rates mandated by the central government. The second column lists total combined tax rates which, in addition to the government tax rate, may also include various provincial, state and local taxes. For example, the 2015 provincial corporate tax rates in Canada range from 11.5% to 16% in addition to the federal tax rate of 15%, unless taxable profits of small corporations are low enough to qualify for a lower tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Corporation tax rates |url= http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/crprtns/rts-eng.html |website=Canada Revenue Agency |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=2016-02-07 |author=Taxpayer Services and Debt Management Branch, Taxpayer Services &amp;#x5b;Directorate&amp;#x5d;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of earnings==
Most systems that tax corporations also impose income tax on shareholders of corporations when earnings are distributed.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61 26 USC 61(a)(7)].&lt;/ref&gt;  Such distribution of earnings is generally referred to as a [[dividend]].  The tax may be at reduced rates.  For example, the United States provides for reduced amounts of tax on dividends received by  individuals and by corporations.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1 26 USC 1(h)(11)] for the reduced rate of tax for individuals, and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/243 26 USC 243] (a)(1) and (c) for a deduction for dividends received by corporations.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company law of some jurisdictions prevents corporations from distributing amounts to shareholders except as distribution of earnings.  Such earnings may be determined under company law principles or tax principles. In such jurisdictions, exceptions are usually provided with respect to distribution of shares of the company, for winding up, and in limited other situations.

Other jurisdictions treat distributions as distributions of earnings taxable to shareholders if earnings are available to be distributed, but do not prohibit distributions in excess of earnings.  For example, under the United States system each corporation must maintain a calculation of its earnings and profits (a tax concept similar to retained earnings).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/312|title=26 U.S. Code § 312 - Effect on earnings and profits|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A distribution to a shareholder is considered to be from earnings and profits to the extent thereof unless an exception applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/316|title=26 U.S. Code § 316 - Dividend defined|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that the United States provides reduced tax on dividend income of both corporations and individuals.

Other jurisdictions provide corporations a means of designating, within limits, whether a distribution is a distribution of earnings taxable to the shareholder or a [[return of capital]].

===Example===
The following illustrates the dual level of tax concept:

C Corp earns 100 of profits before tax in each of years 1 and 2.  It distributes all the earnings in year 3, when it has no profits.  Jim owns all of C Corp.  The tax rate in the residence jurisdiction of Jim and C Corp is 30%.

==Other corporate events==
Many systems provide that certain corporate events are not taxable to corporations or shareholders.  Significant restrictions and special rules often apply.  The rules related to such transactions are often quite complex.

===Formation===
Most systems treat the formation of a corporation by a controlling corporate shareholder as a nontaxable event.  Many systems, including the United States and Canada, extend this tax free treatment to the formation of a corporation by any group of shareholders in control of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/351 26 USC 351].  For a discussion of U.S. principles, see Bittker &amp; Eustice, below, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, in tax free formations the tax attributes of assets and liabilities are transferred to the new corporation along with such assets and liabilities.

Example:  John and Mary are United States residents who operate a business.  They decide to incorporate for business reasons.  They transfer the assets of the business to Newco, a newly formed Delaware corporation of which they are the sole shareholders, subject to accrued liabilities of the business in exchange solely for common shares of Newco.  Under United States principles, this transfer does not cause tax to John, Mary, or Newco.  If on the other hand Newco also assumes a bank loan in excess of the basis of the assets transferred less the accrued liabilities, John and Mary will recognize taxable gain for such excess.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/357 26 USC 357] and [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/aprqtr/pdf/26cfr1.357-2.pdf 26 CFR 1.367-1(b) Example].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions===
Corporations may merge or acquire other corporations in a manner a particular tax system treats as nontaxable to either of the corporations and/or to their shareholders.  Generally, significant restrictions apply if tax free treatment is to be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368 26 USC 368] defining events qualifying for reorganization treatment, including certain acquisitions.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Bigco acquires all of the shares of Smallco from Smallco shareholders in exchange solely for Bigco shares.  This acquisition is not taxable to Smallco or its shareholders under U.S. or Canadian tax law if certain requirements are met, even if Smallco is then liquidated into or merged or amalgamated with Bigco.

===Reorganizations===
In addition, corporations may change key aspects of their legal identity, capitalization, or structure in a tax free manner under most systems.  Examples of reorganizations that may be tax free include mergers, amalgamations, liquidations of subsidiaries, share for share exchanges, exchanges of shares for assets, changes in form or place of organization, and recapitalizations.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/354 26 USC 354] for tax effect on shareholders of reorganizations as defined in  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368 26 USC 368].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interest deduction limitations==
Most jurisdictions allow a [[tax deduction]] for interest expense incurred by a corporation in carrying out its trading activities.  Where such interest is paid to related parties, such deduction may be limited.  Without such limitation, owners could structure financing of the corporation in a manner that would provide for a tax deduction for much of the profits, potentially without changing the tax on shareholders.  For example, assume a corporation earns profits of 100 before interest expense and would normally distribute 50 to shareholders.  If the corporation is structured so that deductible interest of 50 is payable to the shareholders, it will cut its tax to half the amount due if it merely paid a dividend.

A common form of limitation is to limit the deduction for interest paid to related parties to interest charged at arm's length rates on debt not exceeding a certain portion of the equity of the paying corporation.  For example, interest paid on related party debt in excess of three times equity may not be deductible in computing taxable income.

The United States, United Kingdom, and French tax systems apply a more complex set of tests to limit deductions.  Under the [[Corporate tax in the United States|U.S. system]], related party interest expense in excess of 50% of cash flow is generally not currently deductible, with the excess potentially deductible in future years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/163|title=26 U.S. Code § 163 - Interest|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of instruments as debt on which interest is deductible or as equity with respect to which distributions are not deductible can be complex in some systems.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/385 26 USC 385].  The [[Internal Revenue Service]] had proposed complex regulations under this section (see TD 7747, 1981-1 CB 141) which were soon withdrawn (TD 7920, 1983-2 CB 69).  An article in ''Tax Notes'', a publication of [[Tax Analysts]] in 1986 {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} identified 26 factors the U.S. courts have used to classify instruments as debt or equity.  Also see [http://asbbs.org/files/2008/PDF/E/Englebrecht.pdf article]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Englebrecht, ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign corporation branches==
Most jurisdictions tax foreign corporations differently from domestic corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Contrast tax on domestic corporations under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/11 26 USC 11] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/63 26 USC 63] with tax on foreign corporations under  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_N_40_II_50_B.html 26 USC 881-885].&lt;/ref&gt;  No international laws limit the ability of a country to tax its nationals and residents (individuals and entities).  However, treaties and practicality impose limits on taxation of those outside its borders, even on income from sources within the country.

Most jurisdictions tax foreign corporations on business income within the jurisdiction when earned through a branch or [[permanent establishment]] in the jurisdiction.  This tax may be imposed at the same rate as the tax on business income of a resident corporation or at a different rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/882|title=26 U.S. Code § 882 - Tax on income of foreign corporations connected with United States business|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon payment of [[dividends]], corporations are generally subject to [[withholding tax]] only by their country of incorporation.  Many countries impose a branch profits tax on foreign corporations to prevent the advantage the absence of dividend withholding tax would otherwise provide to foreign corporations.  This tax may be imposed at the time profits are earned by the branch or at the time they are remitted or deemed remitted outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/884|title=26 U.S. Code § 884 - Branch profits tax|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branches of foreign corporations may not be entitled to all of the same deductions as domestic corporations.  Some jurisdictions do not recognize inter-branch payments as actual payments, and income or deductions arising from such inter-branch payments are disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] states in its [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p515/ar02.html#en_US_publink1000224779 Publication 515], “The payee of a payment made to a disregarded entity is the owner of the entity.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Some jurisdictions impose express limits on tax deductions of branches.  Commonly limited deductions include management fees and interest.

Nathan M. Jenson argues that low corporate tax rates are a minor determinate of a multinational company when setting up their headquarters in a country. Nathan M. Jenson: Sinha, S.S. 2008, "Can India Adopt Strategic Flexibility Like China Did?", Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management, vol. 9, no. 2/3, pp. 1.

==Losses==
Most jurisdictions allow interperiod allocation or deduction of losses in some manner for corporations, even where such deduction is not allowed for individuals.  A few jurisdictions allow losses (usually defined as negative taxable income) to be deducted by revising or amending prior year taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/172|title=26 U.S. Code § 172 - Net operating loss deduction|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most jurisdictions allow such deductions only in subsequent periods.  Some jurisdictions impose time limitations as to when loss deductions may be utilized.

==Groups of companies==
Several jurisdictions provide a mechanism whereby losses or [[tax credits]] of one corporation may be used by another corporation where both corporations are commonly controlled (together, a group).  In the United States and Netherlands, among others, this is accomplished by filing a single tax return including the income and loss of each group member.  This is referred to as a consolidated return in the United States and as a fiscal unity in the Netherlands.  In the United Kingdom, this is accomplished directly on a pairwise basis called group relief.  Losses of one group member company may be “surrendered” to another group member company, and the latter company may deduct the loss against profits.

The United States has extensive regulations dealing with consolidated returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1502-0|title=26 CFR 1.1502-0 - Effective dates.|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such rule requires matching of income and deductions on intercompany transactions within the group by use of “deferred intercompany transaction” rules.

In addition, a few systems provide a tax exemption for dividend income received by corporations.  The Netherlands system provides a “participation exception” to taxation for corporations owning more than 25% of the dividend paying corporation.

==Transfer pricing==
{{seealso|Transfer pricing}}
A key issue in corporate tax is the setting of prices charged by related parties for goods, services or the use of property. Many jurisdictions have guidelines on transfer pricing which allow tax authorities to adjust transfer prices used. Such adjustments may apply in both an international and a domestic context.

==Taxation of shareholders==
Most income tax systems levy tax on the corporation and, upon distribution of earnings (dividends), on the shareholder.  This results in a dual level of tax.  Most systems require that income tax be withheld on distribution of dividends to foreign shareholders, and some also require withholding of tax on distributions to domestic shareholders.  The rate of such [[withholding tax]] may be reduced for a shareholder under a [[tax treaty]].

Some systems tax some or all dividend income at lower rates than other income.  The United States has historically provided a [[dividends received deduction]] to corporations with respect to dividends from other corporations in which the recipient owns more than 10% of the shares.  For tax years 2004–2010, the United States also has imposed a reduced rate of taxation on dividends received by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1 26 USC 1(h)(11)].  Note that distributions from an [[S corporation]], Regulated Investment Company (mutual fund), or Real Estate Investment Trust are not treated as dividends.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systems currently attempt or in the past have attempted to integrate taxation of the corporation with taxation of shareholders to mitigate the dual level of taxation.  As a current example, Australia provides for a “franking credit” as a benefit to shareholders.  When an Australian company pays a dividend to a domestic shareholder, it reports the dividend as well as a notional tax credit amount.  The shareholder utilizes this notional credit to offset shareholder level income tax.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A previous system was utilised in the United Kingdom, called the [[Advance Corporation Tax]] (ACT).  When a company paid a dividend, it was required to pay an amount of ACT, which it then used to offset its own taxes.  The ACT was included in income by the shareholder resident in the United Kingdom or certain treaty countries, and treated as a payment of tax by the shareholder.  To the extent that deemed tax payment exceeded taxes otherwise due, it was refundable to the shareholder.

==Alternative tax bases==
Many jurisdictions incorporate some sort of alternative tax computation.  These computations may be based on assets, capital, wages, or some alternative measure of taxable income.  Often the alternative tax functions as a minimum tax.

[[Income tax in the United States|United States federal income tax]] incorporates an [[alternative minimum tax]].  This tax is computed at a lower tax rate (20% for corporations), and imposed based on a modified version of taxable income.  Modifications include longer depreciation lives assets under [[MACRS]], adjustments related to costs of developing natural resources, and an addback of certain tax exempt interest.  The U. S. state of Michigan previously taxed businesses on an alternative base that did not allow compensation of employees as a tax deduction and allowed full deduction of the cost of production assets upon acquisition.

Some jurisdictions, such as Swiss cantons and certain states within the United States, impose taxes based on capital.  These may be based on total equity per audited financial statements,&lt;ref&gt;Switzerland {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a computed amount of assets less liabilities&lt;ref name="New York"&gt;New York&lt;/ref&gt; or quantity of shares outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Delaware&lt;/ref&gt;  In some jurisdictions, capital based taxes are imposed in addition to the income tax.&lt;ref name="New York"/&gt;  In other jurisdictions, the capital taxes function as alternative taxes.

Mexico imposes an alternative tax on corporations, the IETU.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  The tax rate is lower than the regular rate, and there are adjustments for salaries and wages, interest and royalties, and depreciable assets.

==Tax returns==
Most systems require that corporations file an annual income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6012|title=26 U.S. Code § 6012 - Persons required to make returns of income|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some systems (such as the [[Tax return (Canada)|Canadian]] and [[Tax return (United States)|United States]] systems) require that taxpayers self assess tax on the tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6151|title=26 U.S. Code § 6151 - Time and place for paying tax shown on returns|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other systems provide that the government must make an assessment for tax to be due.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  Some systems require certification of tax returns in some manner by accountants licensed to practice in the jurisdiction, often the company's auditors.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., India {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax returns can be fairly simple or quite complex.  The systems requiring simple returns often base taxable income on financial statement profits with few adjustments, and may require that audited financial statements be attached to the return.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., UK Form [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ctsa/ct600-2008.pdf CT600], which [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ct/managing/company-tax-return/returns/submit.htm requires the attachment] of audited or statutory accounts as filed with the [[Companies House]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Returns for such systems generally require that the relevant financial statements be attached to a simple adjustment schedule.  By contrast, United States corporate tax returns require both computation of taxable income from components thereof and reconciliation of taxable income to financial statement income.

Many systems require forms or schedules supporting particular items on the main form.  Some of these schedules may be incorporated into the main form.  For example, the Canadian corporate return, [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/t2/t2-09e.pdf  Form T-2]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, an 8-page form, incorporates some detail schedules but has nearly 50 additional schedules that may be required.

Some systems have different returns for different types of corporations or corporations engaged in specialized businesses.  The United States has 13 variations on the basic Form 1120&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/formsInstructions.html?value=1120&amp;criteria=formNumber&amp;submitSearch=Find |title=Forms and Instructions (PDF) |publisher=Irs.gov |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[S corporation]]s, insurance companies, [[Domestic international sales corporation]]s, foreign corporations, and other entities.  The structure of the forms and imbedded schedules vary by type of form.

Preparation of non-simple corporate tax returns can be time consuming.  For example, the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] states in the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1120.pdf instructions for Form 1120] that the average time needed to complete form is over 56 hours, not including record keeping time and required attachments.

Tax return due dates vary by jurisdiction, fiscal or tax year, and type of entity.&lt;ref&gt;Examples:  U.S. corporations must file Federal income Form 1120 by the 15th day of the third month following the end of the tax year (March 15 for calendar years); but Form 1120-IC-DISC returns are not due until the 15th day of the ninth month; Canadian corporations must file T-2 by June 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  In self-assessment systems, payment of taxes is generally due no later than the normal due date, though advance tax payments may be required.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Corporations must pay estimated taxes for each quarter or face penalties under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6655 26 USC 6655].&lt;/ref&gt;  Canadian corporations must pay estimated taxes monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/crprtns/pymnts/nstlmnts/ddts-eng.html |title=Instalment due dates |publisher=Cra-arc.gc.ca |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In each case, final payment is due with the corporation tax return.

'''Dan Roman''' is an entrepreneur, investor and IT professional with focus on emerging markets. In 1990, after the termination of the communist era in Romania, he was a pioneer in establishing one of the first private companies in the country, RBS Ltd. (Romanian Business Systems), that became the local market leader. Roman managed RBS as CEO and owner until 1995, when he sold the company to [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin.ro/articol_68550/dan-roman-fostul-presedinte-de-ca-al-st-deschide-in-romania-biroul-unei-firme-austriece.html |title=Dan Roman, fostul presedinte de CA al S&amp;T, deschide in Romania biroul unei firme austriece &amp;#124; IT&amp;C |publisher=Fin.ro |date=2011-10-31 |accessdate=2012-03-05 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he was appointed Director of IBM CER in Vienna, being responsible for countries in the [[Balkans]] and [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] area. In this capacity, he created for IBM a partner network and a framework for establishing local subsidiaries.

'''Daniel Beale''' (1759&amp;ndash;1842) was a Scottish merchant and fur trader active in the Far East mercantile centres of [[Bombay]], [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]] and [[Macau]] as well as at one time the [[Prussia]]n consul in China.

==Biography==
Daniel Beale was the purser of, successively, the East India Company ships ''Walpole'' and ''General Coote'' on voyages between London and Canton in 1783-1786: in 1783 he joined the Macao partnership of [[John Henry Cox]] and John Reid in their mercantile ventures.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, "John Meares: Dubliner, Naval Officer, Fur Trader and would be Colonizer", ''Journal of Australian Naval History,'' vol.8, no.1, March 2011, pp.32-62, n.34.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving evidence before the British parliament’s commons committee of ''Enquiry on the East India Company’s Affairs'' on 11 May 1815, Beale testified that he had been resident in Canton "from the latter end of 1787 to the middle of 1797"&lt;ref name="PCE"&gt;{{Cite book|title= The parliamentary debates from the year 1803 to the present time}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=yyfauGAhTpcC&amp;pg=RA5-PT213 Online version at Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; and acted as "agent for many of the mercantile houses in Bombay and [[Bengal]]." 

[[John Henry Cox]] had been sent to Canton in 1782 by his father James to sell off an accumulated stock of clocks, watches and mechanical toys&lt;ref name=RIDE&gt;

Along with James Fox, the other major manufacturer of singsongs was Francis Magniac of Clerkenwell, London, whose sons Charles and [[Hollingworth Magniac|Hollingworth]] would later become partners of Beale.&lt;ref name="GREENBERG"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Michael|title= British trade and the opening of China 1800-1842|publisher= Monthly Review Press; First Edition (1 January 1951)|isbn= 978-0-85345-497-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QNo8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA76 Online version at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Merchants operating in the Far East at this time formed a bewildering array of partnerships. As well as the Coxes, Beale was also at various times a partner of John Reid, Charles Magniac and his brother Hollingworth, as well as Alexander Shank and Robert Hamilton.&lt;ref name="CONNELL"&gt;

On 15&amp;nbsp;February 1786, a [[Prussia]]n ship arrived at [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Whampoa]] whereupon the [[East India Company]]’s agent at [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]] informed the Committee of [[Supercargo]]es that Beale had shown him a letter signed by "Count Lusi, Envoy Extraordinaire to his Majesty the King of Prussia with the King of Great Britain and his Colonel of Infantry", announcing his appointment as his Prussian Majesty’s Consul in China.&lt;ref&gt;’’[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]’’ (1798) Volume 58, Page 555 [https://books.google.com/books?id=zk4DAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA555 Online version at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beale was also a member of the Associated Merchants Trading to the Northwest Coast of America, which owned the [[snow (ship)|snow]] ''Iphigenia Nubiana'', trading on this coast in 1788 and 1789. Other partners in the venture were [[John Meares]], [[John Henry Cox]], Richard C. Etches, John W. Etches, William Fitzhugh and Henry Land.&lt;ref&gt;Dalzell , Kathleen ‘’Queen Charlotte Islands - Book 2: of places and names’’ Prince Rupert: Cove Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with fellow Scotsman [[John Reid (merchant)|John Reid]], Beale was also one of the owners of the [[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]], a vessel ostensibly belonging to the fictitious Austrian East India Company, which sailed under the flag of Austria. This allowed her to circumvent the trade monopoly then held by the East India Company. Beale was by this time the Prussian agent in Canton following his earlier appointment as consul. Beale organized the voyage of the ''Imperial Eagle'' when he returned to London from Canton on the HCS ''General Coote'' in August 1786.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Dermigny, ''La Chine et L’Occident,'' Paris, SEVPEN, 1964, tome III, p.1241.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1797, Beale &amp; Co. had become the biggest of the country traders, dealing with clients in Bombay, Calcutta and London, in Indian cotton, sandalwood, tin, pepper Chinese tea and silk as well as opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Coates|first=Austin|title= Macao and the British, 1637-1842|publisher=China; OUP|isbn= 978-0-19-582782-8}} p. 73, pp. 128ff&lt;/ref&gt; His firm Beale &amp; Co. seems to have been active in the opium trade between 1783&amp;ndash;1793.

In 1797 Daniel Beale left China to join Magniac &amp; Co. in London and in 1800 the sole British firm in Canton is recorded as Reid, Beale &amp; Co., formerly Hamilton &amp; Reid, and in 1804 to become Beale &amp; Magniac.&lt;ref name="GREENBERG" /&gt;

==Memorial==
Beale died in England in 1842. In the gallery of [[St Pancras New Church]], London, there is a memorial to Thomas Beale of [[Fitzroy Square]] and of Millfield House [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]], Middlesex. formerly of Canton and Macao, "a most zealous promoter of the building of this Church and one of the original trustees."&lt;ref name="SOL"&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=65559 ''Survey of London: volume 24: The parish of St Pancras part 4: King’s Cross Neighbourhood'' (1952), pp. 1–9.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was immortalised by the artist [[Jacques-Laurent Agasse]] in his painting ''Daniel Beale at his Farm at Edmonton with his Favourite Horse''.&lt;ref name ="SOUTH"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/f-jacques-laurent-agasse-1767-1849-1-c-860tjei64d|title=Sotheby’s Auction Item|year=2005|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1791 he married Elizabeth, the daughter of Paul Barbot of London.&lt;ref name="SOUTH" /&gt; She died in 1830.&lt;ref name="SOL" /&gt;

They had a son, also named Daniel, who was born about 1798 and died on 4&amp;nbsp;January 1827 aged 29, as well as a younger brother, [[Thomas Beale]], and a cousin, [[Thomas Chaye Beale]].&lt;ref name="OPC"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://gwulo.com/sites/gwulo.com/files/Gwulo-Macau-Old-Protestant-Cemetery.pdf|title=Old Protestant Cemetery in Macau|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1748">A '''Design brief''' is a document for a [[design]] project developed by a person or team (the 'designer' or 'design team') in consultation with the 'client'. They outline the deliverables and scope of the project including any products or works (function and aesthetics), timing and budget. They can be used for many projects including those in the fields of architecture, interior design and industrial design. Design briefs are also used to evaluate the effectiveness of a design after it has been produced and during the creation process to keep the project on track and on budget. Some firms rely on them more than others but there is a move towards greater accountability in the design process and thus many people find them most useful. They usually change over time and are adjusted as the project scope evolves. Often they are 'signed off' by the client and designer at set stages in the project.

A design brief may use the following layout:
# Title page
# Table of #* Past Accomplishments
# [[Problem Statement]]
#* Problem Description
#* Constraints
#* [[Budget]]
#* Time
#* Needs of the Problem
# [[Goal]]s
#* What you plan to accomplish
#** Due dates
# Solution Analysis
#* [[Risks]]/[[Economics|Benefits]]
#* Planned Solutions
#* [[Sketch (drawing)|Sketches]]
# Synopsis
#* Evaluation
#* Conclusion/Summary

==Business activities==

===Insurance===
Living and working in [[Basra]] in what was then the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], Edward Fram was a key figure in the country's [[Insurance in Iraq|modern insurance industry]], as the owner of one of Iraq's first [[insurance]] agencies operating under the Insurance Companies Act No. 74 (1 April 1936). This was the first Iraqi law passed to specifically regulate the industry.&lt;ref name="almosul1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almosul.com/Heritage/History/IraqHistory/Begining_of_Insurance_Iraq.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Beginnings of Insurance and Regulation of Insurance Activity in Iraq - An Overview |author=Misbah Kamal |website=Almosul.com |accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, only 3 insurance companies were known to be operating in Iraq, under the Ottoman Commercial Law of 9 August 1904,&lt;ref name="almosul1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Batatu, The Old Social Classes and New Revolutionary Movements of Iraq, (London, al-Saqi

===Bonds and securities===
Fram was one of the first and main players in Basra's nascent [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and securities markets from the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Iraq Directory 1936, p. 139, p. 150, p. 152 and p. 194 (published by Dangoor Printing House under the supervision of the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior)&lt;/ref&gt; His name is the only one listed in the Basra bonds section within Iraq's sole pre-Baathist business directory, published by the Interior Ministry in 1936.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Other===
Fram was a major goods importer, exporter, makers' representative and also acted as the exclusive agent in Iraq for [[Selfridges]], amongst other western companies. During the Second World War, he provided housing for British troops as part of the development of Basra as a "large-scale base"&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Grand Alliance|author=Churchill, W.|date=1986|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=9780395410578|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVdux2KfenoC&amp;pg=PA404|page=404|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/LondonGazette/37685.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and traded scrap metal left by the British military after the war, as did other well-known merchants such as Naji Al-Khedhairi.&lt;ref name="iraqijews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqijews.org/commlead.html|publisher=iraqijews.org|title=Community Leaders|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fram also ran the Basra office of [[Iraq Tours]], the country's first travel agency, which had Iraqi Prime Minister [[Tawfiq al-Suwaydi]] as chairman, and which played a key role in [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]] alongside the Near East Transport Company and the Israeli national airline El Al.&lt;ref name="dailycaller"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/03/when-iraq-expelled-its-jews-to-israel-the-inside-story/|publisher=dailycaller.com|title=When Iraq Expelled Its Jews To Israel: The Inside Story &amp;#124; The Daily Caller|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948-1951|author=Gat, M.|date=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781135246549|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_r3_-9ZU1YC&amp;pg=PA97|page=97|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Modern Israel: 1948-1967|author=Stein, L.|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780745636238|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWkYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death== 
Edward Fram died aged 50 in a car accident, a short distance from his hometown of Basra, on his return from a visit to the [[Hanna-Sheikh]] family's [[Abu Al-Khaseeb]] retreat. A member of the Al-Sa'adoon family with whom he was travelling also died in the crash, along with the chauffeur.

Defender of the free and open access to scientific content,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomedcentral.com/openaccess/archive/?page=features&amp;issue=17 Lobbying for Open Access legislation]&lt;/ref&gt; he chaired the Civil Society Scientific Information Working Group, and co-ordinated a group on patents, trademarks and copyrights at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8194812893544942709# Dr. Francis Muguet's speech at Geneva]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=301222277851752196# Dr. Francis Muguet's speech at Tunis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muguet is also known for designing the pattern of global patronage which aims to answer the legal argument raised against the global license under the Berne Convention on copyright. The sponsorship was supported by his friend [[Richard Stallman]] who co-authored with him the Declaration of Louisiana at a workshop organized by the French Society of the Internet on March 12, 2009. Muguet was then one of the founders of the SARD, a Society of acceptance and distribution of gifts inspired by the principles of global patronage.
His daughter found him on October 14, dead after not answering his mail for several days.
Following the announcement of his death, a change was made in the process of printing the book ''La bataille Hadopi'', to which he had contributed, dedicating it to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  Francis Muguet est mort |author= Mathieu Pasquini |date= October 17, 2009 |work= In Libro Veritas Bibliotheca |url= http://www.ilv-bibliotheca.net/blog/index.php?post/2009/10/17/Francis-Muguet-est-mort |accessdate= July 10, 2011 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= La bataille Hadopi |publisher= In libro veritas |year= 2009 |isbn= 978-2-35922-016-2 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muguet was active in the World Network for Linguistic Diversity and point of contact for the Dynamic Coalition for Linguistic Diversity of the [[Internet Governance Forum]] and a member of [[ICVolunteers]]. From 2001 to 2005, he was Associate Editor MDPI Center Basel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3307">'''Günter Herlitz''' (February 9, 1913 – September 11, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, September 14th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;) was born in [[Berlin]] as the son of [[:de:Carl Herlitz|Carl Herlitz]], founder of the [[Herlitz|Herlitz stationery company]].

==Biography==
Following the founding of the company by his father in 1904, Günter Herlitz took over the business in 1935. He expanded the company from Berlin into [[Province of Brandenburg|Mark Brandenburg]] and already counted six employees to help with the business. When he was conscripted for military service during the Second World War, Günter Herlitz’s mother took on the running of the business.

During the Second World War, the business premises were destroyed by bombs several times, and thus Günter Herlitz resumed business operations in 1945, following completion of his military service, in a basement in the Berlin district of [[Moabit]]. Initially selling bargains of all kinds, the Herlitz company was the only one of around 20 Berlin wholesalers to succeed in securing a minimal amount of goods during the [[Berlin Blockade]]. When the blockade ended, the company extended its product range considerably. As one of the most important wholesale firms nationwide, Herlitz was able to employ 50 people by 1950.

Due to the political situation in Germany at the time, it became increasingly difficult for the company to get its goods from West Germany to Berlin. As a result, Günter Herlitz decided to manufacture his own stationery. The company began with the production of exercise books, drawing pads and index cards. In 1955, the company was already processing 60 tons of paper each month. Even though the political situation at the time initially prevented Herlitz from supplying customers outside [[West Berlin]], the company was able to boast an annual turnover circa 1.1 million Euro.

Initial attempts to sell the products on the West German market were unsuccessful; however, in 1960, the breakthrough came about with notebooks and drawing pads with illustrated covers, which was an absolute novelty at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Der Tagessiegel, October 27th, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, from 1960 to 1994, the company was able to double its turnover each year. This meant an increase in annual turnover from 2 million Euros in 1960 to 885 million Euros in 1994.

In 1996, Günter Herlitz was honoured for his life’s work at the company’s general meeting and resigned from the board of management. He became the company’s honorary chairman. From then on, he never attended another general meeting of the company.

To this day, the company headquarters are located in Berlin.

After the death of Günter Herlitz in September 2010, his family continues his social commitment and is amongst the most active families in Berlin. In 2003 his son, [[Klaus and Eva Herlitz|Dr Klaus Herlitz]] and his wife founded the [[Buddy Bear Help]] children's charities organization.

This is a list of articles about [[terms of service]] and [[privacy policies]]. These are also called terms of use, and are rules one must agree to, in order to use a service. The articles fall in two main categories: descriptions of terms used for specific companies or products, and descriptions of different kinds of terms in general. Articles on companies vary widely in the amount of detail they give on terms of service. Annotations show what is available in the article on each company, and need to be updated as those articles are improved.

Terms of service are regularly the subject of news articles throughout the English-language press, such as in the US,&lt;ref name="ny14"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/upshot/one-third-of-top-websites-restrict-customers-right-to-sue.html |title=One-Third of Top Websites Restrict Customers' Right to Sue |last=Merrill |first=Jeremy B. |date=23 October 2014 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny17"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html |title=How Uber Deceives the Authorities Worldwide |last=Isaac |first=Mike |date=3 March 2017 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ti12"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://business.time.com/2012/08/28/7-surprising-things-lurking-in-online-terms-of-service-agreements/ |title=7 Surprising Things Lurking in Online 'Terms of Service' Agreements |last=Luckerson |first=Victor |work=Time |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/story/zoe-quinn-crash-override-book-excerpt/ |title=Book Excerpt: Zoë Quinn on the Problem of Terms of Service |last=Quinn |first=Zoe |date=9 September 2017 |work=WIRED |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK,&lt;ref name="gu17"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/03/terms-of-service-online-contracts-fine-print |title=Click to agree with what?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1525">The '''Industrial Production Index''' (IPI) is an [[economic indicator]] published by the Federal Reserve Board of the United States that measures the real production output of manufacturing, mining, and utilities. Production indexes are computed mainly as [[fisher index]]es with the weights based on annual estimates of value added. Since Fisher indexes only preserve growth information, the value in the base year (currently 2012) is arbitrarily set at 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization - G.17|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/ip_notes.htm|work=Federal Reserve Bulletin|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial Production Index|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/INDPRO/|work=FRED Database|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This index, along with other industrial indexes and construction, accounts for the bulk of the variation in national output over the duration of the business cycle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6330">'''Cornelis ("Kees") Bruynzeel''' (February 19, 1900 in [[Rotterdam]] &amp;ndash; 1980) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[businessman]], [[timber]] [[merchant]] and [[yachtsman]].

==Early years==
Bruynzeel was the son of Cornelis Bruynzeel Sr., who founded a timber factory in 1897, and Antoinette Lels. He studied in [[The Hague]], and took several trips to the United States and Sweden to study progress in automatization and wood manufacturing. In 1920 he became manager of the family's new door factory in [[Zaandam]]. In 1922 he married Titia Verkade, granddaughter of the industrialist [[Ericus Verkade|Ericus Gerhardus Verkade]].

Bruynzeel Jr. was an avid sailor. He won the [[Fastnet race]] for the [[Netherlands]] in 1937 with his [[Sparkman &amp; Stephens|Stephens-designed]] [[yawl]] ''Zeearend'' ("sea eagle", the eagle being the logo of the Bruynzeel company). The Dutch designer [[Piet Zwart]] worked closely with Bruynzeel's father and his brother Willem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisg.nl/ondernemers/pdf/pers-0266-02.pdf|title=Biography: Willem Bruynzeel|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he designed their first kitchens) and was involved with the design of the Zeearend as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.nl/foto.php?pageID=157 |title=Piet Zwart, een veelzijdig avant-gardistisch vormgever |language=Dutch }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry Pioneer==
In 1939, when the production had expanded to include floors and kitchens and the threat of [[World War II]] was causing a decline in the building industry, he considered alternatives and pioneered the development of new timber materials for the production of the Bruynzeel kitchen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nai.nl/e/collection/news/2004/0405_bruynzeel_e.html |title=Model by Bruynzeel: Design your own kitchen |publisher=Netherlands Architecture Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724120633/http://www.nai.nl/e/collection/news/2004/0405_bruynzeel_e.html |archivedate=2006-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for boat construction. Using a newly developed water-resistant synthetic resin glue, Bruynzeel developed a durable three-ply wood, similar to [[plywood]], for the fabrication of external doors. Bruynzeel went on to extend the concept of the modular kitchen and with [[E.G. van de Stadt]] developed the first industrialised boat construction system in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valkenklasse.nl/nieuws/newsarch.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426210812/http://www.valkenklasse.nl/nieuws/newsarch.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-04-26 |title=Valkenklasse |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Bruynzeel Multipanel Int. B.V., as it was later renamed, is a leading timber company that specialises in [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[construction]] timber, with distribution throughout [[Europe]], [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], amongst others. The Bruynzeel name also lives on as a [[shelf (storage)|shelving]] brand of the Norwegian [[Constructor Group AS|Constructor Group]].

==South Africa==
In 1956 Kees Bruynzeel Jr. moved to [[South Africa]], where he owned and operated a company [[Bruply Doors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icpcredit.com/ReportRequest.asp?sCompanyID=306988|title=Bruply Doors (Pty) Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a factory at [[Stellenbosch]]. Bruynzeel's South African timber operations now comprise [[PG Bison]] and are controlled by Steinhoff Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steinhoffinternational.com/asp/africa_operations.asp|title=PG Bison and Steinhoff Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Bruynzeel built a house in [[Stellenbosch]], that was controversial considering the conservative architecture of the time. The roof of the house is shaped like a [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], and is constructed using [[teak]] [[rafter]]s and lined with [[Afrocarpus|yellowwood]]. It was [[design]]ed by [[architect]] [[Aart Bijl]].

==Sailing==
Bruynzeel continued sailing and winning races. In the 1937 Fastnet Race "Zeearend" was winner overall.
In the  Fastnet 1951 Race, "Zeevalk" wasklasse winner and 2. overall.
"Stormvogel" was first to finish in the 61 Fastnet, the 62 Buenos Aires-Rio race, the 64 Burmuda race, the Sydney-Hobart, the China Sea, and the 1967 Trans-Pacific Race (Los Angeles-to-Hawaii [[Transpacific Yacht Race|Transpac]] race with the boat ''Stormvogel'' ("Stormbird" or the ''[[Procellariidae|Shearwater]]''), after coming in a close second in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transpacificyc.org/history/tp03-lists.html |title=The Transpac Race at www.transpacificyc.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504022510/http://www.transpacificyc.org/history/tp03-lists.html |archivedate=2006-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, aged 72, Bruynzeel took both line and overall handicap honours in the [[Cape to Rio Yacht Race]] in his boat ''Stormy'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rorc.org/admiralscup/history/1957/default.html|title=Excerpt from ''The Admiral's Cup'' by Bob Fisher|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427205526/http://www.rorc.org/admiralscup/history/1957/default.html|archivedate=2006-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his progress was followed with keen interest, since he had suffered three [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s in the previous year.

'''Kim Woo-Choong''' (born December 19, 1936) was the founder and chairman of the [[Daewoo|Daewoo Group]] (대우). Born in [[Daegu]], he was the son of the provincial governor.

He was a [[paperboy|newspaper delivery boy]] when he was a youngster, helping a family that depended almost solely on him during a brief period. He graduated from the prestigious [[Kyunggi High School]], then finished with an Economics Degree at [[Yonsei University]] in [[Seoul]]. His father was the teacher or mentor of Former President, [[Park Chung Hee]], who in turn supported Kim to a great degree both financially and business-wise.

After graduating from Yonsei, he entered into a small trading corporation, later specialising in textiles and clothing. He broke off and created Daewoo Industries with 5 people as his associates. Using his connections in both alumni of the Yonsei and political backing, he managed to do well, and consecutively bought many different companies. It would not be wrong to say that Daewoo Group was originally built on companies that were bought (most heavily in trouble). Kim was a magician in turning near-bankrupt companies into successive cash machines. With a company that had a history of 30 years, by the 90s, Daewoo Group was listed Number 2 on assets, Number 3 on revenues, an unbelievable achievement for anybody with knowledge of how the other Big 3 Korean companies, ([[Hyundai]], [[LG]], [[Samsung]]), made their mark.

But due to its rather hollow financial structure, even though it had the most Overseas Branch offices, when the [[Asian Financial Crisis]] came about, the unstable Daewoo Group plummeted. It had to sell off nearly 50 division corporations, only focusing on the major companies.

Kim was on the list for the [[Interpol]] when he was in exile, because of how he left Daewoo with the insurmountable debt, to his employees etc...

He was arrested soon after he returned to South Korea on June 14, 2005, and apologized "for hurting the nation and accepted full responsibility for the collapse of the group, adding he is ready to accept whatever the authorities have in store for him," according to the [[Chosun Ilbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200506/200506140028.html|title=Kim Woo-choong Must Prove He Is Sincere|date=2005-01-14|website=english.chosun.com|publisher=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050617021214/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200506/200506140028.html|archivedate=2005-06-17|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2006 he was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being found guilty of charges including embezzlement and accounting fraud. 21 trillion won ($22bn) of his fortune was seized and he was fined an additional 10m won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5028708.stm|title=Daewoo boss gets 10 years in jail|date=30 May 2006|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing health concerns, his sentence was reduced to 8 and 1/2 years; then on 30 December 2007, he was granted amnesty by President [[Roh Moo-hyun]]. South Korean presidents traditionally hand out pardons for the new year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-pardons-idUSSEO20431320071231|title=S.Korea pardons Daewoo founder, death-row inmates|last=Herskovitz|first=Jon|last2=Lee|first2=Jin-joo|date=2007-12-31|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luc Hoebeke''' (born 27 December 1941) is a [[Belgian]] consultant, author and lecturer in the field of self-organization, innovation processes and human activity systems, known for his book ''Making Work Systems Better: A Practitioner's Reflections'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Ten Bos, René. ''Fashion and utopia in management thinking''. Vol. 6. John Benjamins Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arora, Sant, and Sameer Kumar. "Reengineering: a focus on enterprise integration." ''Interfaces'' 30.5 (2000): 54-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Born in [[Kortrijk, Belgium]], Hoebeke received his [[Master of Science in Engineering]] in Electrical Engineering, Nuclear Physics and Management Science.&lt;ref name = "SV 2010"&gt;Gerrit Jan Schuiling, Johannes Gerardus Vermaak (eds.) ''Leren in organisaties: als leren het antwoord is, wat is dan de vraag?''. Kluwer, 2010. p 383&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been working as consultant, author and lecturer. He assisted the University of Amsterdam in the development of a curriculum for the new study of Information Management and new Media, and also assisted the University of Leiden similar developments. He has been lecturer at the Sioo, Dutch institute for management studies, and from 2002 to 2010 he has been lecturer at the [[University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business]].&lt;ref name = "SV 2010"/&gt;

Hoebeke has been active in the Metaphorum community and fora on the [[viable system model]] (VSM).

== Work ==
In his book ''Making Work Systems Better: A Practitioner's Reflections'' (1994) &lt;ref name="LH 1994"&gt;Luc Hoebeke, ''Making Work Systems Better: A Practitioner's Reflections'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0471942480}},1994&lt;/ref&gt; he developed a work system model based on the insights of [[Peter Checkland]] and [[Brian Wilson (systems scientist)|Brian Wilson]] in [[soft systems methodology]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela|Francisco Varela's]] development of [[autopoiesis theory]], and [[Anthony Stafford Beer|Stafford Beers']] development of the viable system model.

The notion of a work system is defined by Hoebeke as "... a purposeful definition of the real world in which people spend effort in more or less coherent activities for mutually influencing each other and their environment." &lt;ref name="LH 1994"/&gt;

In the work systems model Hoebeke describes the generic transformation processes, control information, audit information and development information for human activities using four overlapping time domains:&lt;ref name="LH 1994"/&gt;
# Added-value domain: This domain spans periods between 1 day and 2 years in which processes are characterized by throughput time, volume requirements, quality requirements and price requirements.
# Innovation domain: This domain spans periods between 1 and 10 years in which processes are characterized by desirability, feasibility, transferability and systemicity.
# Value-systems domain: This domain spans periods between 5 and 20 years in which processes are generative, tolerant, dialectical and congruent.
# Spiritual domain: This domain spans periods longer than 20 years, up to 50 years. The generic transformation process in this domain is: "To materialize through works of art or mere behaviour the universal understanding of one's own mortality".

The notion of a transformation process is central in Hoebeke's work. Hoebeke defined it as "... a basic purpose behind the work system and transforms a specified input into a specified output. The output must contain the input, which has been transformed during the process."{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The mentioned time domains (added-value, innovation, value-systems and spiritual) are overlapping. To handle this overlap Hoebeke uses the concept of ''process levels'', of which there are seven to span the time between 1 day and 50 years. Process level is defined as: {{Quote|A process of a higher order is one whose output creates conditions for one of a lower order. Processes can be differentiated in a hierarchy. To avoid confusion with what is seen in organisational terms as hierarchical levels we call this the process level.&lt;ref name="LH 1994"/&gt;}}

Hoebeke also defined the following concepts in terms not found in contemporary management literature:&lt;ref name="LH 1994"/&gt;
* Contributions of people
* Responsibility and accountability
* Clients, actors, owners (as stakeholders of the process)
* Environmental constraints and [[Weltanschauung]]
* The management process

To complete the models' dimensions Hoebeke defined three information processes:
* Strategic: All information processes that contribute to management, we call strategic information processes. These create, convey and develop meaning to all people involved in a work system.
* Control: Control information processes are those which lead to a corrective, regulative action by the people contributing to transformation processes.
* Audit: Audit information processes are those that lead actors to a more profound understanding of why the process is carried out, what it does, with what means it is performed and how these means are used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5355">'''Marketing experimentation''' is a research method which can be defined as "the act of conducting such an investigation or test".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of "experiment" {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/experiment|website = www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is testing a market that is segmented to discover new opportunities for organisations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU3YfJDPUjE|title = Marketing Experiments: From the Basics to the Cutting Edge|date = 18 September 2012|accessdate = 31 October 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = Wharton Analytics|last = McDonnell|first = Elia}}&lt;/ref&gt; By controlling conditions in an experiment, organisations will record and make decisions based on [[consumer behaviour]]. '''Marketing experimentation''' is commonly used to find the best method for maximizing [[revenues]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.slideshare.net/nbairstow/marketing-research-design|title = Marketing Research Design|date = 8 July 2008|accessdate = 29 October 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/experiment.html|title = What is experiment? Definition and meaning|date = |accessdate = 28 October 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; through the acquisition of new [[customer]]s. For example; two groups of customers are exposed to different advertising (test). How did consumers react to advertising compared to the other group? (measurable). Did the advertising increase sales for each group? (result).

== Characteristics&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = 2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3soKJGOcSM|title = 0:29 / 24:53 Unit 7: MR2300 - Marketing Research - Primary Research: Experiments|date = 7 November 2014|accessdate = 28 October 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = |last = Tilley|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
There are three characteristics which are the make-up of a market experimentation:
* '''Experimental subjects''' '''-''' Humans are usually participants in experiments. Subjects are divided into two or more groups and can be referred to as [[Focus Groups|focus groups]]. Subjects can be made up of a particular age group [[Demographic|(demographical)]], from a particular area [[Geographic information system|(geographical)]], or culture ([[Ethnography|ethnographic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/19346/1/Market_Experimentation_in_a_Dynamic_Differentiated-Goods_Duopoly.pdf|title = MARKET EXPERIMENTATION IN A DYNAMIC DIFFERENTIATED-GOODS DUOPOLY|date = July 1999|accessdate = 23 October 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Keller|first = Godfrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conditions -'''  Known as the independent variable where, conditions are tightly controlled and manipulated by the tester.
* '''Effects -''' Are the results of the test known as the dependent variable. Results are measured and cannot be changed. If the tester wants to see different results they would have to change the conditions of the independent variable to measure the effects.
To gain an accurate result from experiments, the experimenter must consider outside factors that could effect the dependent variable. Continuing from the advertising example above; did sales increase because of a festive seasons at that particular time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applied application ==

In marketing email marketing is popular&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; it is more targeted and there are many testable features such as font, colour and pictures. By tailoring emails it gives the experimenter control over conditions. For example; promoting discounts to '''experimental subjects''' via email.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.slideshare.net/nbairstow/marketing-research-design|title = Marketing Research Design|date = 8 July 2011|accessdate = 29 October 2015|website = Slide Share|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is here the experimenter has control and sets '''conditions''' by sending one tailored email to one age group (subject A). The experimenter will send another tailored email to an older age group (subject B) offering the same promotion with a different presentation. The experiment so far is exposing group A and B to different advertising messages.

There are many measurable outcomes, a few are as follows:
* How much time is spent on the site from the URL link in an email
* Better measurement in purchase process than other mediums - Subject A and B using promotion codes from the email
* Users unsubscribing
Comparing the '''effects''' the experiment had on subject A and subject B will give the organisation more of an understanding of how these subjects have reacted when they received the email (if there was one) and their purchasing behaviour. The experimenter may wish to change the '''conditions''' of the test to measure the different outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marketingexperiments.com/methodology-marketingexperiments.html|title = Methodology {{!}} Marketing Experiments|date = |accessdate = 30 October 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marvin Bower''' (August 1, 1903 – January 22, 2003) was an American business theorist and management consultant.

== Biography ==
Bower was the son of the deputy recorder at [[Cuyahoga County]], and grew up in the [[Collinwood]] neighborhood of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and attended [[Glenville High School]].  He earned his bachelor's degree in Economics and Psychology from [[Brown University]] in 1925.  His father advised him to study law, and Bower graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1928.  Bower then attended [[Harvard Business School]], graduating in 1930.  Following completion of his studies, Bower worked as an associate at [[Jones Day|Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue]] in Cleveland.

In 1933, Bower was hired by [[James O. McKinsey]] in the new [[Chicago]] firm of James O. McKinsey &amp; Company to manage a newly acquired branch in [[New York City|New York]]. Following McKinsey's death in 1937, the two offices split up and Bower resurrected the New York firm, with the assistance of New York partners, as [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] in 1939. He served as managing director from 1950 to 1967, and remained a leadership figure at McKinsey as director and partner until 1992.

According to the [[Harvard Business School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvin Bower|url=http://www.hbs.edu/leadership/database/leaders/marvin_bower.html|publisher=Harvard Business School|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bower "is considered the father of modern [[management consulting]]." His principled insistence on impeccable professional standards in substance, ethics, and style; his dedication to the professional development of his colleagues; and his candor, all served as a role model for several generations of management consultants, both within and outside McKinsey.

Bower performed one act in the history of McKinsey &amp; Company that permanently set him and McKinsey apart from its competitors. In an era when other consultants were taking themselves public or selling out to larger companies, he sold his own shares back to the firm at book value when he turned 60, which he could easily have done at some huge multiple of earnings.

Bower's decision came as a surprise to many, including his own family. "Let me just say there was a shock on people's faces when he told us that he was selling his shares back to McKinsey at book value," said his son Dick Bower. "It felt unbelievable, to tell you the truth.  But that was Marvin for you."&lt;ref&gt;Duff McDonald. ''The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and Its Secret Influence on American Business.'' 2014. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
He published several books and articles, among them:
* ''The Will to Manage: Corporate Success Through Programmed Management'' (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1966), {{ISBN|0-07-006735-X}}
* ''The Will to Lead: Running a Business With a Network of Leaders'' (Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Mass., 1997), {{ISBN|0-87584-758-7}}
* ''Perspective on McKinsey'' - internal McKinsey publication

Option was the worldwide market leader in the wireless broadband [[Niche market|niche]] (other market contestants are either significantly smaller, or don’t consider wireless broadband a [[core business]] – for example [[NEC Corporation]]), and could benefit from high margins across the whole product range. Intentions from a new [[Intel]]-[[Nokia]] partnership which would deteriorate Option's market share were short-lived and quickly dropped,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111836437403956044?mod=technology_main_whats_news Nokia, Intel Plan to Collaborate On Wireless Technology WiMAX]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unstrung.com/document.asp?doc_id=105059 Intel/Nokia Deal Gets Mixed Reactions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="six"&gt;[http://www.computerwire.com/industries/research/?pid=95B66072-C21B-4200-816A-E38141A28F76 Datamonitor ComputerWire - Nokia-Intel 3G Deal Threatens Wireless Modem Makers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boursorama.com/forum/message.phtml?file=356524043&amp;pageForum=1 Dutch press coverage at 3GSM Barcelona, quoting an Intel spokesman]&lt;/ref&gt; proving Option's leadership as well as high entry-to-market barriers even for large corporations. Most production took place at [[Jabil]] in [[Bergamo]], Italy, while [[Celestica]] in Kladno, [[Czech Republic]], provides additional capacity.  Nowadays, all manufacturing of devices is done in [[Wuxi]] ([[China]]). The products were marked as having been designed in Leuven, but actually are refurbished and labelled in Ireland.

== Financials ==

Initial market panic stemming from the announced Intel-Nokia deal did cause Option's share price to drop significantly in 2006, losing more than 23% in one day on September 28, which lies, together with the severe Chinese competition, at the basis of the downfall of the company .&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

== Customers ==

Option's revenues substantially declined last years. In the past, Option had the following customers in their portfolio [[Sharp Corporation]], [[Wataniya Telecom]], [[Fujitsu Siemens Computers|Fujitsu Siemens]], [[T-Mobile]], [[Cingular]] Wireless (now AT&amp;T), [[Vodafone]], [[Orange SA|Orange]], [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel]], [[Telstra]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Uniwill]], [[Samsung Electronics]] and [[Telenor]], to name but a few.

'''Policy alienation''' refers to a framework which examines the experiences of governmental employees with new policies they have to implement. It has been used to describe the experiences of front-line public professionals with new policies. It is defined "as a general cognitive state of psychological disconnection from the policy programme being implemented."

==Introduction==
A number of examples can clarify the concept of policy alienation. For example, Bottery (1998:40),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bottery|first=M.|title=Professionals and policy: Management strategy in a competitive world|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-304-70157-2|url=https://www.amazon.com/Professionals-Policy-Management-Competitive-Education/dp/0304701572}}&lt;/ref&gt; examining the pressures on professionals stemming from new policies in education and [[health care]] in Great Britain, cites a teacher arguing that: “The changes have been outrageous, and have produced a culture of meritocracy and high flyers. There’s massive paperwork because the politicians don’t believe teachers are to be trusted.” This indicates that professionals had difficulties identifying with the policies they had to implement. A second example refers to the introduction of a new reimbursement policy in mental healthcare in the Netherlands. In one large-scale survey, as many as nine out of ten professionals wanted to abandon this new policy (Palm et al., 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palm, I., Leffers, F., Emons, T., Van Egmond, V., &amp; Zeegers, S.|title=De GGz ontwricht: Een praktijkonderzoek naar de gevolgen van het nieuwe zorgstelsel in de geestelijke gezondheidszorg|year=2008|publisher=SP|location=The Hague|url=http://www.sp.nl/service/rapport/081025GGZ_ontwricht.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists even went as far as to openly demonstrate on the street against this policy. A major reason for this was that many could not align their professional values with the content of the policy. As one professional noted:

''"Within the new healthcare system economic values are dominant. Too little attention is being paid to the content: professionals helping patients. The result is that professionals become more aware of the costs and revenues of their behavior. This comes at the expense of acting according to professional standards.”''{{Attribution needed|date=June 2012}}

Overall, a number of studies show an increasing discontent among public professionals toward public policies (see also Hebson et al., 2003; White, 1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hebson, G., Grimshaw, D., &amp; Marchington, M.|title=PPPs and the changing public sector ethos: Case-study evidence from the health and local authority sectors|journal=Work Employment and Society|year=2003|volume=17|issue=3|pages=481–501|doi=10.1177/09500170030173005|url=http://wes.sagepub.com/content/17/3/481.short|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White, D.|title=A balancing act: Mental health policy-making in Quebec|journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry|year=1996|volume=19|issue=4|pages=289–307|pmid=8968814|doi=10.1016/s0160-2527(96)80005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; although more positive experiences can also be found (Ruiter, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiter, A. E. P.|title=Implementatie van het structureel echoscopisch onderzoek: Samenwerking en kwaliteitsdenken|year=2007|publisher=University of Twente|location=Twemte|url=http://essay.utwente.nl/58027/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy alienation framework was developed to better understand the experiences of front-line public professionals with new policies.

==Effects of policy alienation==
Currently, there is an intense debate concerning professionals in the public sector. Many of the pressures that professionals face are related to the difficulties they have with the policies they have to implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Duyvendak, W. G. J., Knijn, T., &amp; Kremer, M.|title=Policy, people, and the new professional. de-professionalisation and re-professionalisation in care and welfare|year=2006|publisher=[[Amsterdam University Press]]|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-5356-885-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When implementers are unable to identify with a policy, this can negatively influence policy effectiveness. Furthermore, a high degree of policy alienation can  affect the quality of interactions between professionals and citizens, which may eventually influence the output legitimacy of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Bekkers, V. J. J. M., Edwards, A., Fenger, M., &amp; Dijkstra, G.|title=Governance and the Democratic Deficit, assessing the legitimacy of governance practices|year=2007|publisher=Aldershot|location=Ashgate|isbn=0-7546-4983-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy alienation framework is used to analyze this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tummers|first=L.G. |author2=Bekkers, V.J.J.M. |author3=Steijn, A.J.|title=Policy alienation of public professionals: Application in a new public management context|journal=Public Management Review|year=2009|volume=11|issue=5|pages=685–706|doi=10.1080/14719030902798230|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14719030902798230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been shown that policy alienation increases resistance to a new policy, lowers behavioral support for the policy and decreases job satisfaction of public professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tummers, L.G.|title=Policy alienation - Analyzing the experiences of public professionals with new policies|year=2012|publisher=Erasmus University Rotterdam|location=Rotterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, it has both influences on the individual professional, as well as on  policy effectiveness.

== Conceptualization ==
Alienation broadly refers to a sense of social estrangement, an absence of social support or meaningful social connection. Sociologists, [[public administration]] scholars, and other social scientists have used the alienation concept in various studies. As a result, a number of meanings have been attributed to the term.&lt;ref name=Kanungo&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanungo|first=R.|title=Work alienation: an integrative approach|year=1982|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-03-060241-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to provide clarity, Seeman broke these meanings down into [[Social alienation|five alienation dimensions]]: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, social isolation, and self-estrangement.

Many scholars have used these dimensions to devise operational measures for alienation so that they can examine the concept in a range of settings. Mau, for example, used four dimensions in examining student alienation. Rayce et al., when investigating adolescent alienation, used three of the five dimensions. Further, many other researchers have used Seeman’s classification in examining the concept of work alienation. [[Bob Blauner|Blauner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blauner, R.|title=Alienation and freedom|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; devised operational measures for three of the dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, and social isolation.

The policy alienation framework was conceptualized based on the works of sociologists such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], Seeman, and Blauner.  Furthermore, works of public administration scholars were used, particularly on [[Michael Lipsky|Lipsky]] (street-level bureaucracy). Like work alienation, policy alienation is multidimensional, consisting of policy powerlessness and policy meaninglessness dimensions. In the work alienation literature, the dimensions of powerlessness and meaninglessness are also considered very important.&lt;ref name=Kanungo /&gt;

In essence, powerlessness is a person's lack of control over events in their life. In the realm of policy formulation and implementation, policy powerlessness relates to the degree of influence public professionals have over shaping a policy program. Powerlessness can occur when a new policy is drafted without the help of the professionals, by for example not consulting their professionals associations or labor unions. Furthermore, on an operational level professionals can feel powerless when they have to adhere to tight procedures and rules when implementing a policy (see also [[Michael Lipsky|Lipsky]]). This kind of powerlessness may be particularly pronounced in professionals whose expectations of discretion and autonomy contradict notions of bureaucratic control (see also [[Profession]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidson, E.|title=Professionalism: The third logic|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-226-26203-0|url=https://www.amazon.com/Professionalism-Third-Logic-Practice-Knowledge/dp/0226262030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second dimension of policy alienation is meaninglessness. In the realm of policy making and implementation, policy meaninglessness refers to a professional’s perception of the contribution that the policy makes to a greater purpose, most notably to society or to their own clients. For instance, a professional can feel that implementing a policy is meaningless, if it does not deliver any apparent beneficial outcomes for society, such as more safety on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Thiel, S., &amp; Leeuw, F. L.|title=The performance paradox in the public sector|journal=Public Performance and Management Review|year=2002|volume=25|issue=3|pages=267–281|doi=10.2307/3381236|url=http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/1577/BSK074.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the dimensions more specific, five sub-dimensions were identified: strategic, tactical and operational powerlessness, societal and client meaninglessness. This is shown in the table below.

'''Five sub-dimensions of policy alienation'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Sub-dimension !! Definition !! Example of high scores
|-
| Strategic powerlessness || The perceived influence of the professionals on decisions concerning the content of the policy, as is captured in rules and regulations || A professional feeling that the policy is drafted without the help of implementing professionals or professional associations.
|-
| Tactical powerlessness || The professionals’ perceived influence on decisions concerning the way policy is implemented within their own organization. || Professionals stating that the managers in the organization did not consult them or their colleagues when designing the implementation process for the policy.
|-
| Operational powerlessness || The perceived degree of freedom in making choices concerning the sort, quantity and quality of sanctions and rewards on offer when implementing the policy. || Answering ‘fully agree’ to a survey question on whether the professional feels that their autonomy during the implementation process was lower than it should be.
|-
| Societal meaninglessness || The perception of professionals concerning the added value of the policy to socially relevant goals. || Stating in an interview that “I agree with the policy goal of enhancing transparency, but I do not see how this policy helps in achieving this goal.”
|-
| Client meaninglessness || The professionals’ perceptions of the added value of their implementing a policy for their own clients. || A professional who argues that a particular policy seriously impinges on their clients’ privacy.

'''Santika Indonesia Hotels &amp; Resorts''' is one of the largest [[hotel]] chains in [[Indonesia]] and managed under PT. Grahawita Santika, a member of [[Kompas Gramedia]] Group. PT. Grahawita Santika was established on August 22, 1981 and has over 40 hotels across Indonesia. Since 2006, PT. Grahawita Santika has changed its strategy based on market segmentation and divided its brands into The Royal Collection, Hotel Santika Premiere, Hotel Santika, and Amaris Hotel.

==History==
PT. Grahawita Santika was established to manage the hospitality industry under [[Kompas Gramedia]] Group on August 22, 1981. Hotel Soeti was the first hotel purchased from its owner, Soetiyah Pudjosuwarno. This hotel is on Jalan Sumatra No. 52-54, Bandung. In 1988, this simple hotel with 33 rooms built in an area of 3,250 square meters was renovated into 70 rooms. Once the renovation was completed, this hotel was inaugurated as the 3-star Hotel Santika Bandung by the Minister of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications, Susilo Sudarman on March 27, 1989. Hotel Santika Bandung was the forerunner to the establishment of Santika Indonesia Hotels &amp; Resorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=History (Translated) | url=http://www.kompasgramedia.com/aboutkg/history | publisher=Kompas Gramedia Group | accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background of the establishment of Hotel Santika, because ''[[Kompas]]'' daily newspaper was suppressed in 1978, therefore the pioneers of [[Kompas Gramedia]] Group should think about the business diversification outside its core business as a communication media. They made the plan in order to prevent mass layoffs. If the ''Kompas'' daily newspaper will be suppressed again, there are subsidiaries, which can sustain their employees. Several businesses began to implement, including the [[hospitality industry]].

At the beginning, the proposal for establishing a hotel was not approved because at that time, hotel business was considered a negative connotation and the [[Rate of return|Return on Investment]] was progressing slowly. However, Binawarman Sardjan, who was a member on the investment team of [[Kompas Gramedia]] Group at that time, could convince the Chairman of the investment team of [[Kompas Gramedia]] Group, Indra Gunawan, to approve the proposal. Because of the persistence and hard work of Binawarman Sardjan, Hotel Santika could be established.

Several years after the first Santika Hotel was inaugurated, Santika Indonesia Hotels &amp; Resorts can develop itself and reach about 40 properties across Indonesia. In accordance with its brand value, "Indonesian Home" and the service motto, "Hospitality from the Heart", Santika Indonesia Hotels &amp; Resorts always emphasize the value of Indonesian culture, including the hospitality to all guests.&lt;ref name=corpinfo&gt;{{cite web | title=History | url=http://www.santika.com/santika.php?gmid=1 | publisher=Santika Indonesia Hotels &amp; Resorts | accessdate=2012-05-07 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506231030/http://santika.com//santika.php?gmid=1 | archivedate=2012-05-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the business activities of the [[House of Saud|Al Saud]] family, Saud bin Nayef argued "You have to understand one simple fact.

'''Sergey Yurievich Kuznetsov''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Сергей Юрьевич Кузнецов}}; born 14 June 1966) is a contemporary Russian writer, journalist and entrepreneur.

==Early life==
Kuznetsov was born in [[Moscow]] to Galina Kuznetsova, a French language and [[French literature]] teacher, and Yuri Kuznetsov, a well-known Soviet chemist. In 1988, Kuznetsov graduated from [[Moscow State University]]'s Department of Chemistry.

==Career==

===Literary career===
Throughout his early literary career, he focused on modern philology; his works included a monograph on [[Joseph Brodsky]]'s poetics as well as translations of [[Stephen King]] and [[Susan Sontag]]. He also studied the works of [[Thomas Pynchon]].

Kuznetsov's first published work was ''The Nineties: A Fairy Tale'', a detective trilogy. His first work to receive critical acclaim was ''PG-21'', a futuristic novel written together with [[Linor Goralik]] and nominated for the National Bestseller award.

Other books by Kuznetsov were also favored by the critics and were nominated for various literature awards. His [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] work ''Alive and Adult'' was awarded Best Book in Mystics &amp; Horror of 2011 by [[Mir Fantastiki|World of SciFi (Mir Fantastiki) magazine]]; his novel ''Round-Dance of Water'' was shortlisted for ''Big Book'' (''Bolshaya Kniga''), a prominent Russian literary award.

Kuznetsov's books have been translated into many languages. ''Round-Dance of Water'', for instance, was published in Arabic, and several chapters from the book were published independently in the ''Moscow Noir'' anthology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/moscow-noir/|title=Moscow Noir (Russia)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Butterfly Skin''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://titanbooks.com/butterfly-skin-7346/|title=Titan Books - Butterfly Skin - Sergey Kuznetsov,  Andrew Bromfield|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was translated into English, German, Polish, Hungarian, Czech and Dutch. The publishers called it a Russian take on [[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|''Silence of the Lambs'']], but critics pointed out that Kuznetsov "aims for more than smug nihilism. He delivers a gratifying conclusion to a sometimes overburdened and sickening journey through sadism and alienation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/tawni-odells-one-of-us-and-more.html|title=Killer Company|date=26 October 2014|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most recent novel, "Kaleidoscope", received praise from both readers and critics. Lisa Hayden, a recognized literary translator, wrote: ‘What I enjoy is reading about upheaval and how it affects and even connects characters that pop in and out of the chapters like pieces in a kaleidoscope" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catranslation.org/blog-post/lisa-hayden-on-russian-book-prizes/|title=Q&amp;A: Lisa Hayden on the 2016 Russian Book Prizes|date=16 February 2017|work=Center for the Art of Translation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Member of [[PEN Club]] and Russian Union of Cinematographers.

===Journalism===
In 1996 he started to write articles on pop culture for various magazines and online media. After returning from Stanford to Russia in 2002, Kuznetsov continued to work in journalism.

'''Sosthenes Behn''' (January 30, 1884 – June 6, 1957) was an American businessman widely known for founding [[ITT Corporation|ITT]]. He held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Sosthenes Behn was born in the island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], then part of the [[Danish West Indies]]. His ancestry was [[Danes|Danish]] on his paternal side, and [[French people|French]] on his maternal side.

Behn served in the [[United States Army]] and was commissioned a Captain, Signal Corps, on June 19, 1917. He later achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, having served with distinction during World War I. Behn served with the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France until February 1919. He was given command of the 232nd Field Signal Battalion, [[Château-Thierry]], [[Saint-Mihiel]], Argonne. In recognition of his meritorious service during the war he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] (DSM).

===Puerto Rico Telephone Company and ITT===
After his return from military service, Colonel Behn co-founded the [[Puerto Rico Telephone Company]] which eventually spawned ITT&lt;ref&gt;Morales Cortés, Ramón. [http://www.vii.org/papers/puer.htm Telecommunications in Puerto Rico] (paper). New York, USA: ''Virtual Institute of Information''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under his direction ITT was granted the [[monopoly]] of telephone service in [[Spain]] ([[Telefónica|Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España]]) in 1924,&lt;ref&gt;García-Algarra, Javier: [https://www.scribd.com/doc/53101811/The-American-Influence-in-Telefonica%E2%80%99s-Public-Relations-Strategyduring-the-20%E2%80%99s-and-30%E2%80%99s "The American influence in Telefónica's public relations strategy during the 20s and 30s"], IEEE HISTELCON 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and purchased the international division of [[Western Electric]].

According to Anthony Sampson's book  ''[[The Sovereign State of ITT]]'', one of the first American businessmen Hitler received after taking power in 1933 was Sosthenes Behn, then the CEO of ITT, and his German representative, Henry Mann. [[Antony C. Sutton]], in his book ''Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler'', makes the claim that ITT subsidiaries made cash payments to [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] leader [[Heinrich Himmler]].

ITT, through its subsidiary [[C. Lorenz AG]] of [[Berlin]], owned 25% of [[Focke-Wulf]], the German aircraft manufacturer, builder of some of the most successful [[Luftwaffe#Interwar period|Luftwaffe]] [[fighter aircraft]]. In addition, Sutton’s book uncovers that ITT owned Dr. Erich F. Huth GmbH (Signalbau Huth, Berlin), which made [[radio]] and [[radar]] parts that were used in equipment going to the [[Wehrmacht]].

Behn, along with his brother, [[Hernan Behn|Hernan]], built the ''Two Brothers Bridge'' &amp;mdash;''Puente Dos Hermanos'' in [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]&amp;mdash; in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. The bridge links the districts of [[Condado, Puerto Rico|Condado]] and [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico|Old San Juan]].

Colonel Behn and [[Ludwig Roselius]], founder of the company [[KAFFEE HAG]], owned 74% of German aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf after the company reconstitution in 1936. [[Barbara Goette]] referred to Colonel Behn as a huge global player.&lt;ref&gt;Leidig, Ludwig. Bombshell sbpra, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-62516-346-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sosthenes Behn met with Hitler on 3/8/1933 and in 1936 there was a high-level meeting in Berlin where it was proposed that Behn through ITT gain 50% of [[Focke-Wulf]] and oust [[Café HAG]] completely, but after Barbara Goette intervened with Hitler, Ludwig Roselius' life was spared and he became majority shareholder in Focke-Wulf with 46% and a massive capital injection occurred.&lt;ref&gt;The Office of Military Government US Zone in Post-War Germany 1946-1949, declassified per Executive Order 12958, Section 3.5 NND Project Number: NND 775057 by: NND Date: 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the war, all of ITT's German holdings were put under Nazi control. These included a minority share in airplane manufacturer Focke-Wulf, which ITT had acquired through its contacts with German financier [[Kurt Baron von Schröder]]. After the end of the war, the US authorities returned these assets to their rightful US owner.

Behn appointed [[Gerhard Westrick]] to the board of Focke-Wulf after the reconstitution in 1936. He was ITT's corporation chairman in Germany. After Pearl Harbour, at meetings with Baron Kurt von Schröder and Behn in Switzerland, Westrick nervously admitted he had run into a problem. Wilhelm Ohnesorge, the elderly minister in charge of post offices, who was one of the first fifty Nazi party members, was strongly opposed to ITT's German companies continuing to function under New York management in time of war. Behn told Westrick to use Schröder and the protection of the Gestapo against Ohnesorge. In return, Behn guaranteed that ITT would substantially increase its payments to the Gestapo through the Circle of Friends. A special board of trustees was set up by the Nazis to cooperate with Behn and his thirty thousand staff in Occupied Europe. Ohnesorge savagely fought these arrangements and tried to obtain the support of Himmler. However, Schröder had Himmler's ear, and so, of course did his close friend and associate Walter Schellenberg. Ohnesorge appealed directly to Hitler and condemned Westrick as an American sympathiser. However, Hitler realized the importance of ITT to the German economy and proved supportive of Behn.

In 1943, ITT became majority shareholder of Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH with 29% due to Ludwig Roselius' Kaffee HAG share falling to 27% after he died on May 15.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Pfliegensdörfer; Volker Bergmann; Willi Elmers; Manfred Fittkau; Michael Jung; Michael Wolf; Wolfgang Günther. Wellblech &amp; Windkanal. Arbeit und Geschäfte im Bremer Flugzeugbau von den Anfängen 1909 bis heute. Steintor, 1989, {{ISBN|3926028513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Behn died on 6 June 1957.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2175">'''''Wireless Valley''''' is a term that was coined by Professor [[Theodore Rappaport|Ted Rappaport]] in 1990 when he was a faculty member at [[Virginia Tech]], and was used to describe the [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]/[[Blacksburg, Virginia]] region and the potential of research to create spin-out companies. In 1990 he and his students founded [[TSR Technologies]], a company that made software-defined cellular and paging intercept and drive test equipment that was sold to Allen Telecom in 1993, and in 1995 Wireless Valley Communications, a company that pioneered the creation of computer-aided [[wireless network]] prediction and management software that was sold to [[Motorola]] in late 2005. This term was later used as nickname to describe several regional clusters of companies in the [[information technology]] sector, in analogy to [[California|California's]] [[Silicon Valley]]:

* One such cluster is located in northern [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} This also included a number of companies that saw themselves as belonging to the new information based [[Economics|economy]]. [[Ericsson]], the [[telecommunications]] supplier, has one of its main design centers in the Stockholm suburb of [[Kista]].
* [[Finland]] also has a high-tech area in [[Espoo]], sometimes called "Wireless Valley", based on [[Nokia]] and [[Nokia Siemens Networks]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} There is a secondary hub located in [[Oulu]] which is the base for other wireless specialist companies too.
* A third such cluster consists of the telecommunications formed in [[San Diego]],&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, John, “‘Wireless Valley’ Growing in San Diego Area,” New York Times, March 24. 1997, URL: https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE4D7133BF937A15750C0A961958260&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Qualcomm]]
