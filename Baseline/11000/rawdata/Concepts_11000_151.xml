      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17100">'''Agency''' (also referred to as '''free agency''' or '''moral agency'''), in [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint theology]], is "the privilege of choice which was introduced by God the Eternal Father to all of his spirit children in the premortal state".&lt;ref name="stapley"/&gt;  Mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where our choices are central to the [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] in Mormon teaching. "It was essential for their eternal progression that they be subjected to the influences of both good and evil".&lt;ref name="stapley" /&gt; Mormons believe that Lucifer presented an alternative plan, which resulted in a [[war in heaven]], with Lucifer being cast out of heaven and becoming Satan.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Abraham |abr|3|24|28}}; {{lds|Revelation|rev|12|7|9}}; {{lds|Isaiah|isa|14|12|15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons believe that all individuals have the ability to differentiate between good and evil&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|Moroni|moro|7|18|19}}; {{lds|Moroni|moro|8|9|10}}; {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|88|6|7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Satan and his followers are not able to tempt people beyond the point where they can resist.&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|1 Corinthians|1-cor|10|13}}; {{lds|Alma|alma|13|28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that mortals can be held accountable for their actions;&lt;ref name="Self-Accountability and Human Progress"/&gt; mortals will be judged by God based on a combination of one's faith and works (with salvation coming only through the power, mercy, and grace of Jesus Christ).&lt;ref name="Faith and Good Works"/&gt;

==Pre-Earth life==
{{See also|Pre-mortal existence#Latter Day Saints}}
A major difference between the beliefs of Latter-day Saints and many other Christians involves the belief of a life before mortality, referred to as the pre-earth life, pre-mortal life, or [[pre-existence]]. Latter-day Saints believe that before the earth was created, all mankind lived as spirit children of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Hebrews|heb|12|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, God nurtured, taught and provided means for their development. This preparation would allow them to later become the men and women of Earth, to be further educated and tested in the schoolhouse of mortality in order to return to God's presence and become like him. Thus, the pre-existent life is believed to have been a period of unknown length of progression, and schooling. Mormons believe that there came a time when we could not progress further without being born into a body and experiencing earthly life.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/01/the-choice-that-began-mortality |title= The Choice That Began Mortality |first= Jess L. |last= Christensen |date=January 2002 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mormon beliefs, God proposed a plan whereby further progression could take place, a [[plan of salvation]]. Because agency would allow all people to fall in sin, a savior was necessary to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for the sins of each person so that they could return to live with their Father in Heaven. [[Jesus]] volunteered to follow the plan as outlined, which preserved agency, accountability for action, and the necessary result that some of Heavenly Father's children would never to return to Heavenly Father as a consequence of sin. The second volunteer, [[Lucifer]], attempted to amend the plan by proposing that all mankind would return to Heavenly Father despite their sins—essentially defeating agency and the divine principle of accountability for action. God the Father chose the plan that he proposed with Jesus as the Savior. Lucifer and his followers rebelled against this plan and were eventually cast out of heaven. Lucifer became [[Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;Much of this is discussed in {{lds|Abraham|abr|3|22|28}}. Latter-day Saints also believe {{lds|Isaiah|isa|14|12|15}} refers to this incident.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreordination===
Mormons believe that another aspect of agency occurred during the pre-mortal life. Some of the spirit children of God exercised their agency and conformed to God's law and became "noble and great". This doctrine is called "[[Predestination|foreordination]]". God foreordained some of these spirits to particular stations in life in order to advance his plan to lead humanity back to his presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Abraham|abr|22|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons believe that these foreordinations were not unalterable decrees, but rather callings from God for man to perform specific missions in mortality. Even these who were foreordained for greatness could fall and transgress the laws of God. Therefore, mortality is simply a state wherein progression and testing is continued from what began in the pre-existence.

Mormon doctrine states that God's plan includes the foreordination of prophets and teachers who have gifts and callings among men to teach and re-teach correct principles so that agency can be used wisely.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Jeremiah|jer|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; God's plan includes the important role of parents to teach their children the path of righteousness and happiness,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Deuteronomy|deut|6|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the blessing of the holy scriptures to give a foundation of gospel knowledge, including the knowledge of the saving role of Jesus Christ and the importance of ordinances and covenants of the gospel.

==Earth life==
In essence, agency is the ability to make choices for oneself, as well as the ability to learn the difference between right and wrong and to make ethical and moral decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/study/topics/agency |title= Gospel Topics: Agency |work= lds.org |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David O. McKay]], a [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]], stated, "It is the purpose of the Lord that man become like him. In order for man to achieve this it was necessary for the Creator first to make him free."&lt;ref&gt;''Conference Report'', April 1950, 32. As quoted in {{citation|url=http://institute.lds.org/content/languages/english/Institute%20of%20Religion%20Materials/Student%20Manuals/Religion%20430-431,%20Doctrines%20of%20the%20Gospel%20Student%20Manual~eng.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514133833/http://institute.lds.org/content/languages/english/Institute%20of%20Religion%20Materials/Student%20Manuals/Religion%20430-431,%20Doctrines%20of%20the%20Gospel%20Student%20Manual~eng.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-05-14 |chapter=Chapter 11: The Agency of Man |title=Doctrines of the Gospel: Student Manual, Religion 430 and 431 |publisher=[[Institute of Religion|Institute]] program, [[Church Educational System]], LDS Church |edition=Second |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without agency, mortality would be useless. Men are ultimately responsible for their own destiny, through their faith and obedience to the commandments of God. "Free agency" therefore should not be interpreted to mean that actions are without consequences; "free"  means that it is a gift from God and consequences must necessarily come as a result of choices made. Free agency and accountability are complementary and cannot be separated.

This principle holds that it is wrong to deny someone of his or her free agency unless they have abused it to infringe against the agency of another, as it would bind a person from their own choices. Such offenses logically include crimes such as [[murder]], [[rape]] and [[slavery]]. Furthermore, a person who prevents an individual from doing what they have been commanded to do (e.g., force them to do something they believe is wrong) will be held responsible for any offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= James E. |last= Talmage |authorlink= James E. Talmage |origyear= 1899 |year= 1981 |title= [[Articles of Faith (Talmage)|Articles of Faith]] |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= Deseret Book |page= {{Page needed|date=February 2012}} |isbn= 0-87747-838-4 |oclc= 6708594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, church leaders often equated governments led by dictatorships as being under the influence and control of Satan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} For example, [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Ezra Taft Benson]] often spoke of the "evil" communist or socialist movements that threatened the free agency of mankind: "it is realized that communism is turning out to be the earthly image of the plan which Satan presented in the preexistence. The whole program of socialistic communism is essentially a war against God and the plan of salvation—the very plan which we fought to uphold during 'the war in heaven.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Ezra Taft |last= Benson |authorlink= Ezra Taft Benson |year= 1974 |chapter= The American Heritage of Freedom |title= God, Family, Country: Our Three Great Loyalties |location= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Deseret Book]] |page= 356 |oclc= 1130226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other 
leaders contradicted these statements, often pointing to the church's belief in the "[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/consecrate-law-of-consecration Law of Consecration]" which is a form of socialism practiced by early church members in which all property was held in common and distributed by church leaders based on the needs of each individual. The church is [http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/official-statement/political-neutrality officially politically neutral] and today church members around the world subscribe to a variety of political beliefs including communism and socialism.

Mormon doctrine teaches that many men and women since the beginning of mortal time have used their agency unwisely, limiting their own progress and their opportunity to receive light and knowledge. Beginning with [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], some have used their agency to inflict harm, abuse, tyranny, slavery, or death upon others, contrary to the will and commandments of God.

The fact that God allows these actions does not mean that He condones them. LDS doctrine holds that agency is an eternal principle, and that God has provided the way through the atonement of Jesus Christ whereby men and women can repent of their wrongful acts of commission or of omission, and come back into the path of receiving further light and knowledge through making right choices. The atonement of Christ and the plan of compassion among men also provides a way whereby those who have been harmed by the sinful actions of others may be healed in a spiritual sense, although this may take great patience and long-suffering, and often requires the help of others.

[[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|The Pearl of Great Price]], one of the scriptures of the LDS church, states that Satan, the great deceiver, sought during premortal life to destroy the agency of man,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moses|moses|4|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he continues to seek to enslave men, women and children in whatever ways that he can in this world, to "lead them captive at his will."&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moses|moses|4|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; LDS doctrine teaches that whatever leads in this world to enslavement, addiction, or forced behavior is ultimately instigated by Satan. God allows these conditions because of the agency he has given to man, but He expects men to overcome evil by doing good among the society in which they live. God holds men and women responsible and accountable in relation to the light and knowledge they have. Every person born into the world is given the light of Christ, also called conscience, to guide each person in choosing good from evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moroni|moro|7|18|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LDS doctrine also holds that whenever gospel knowledge has been lost or limited among portions of mankind, this has come about because of the unrighteousness of the people and their leaders, as described by the prophet Isaiah in the Bible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

LDS leaders teach that family and societal relationships are a part of mortal life for many purposes, including the need to learn to show love, acceptance, and compassion in ways that continue to allow agency. They teach that unrighteous dominion is never acceptable to God, and that with the agency given to men is the expectation that when they marry, they will treat their wife and children with love, respect, tenderness, and material and emotional support.  LDS leaders teach that men should treat women as equal partners in all decisions in the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|121|34|46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Free" agency===

The term free agency is commonly used, and has traditionally been interpreted as meaning that individuals have the ability to choose their actions freely. Many leaders of the LDS Church have pointed out that the term "free agency" should not be interpreted to mean that agency does not have consequences, but rather that agency is fraught with risk and choices (the result of the exercise of agency) determine eternal destination. Some church manuals avoid the term "free agency" and instead refer simply "agency."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter= Lesson 2: Agency: The Power to Choose |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-for-exaltation-teachers-manual/lesson-2-agency-the-power-to-choose |title= Preparing for Exaltation: Teacher’s Manual |year= 1998 |publisher= LDS Church |quote= Note that although the term 'free agency' is often used, the correct, scriptural term is simply 'agency'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some church leaders favor the term "moral agency".&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{citation |first= Dallin H. |last= Oaks |authorlink= Dallin H. Oaks |url= http://www.lds.org/liahona/2000/03/weightier-matters |title= Weightier Matters |journal= [[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]] |date=March 2000 |page= 15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam and Eve===
{{see also|Fall of man}}
It is said that [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] were the first of God’s children to come to Earth. They were created in God’s image, with bodies of flesh and bones. God placed them in the Garden of Eden. Here they did not remember their former existence though they were still able to enjoy God's presence and could have lived forever.

As it is believed the Heavenly Father has blessed all of His children with the freedom to choose, Adam and Eve were given agency to make their own choices on the earth.  He commanded them not to eat the forbidden fruit, or the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, warning that such would result in death. Obeying this commandment meant they could remain in the garden forever, but they could not progress by experiencing opposition in mortality and would remain innocent; they could not know joy because they could not experience sorrow and pain. Thus, as a part of the plan, Satan was allowed to tempt Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit and they chose to do so. As a consequence, they were separated from God's presence physically and spiritually. Adam and Eve then became mortal; subject to sin and death, and were unable to return to Heavenly Father without his help. They could now experience disease and all types of suffering. They had moral agency, or the ability to choose between good and evil, which made it possible for them to learn and progress. It also made it possible for them to make wrong choices and to sin. In addition, they could now have children, so the rest of God’s spirit children could come to Earth, obtain physical bodies, and be proven. All this was in accordance with the plan of God. Only in this way could God's children progress and become like him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lds.org {{specify|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary [[personality psychology]], agreeableness is one of the [[Big five personality traits|five major dimensions]] of personality structure, reflecting individual differences in [[cooperation]] and social harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Graziano, W.G., &amp; Eisenberg, N. (1997). Agreeableness; A dimension of personality. In R. Hogan, S. Briggs, &amp; J. Johnson,  (1997). ''Handbook of Personality Psychology.'' San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

People who score high on this dimension are empathetic and altruistic, while a low agreeableness score relates to selfish behavior and a lack of empathy. Those who score very low on agreeableness show signs of [[dark triad]] behavior such as manipulation and competing with others rather than cooperating.

Agreeableness is considered to be a superordinate trait, meaning that it is a grouping of personality sub-traits that cluster together statistically. The lower-level traits, or [[Facet (psychology)|facets]], grouped under agreeableness are: [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], straightforwardness, [[altruism]], [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], [[humility|modesty]], and tender-mindedness.&lt;ref name="Culture Psych"&gt;{{cite book

=== Cattell's 16 Personality Factors ===
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau - Agreeable Burden 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|''Agreeable Burden'' ([[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1895)]]

Like all [[Big Five personality traits]], the roots of the modern concept of agreeableness can be traced to a 1936 study by [[Gordon Allport]] and Henry S. Odbert.&lt;ref name="Trait names"&gt;{{cite journal
  | title   = Trait names: A psycholexical study.

  | doi     = 10.1037/h0093360
  | pages=i–171
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later, [[Raymond Cattell]] published a [[cluster analysis]] of the thousands of personality-related words identified by Allport and Odbert.&lt;ref name="Clusters"&gt;{{cite journal

  | title     = The Description and Measurement of Personality
  | publisher = World Book
  | author    = Cattell, R. B.
  | location  = New York
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually settled on [[16 personality factors]] through the use of [[factor analysis]]. Further factor analyses revealed five higher-order, or "global", factors to encompass these 16.&lt;ref name="16PF"&gt;{{cite web

=== The Big Five ===

Extent of agreeableness in [[Big Five personality traits|the five factor model]] of personality is most commonly assessed through self-report measures, although peer-reports and third-party observation can also be used. Self-report measures are either ''lexical''&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; or based on ''statements''.&lt;ref name="Goldbergetal"&gt;{{cite journal

Thompson (2008)&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; systematically revised and improved these markers to develop a 40-word measure with better psychometric properties in both American and non-American populations, the International English Mini-Markers. This brief measure has good internal consistency reliabilities and other validity for assessing agreeableness and other five factor personality dimensions, both within and, especially, without American populations. Internal consistency reliability of the Agreeableness measure for native English-speakers is reported as .86, that for non-native English-speakers is .80.

''Statement measures'' tend to comprise more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked the extent to which they, for example, ''Am on good terms with nearly everyone'', ''Am not interested in other people's problems'' or ''Sympathize with others' feelings''.&lt;ref name="Goldbergetal" /&gt;

Cattell's [[Factor analysis|factor analytic approach]], used to identify the universal personality structures, inspired countless studies in the decades following the introduction of the 16PF. Using Cattell's original clusters, the 16 Personality Factors, and original data, multiple researchers independently developed a five factor model of personality over this period. From the early 1960s on, these explorations typically included a factor called "agreeableness" or "sociability."&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Personality and Individual Differences"&gt;{{cite book

Using lexical studies similar to those of Allport and Odbert, Goldberg chose the term "Big Five" to reflect the sheer number of personality-related terms encompassed by each of these five distinct factors.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; One of these, agreeableness, was defined by a number of personality-related words similar to those present in earlier and more recent manifestations of the construct; examples include "friendly," "good-natured," "cooperative," "trustful," "nurturing," "sociable," and "considerate."&lt;ref name="goldberg81-1"&gt;{{cite book

=== NEO PI ===

Beginning in the 1970s, [[Paul Costa Jr|Paul Costa]] and Robert McCrae began researching the development of personality assessments based on factor models. Beginning with cluster analyses of Cattell's 16 Personality Factors, Costa and McCrae initially settled on a three-factor model of personality. These three factors were [[neuroticism]] (vs. emotional stability), [[extraversion]] (vs. introversion), and [[Openness to experience|openness]] (vs. closedness) to experience, resulting in the acronym "NEO."&lt;ref name="costamccrae1976"&gt;{{cite journal

== NEO PI facets ==

In the NEO PI, each of the five factors identified by Costa and McCrae are identified with six lower-level traits. Known as [[Facet (psychology)|facets]], the lower-level traits subsumed by agreeableness were first introduced with the 1992 publication of the revised version of the NEO PI. Based on the modern NEO PI-R, the six facets of agreeableness are: [[Trust (social sciences)|Trust]], straightforwardness, [[Altruism]], [[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]], [[Modesty]], and Tender-Mindedness.&lt;ref name="Culture Psych" /&gt;

=== Trust ===

Trust is a defining feature of psychosocial development, personality theory, and [[folk psychology|folk psychological]] conceptions of personality.&lt;ref name="A and C"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who score high on this facet generally believe others' intentions to be benevolent. Those scoring low on this facet tend to be cynical and view others as suspicious, dishonest, or dangerous.

=== Straightforwardness ===

Straightforwardness is the quality of directness and frankness in dealing with others. Despite a long history in [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], straightforwardness is not as vital to personality theory as the other facets of agreeableness.&lt;ref name="A and C" /&gt; Those scoring high on straightforwardness tend to interact with others in a direct and frank manner. Low scorers are less direct, tend to be high in [[self-monitoring]], and are generally deceitful or manipulative. Although the two concepts are not identical, those who score low on this facet tend to be high in [[Machiavellianism#In psychology|Machiavellianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Altruism ===

Similar to [[altruism in animals]] and [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]], this facet is defined by measures of selflessness, self-sacrifice, generosity, and consideration, courtesy, and concern for others.&lt;ref name="A and C" /&gt; Altruism is similar to [[Alfred Adler]]'s concept of social interest, which is a tendency to direct one's actions toward the betterment of society.&lt;ref name="social interest"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who score low on Altruism tend to be discourteous, selfish, or greedy, a pattern of behaviors known as "self-interest" in [[Classical Adlerian psychology|Adlerian psychology]].

=== Compliance ===

As a facet of agreeableness, compliance is defined as an individual's typical response to conflict. Those who score high on compliance tend to be meek and mild, and to prefer cooperation or deference as a means of resolving conflict. Low scorers tend to be aggressive, antagonistic, quarrelsome, and vindictive.&lt;ref name="A and C" /&gt;

=== Modesty ===

While trust, straightforwardness, altruism, and compliance all refer to interpersonal or social behaviors, modesty refers to an individual's [[self-concept]]. Those who score high on modesty tend to be humble and other-focused, while low scorers tend to be arrogant and self-aggrandizing.&lt;ref name="A and C" /&gt; Low modesty is otherwise known as conceitedness or [[Narcissism]] and, in extreme cases, can manifest as [[Narcissistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="psychopathology"&gt;{{cite book

Tender-mindedness is defined as the extent to which an individual's judgments and attitudes are determined by emotion.

To address the absence of measures of [[Dark triad]] traits (i.e., [[narcissism]], [[Machiavellianism]], and [[psychopathy]]), Michael Ashton and Kibeom Lee proposed the addition of a sixth factor to the Five Factor Model.&lt;ref name="honesty"&gt;{{cite journal

As both of these facets are only weakly correlated with Big Five Agreeableness, Ashton and Lee suggest dividing NEO PI Agreeableness into two factors similar to those in the HEXACO Model: Honesty-Humility (i.e., Straightforwardness and Modesty) and a redefined Agreeableness (Trust, Altruism, Compliance, and Tender-Mindedness).&lt;ref name="HEXACO" /&gt; Reflecting this conception of Honesty-Humility and HEXACO Agreeableness as unique though similar concepts, Ashton and Lee propose that they represent different aspects of [[reciprocal altruism]]: fairness (Honesty-Humility) and tolerance (Agreeableness).&lt;ref name="versus anger"&gt;{{cite journal

Despite suggesting this reconceptualization of Agreeableness for the NEO PI, Ashton and Lee do not believe HEXACO Agreeableness is accurately captured by Trust, Altruism, Compliance, and Tender-Mindedness. In addition to accounting for these four facets of Big Five Agreeableness, the HEXACO Model's construction of Agreeableness includes content categorized under [[Neuroticism]] in the NEO PI (i.e., temperamentalness and irritability).&lt;ref name="temperamentalness"&gt;{{cite journal

In response to offensive or [[Relational transgression|transgressive]] actions, individuals who score low on Honesty-Humility tend not to respond immediately. Instead, they defer their response by planning their revenge and waiting for the perfect opportunity to enact it.

=== HEXACO Agreeableness facets ===

To help capture the numerous distinctions between the Big Five and HEXACO models, Ashton and Lee propose four new [[Facet (psychology)|facet]] labels in their conceptualization of Agreeableness: Forgiveness, Gentleness, Flexibility, and Patience.&lt;ref name="temperamentalness" /&gt; In addition to these four Agreeableness-specific facets, Lee and Ashton have proposed an additional "interstitial" facet located in a space shared by Agreeableness, Honesty-Humility, and Emotionality: [[Altruism]] versus Antagonism.&lt;ref name="altruism-antagonism"&gt;{{cite journal

* ''Forgiveness'': A measure of an individual's response to deception or other transgressions.

* ''Gentleness'': A measure of how an individual typically evaluates others. Individuals who score high on this facet tend to avoid being overly judgmental, while those who score low are highly critical and judgmental.
* ''Flexibility'': A measure of behaviors related to compromise and cooperation. Individuals who score high on this facet prefer cooperation and compromise as means of resolving disagreement, while those who score low tend to be stubborn, argumentative, and unwilling to accommodate others.
* ''Patience'': A measure of one's response to anger and aggravation. Individuals who score high on this facet tend to be able to tolerate very high levels of anger and maintain their composure while expressing anger. Those who score low on Patience have difficulties remaining calm while expressing their anger and tend to have quick tempers, becoming very angry in response to comparatively little provocation.
* ''Altruism versus Antagonism'': Although shared between three HEXACO factors, Altruism versus Antagonism is moderately correlated with Agreeableness.&lt;ref name="altruism-antagonism" /&gt; This interstitial facet assesses the extent to which an individual is sympathetic, soft-hearted, and helpful, with low-scoring individuals tending toward an antagonistic interpersonal style.

== Interpersonal relations ==

Agreeableness is an asset in situations that require getting along with others. Compared to disagreeable persons, agreeable individuals display a tendency to perceive others in a more positive light.

Because agreeable children are more sensitive to the needs and perspectives of others, they are less likely to suffer from [[social rejection]]. Specifically, research indicates that children who are less disruptive, less aggressive, and more skilled at entering play groups are more likely to gain acceptance by their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, K. L. (2003). ''Peer rejection: Developmental processes and intervention strategies''. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that people high in agreeableness are more emotionally responsive in social situations. This effect was measured on both self-report questionnaires and physiological measures, and offers evidence that [[extraversion]] and [[neuroticism]] are not the only Big Five personality factors that influence emotion. The effect was especially pronounced among women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Research also shows that people high in agreeableness are more likely to control negative emotions like anger in conflict situations. Those who are high in agreeableness are more likely to use conflict-avoidant tactics when in conflict with others (whereas people low in agreeableness are more likely to use coercive tactics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Prosocial behaviour ==

A central feature of agreeableness is its positive association with [[altruism]] and helping behaviour. Across situations, people who are high in agreeableness are more likely to report an interest and involvement with helping others. Experiments have shown that most people are likely to help their own [[Kinship|kin]], and help when [[empathy]] has been aroused. Agreeable people are likely to help even when these conditions are not present.&lt;ref&gt;Graziano, W. G., Habashi, M.  M., Sheese, B.E., &amp; Tobin, R. M. (2007).

While agreeable individuals are habitually likely to help others, disagreeable people may be more likely to cause harm. Researchers have found that low levels of agreeableness are associated with hostile thoughts and [[aggression]] in adolescents, as well as poor social adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When [[mental illness]] is present, low agreeableness may be associated with [[narcissism|narcissistic]] and [[anti-social behavior|anti-social]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, P. T. &amp; McCrae, R. R. (1992). ''NEO personality Inventory professional manual''. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, individuals who are extremely high in agreeableness are at risk for problems of dependency. Empirical studies show that many more problems are associated with low agreeableness.

However, high agreeableness does not always lead to prosocial behaviour, in a [[Milgram experiment]] conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with willingness to administer high-intensity electric shocks to a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bègue|first1=Laurent|last2=Beauvois|first2=Jean-Léon|last3=Courbert|first3=Didier|last4=Oberblé|first4=Dominique|last5=Lepage|first5=Johan|last6=Duke|first6=Aaron|title=Personality Predicts Obedience in a Milgram Paradigm|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=83|issue=3|pages=299|date=2014|doi=10.1111/jopy.12104|pmid=24798990|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12104/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From childhood to adulthood ==

Agreeableness is of fundamental importance to psychological well-being, predicting mental health, positive affect, and good relations with others. In both childhood and adolescence agreeableness has been tied to externalizing issues. Along with this it has also been implicated in outcomes to conflict management skills, school adjustment, peer-social status and self-esteem. Some work has been done looking into whether agreeableness levels through childhood have effects on adjustment and agreeableness into adulthood. Among young adults, individuals that have been diagnosed with either externalizing as well as internalizing disorders present lower levels of agreeableness and communion, and higher levels of negative emotionality, than those young adults without such disorders. Agreeableness also is reported to mediate links between anger and depression in young adults. Among college students, agreeableness is often associated with self-reports of emotional experience and control along with psycho-physiological responses to affectively charged stimuli. Across adulthood, low agreeableness has been found to be a health risk. High agreeableness, especially trust and honesty, has been linked to longevity.&lt;ref name="Laursen B., Pulkkinen L., Adams R. 2002 591–603"&gt;{{cite journal

A study done by Caspi, Elder, and Bem (1987) found that explosive and ill-tempered children were found to have higher rates of divorce as adults when compared with their even-tempered peers. Further, ill-tempered men had lower educational attainment, occupational status, and work stability, and ill-tempered women married men with similar low achievement profiles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Most recent is a study done by Larsen, Pulkkinen, and Adams (2002) in which they looked at many different levels of childhood behavior and emotion and the correlation into adulthood agreeableness. In their first analyses, structure coefficients showed that childhood compliance, aggression, and self-control discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did activity versus passivity, constructiveness, and anxiety. In their second analyses, structure coefficients indicated that adulthood socialization and impulsivity discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did inhibition of aggression and anxiety. In linking childhood behavioral profiles to adulthood personality profiles, high-compliant, high-self-control, and low-aggressive children were most likely to become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. These children were more unlikely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults. Further, low-compliant, low-self-control, and high-aggressive children were likely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults and these children were unlikely to become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. In addition to this, children classified as low-compliance, low-self-control, low-aggression types and children classified as high-compliance, high-self-control, low-aggression types had a greater probability of becoming adults with high-agreeableness, high-socialization, high-impulsivity profiles. Looking at stability of agreeableness they found results that indicated that stable low agreeable individuals reported less career stability and more depression when compared with stable high agreeable individuals and low to high agreeable individuals. Further, stable high agreeable individuals reported lower levels of alcoholism than did the other groups and fewer arrests than did stable low agreeable individuals.&lt;ref name="Laursen B., Pulkkinen L., Adams R. 2002 591–603" /&gt;

Because these states are generally less urbanized than the east and west coasts, people may be more likely to live in small communities and know their neighbors. Consequently, they may be more willing to care about and help their neighbours.

(1997) groups of college students from China and the United States rated strangers from both countries on the "Big Five" personality traits, external traits, and how well they were dressed.

'''Albert von Kölliker''' (born ''Rudolf Albert Kölliker;'' 6 July 1817{{snd}}2 November 1905) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[anatomist]], [[physiologist]], and [[Histology|histologist]].

==Biography==
Albert Kölliker was born in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].  His early education was carried on in Zurich, and he entered the university there in 1836. After two years, however, he moved to the [[University of Bonn]], and later to that of [[Berlin]], becoming a pupil of noted physiologists [[Johannes Peter Müller]] and of [[Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle]]. He graduated in [[philosophy]] at Zurich in 1841, and in medicine at [[Heidelberg]] in 1842. The first academic post which he held was that of [[prosector]] of [[anatomy]] under Henle, but his tenure of this office was brief{{snd}}in 1844 he returned to Zurich University to occupy a chair as professor extraordinary of [[physiology]] and [[comparative anatomy]]. His stay here was also brief; in 1847 the [[University of Würzburg]], attracted by his rising fame, offered him the post of professor of physiology and of microscopical and comparative anatomy. He accepted the appointment, and at Würzburg he remained thenceforth, refusing all offers tempting him to leave the quiet academic life of the [[Bavaria]]n town, where he died.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=889}}

At Zurich, and afterwards at Würzburg, the title of the chair which Kölliker held laid upon him the duty of teaching comparative anatomy. Many of the numerous memoirs which he published, (including the very first paper he wrote) and which appeared in 1841, before he graduated, were on the structure of animals of the most varied kinds. Notable among these were his papers on the ''[[Medusae]]'' and allied creatures. His activity in this direction led him to make [[zoology|zoological]] excursions to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and to the coasts of [[Scotland]], as well as to undertake, conjointly with his friend [[Carl Theodor Ernst von Siebold]], the editorship of the ''Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche Zoologie'', which, founded in 1848, continued under his hands to be one of the most important zoological periodicals.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

His hand was one of the first to be x-rayed, by his friend [[Wilhelm Roentgen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/rontgen-wilhelm-conrad-ueber-eine-neue-5084328-details.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:X-ray by Wilhelm Röntgen of Albert von Kölliker's hand - 18960123-02.jpg|thumb|X-ray of Kölliker's hand, made by Röntgen on 23 Jan 1896]]

==Works==
Kölliker made contributions to the study of [[zoology]]. His earlier efforts were directed to the [[invertebrates]], and his memoir on the development of [[cephalopod]]s (which appeared in 1844) is considered a classical work.  He soon passed on to the [[vertebrates]], and studied the [[amphibia]]ns and [[mammal]]ian [[embryo]]s. He was among the first, if not the very first, to introduce into this branch of biological inquiry the newer [[microscopy|microscopic technique]] – the methods of hardening, sectioning and [[staining (biology)|staining]]. By doing so, not only was he enabled to make rapid progress himself, but he also placed in the hands of others the means of a similar advancement. The remarkable strides forward which [[embryology]] made during the middle and latter half of the 19th century will always be associated with his name. His ''Lectures on Development'', published in 1861, at once became a standard work.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

But neither zoology nor embryology furnished Kölliker's chief claim to fame. If he did much for these branches of science, he did still more for [[histology]], the knowledge of the minute structure of the animal [[Biological tissue|tissues]]. Among his earlier results was the demonstration in 1847 that [[smooth muscle|smooth]] or unstriated muscle is made up of distinct units, of nucleated muscle cells. In this work, he followed in the footsteps of his master Henle. A few years before this, there was doubt whether [[arteries]] had muscle in their walls – in addition, no solid histological basis as yet existed for those views as to the action of the [[nervous system]] on the [[circulatory system|circulation]], which were soon to be put forward, and which had such a great influence on the progress of physiology.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

Kölliker's contributions to histology were widespread; [[smooth muscle]], [[striated muscle]], [[skin]], [[bone]], [[teeth]], [[blood vessel]]s and [[viscera]] were all investigated by Kölliker, and he touched none of them without discovering new truths. The results at which he arrived were recorded partly in separate memoirs, partly in his great textbook on microscopical anatomy, which first saw the light in 1850, and by which he advanced histology no less than by his own researches.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

[[Albert L. Lehninger]] asserted that Kölliker was among the first to notice the arrangement of granules in the [[sarcoplasm]] of striated muscle over a period of years beginning around 1850. These granules were later called sarcosomes by [[Gustaf Retzius|Retzius]] in 1890. These sarcosomes have come to be known as the [[mitochondria]]-the power houses of the cell. In the words of Lehninger, "Kölliker should also be credited with the first separation of mitochondria from cell structure. In 1888 he teased these granules from insect muscle, in which they are very profuse, found them to swell in water, and showed them to possess a [[Inner nuclear membrane|membrane]]."{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the case of almost every tissue, our present knowledge contains information first discovered by Kölliker – it is for his work on the [[nervous system]] that his name is most remembered. As early as 1845, while still at Zurich, he supplied the clear proof that [[nerve fiber]]s are continuous with [[nerve cells]], and so furnished the absolutely necessary basis for all sound speculations as to the actions of the [[central nervous system]].{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

From that time onward he continually laboured at the histology of the nervous system, and more especially at the difficult problems presented by the intricate patterns in which [[nerve fiber]]s and [[neuron]]s are woven together in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].  From his early days a master of method, he saw at a glance the value of the new [[Golgi's method|Golgi staining method]] for the investigation of the central nervous system, and, to the great benefit of science, took up once more in his old age, with the aid of a new means, the studies for which he had done so much in his youth. Kölliker contributed greatly to knowledge of the inner structure of the [[brain]].{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/handbuchdergeweb02kl ''Handbuch der Gewebelehre des Menschen'', t. 2, Leipzig, 1896.] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==

Kölliker was ennobled by [[Prince Regent]] [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold of Bavaria]] in 1897 and thus permitted to add the predicate "[[von]]" to his surname.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} He was made a member of the learned societies of many countries; in [[England]], which he visited more than once, and where he became well known, the [[Royal Society]] made him a fellow in 1860, and in 1897 gave him its highest token of esteem, the [[Copley medal]].{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

==Heterogenesis==
{{further|Saltationism}}

In 1864 Kölliker revived [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]'s theory that [[evolution]] proceeds by large steps ([[saltationism]]), under the name of heterogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Sewall Wright |first=Sewall |last=Wright |year=1984 |title=Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations |volume=1 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=10 |isbn=0226910490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kölliker was a critic of [[Darwinism]] and rejected a [[universal common ancestor]], instead he supported a theory of [[common descent]] along separate lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mario A. |last=Di Gregorio |year=2005 |title=From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |page=303 |isbn=3525569726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alexander Vucinich]] the non-Darwinian evolution theory of Kölliker tied "organic transformism to three general ideas, all contrary to Darwin's view: the multiple origin of living forms, the internal causes of variation, and "sudden leaps" (heterogenesis) in the evolutionary process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Vucinich |year=1988 |title=Darwin in Russian Thought |publisher=University of California Press |page=137 |isbn=0520062833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kölliker claimed that heterogenesis functioned according to a general law of evolutionary progress, [[orthogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Thomas F.

'''Automated species identification''' is a method of making the expertise of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] available to ecologists, [[parataxonomy|parataxonomists]] and others via computers and other digital technology through [[artificial intelligence]].

== Introduction ==
The '''automated identification''' of biological objects such as [[insects]] (individuals) and/or groups (e.g., [[species]], guilds, characters) has been a dream among [[systematics|systematists]] for centuries. The goal of some of the first [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] [[biometric]] methods was to address the perennial problem of [[group discrimination]] and inter-group characterization. Despite much preliminary work in the 1950s and '60s, progress in designing and implementing practical systems for fully automated object biological [[identification (biology)|identification]] has proven frustratingly slow. As recently as 2004 [[Daniel Janzen|Dan Janzen]]

updated the dream for a new audience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The spaceship lands. He steps out. He points it around. It says ‘friendly–unfriendly—edible–poisonous—safe– dangerous—living–inanimate’. On the next sweep it says ‘''Quercus oleoides—Homo sapiens—Spondias mombin—Solanum nigrum—Crotalus durissus—Morpho peleides''—serpentine’. This has been in my head since reading science fiction in ninth grade half a century ago.{{clarify|reason=how is this relevant?|date=January 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Janzen’s preferred solution to this classic problem involved building machines to identify species from their [[DNA]]. His predicted budget and proposed research team is “US$1 million and five bright people.” However, recent developments in computer architectures, as well as innovations in software design, have placed the tools needed to realize Janzen’s vision in the hands of the [[systematics]] and [[computer science]] community not in several years hence, but now; and not just for creating [[DNA barcode]]s, but also for identification based on [[digital images]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies why automated species identification had not become widely employed at this time and whether it would be a realistic option for the future. The authors found that "a small but growing number of studies sought to develop automated species identification systems based on morphological characters". An overview of 20 studies analyzing species’ structures, such as cells, pollen, wings, and genitalia, shows identification success rates between 40% and 100% on training sets with 1 to 72 species. However, they also identified four fundamental problems with these systems: (1) training sets—were too small (5-10 specimens per species) and their extension especially for rare species may be difficult, (2) errors in identification—are not sufficiently studied to handle them and to find systematics, (3) scaling—studies consider only small numbers of species (&lt;200 species), and (4) novel species — systems are restricted to the species they have been trained for and will classify any novel observation as one of the known species.

A survey published in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wäldchen|first=Jana|last2=Mäder|first2=Patrick|date=2017-01-07|title=Plant Species Identification Using Computer Vision Techniques: A Systematic Literature Review|journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering|volume=25|issue=2|language=en|pages=507–543|doi=10.1007/s11831-016-9206-z|pmid=29962832|pmc=6003396|issn=1134-3060}}&lt;/ref&gt; systematically compares and discusses progress and findings towards automated plant species identification within the last decade (2005–2015). 120 primary studies have been published in high-quality venues within this time, mainly by authors with computer science background. These studies propose a wealth of [[computer vision]] approaches, i.e., [[Feature (computer vision)|features]] reducing the high-dimensionality of the pixel-based image data while preserving the characteristic information as well as classification methods.  The vast majority of these studies analyzes [[Leaf|leaves]] for identification, while only 13 studies propose methods for [[flower]]-based identification. The reasons being that leaves can easier be collected and imaged and are available for most of the year. Proposed [[Feature (computer vision)|features]] capture generic object characteristic, i.e., [[shape]], texture, and [[color]] as well as leaf-specific characteristics, i.e., [[Leaf|venation]] and margin. The majority of studies still used datasets for evaluation that contained no more than 250 [[species]]. However, there is progress in this regard, one study uses a dataset with &gt;2k&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joly|first=Alexis|last2=Goëau|first2=Hervé|last3=Bonnet|first3=Pierre|last4=Bakić|first4=Vera|last5=Barbe|first5=Julien|last6=Selmi|first6=Souheil|last7=Yahiaoui|first7=Itheri|last8=Carré|first8=Jennifer|last9=Mouysset|first9=Elise|date=2014-09-01|title=Interactive plant identification based on social image data|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157495411300071X|journal=Ecological Informatics|series=Special Issue on Multimedia in Ecology and Environment|volume=23|pages=22–34|doi=10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another with &gt;20k&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Huisi|last2=Wang|first2=Lei|last3=Zhang|first3=Feng|last4=Wen|first4=Zhenkun|date=2015-08-01|title=Automatic Leaf Recognition from a Big Hierarchical Image Database|journal=International Journal of Intelligent Systems|language=en|volume=30|issue=8|pages=871–886|doi=10.1002/int.21729|issn=1098-111X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[species]].

These developments could not have come at a better time. As the [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] community already knows, the world is running out of specialists who can identify the very [[biodiversity]] whose preservation has become a global concern. In commenting on this problem in [[palaeontology]] as long ago as 1993, [[Roger Kaesler]] &lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; recognized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“… we are running out of systematic palaeontologists who have anything approaching synoptic knowledge of a major group of organisms … Palaeontologists of the next century are unlikely to have the luxury of dealing at length with taxonomic problems … Palaeontology will have to sustain its level of excitement without the aid of systematists, who have contributed so much to its success.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;This expertise deficiency cuts as deeply into those commercial industries that rely on accurate identifications (e.g., [[agriculture]], [[biostratigraphy]]) as it does into a wide range of pure and applied research programmes (e.g., [[Conservation biology|conservation]], biological [[oceanography]], [[climatology]], [[ecology]]). It is also commonly, though informally, acknowledged that the technical, taxonomic literature of all organismal groups is littered with examples of inconsistent and incorrect identifications. This is due to a variety of factors, including taxonomists being insufficiently trained and skilled in making identifications (e.g., using different rules-of-thumb in recognizing the boundaries between similar groups), insufficiently detailed original group descriptions and/or illustrations, inadequate access to current monographs and well-curated collections and, of course, taxonomists having different opinions regarding group concepts. Peer review only weeds out the most obvious errors of commission or omission in this area, and then only when an author provides adequate representations (e.g., illustrations, recordings, and gene sequences) of the specimens in question.

[[Systematics]] too has much to gain, both practically and theoretically, from the further development and use of automated identification systems. It is now widely recognized that the days of systematics as a field populated by mildly eccentric individuals pursuing knowledge in splendid isolation from funding priorities and economic imperatives are rapidly drawing to a close.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In order to attract both personnel and resources, systematics must transform itself into a “large, coordinated, international scientific enterprise” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many have identified use of the [[Internet]]— especially via the [[World Wide Web]] — as the medium through which this transformation can be made. While establishment of a virtual, [[GenBank]]-like system for accessing [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data, audio clips, video files and so forth would be a significant step in the right direction, improved access to observational information and/or text-based descriptions alone will not address either the [[taxonomic impediment]] or low identification reproducibility issues successfully. Instead, the inevitable subjectivity associated with making critical decisions on the basis of qualitative criteria must be reduced or, at the very least, embedded within a more formally analytic context.

[[File:sphinxGels.png|thumb|340px|thumbnail|[[SDS-PAGE|SDS]] protein gel images of sphinx moth caterpillars. It can be used in a similar way to [[DNA fingerprinting]] ]]

Properly designed, flexible, and robust, automated identification systems, organized around distributed computing architectures and referenced to authoritatively identified collections of training set data (e.g., images, and [[gene sequence]]s) can, in principle, provide all systematists with access to the electronic data archives and the necessary analytic tools to handle routine identifications of common taxa. Properly designed systems can also recognize when their algorithms cannot make a reliable identification and refer that image to a specialist (whose address can be accessed from another database). Such systems can also include elements of artificial intelligence and so improve their performance the more they are used. Most tantalizingly, once morphological (or molecular) models of a species have been developed and demonstrated to be accurate, these models can be queried to determine which aspects of the observed patterns of variation and variation limits are being used to achieve the identification, thus opening the way for the discovery of new and (potentially) more reliable taxonomic characters.

The '''Mouth of Truth''' ({{lang-it|Bocca della Verità}} {{IPA-it|ˈbokka della veriˈta|}}) is a marble mask in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], which stands against the left wall of the portico of the [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]] church, at the Piazza della Bocca della Verità, the site of the ancient [[Forum Boarium]] (the ancient cattle market). It attracts visitors who audaciously stick their hand in the mouth.

The massive marble mask weighs about 1300&amp;nbsp;kg and probably depicts the face of the sea god [[Oceanus]]. The eyes, nostrils and mouth are open.  Historians aren't quite certain what the original purpose of the disc was. It was possibly used as a drain cover in the nearby [[Temple of Hercules Victor]], which had an oculus—a round open space in the middle of the roof, similar to that of the Pantheon. Hence, it could rain inside. It is also thought that cattle merchants used it to drain the blood of cattle sacrificed to the god Hercules. In the thirteenth century the disc was probably removed from the temple and placed against the wall of the Santa Maria in Cosmedin. In the seventeenth century it eventually moved to its current location inside the portico of the church.

The Mouth of Truth has also been featured as a theme in historical European art. [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a German painter during the Renaissance period, created two paintings depicting a woman placing her hand in the mouth of a statue of a lion while onlookers watched, a subject which was drawn by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and made into a woodcut by the Dutch printmaker [[Lucas van Leyden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property From An Important European Private Collection - Lucas Cranach the Elder|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/old-master-british-paintings-evening-sale-l15033/lot.8.html|website=sothebys.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mouth of Truth is referenced in one chapter of [[Devil Lady|Devilman Lady]], by a Devil Beast known as Mita, who utters its Italian name alongside an illustration of the Mouth, before transforming into a spider-like creature with a mouth full of fangs on its back, which rapidly descends and bites off the top of the head of its victims before they can react.

The Mouth of Truth is depicted as a teacher in the japanese manga Shishunki Renaissance David-kun, the teacher uses his mouth to verify if students are telling the truth or not.

The quarterfinals have been completed, and the semifinals will be Lisa vs. Ernie, and Andrew vs. Robert.  The final will be between the two semifinal winners.]]

A '''bracket''' or '''tournament bracket''' is a [[tree structure|tree diagram]] that represents the series of games played during a [[knockout tournament]]. Different knockout tournament formats have different brackets; the simplest and most common is that of the [[single-elimination tournament]]. The name "bracket" is [[American English]], derived from the resemblance of the links in the tree diagram to the [[bracket]] punctuation symbol ] or [ (called a "square bracket" in [[British English]]).  The closest British term is '''draw''', although this implies an element of chance, whereas some brackets are determined entirely by [[Seed (sports)|seed]]ing.

In some tournaments, the full bracket is determined before the first match. In such cases, fans may enjoy trying to predict the winners of the initial round and of the consequent later matchups. This is called "[[bracketology]]", particularly in relation to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. This prediction is not possible in tournaments, such as the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]], in which the pairings for a later round are not made until after the previous round has been played.

==Usage in North America==

Brackets are commonly found in [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American professional sports leagues]] and in U.S. college sports. Often, at the end of the regular [[Season (sports)|season]], the league holds a post-season tournament (most commonly called a [[playoff]]) to determine which team is the best out of all of the teams in the league. This is done because often in American professional sports there are at least two different [[Conference (sports)|conferences]], and teams mostly play other teams in their own conference. Examples of this are the [[American Football Conference]] and the [[National Football Conference]] in the [[NFL]], the [[American League]] and the [[National League]] in [[Major League Baseball]], and the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern]] [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Conference]] and the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western]] [[Western Conference (NHL)|Conference]] in the [[NBA]] or [[NHL]].

When there are only two different conferences, there are two sides of the bracket. One conference is on one side, while the other is on the opposite side. Each side is organized according to a team's [[Seed (sports)|seeding]]; higher-seeded teams are matched against lower-seeded teams. Teams that qualify for the post-season tournament only compete against teams in their own conference, until only one team from each conference remains. These two teams, called the conference champions, play each other to determine the best in the league. Other leagues, like the NHL, have two conferences, each of which is divided into divisions, usually by region. In the post-season tournament, only the teams with the best records qualify, with the exception of the division leader (and also #2 and #3 in the division in the NHL) having an automatic entry into the tournament.

Most North American professional post-season tournaments are single-elimination format. If a [[bye (sports)|bye]] is required, the top seeded teams usually get the bye. There is usually no third place match to separate the third and fourth place teams.

The concept is even more visible in college sports, most notably in reference to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], in which millions of casual and serious fans "fill out brackets"—predict the winners of each game in the tournament—in both formal contests, sponsored by various corporations, and informal betting pools among friends or colleagues. The brackets are much larger than those in North American professional leagues—while no more than 16 teams qualify for the postseason in any major North American league (this is the case in the NBA and NHL), 68 teams (out of over 350) advance to the NCAA men's tournament, with most bracket contests involving 64 of these teams.

The diagrams for formats other than single-elimination are more complex than a simple tree.

All three men were arrested and implicated in the arson on December 1971, a full three years after the incident.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"&gt;{{harvp|Michalowski|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men were eventually convicted for their presumed actions, and were unsuccessful in having their appeals accepted, with the Supreme Court rejecting their motions.&lt;ref name="Waller_127"&gt;{{harvp|Waller|2002|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were all well known radical activists in Charlotte and some people claimed their arrest was aimed at stopping their political motives. Many observers believed that this case was a representation of the still heavily racist [[Southern United States]] of the 1970s, and the various underhanded methods prosecutors were willing to utilize to obtain convictions against African Americans.&lt;ref name="Waller_127"/&gt; The Charlotte Three were victims in the eyes of some, of an American South that was still reeling from widespread integration and general mistrust in Black affairs. The men were held against their will incorrectly not for crimes that they did not commit, but because of the social change they worked hard to attain. Finally, in 1979, North Carolina Jim Hunt commuted all three men's sentences after a vigorous campaign by state, national, and international activists on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grimsley|2003|pp=150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charlotte ==

Charlotte, North Carolina had a reputation as a forward-thinking city in that it wasn't supposed to have the same racial discrimination that the cities in the [[Deep South]] had.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"&gt;{{harvp|Kusmer|Trotter|2009|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte was called a "New South city" but many of its residents still harbored the same racial discrimination, and "clung to Jim Crow segregation" as strongly as residents of Mobile, Alabama and Jackson, Mississippi, stereotypical anti-black cities.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"/&gt; African American dissent towards racism was however very prevalent in Charlotte, as the landmark case [[Brown v. Board of Education]] arose from a school district around Charlotte, and Reginald Hawkins spearheaded protests against segregation in the cities public and private institutions.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"/&gt; When residents in Charlotte in January 1965 filed the court case [[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]], the car of civil rights leader "[[Julius Chambers]] was blown to bits" and a year later, "bombs exploded at the homes of four more civil rights leaders".&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"/&gt;

== Biographical background ==

One of the residents of Charlotte who had experienced much racial discrimination in his lifetime was T.J. Reddy, who was enrolled in the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]].&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"/&gt; T.J. had been a poet and playwright who used his talents to help him pursue his goal of being an urban activist.&lt;ref name="Waller_127"/&gt; He was with his girlfriend Vicky Minar, when he "happened upon a particularly humiliating experience of racial injustice" at the Lazy B Stables.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"/&gt; In September 1967, Reddy, his girlfriend, and a group of friends went to Lazy B to enjoy their free time by horseback riding. When the group arrived at the stable, they were rejected from being able to ride since they were black.&lt;ref name="Waller_127"/&gt; Since Reddy did not want to make a scene, he decided to leave and not do anything about the social injustice he just encountered.

After "following traditional protest strategies", the group returned mixed, with whites and blacks, and were allowed to ride the horses the next day.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"&gt;{{harvp|Kusmer|Trotter|2009|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddy was a man who did not like to be treated unfairly or in a derogatory manner, as evidenced by his poetry "ain't nothing funny bout a cracker/calling me a n*****".&lt;ref name="Reddy_58"&gt;{{harvp|Reddy|1974|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he would not seek to create fights when unnecessary, as he liked to "keep his nose/just above" implying that he would not resort to arguments when the matter was cleared.&lt;ref name="Reddy_58"/&gt; Charles Parker, another black man who accompanied Reddy to the stable, was able to ride in public while being watched by the media, thus Reddy believed the matter to be closed.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"/&gt; Reddy left the incident because in his mind; "management had a change of heart and was willing to allow black people to ride".&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"/&gt; Parker had been an honors student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and was engaged in antiwar activism through his clubs and activities, and was linked to the movement of "black consciousness".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_184"&gt;{{harvp|Grimsley|2003|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Another Civil Rights activist who was charged and convicted in the Lazy B Stables case was Dr. James Earl Grant, a dedicated activist against racial discrimination. Though Grant was from [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and received his doctorate degree from Penn State, he was very active in the South's racial playing field, especially that of North Carolina's.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"/&gt; On May 11, 1970, three white males murdered a black man, Henry Marrow, a father of three children who lived in [[Oxford, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"/&gt; When news spread that Henry had been murdered, Blacks from across the country, along with Grant, decided they were fed up and organized protests. Most wanted to obtain justice through the tried and true legal system, however a group of "black Vietnam veterans" took matters into their own hands and decided to bomb white businesses in Oxford.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"/&gt; Neither Grant nor Reddy were involved in the acts of violence against the white owned businesses, but had their fates sealed when a police officer decided to pull over a car driven by two African Americans while exiting Oxford.

== Alfred Hood and David Washington ==

On May 15, 1970, police officers in Oxford, NC arrested Alfred Hood and David Washington for possessing "seven sticks of dynamite, two rifles, and a pistol".&lt;ref name="Kusmer_196"&gt;{{harvp|Kusmer|Trotter|2009|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two were friends affiliated with James Grant and told authorities later that Grant had told the two to drive up to Charlotte with their supplies.&lt;ref name="Schutz_170"&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City Manager of Charlotte, Ragland, remembered Grant as someone who "was an expert in starting fires…he could start a fire in a rainstorm".&lt;ref name="Schutz_170"/&gt; Hood and Washington were subsequently jailed for possessing such deadly weapons, however after a short period of time, the two "jumped bail, and fled to Canada" where they were eventually returned on warrants.&lt;ref name="Waller_126"&gt;{{harvp|Waller|2002|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the two were apprehended a second time, they decided to cut a deal with the prosecutor that was perceived in the black community as indicative of the social climate of the time period. The men had their general living expenditures paid for, and after their testimony, would be relocated completely all on the government's dime.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_196"/&gt;

What Hood and Washington offered for this unique package was the ability to bring in one of the most influential leaders for the movement of reducing racism, James Grant. They testified in April 1972 that Grant had "encouraged them to skip bond" and even helped them "to cross the border into Canada" so that the two could not be extradited back to the United States.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_196"/&gt; The prosecutor had believed that Grant had "trained these little kids…they were the ones doing the big stuff" while Grant was able to sit "behind the scenes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant ended up being convicted of conspiracy and helping out fugitives, and was sentenced to ten years in a federal penitentiary.

Since the prosecutor wanted more from Hood and Washington, he pressed them further, and allegedly started to offer the two men cash for their support in bringing justice to the Charlotte Three for their presumed role in the burning of Lazy B Stables. Assistant Attorney General [[Robert C. Mardian]] "approved a deal giving Hood and Washington cash payments of four thousand dollars each" which was to help persuade the two men to say what the prosecutor wanted to hear.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_196"/&gt; What the prosecutor wanted was to be able obtain a conviction of the Charlotte Three who were all civil rights leaders and proponents for the end of racism in Charlotte.&lt;ref name="Waller_127"/&gt; The three were indicted in January 1972 and this set off a racial firestorm.

The prosecutor however denies this claim and rather implies that Hood and Washington were willing to testify against the Charlotte Three on their own without any outside pressures or rewards. The prosecutor asked the pair "whose driving around in a Cadillac while you're stuck in here" and that the leaders are not doing anything while the pair are "stuck in here paying the price".&lt;ref name="Schutz_174_184"&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|pp=174, 184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI also believed the truth of what Hood and Washington said in that Charlotte FBI Agent Koon wanted to transform Grant into an informant on his other troublemaking friends, but that did not end up panning out.&lt;ref name="Schutz_174_184"/&gt;

== Court case ==

With three black defendants, the lawyers for the Charlotte Three requested that since the grand jury "excludes blacks from participation since it is derived from voter registration laws", the case should be dropped.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Judge Snepp however refuted that point, as he claimed that blacks could register to vote as they pleased. The defendants' lawyers saw this as a systematic attempt to stop blacks from being able to register to vote. At the time, black voters had to take voter tests, unlike their white counterparts, implying an unfair situation.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Similarly, the prosecutor's office decided to appoint no black or Jewish jurors, with a near deaf old black lady as the lone exception.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Since the defense had to waste all their challenges and objections that they are legally allowed to have by removing clearly incompetent jury members, they were left at a considerable disadvantage in the courtroom.

Reporters and journalists questioned the evidence and workings of the case.&lt;ref name="twopaid"&gt;AP. 1974. 'Paper Says Two Paid to Testify'. The Dispatch, March 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the white prosecutor's office did follow all the laws and did not do anything illegal, "the court empaneled a seriously prejudiced jury of white Southern Baptists".&lt;ref name="twopaid"/&gt; During the trial, the only real piece of evidence other than the falsified witness testimony by Hood and Washington was a picture of a bottle that was presumed to be an unused firebomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Waller|2002|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bottle however was never actually placed into the evidence files of the case since it was mysteriously "lost" by the fire marshals, and that the "original photograph was staged".&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Though there seemed to be very little evidence to support the prosecutor's claims, the jury returned a guilty verdict within one hour of the case's arguments ending. T.J. Reddy was sentenced to 20 years, James Grant got 25 years, and Charles Parker received 10 years (8).&lt;ref name="twopaid"/&gt;

The sentencing of the Charlotte Three emphasized a clear dichotomy: the white jurors wanted to be fair in trial, but were worried of the social repercussions that would come about from supporting these black men. There was a fear of a "black revolution" in the South at that time, and by imprisoning the leaders of black movements across the South, whites were able to contain that movement and stymie it.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Many saw the decision as one that favored the persecuting of black leaders for their black revolution ideas, in that Judge Snepp sentenced Grant to 25 years due to his education.

== Problems with testimony ==

Judge Snepp said that since Grant was so educated, with a doctorate, he "showed no gratitude to society" and since he was so well educated, was "an extremely dangerous revolutionary beyond rehabilitation."&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Reddy was in the eyes of Snepp, dangerous since he was a poet and able to use his talents to appeal to the heart of blacks and revolutionize their ways of thinking. Snepp gave Parker the lightest sentence since he was not deemed as harmful as the rest, as Parker was thought to be an "easily led young Black dupe."&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt;

Snepp knew that Hood and Washington "are not exactly A-1 citizens" yet he decided to use their testimony as a key component in the conviction of the Charlotte Three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Myerson|1978|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credibility given to Washington and his statements about Grant and the Charlotte Three were not questioned during the trial, but should have been. He was the "prime suspect in five murders in the Charlotte area" and yet his testimony was used to put men with clean criminal backgrounds in jail.&lt;ref name="Schutz_173"&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; With crime rates rising, famed philosopher Angela Davis's publicized fight with the FBI, George Jackson's "meteoric rise to militant fame as…Black Party Minister of Defense", and the University of Wisconsin's math building bombing, the crimes of Washington were overlooked.&lt;ref name="Schutz_173"/&gt; They were not taken seriously enough since the aforementioned crimes were politically motivated, however Washington's were not, and as put by the District Attorney Tom Moore; "sometimes you must go to hell to get the devil".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was said to have used "heroin, LSD, and large quantities of alcohol and marijuana" which cast considerable doubt on his credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

Though the Charlotte Three had been convicted and imprisoned, the general support from Charlotte and the members in the men's' lives never stopped. In the Herald Journal, Grant's father mentions that there were "vigils…held in front of the historic Old State House in Hartford…to keep the case alive".&lt;ref&gt;AP. 1978. 'Vigils Continue in Freedom Fight'. Herald Journal, May 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The men felt they were representing how racially charged Charlotte had become, and its residents did not want the city to be tainted by corrupt judicial officers. In the Black Panther newspaper, a letter campaign by the North Carolina Political Prisoners Committee started to prosper. Local residents were urged to send letters in support of the Charlotte Three to Governor Hunt of North Carolina in an effort to have the men's sentences commuted.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Huey. 1974. 'Community Demands Free the Charlotte 3'. The Black Panther, April 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Reddy received support from his fellow poets, such as Sandra Beck of Charlotte who wrote that she had met "few people so creatively and constructively oriented" and who gave his encouragement to many "young writers and authors".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_184"/&gt; Ironically, Reddy was labeled as one who was constructively oriented and creative, yet he was accused of demolishing a construction through the brute force method of arson, which has no creativity to it whatsoever. He also had the whole support of the state's art community "who strongly backed the black poet".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_184"/&gt;

James Grant had received support from individuals in both the North and the South, including Connecticut Governor Ella Grasso, who called her counterpart in North Carolina on Grant's behalf.&lt;ref name="Grimsley_149_150"&gt;{{harvp|Grimsley|2003|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant also had the support of famous Southern prison rights leader L.C. Dorsey who claimed that Grant's imprisonment was a result of wanting to disagree with "a senseless war, racial oppression at home, and the plight of those who had taxation without representation".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_149_150"/&gt;

== Commuted sentence ==

Grant was eventually granted parole from [[Jim Hunt|Governor Hunt]] of North Carolina reducing his sentence, and Reddy and Parker were also set free.&lt;ref name="endvigil"&gt;AP. 1979. 'Parents of Charlotte Three Members See End to Vigil'. Daytona Beach Morning Journal, July 23.&lt;/ref&gt; When Grant learned that he was about to be freed, since he had "made progress towards rehabilitation" in the eyes of the Governor instead of a full pardon, he said that "people have paid higher prices" than he has, and that he is fine with whatever decision he is granted.&lt;ref name="endvigil"/&gt; The sentences were not pardoned however by Governor Hunt, but rather commuted, implying that the men were still guilty of the burning in the eyes of the judicial system.

[[File:North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt in 1992.jpg|thumb|North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt in 1992]]

== Larger context of politics, race, and the civil rights movement ==

The Charlotte Three case was an event that epitomized the larger issues of politics, race, and the civil rights movement in the South. The commuting of the sentences for the men may not have actually been purely due to the reasons publicly stated, but instead for hidden political ones. In 1979, an election year, there was a lot of turmoil and Governor Hunt and the Democratic party were worried about the backlash that would ensue if the men were still imprisoned at the time of the election. Herbert N. Lape who was serving as the vice-chairman of the North Carolina state democratic party stated in a letter to Hunt that many people in the state view "the Charlotte Three [case] as [a] primarily white witch [hunt] that involved racial bigotry".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_184"/&gt; A secretary by the name of Joseph Grimsley also stated in a memo to Governor Hunt, "[the] state's repressive image is beginning to spill over in this administration to yours personally".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_184"/&gt;

The administration was in a position where it had to save face by reducing the sentences or else face the possibility of losing control to another party. The judge had originally given out the long sentences because he wanted to show that it was "the smashing of a dangerous Black revolution plot".&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; He hoped to set an example of the men, as he was worried of more of these plots in the future.

== Criticism ==

The case of the Charlotte Three was not something that was entirely unique; rather, as historian John Schutz argued, it was the ordinary in the mid 1900s South. By persecuting "black leaders for conventional crimes", the state could follow "civilized" methods that would instead of cause violence, put the leader in jail where he could no longer do any more leading.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Expert Raymond Michalowski believes these persecutions of blacks were similar to those of the KKK or other "night riders of decades past" but instead of illegal henchmen carrying out the attacks, legal judges and prosecutors were doing so in the courts.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; By charging the leaders with crimes, the state was able to make it seem like the leaders were not as viable as they claimed to be. This helped to mute some of the public support the leaders may have originally garnered. Though the South seemed to have overtly fixed its race problem after the passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|federal civil rights legislation in 1964-65]], it was covertly persecuting Black revolutionary leaders. The persecutions were not taking place out on the streets through public lynching as in times past, but instead through illegal backdoor deals supported by the judicial system.

According to the [[International Panel on Climate Change|IPCC's]] 2014 [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|assessment report]], "Mitigation is a public good; climate change is a case of the '[[tragedy of the commons]]'. Effective climate change mitigation will not be achieved if each agent (individual, institution or country) acts independently in its own selfish interest (see [[International cooperation]] and [[Emissions trading]]), suggesting the need for collective action. Some [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] actions, on the other hand, have characteristics of a private good as benefits of actions may accrue more directly to the individuals, regions, or countries that undertake them, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, financing such adaptive activities remains an issue, particularly for poor individuals and countries."&lt;ref name="AR5-WG3-Chap3"&gt;

One of the issues often discussed in relation to climate change mitigation is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) has the ultimate objective of [[Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change|preventing "dangerous" anthropogenic (i.e., human) interference of the climate system]]. As is stated in Article 2 of the Convention, this requires that greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where [[climate change and ecosystems|ecosystems]] can adapt naturally to climate change, [[climate change and agriculture|food production]] is not threatened, and [[economics of global warming|economic development]] can proceed in a sustainable fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There are a number of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. These include [[carbon dioxide]] ([[chemical formula]]: {{CO2}}), [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), and a group of gases referred to as [[halocarbon]]s.

The reason for this is that human activities are adding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]] for a complete explanation).&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt; This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of the other greenhouse gasses humans emit also depends on how fast their emissions are added to the atmosphere, and how fast the GHGs are removed. Stabilization for these gases is described in the later section on [[#Non-CO2 greenhouse gases|non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; GHGs]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 2018 an international team of scientist published research saying that the current mitigation policy in [[Paris Agreement]] is insufficient to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees. They say that even if all the current pledges will be accomplished there is a chance for a 4.5 degree temperature rise in decades.  To preventing that, restoration of natural [[Carbon sink]]s, [[Carbon dioxide removal]], changes in society and values will be necessary.&lt;ref name="Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steffen |first1=Will |last2=Rockström |first2=Johan |last3=Richardson |first3=Katherine |last4=M.

To create lasting climate change mitigation, the replacement of high carbon [[emission intensity]] power sources, such as conventional [[fossil fuel]]s—[[oil]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]]—with [[low-carbon power]] sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with the vast majority of our energy demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf World energy outlook 2012 (IEA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[hydroelectricity]] and [[nuclear power]] together provide the majority of the generated [[low-carbon power]] fraction of global total power consumption.

In general, higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact. Several scientific studies have shown that when people, especially those living in [[developed country|developed countries]] but more generally including all countries, wish to reduce their carbon footprint, there are four key "high-impact" actions they can take:&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017&gt;{{cite journal |title= The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions |journal= Environmental Research Letters |first1= Seth |last1= Wynes |first2= Kimberly A |last2= Nicholas |date= 12 July 2017 |volume= 12 |page= 074024 |number= 7 |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541 |bibcode= 2017ERL....12g4024W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul P |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

:3. Avoiding one round-trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes)

:4. Eating a [[plant-based diet]] (0.8 tonnes)

These appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for “greening” one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the “low-impact” category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, K-12 school textbooks, etc.&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;

The researchers added that “Our recommended high-impact actions are more effective than many more commonly discussed options (e.g. eating a plant-based diet saves eight times more emissions than upgrading light bulbs). More significantly, a US family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who choose to adopt comprehensive recycling for the rest of their lives.”&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;

Overall, food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based GHG emissions with nearly 20% of the global carbon footprint, followed by housing, mobility, services, manufactured products, and construction.

====Energy efficiency and conservation====
{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Led-lampa.jpg|thumb|A 230-volt LED light bulb, with an [[Edison screw|E27]] base (10 [[watt]]s, 806 [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s).]]

Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called "energy efficiency", is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[LED lamp|LED lighting]], [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], or natural [[skylight|skylight windows]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulb]]s. [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s use only 33% of the energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; LED lamps use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.

Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled. As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses using less energy to achieve a lesser energy demanding service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter, driving less, or working in a less brightly lit room. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demand-side switching sources====
Fuel switching on the demand side refers to changing the type of fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service. To meet deep decarbonization goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Change |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/cc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050 – European Commission |accessdate= 2015-04-29 |url= http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/roadmap/index_en.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150511100639/http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/roadmap/index_en.htm |archive-date= 2015-05-11 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency alone may not be sufficient to meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014038 |issn= 1748-9326 |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |page= 014038 |last1= Wei |first1= Max |last2= Nelson |first2= James H |last3= Greenblatt |first3= Jeffery B |last4= Mileva |first4= Ana |last5= Johnston |first5= Josiah |last6= Ting |first6= Michael |last7= Yang |first7= Christopher |last8= Jones |first8= Chris |last9= McMahon |first9= James E |last10= Kammen |first10= Daniel M |title= Deep carbon reductions in California require electrification and integration across economic sectors |journal= Environmental Research Letters |accessdate= 2015-03-21 |date= 2013-03-01 |url= http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/8/i=1/a=014038?key=crossref.37ef0d9dff3c11bf4c176aa87e4f5831|bibcode= 2013ERL.....8a4038W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Williams |first= James H. |title= The technology path to deep greenhouse gas emissions cuts by 2050: The pivotal role of electricity |journal= Science |volume= 335 |issue= 6064 |pages= 53–9 |accessdate= 2015-03-21 |date= 2012 |url= https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2mz2472z.pdf |bibcode= 2012Sci...335...53W |doi= 10.1126/science.1208365|pmid= 22116030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning [[coal]].&lt;ref name=gasdotorg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ |title=Natural Gas and the Environment |publisher=Naturalgas.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503132200/http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ |archivedate=2009-05-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very efficient [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.

At the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.

The economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. The EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2014 suggests that domestic gas prices will rise faster than electricity prices which will encourage electrification in the coming decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/ |title=Annual Energy Outlook 2015 – Energy Information Administration |publisher=Eia.gov |date=2015-04-14 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.

Alternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]]. A 2015 study by Energy+Environmental Economics shows that a hybrid approach of decarbonizing pipeline gas, electrification, and energy efficiency can meet carbon reduction goals at a similar cost as only electrification and energy efficiency in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= E3 Decarbonizing Pipeline 01-27-2015.pdf |accessdate= 2015-04-14 |url= https://ethree.com/documents/E3_Decarbonizing_Pipeline_01-27-2015.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150717182053/https://ethree.com/documents/E3_Decarbonizing_Pipeline_01-27-2015.pdf |archive-date= 2015-07-17 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demand side grid management====
Expanding intermittent electrical sources such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].

[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.

[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers would need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.

[[Demand response]] devices could receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This would allow electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. The [[vehicle-to-grid]] suggestion would use a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.

A [[Yale University]] review published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology analyzing {{CO2}} [[life cycle assessment]](LCA) emissions from nuclear power([[light water reactor]]s) determined that: "The collective LCA literature indicates that life cycle [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies."&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"/&gt;
While some have raised uncertainty surrounding the future GHG emissions of nuclear power as a result of an extreme potential decline in uranium ore grade without a corresponding increase in the [[enriched uranium|efficiency of enrichment methods]]. In a scenario analysis of future global nuclear development, as it could be effected by a decreasing global [[uranium market]] of average ore grade, the analysis determined that depending on conditions, median life cycle nuclear power GHG emissions could be between 9 and 110&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh by 2050, with the latter high figure being derived from a "worst-case scenario" that is not "considered very robust" by the authors of the paper, as the "ore grade" in the scenario is lower than the uranium concentration in many lignite coal ashes.&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Warner |first1= E.

Although this future analyses primarily deals with extrapolations for present [[Generation II reactor]] technology, the same paper also summarizes the literature on "FBRs"/[[Fast Breeder Reactor]]s, of which two are in operation as of 2014 with the newest being the [[BN-800 reactor|BN-800]], for these reactors it states that the "median life cycle GHG emissions&amp;nbsp;...

It is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/factsheet_energy_speech_080308.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017172925/http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/factsheet_energy_speech_080308.pdf |archivedate=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis in 2015 by Professor and Chair of Environmental Sustainability [[Barry Brook (scientist)|Barry W. Brook]] and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely, from the electric grid of the world, has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in France and Sweden during each nation's building programs in the 1980s, within 10 years nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely, "allow[ing] the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Potential for Worldwide Displacement of Fossil-Fuel Electricity by Nuclear Energy in Three Decades Based on Extrapolation of Regional Deployment Data|first1=Staffan A.|last1=Qvist|first2=Barry W.|last2=Brook|date=13 May 2015|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=5|page=e0124074|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124074|pmid=25970621|pmc=4429979|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1024074Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar analysis, Brook had earlier determined that 50% of all [[world energy consumption|global energy]], that is not solely electricity, but transportation [[synfuels]] etc. could be generated within approximately 30 years, if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nation's already proven decadal rates(in units of installed [[nameplate capacity]], [[gigawatt|GW]] per year, per unit of global [[GDP]](GW/year/$).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511009189|title=Could nuclear fission energy, etc., solve the greenhouse problem?

[[Nuclear fusion]] research, in the form of the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] is underway. Fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable, as fission power had been.

Natural gas emits far fewer greenhouse gases (i.e. {{CO2}} and methane—CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) than coal when burned at power plants, but evidence has been emerging that this benefit could be completely negated by methane leakage at gas drilling fields and other points in the supply chain.

A study performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of [[methane emissions]] from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the findings of this study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.

A 2011 study&lt;ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102222215/http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage |archive-date=2015-01-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by noted climate research scientist, Tom Wigley,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wigley]]&lt;/ref&gt; found that while carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy, it also found that additional methane (CH4) from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in {{CO2}} forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. The study looked at methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced {{CO2}} emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small. Petron et al.

These studies indicate that the exploitation of natural gas as a "cleaner" fuel is questionable. A 2014 meta-study of 20 years of natural gas technical literature shows that methane emissions are consistently underestimated but on a 100-year scale, the climate benefits of coal to gas fuel switching are likely larger than the negative effects of natural gas leakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume= 343 |issue= 6172 |pages= 733–35 |last1= Brandt |first1= A.

====Heat pump====
{{Main|Heat pump}}
[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]
A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.

While [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction—releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.

It has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market. With a market share of 30% and (potentially) clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global {{CO2}} emissions by 8% annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Staffell Iain ''et al.'' |year= 2012 |title= A review of domestic heat pumps |url= |journal= [[Energy and Environmental Science]] |volume= 5 |issue= 11 |pages= 9291–9306 |doi= 10.1039/c2ee22653g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60% of the [[primary energy]] demand and 90% of {{CO2}} emissions in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Carvalho |first1= |display-authors= 1 |last2= et al |year= 2015 |title= Ground source heat pump carbon emissions and primary energy reduction potential for heating in buildings in Europe—results of a case study in Portugal |url= |journal= [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] |volume= 45 |issue= |pages= 755–768 |doi= 10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sternberg André, Bardow André |year= 2015 |title= ''Power-to-What? – Environmental assessment of energy storage systems''.

With significant amounts of fossil fuel used in electricity production, demands on the electrical grid also generate greenhouse gases. Without a high share of low-carbon electricity, a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysolutionscenter.org/assets/1/Page/GHP_Position_Paper_and_apndx_031710.pdf pg 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinks and negative emissions===
{{Main|Carbon sink|Negative carbon dioxide emission}}

A [[carbon sink]] is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing [[forest]]. A [[negative carbon dioxide emission]] on the other hand is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Examples are [[carbon capture and storage|direct air capture]], [[enhanced weathering]] technologies such as storing it in [[geologic sequestration of CO2|geologic formations]] underground and [[biochar]]. These processes are sometimes considered as variations of sinks or mitigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Reforestation and afforestation====
[[File:Shennongjia virgin forest.jpg|thumb|Transferring [[land rights]] to indigenous inhabitants is argued to efficiently conserve forests.]]
{{Main|Deforestation|Reforestation|Biosequestration}}

Almost 20 percent (8{{nbsp}}GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year) of total greenhouse-gas emissions were from deforestation in 2007. It is estimated that avoided deforestation reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions at a rate of 1{{nbsp}}tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per $1–5 in [[opportunity costs]] from lost agriculture. [[Reforestation]] could save at least another 1{{nbsp}}GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year, at an estimated cost of $5–15/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt; [[Afforestation]] is where there was previously no forest - such plantations are estimated to have to be prohibitively massive to be reduce emissions by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lena R.

With increased [[intensive agriculture]] and [[urbanization]], there is an increase in the amount of abandoned farmland. By some estimates, for every half a hectare of original [[old-growth forest]] cut down, more than 20 hectares of new [[secondary forest]]s are growing, even though they do not have the same biodiversity as the original forests and original forests store 60% more carbon than these new secondary forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/science/earth/30forest.html?pagewanted=all|title=New Jungles Prompt a Debate on Rain Forests|publisher=New York Times |accessdate=18 July 2016|date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, E.

Restoring grasslands store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air into plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth.

[[File:Carbon sequestration-2009-10-07.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic showing both terrestrial and geological sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions from a coal-fired plant]]
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The IPCC estimates that the costs of halting global warming would double without CCS.&lt;ref name=guardian0916&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/09/co2-turned-into-stone-in-iceland-in-climate-change-breakthrough|title=CO2 turned into stone in Iceland in climate change breakthrough|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Energy Agency says CCS is "the most important single new technology for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; savings" in power generation and industry.&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson |first=Simon |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1954176_1954175,00.html |title=How to Reduce Carbon Emissions: Capture and Store it? |publisher=[[Time.com]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it requires up to 40% more energy to run a CCS coal power plant than a regular coal plant, CCS could potentially capture about 90% of all the carbon emitted by the plant.&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit/&gt; Norway's [[Sleipner gas field]], beginning in 1996, stores almost a million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a year to avoid penalties in producing natural gas with unusually high levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/sleipner.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit/&gt; As of late 2011, the total planned {{CO2}} storage capacity of all 14 projects in operation or under construction is over 33 million tonnes a year.

====Enhanced weathering====
Enhanced weathering is the removal of carbon from the air into the earth, enhancing the natural carbon cycle where carbon is mineralized into rock. The [[CarbFix]] project couples with carbon capture and storage in power plants to turn carbon dioxide into stone in a relatively short period of two years, addressing the common concern of leakage in CCS projects. While this project used [[basalt]] rocks, [[olivine]] has also shown promise.&lt;ref name=guardian0916/&gt;

===Geoengineering===
{{Main|Climate engineering}}

Geoengineering is seen by Olivier Sterck as an alternative to mitigation and adaptation, but by Gernot Wagner as an entirely separate response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00635487/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatecentral.org/news/harvard-scientists-taking-geoengineering-into-the-field-21362&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[scientific literature|literature]] assessment, Barker ''et al.''

Chapter 28 of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] report ''Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base'' (1992) defined geoengineering as "options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry."&lt;ref name="nas_policy_implications"&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1605&amp;page=433 Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base] (1992), [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP)&lt;/ref&gt; They evaluated a range of options to try to give preliminary answers to two questions: can these options work and could they be carried out with a reasonable cost. They also sought to encourage discussion of a third question&amp;nbsp;— what adverse side effects might there be. The following types of option were examined: reforestation, increasing ocean absorption of carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration) and screening out some sunlight. NAS also argued "Engineered countermeasures need to be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the potential side effects, the ethical issues, and the risks.".&lt;ref name="nas_policy_implications"/&gt; In July 2011 a report by the [[United States Government Accountability Office]] on geoengineering found that "[c]limate engineering technologies do not now offer a viable response to global climate change."&lt;ref&gt;GAO (2011).

====Carbon dioxide removal====
{{Main|Carbon dioxide removal|Greenhouse gas remediation|Carbon sequestration}}
{{See also|Carbon air capture}}

[[Carbon dioxide removal]] has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of radiative forcing. A variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon, as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes, are being explored. The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms (see [[biosequestration]]). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.&lt;ref name=RoyalSociety&gt;The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 "Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty"]. Retrieved 2009-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable that the availability of cheap energy and appropriate sites for [[carbon capture and storage|geological storage]] of carbon may make [[carbon dioxide air capture]] viable commercially. It is, however, generally expected that carbon dioxide air capture may be uneconomic when compared to [[carbon capture and storage]] from major sources&amp;nbsp;— in particular, fossil fuel powered power stations, refineries, etc. As in the case of the US [[Kemper Project]] with carbon capture, costs of energy produced will grow significantly.

The emissions caps agreed to by most developed countries under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] regulate the emissions of almost all the anthropogenic GHGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These gases are CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), the [[halocarbon|hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of the different anthropogenic GHGs requires an understanding of their different physical properties. Stabilization depends both on how quickly GHGs are added to the atmosphere and how fast they are removed. The rate of removal is measured by the atmospheric lifetime of the GHG in question (see the [[greenhouse gas#Global warming potential|main GHG article]] for a list). Here, the lifetime is defined as the time required for a given perturbation of the GHG in the atmosphere to be reduced to 37% of its initial amount.&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt;
Methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years, while N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O's lifetime is about 110 years. For methane, a reduction of about 30% below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration, while for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, an emissions reduction of more than 50% would be required.&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt;

[[Methane]] is a significantly more potent greenhouse gas than [[carbon dioxide]] in the amount of heat it can trap, especially in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Methane vs. Carbon Dioxide: A Greenhouse Gas Showdown|url= http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/|website= One Green Planet|accessdate= 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burning one molecule of methane generates one molecule of carbon dioxide, indicating there may be no net benefit in using gas as a fuel source.&lt;ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; Reducing the amount of waste methane produced in the first place and moving away from use of gas as a fuel source will have a greater beneficial impact, as might other approaches to productive use of otherwise-wasted methane. In terms of prevention, vaccines are being developed in Australia to reduce the significant global warming contributions from [[methane]] released by livestock via [[flatulence]] and [[eructation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6431 Burp vaccine cuts greenhouse gas emissions] ''Rachel Nowak'' for NewScientist September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Another physical property of the anthropogenic GHGs relevant to mitigation is the different abilities of the gases to trap heat (in the form of [[infrared radiation]]). Some gases are more effective at trapping heat than others, e.g., SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is 22,200 times more effective a GHG than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a per-kilogram basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Transport===
{{Main|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation emissions account for roughly 1/4 of emissions worldwide, and are even more important in terms of impact in developed nations especially in North America and Australia. Many citizens of countries like the United States and Canada who drive personal cars often, see well over half of their climate change impact stemming from the emissions produced from their cars. Modes of mass transportation such as bus, light rail (metro, subway, etc.), and long-distance rail are far and away the most energy-efficient means of motorized transportation for passengers, able to use in many cases over twenty times less energy per person-distance than a personal automobile. Modern [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient technologies]], such as [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles and [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral synthetic gasoline &amp; Jet fuel]] may also help to reduce the consumption of [[petroleum]], land use changes and emissions of [[carbon dioxide]]. Utilizing [[rail transport]], especially electric rail, over the far less efficient [[environmental impact of aviation|air transport]] and [[road transport|truck transport]]
significantly reduces emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Urban planning===
{{Main|Urban planning}}

Effective [[urban planning]] to reduce [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] aims to decrease Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), lowering emissions from transportation. Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Between 1982 and 1997, the amount of land consumed for [[urban development]] in the United States increased by 47 percent while the nation's population grew by only 17 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.

At the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.

Approaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through "medium-density", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.&lt;!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book "Sustainability and Cities" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.--&gt;

Smarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.

====Building design====

For institutions of higher learning in the United States, greenhouse gas emissions depend primarily on total area of buildings and secondarily on climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fetcher|first=Ned|title=Effects of climate and institution size on greenhouse gas emissions from colleges and universities in the United States|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|date=December 2009|volume=2|issue=6|pages=362–67|doi=10.1089/SUS.2009.9820}}&lt;/ref&gt; If climate is not taken into account, annual greenhouse gas emissions due to energy consumed on campuses plus purchased electricity can be estimated with the formula, ''E=aS''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''a'' =0.001621 metric tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent/square foot or 0.0241 metric tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent/square meter and ''b''= 1.1354.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Colleges and Universities|url=http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/4243.asp|accessdate=2 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106105803/http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/4243.asp|archive-date=2011-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly [[hot water heater]]s and [[furnaces]]), [[insulated glazing|double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows]], external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as [[geothermal heat pump|shallow geothermal]] and [[passive solar]] energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Climate change and agriculture}}
According to the [[EPA]], agricultural [[soil management]] practices can lead to production and emission of [[nitrous oxide]] (N2O), a major [[greenhouse gas]] and air pollutant. Activities that can contribute to {{chem|N|2|O}} emissions include [[fertilizer]] usage, [[irrigation]], and [[tillage]]. The management of soils accounts for over half of the emissions from the Agriculture sector. Cattle livestocks account for one third of emissions, through methane emissions. Manure management and rice cultivation also produce gaseous emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/agriculture.html|title=Agriculture: Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions|year=2015|publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study found that farming can deplete soil carbon and render soil incapable of supporting life; however, the study also showed that [[conservation farming]] can protect carbon in soils, and repair damage over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://eos.org/research-spotlights/conservation-farming-shown-to-protect-carbon-in-soil|title=Conservation Farming Shown to Protect Carbon in Soil|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences|authors=A.

===Societal controls===
{{Main|Personal carbon credits}}

Another method being examined is to make carbon a new currency by introducing tradeable "[[personal carbon credits]]". The idea being it will encourage and motivate individuals to reduce their 'carbon footprint' by the way they live. Each citizen will receive a free annual quota of carbon that they can use to travel, buy food, and go about their business. It has been suggested that by using this concept it could actually solve two problems; pollution and poverty, old age pensioners will actually be better off because they fly less often, so they can cash in their quota at the end of the year to pay heating bills and so forth.{{citation needed|reason=previous source deadlink|date=April 2009}}

===Costs===
The [[Stern Review]] proposes stabilising the concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere at a maximum of 550ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e by 2050. The Review estimates that this would mean cutting total greenhouse-gas emissions to three quarters of 2007 levels. The Review further estimates that the cost of these cuts would be in the range −1.0 to +3.5% of World [[GDP]], (i.e. [[Gross world product|GWP]]), with an average estimate of approximately 1%.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt; Stern has since revised his estimate to 2% of GWP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/26/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange |title=Cost of tackling global climate change has doubled, warns Stern |first= Juliette |last=Jowit |first2= Patrick |last2=Wintour |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 June 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the Gross World Product (GWP) at [[purchasing power parity|PPP]] was estimated at $74.5 trillion in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mitigation costs will also vary according to how and when emissions are cut: early, well-planned action will minimise the costs.&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;Stern, N. (2006). ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change: Part III: The Economics of Stabilisation.'' HM Treasury, London: http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes. Policy makers can compare the [[marginal abatement costs]] of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time. The marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country, by sector, and over time.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt;

This was judged to be especially the case when combined with enhanced adaptation. By 2100, however, it was still judged likely that there would be significant [[effects of global warming]]. This was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced [[adaptive capacity]].

|doi=10.2277/0521568544|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealth, as measured by per capita income (i.e., income per head of population), varies widely between different countries. Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as [[heating]] to stay tolerably warm. In richer countries, emissions tend to be associated with things like [[car]]s, [[central heating]], etc. The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according to wealth.

====Distributing emissions abatement costs====
There have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–105):&lt;ref name=banuri/&gt;
*'''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.
*'''Basic needs''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.
*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the "polluter-pays principle", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:
**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-521-56854-8
|doi=10.2277/0521568544|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**''Comparable burdens and ability to pay'': with this approach, countries would reduce emissions based on comparable burdens and their ability to take on the costs of reduction. Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].
**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit from reducing their emissions.
**''Carbon inheritance'':&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is the notion that we have inherited the (technological) benefits of past emissions, and those who benefit most from them should pay the most. An energy levy has been suggested as a proxy for technological development. Rather than allocating blame for historical emissions, an energy levy pays back the benefits these technologies have brought&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Specific proposals====
*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;106),&lt;ref name=banuri/&gt; for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.
*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.
*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;27).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of these technologies aids mitigation and could result in substantial reductions in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Policies include targets for emissions reductions, increased use of renewable energy, and increased energy efficiency. It is often argued that the results of climate change are more damaging in poor nations, where infrastructures are weak and few social services exist. The [[Commitment to Development Index]] is one attempt to analyze rich country policies taken to reduce their disproportionate use of the global commons. Countries do well if their greenhouse gas emissions are falling, if their gas taxes are high, if they do not subsidize the fishing industry, if they have a low fossil fuel rate per capita, and if they control imports of illegally cut tropical timber.

===Kyoto Protocol===
{{Main|Kyoto Protocol}}

The main current international agreement on combating climate change is the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. On the 11th of December 1997 it was implemented by the 3rd conference of parties, which was coming together in kyoto, which came into force on 16 February 2005. The Kyoto Protocol is an [[wikt:amendment|amendment]] to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|Countries that have ratified this protocol]] have committed to reduce their emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in [[emissions trading]] if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases. For Kyoto reporting, governments are obliged to be told on the present state of the countries forests and the related ongoing processes.

*Policies adopted by parties to the UNFCCC are too weak to meet a 2 or 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C target. However, these targets might still be achievable if more stringent mitigation policies are adopted immediately.
*Cost-effective 2&amp;nbsp;°C scenarios project annual global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before the year 2020, with deep cuts in emissions thereafter, leading to a reduction in 2050 of 41% compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alcamo|others|2013|pp=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Discussion on other targets
Scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change and associated policies, such as reducing GHG emissions. However, deciding what policies are best requires value judgements.&lt;ref name="wg 2 ch19 dangerous climate change"/&gt; For example, limiting global warming to 1&amp;nbsp;°C relative to pre-industrial levels may help to reduce climate change damages more than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C limit.&lt;ref&gt;"Implication for Carbon Emissions Target," in: {{harvnb|Hansen|others|2013|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1&amp;nbsp;°C limit may be more costly to achieve than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C limit.&lt;ref&gt;"4.

Emission taxes can be both cost-effective and environmentally effective.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt; Difficulties with emission taxes include their potential unpopularity, and the fact that they cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions reduction.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt; Emissions or energy taxes also often fall disproportionately on lower income classes. In developing countries, institutions may be insufficiently developed for the collection of emissions fees from a wide variety of sources.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt;

====Subsidies====
According to [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], a program of subsidization balanced against expected flood costs could pay for conversion to 100% renewable power by 2030.&lt;ref name="wws-review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jacobson |first1= M.Z. |year= 2009 |title= Review of solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy security |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100424234910/http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2010-04-24 |format= PDF |journal= Energy and Environmental Science |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |pages= 148–73 |doi= 10.1039/b809990c|citeseerx= 10.1.1.180.4676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobson, and his colleague Mark Delucchi, suggest that the cost to generate and transmit power in 2020 will be less than 4 cents per kilowatt hour (in 2007 dollars) for wind, about 4 cents for wave and hydroelectric, from 4 to 7 cents for geothermal, and 8 cents per kWh for solar, fossil, and nuclear power.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{cite journal|last1= [[Mark Z.

====Investment====
{{See also|Fossil fuel divestment}}

Another indirect method of encouraging uses of renewable energy, and pursue sustainability and environmental protection, is that of prompting investment in this area through legal means, something that is already being done at national level as well as in the field of international investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=Journal of World Energy Law and Business|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon emissions trading====
{{Main|Carbon emissions trading}}

With the creation of a [[market (economics)|market]] for [[carbon emissions trading|trading carbon dioxide emissions]] within the Kyoto Protocol, it is likely that London financial markets will be the centre for this potentially highly lucrative business; the [[NYSE|New York]] and [[Chicago]] stock markets may have a lower trade volume than expected as long as the US maintains its rejection of the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,1509761,00.html How high-pressure politics threatens action on climate] The Observer June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

However, emissions trading may delay the phase-out of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;''StoryOfStuff.com'' (2009) [http://storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ "The Story of Cap and Trade"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722034154/http://www.storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ |date=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north-east United States, a successful cap and trade program has shown potential for this solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceprogress.org/2013/02/success-of-northeast-cap-and-trade-system-shows-market-based-climate-policy-is-well-within-reach/|title=Success of Northeast Cap-and-Trade System Shows Market-Based Climate Policy Is Well Within Reach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS)] from ''ec.europa.eu''&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest multi-national, greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. It commenced operation on 1 January 2005, and all 28 member states of the [[European Union]] participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35&amp;nbsp;billion Euros (US$43&amp;nbsp;billion) per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2570.jsp The $20,000,000,000,000 question] ''Robins, Nick'' for Opendemocracy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] was the first (voluntary) emissions market, and is soon to be followed by Asia's first market ([[Asia Carbon Exchange]]). A total of 107 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been exchanged through projects in 2004, a 38% increase relative to 2003 (78 Mt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e).&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/docs/CarbonMarketStudy2005.pdf State and Trends of the Carbon Market] International Emissions Trading Association 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty three [[multinational corporation]]s have come together in the [[G8 Climate Change Roundtable]], a business group formed at the January 2005 [[World Economic Forum]]. The group includes [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Toyota]], [[British Airways]], and [[BP]]. On 9 June 2005 the Group published a statement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf Statement of G8 Climate Change Roundtable] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508123035/http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf |date=May 8, 2013}} Convened by the World Economic Forum June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; stating that there was a need to act on climate change and claiming that market-based solutions can help. It called on governments to establish "clear, transparent, and consistent price signals" through "creation of a long-term policy framework" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases.

The [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] is a proposed carbon trading scheme being created by nine North-eastern and Mid-Atlantic [[United States|American]] states; [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]]. The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.

===Implementation===
Implementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding====
Implementation requires funding sources but is often beset by disputes over who should provide funds and under what conditions.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; A lack of funding can be a barrier to successful strategies as there are no formal arrangements to finance climate change development and implementation.&lt;ref name="IHDP"&gt;Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat. P, Klostermann.J.E.M (unpublished) Institutional governance barriers for the development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies, Working paper for the International Human Dimensions Programme (IHDP) conference "Earth System Governance: People, Places, and the Planet", December 2–4, Amsterdam, the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; Funding is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Mee. L. D, Dublin. H. T, Eberhard. A. A (2008) Evaluating the Global Environment Facility: A goodwill gesture or a serious attempt to deliver global benefits?, Global Environmental Change 18, 800–810&lt;/ref&gt;

====Problems====
There are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.&lt;ref name="IHDP"/&gt; The issues that arise with a system which involves international government cooperation, such as [[emissions trading|cap and trade]], could potentially be improved with a polycentric approach where the rules are enforced by many small sections of authority as opposed to one overall enforcement agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www10.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04268.pdf |title=A Polycentric Approach for Coping with Climate Change |publisher=World Bank |date=October 2009 |author=Elinor Ostrom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101164212/http://www10.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04268.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-01 |series=Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about metal requirement and/or availability for essential decarbonization technoloqies such as [[photovoltaics]], [[nuclear power]], and (plug-in hybrid) [[electric vehicle]]s have also been expressed as obstacles.&lt;ref name="Tokimatsu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tokimatsu|first1=Koji|last2=Wachtmeister|first2=Henrik|last3=McLellan|first3=Benjamin|last4=Davidsson|first4=Simon|last5=Murakami|first5=Shinsuke|last6=Höök|first6=Mikael|last7=Yasuoka|first7=Rieko|last8=Nishio|first8=Masahiro|title=Energy modeling approach to the global energy-mineral nexus: A first look at metal requirements and the 2 °C target|journal=Applied Energy|date=December 2017|volume=207|pages=494–509|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occurrence====
Despite a perceived lack of occurrence, evidence of implementation is emerging internationally. Some examples of this are the initiation of NAPA's and of joint implementation. Many developing nations have made National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs.&lt;ref name="EMJ"&gt;Preston. B. L, Westaway. R. M, Yuen. E. Y (2004) Climate adaptation planning in practice: an evaluation of adaptation plans from three developed nations, European Management Journal, 22(3) 304–314&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of many of these is supported by GEF agencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2011) Report on the twentieth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group, Subsidiary Body for Implementation, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt; Many developed countries are implementing 'first generation' institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale.&lt;ref name="EMJ"/&gt; There has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the UNFCCC as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2011) Annual report of the Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|Climate change in the United States}}
Efforts to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions by the United States]] include [[energy policy of the United States|energy policies]] which encourage efficiency through programs like [[Energy Star]], [[Commercial Building Integration]], and the [[Industrial Technologies Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/index.html |title=Industrial Technologies Program: BestPractices |publisher=Eere.energy.gov |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 1998, Vice President [[Al Gore]] symbolically signed the Kyoto Protocol, but he indicated participation by the developing nations was necessary prior its being submitted for ratification by the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/12/11/kyoto/ |date=1997-12-11 |title=Clinton Hails Global Warming Pact|work= All Politics|publisher= CNN|accessdate=2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Transportation Secretary [[Mary Peters (politician)|Mary Peters]], with White House approval, urged governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California's first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/09/25/4099/ "How the White House Worked to Scuttle California's Climate Law"], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], September 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Climate Change Science Program|US Climate Change Science Program]] is a group of about twenty federal agencies and US Cabinet Departments, all working together to address global warming.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] pressured American scientists to suppress discussion of global warming, according to the testimony of the Union of Concerned Scientists to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the US House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Reuters, January 30, 2007, free archived version at http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012017/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm |date=2007-02-02 }}, last visited Jan. 30, '07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Written testimony of Dr. Grifo before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web|url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805213620/http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "High-quality science" was "struggling to get out," as the Bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the Bush administration's skepticism, in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist. "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change,' 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications." Similarly, according to the testimony of senior officers of the [[Government Accountability Project]], the White House attempted to bury the report "National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change," produced by US scientists pursuant to US law.&lt;ref&gt;written testimony of Rick Piltz before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web |url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131202854/http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-31 |df=}} last visited Jan. 30, 07&lt;/ref&gt; Some US scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to White House pressure to underreport global warming.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

In the absence of substantial federal action, state governments have adopted emissions-control laws such as the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] in the Northeast and the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/science/earth/in-california-a-grand-experiment-to-rein-in-climate-change.html |work=The New York Times |first=Felicity |last=Barringer |title=In California, a Grand Experiment to Rein in Climate Change |date=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developing countries====
In order to reconcile [[economic development]] with mitigating carbon emissions, [[developing countries]] need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.

An important point of contention, however, is how overseas development assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&amp;title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&amp;nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];
# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;
# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and
# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.
The main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

However, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.

In an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] "which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&amp;Cr=trade&amp;Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-governmental approaches==
While many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.

===Choices in personal actions and business operations===
Environmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]]. Common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage, burning less gasoline, supporting renewable [[energy sources]], buying local products to reduce transportation, turning off unused devices, and various others.

A [[geophysicist]] at [[Utrecht University]] has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation, suggesting the use of communications technologies such as [[videoconferencing]] to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Part of the difficulty is that when [[environmental impact of aviation|aviation emissions]] are made at high altitude, the climate impacts are much greater than otherwise. Others have been raising the related concerns of the increasing [[hypermobility (travel)|hypermobility]] of individuals, whether traveling for business or pleasure, involving frequent and often long distance air travel, as well as air shipment of goods.&lt;ref name="gossling"&gt;Gössling S, Ceron JP, Dubois G, Hall CM, Gössling IS, Upham P, [[Earthscan]] London (2009).

===Business opportunities and risks===
{{Main|Business action on climate change}}

On 9 May 2005 [[Jeff Immelt]], the [[chief executive]] of [[General Electric]] (GE), announced plans to reduce GE's global warming related emissions by one percent by 2012. "GE said that given its projected growth, those emissions would have risen by 40 percent without such action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7791657/ |title=Green Electric? GE unveils eco-strategy |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2005 a group of leading [[airline]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[aerospace]] [[manufacturer]]s pledged to work together to reduce the negative [[environmental impact of aviation]], including limiting the impact of air travel on climate change by improving [[fuel efficiency]] and reducing carbon dioxide emissions of new aircraft by fifty percent per seat kilometre by 2020 from 2000 levels. The group aims to develop a common reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions per aircraft by the end of 2005, and pressed for the early inclusion of aviation in the [[European Union]]'s carbon emission trading scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/747d20ea-e1ff-11d9-bf18-00000e2511c8.html |title=Aviation groups set targets to limit their environmental impact |publisher=FT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investor response===
{{Main|Fossil fuel divestment}}
Climate change is also a concern for large institutional investors who have a long term time horizon and potentially large exposure to the negative impacts of global warming because of the large geographic footprint of their multi-national holdings. SRI ([[Socially responsible investing]]) Funds allow investors to invest in funds that meet high ESG (environmental, social, governance) standards as such funds invest in companies that are aligned with these goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T041-C016-S001-5-mutual-funds-for-socially-responsible-investors.html |title=5 Mutual Funds for Socially Responsible Investors |publisher=Kiplinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proxy firm]]s can be used to draft guidelines for [[investment manager]]s that take these concerns into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ussif.org/files/publications/institutional_climate.pdf |title=Investing to Curb Climate Change |publisher=USSIF |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a legal action for [[negligence]] (or similar) to succeed, "Plaintiffs ... must show that, more probably than not, their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question, as opposed to any other cause. This has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two."&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Columbia J. of Env. Law, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Another route (though with little legal bite) is the [[World Heritage Convention]], if it can be shown that climate change is affecting [[World Heritage Site]]s like [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=4950&amp;method=full |title=Climate change 'ruining' Everest |publisher=Heatisonline.org |date=2004-11-17 |access-date=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2004/11/041117_climate-belize.shtml Climate change 'ruining' Belize] BBC November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides countries suing one another, there are also cases where people in a country have taken legal steps against their own government. Legal action for instance has been taken to try to force the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatelaw.org/cases Climate Justice] Ongoing Cases&lt;/ref&gt; and against the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] and [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]] for failing to assess environmental impacts (including global warming impacts) under [[NEPA]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the Netherlands and Belgium, organisations such as [[Urgenda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling|title=Dutch government ordered to cut carbon emissions in landmark ruling|first=Arthur Neslen The|last=Hague|date=24 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgenda.nl/themas/klimaat-en-energie/klimaatzaak/|title=Klimaat en Energie – Thema's – Urgenda – Samen Sneller Duurzaam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/afleveringen/2015-2016/de-klimaatzaak.html|title=VPRO Tegenlicht|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[vzw Klimaatzaak]] in Belgium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/2.36678|title=Klimaatzaak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klimaatzaak.eu/nl/about/|title=Over ons – Klimaatzaak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also sued their governments as they believe their governments aren't meeting the emission reductions they agreed to. Urgenda have already won their case against the Dutch government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

According to a 2004 study commissioned by [[Friends of the Earth]], [[ExxonMobil]], and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Press release (29 January 2004). [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/exxonmobils_contribution_t_28012004.html Archived press release: Exxonmobil's contribution to global warming revealed]. Friends of the Earth Trust. Retrieved May 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Exxon]] received a subpoena. According to the ''Washington Post'' and confirmed by the company, the attorney general of New York, [[Eric Schneiderman]], opened an investigation into the possibility that the company had misled the public and investors about the risks of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/05/exxonmobil-under-investigation-for-misleading-the-public-about-climate-change/ |title=New York is investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change |publisher=The Washington Post |date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A consumer-led response to climate change===

Low carbon investment and [[ethical banking]] has been suggested as a tactic to allow consumers to drive a low-carbon transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Roughly 5% of OECD disposable income is saved[https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-savings.htm], and could alternately be saved in low-carbon investment funds to substantially increase overall low-carbon investment. 

Voluntarily funded, low-carbon investment funds have been suggested as a way to provide revenue for adaptation costs in the post-fossil fuel era&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is suggested that voluntary donations can be invested, rather than spent, and long-term returns used to pay for adaptation costs.

The '''cognitive elite''' of a [[society]], according to [[Richard J. Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], are those having higher [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] levels and thus better prospects for success in life. The development of a cognitive elite during the 20th century is presented in their 1994 book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. In this book, Herrnstein and Murray propose that the cognitive elite has been produced by a more technological society which offers enough high skill jobs for those with a higher intelligence to fill. They also propose that by removing [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]] or [[social class|class]] as criteria the main criteria of success in academic and professional life is becoming primarily based on cognitive ability.

[[Educational psychology|Educational psychologist]] [[Linda Gottfredson]] wrote:
{{cquote|Differences in intelligence matter. For members of the cognitive elite to maintain otherwise is like the rich arguing that money does not matter. Differences in ''[[General intelligence factor|g]]'' affect the lives of individuals and families. They help shape the social order and limit our ability to reshape it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf Why g matters]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is a stricter (more precise) technical definition of synonymy, specifically for theoretical (e.g., [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philosophical]]) purposes.

==Overview==
If a word is cognitively synonymous with another word, they refer to the same thing independently of [[context (language use)|context]]. Thus, a word is cognitively synonymous with another word [[if and only if]] all instances of both words express the same exact thing, and the referents are [[modal logic|necessarily]] [[identity (philosophy)|identical]], which means that the words' interchangeability is not [[wikt:context-sensitive|context-sensitive]].

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] used the concept of cognitive synonymy extensively in his famous 1951 paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", where two words were cognitively synonymous if they were interchangeable in every possible instance.&lt;ref name="Hanna_2005"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hanna |first=Patricia |year=2005 |title=''Cognitive Synonymy'', from Notes on "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~phanna/classes/ling5030/webpostings/notestwodogmas/node14.html |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Citation |last=Quine |first=Willard Van Orman |year=1951 |title=Two dogmas of empiricism |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=60 |issue= |pages=20–43 |url=http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html |doi= |postscript=. Reprinted in his 1953 book ''From a Logical Point of View''. Harvard University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example,
* All bachelors are unmarried men.
* All unmarried men are not married.

Quine notes that if one is [[use-mention distinction|referring to the word itself]], this doesn't apply, as in,
* ''Bachelor'' has fewer than ten letters.

As compared to the substitution which is obviously false,
* "Unmarried men" has less than ten letters.

The '''contrast ratio''' is a property of a display system, defined as the [[ratio]] of the [[luminance]] of the brightest color (white) to that of the darkest color (black) that the system is capable of producing. A high contrast ratio is a desired aspect of any display. It has similarities with [[dynamic range]].

There is no official, standardized way to measure contrast ratio for a system or its parts, nor is there a standard for defining "Contrast Ratio" that is accepted by any standards organization so ratings provided by different manufacturers of display devices are not necessarily comparable to each other due to differences in method of measurement, operation, and unstated variables.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Powell. [http://www.projectorcentral.com/contrast_ratios.htm Let's Ignore Contrast Specs]. March 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Manufacturers have traditionally favored measurement methods that isolate the device from the system, whereas other designers have more often taken the effect of the room into account. An ideal room would absorb all the light reflecting from a [[projection screen]] or emitted by a [[cathode ray tube]], and the only light seen in the room would come from the display device. With such a room, the contrast ratio of the [[image]] would be the same as the contrast ratio of the [[display device|device]]. Real rooms reflect some of the light back to the displayed image, lowering the contrast ratio seen in the image.

'''Static contrast ratio''' is the luminosity ratio comparing the brightest and darkest color the system is capable of producing simultaneously at any instant of time, while '''dynamic contrast ratio''' is the luminosity ratio comparing the brightest and darkest color the system is capable of producing over time (while the picture is moving). Moving from a system that displays a static motionless image to a system that displays a dynamic, changing picture slightly complicates the definition of the contrast ratio, due to the need to take into account the extra temporal dimension to the measuring process.

== Methods of measurement ==

Many display devices favor the use of the ''full on/full off'' method of measurement, as it cancels out the effect of the room and results in an ideal ratio. Equal proportions of light reflect from the display to the room and back in both "black" and "white" measurements, as long as the room stays the same. This will inflate the light levels of both  measurements proportionally, leaving the black to white luminance ratio unaffected.

Some manufacturers have gone as far as using different device parameters for the three tests, even further inflating the calculated contrast ratio. With [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] projectors, one method to do this is to enable the clear sector of the color filter wheel for the ''"on"'' part and disable it for the ''"off"'' part&lt;ref name=practical&gt;''www.practical-home-theater-guide.com''. [http://www.practical-home-theater-guide.com/contrast-ratio.html Extensive coverage of practical contrast ratio]&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice is rather dubious, as it will be impossible to reproduce such contrast ratios with any useful image content.

Another measure is the ''[[ANSI]] contrast'', in which the measurement is done with a checker board patterned test image where the black and white luminosity values are measured simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carltonbale.com/the-truth-about-inflated-hdtv-contrast-ratios The Truth About Inflated HDTV Contrast Ratios]. August 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a more realistic measure of system capability, but includes the potential of including the effects of the room into the measurement, if the test is not performed in a room that is close to ideal.

It is useful to note that the ''full on/full off'' method effectively measures the dynamic contrast ratio of a display, while the ''ANSI contrast'' measures the static contrast ratio.

== Dynamic contrast (DC) ==
A notable recent development{{When|date=July 2017}} in LCD technology is '''dynamic contrast''' (DC), also called '''advanced contrast ratio''' (ACR) and various other designations. When there is a need to display a dark image, a display that supports dynamic contrast underpowers the backlight lamp (or decreases the aperture of the projector's lens using an iris), but proportionately amplifies the transmission through the LCD panel; this gives the benefit of realizing the potential static contrast ratio of the LCD panel in dark scenes when the image is watched in a dark room. The drawback is that if a dark scene contains small areas of superbright light, the resulting image will be over exposed.

The trick for the display is to determine how much of the highlights may be unnoticeably blown out in a given image under the given ambient lighting conditions.

Brightness, as it is most often used in marketing literature, refers to the emitted luminous intensity on screen, measured in [[candela per square metre]] (cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The higher the number, the brighter the screen.

It is also common to market only the dynamic contrast ratio capability of a display (when it is better than its static contrast ratio only on paper), which should not be directly compared to the static contrast ratio. A plasma display with a 4,000,000:1 static contrast ratio will show superior contrast to an LCD (with LED or CCFL backlight) with 30,000,000:1 dynamic and 20,000:1 static contrast ratio when the input signal contains a full range of brightnesses from 0 to 100% simultaneously. They will, however, be on par when input signal ranges only from 0 to 20% brightness.

== Contrast ratio in a real room ==
In marketing literature, contrast ratios for emissive (as opposed to reflective) displays are always measured under the optimum condition of a room in total darkness. In typical viewing situations, the contrast ratio is significantly lower due to the reflection of light from the surface of the display, making it harder to distinguish between different devices with very high contrast ratios.&lt;ref name=realenv&gt;''www.poynton.com''. [http://www.poynton.com/notes/Timo/Weber_and_contrast_ratio.html On practical contrast ratios in real environments]&lt;/ref&gt; How much the room light reduces the contrast ratio depends on the [[luminance]] of the display, as well as the amount of light reflecting off the display.&lt;ref&gt;HomeTheaterMag.com - [http://blog.hometheatermag.com/geoffreymorrison/111705contrast/ Contrast Ratio – The Useless Statistic]&lt;/ref&gt;

A clean print at a typical [[movie theater]] may have a contrast ratio of 500:1,&lt;ref name=dalite&gt;''www.da-lite.com''. [http://www.da-lite.com/education/angles_of_view.php?action=details&amp;issueid=56 Contrast - From Dark to Light]. Angles of View vol. III.&lt;/ref&gt; a transmissive digital projector is around 200:1, and a reflective digital projector (i.e. DLP) is around 500:1 under nearly ideal circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Evan|title=Let's Ignore Contrast Specs|url=http://www.projectorcentral.com/contrast_ratios.htm?page=Projector-Central-Measurements|website=ProjectorCentral.com|accessdate=11 March 2016|date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern computer LCD monitor is typically at 1000:1,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite web|title=Apple Thunderbolt Display|url=https://www.apple.com/displays/specs.html|publisher=Apple|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TVs might be over 4000:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Demers|first1=Cedric|title=Contrast Ratio of 2015 TVs|url=http://www.rtings.com/info/contrast-ratio-tvs|website=rtings.com|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic contrast ratio is usually measured at factory with two panels (one versus another) of the same model as each panel will have an inherent dark and light (hot) spot. Static is usually measured with the same screen showing half screen full bright vs half screen full dark. This usually results in a lower ratio as brightness will creep into the dark area of the screen thus giving a higher luminance.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2672">In the [[philosophy of perception]], '''critical realism''' is the theory that some of our [[sense-data]] (for example, those of [[primary qualities]]) can and do accurately represent external objects, properties, and events, while other of our sense-data (for example, those of [[secondary qualities]] and perceptual illusions) do not accurately represent any external objects, properties, and events. Put simply, critical realism highlights a mind-dependent aspect of the world that reaches to understand (and comes to an understanding of) the mind-independent world.

==Locke==
According to [[John Locke|Locke]], some [[sense-data]], namely the [[sense-data]] of secondary qualities, do not represent anything in the external world, even if they are caused by external qualities (primary qualities). Thus it is natural to adopt a theory of critical realism.

By its talk of sense-data and representation, this theory depends on or presupposes the truth of [[Direct and indirect realism|representationalism]]. If critical realism is correct, then [[Direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] would have to be a correct theory of perception.{{Citation needed|reason=either a source or an expanded logics is needed|date=May 2010}}

==American critical realism==
The American critical realist movement was a response both to [[direct realism]], as well as to [[idealism]] and [[pragmatism]].  In very broad terms, American critical realism was a form of [[representative realism]], in which there are objects that stand as mediators between independent real objects and perceivers. Prominent developers of American critical realism are [[Roy Wood Sellars]] and his son [[Wilfrid Sellars]].&lt;ref&gt;Willem deVries, 2014. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars Wilfrid Sellars]," ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Aug. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

One innovation was that these mediators are not ideas ([[British empiricism]]), but properties, essences, or "character complexes".

==British critical realism==
Similar developments occurred in the UK.  Major figures included [[Samuel Alexander]], [[John Cook Wilson]],  [[H. A. Prichard]], [[H. H. Price]], and [[C. D. Broad]].

==German critical realism==
[[Nicolai Hartmann]] renewed the interest in the critical realist theory in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Schnädelbach, ''Philosophy in Germany 1831-1933'', Cambridge UP, 1984, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evidence of absence''' is [[evidence]] of any kind that suggests something is missing or that it does not exist.

Per the traditional [[aphorism]], "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," positive evidence of this kind is distinct from a lack of evidence or ignorance&lt;ref name="Turvey2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=B.E. |last=Turvey |year=2008 |title=Criminal Profiling: An Introduction to Behavioral Evidence Analysis |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780123741004 |lccn=2008274380 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oge7LFaN5xYC&amp;pg=PA267 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; of that which should have been found already, had it existed.&lt;ref name="Martin2007"&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Martin |year=2007 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism |series=Cambridge Companions to Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521842709 |lccn=2006005949 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&amp;pg=PA70 |page=70 |quote=[Advocates] of the presumption of atheism... insist that it is precisely the absence of evidence for theism that justifies their claim that God does not exist. The problem with such a position is captured neatly by the aphorism, beloved of forensic scientists, that "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." The absence of evidence is evidence of absence only in case in which, were the postulated entity to exist, we should expect to have more evidence of its existence than we do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard [[Irving Copi]] writes:{{quote |In some circumstances it can be safely assumed that if a certain event had occurred, evidence of it could be discovered by qualified investigators. In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence. |Copi |''Introduction to Logic'' (1953), p. 95}}

==Overview==
The [[Argument from ignorance#Distinguishing absence of evidence from evidence of absence|difference]] between evidence that something is absent (e.g., an observation that suggests there were no dragons here today) and a simple absence of evidence (e.g., no careful research has been done) can be nuanced. Indeed, scientists will often debate whether an experiment's result should be considered evidence of absence, or if it remains absence of evidence. The debate is whether the experiment would have detected the phenomenon of interest if it was there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vision and Visual Perception The Conscious Base of Seeing|last=Schreuder |first= Duco A.|year=2014 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[argument from ignorance]] for "absence of evidence" isn't necessarily fallacious, for example, that a potentially life saving new drug poses no long term health risk unless proved otherwise. On the other hand, were such an argument to rely imprudently on the ''lack'' of research to promote its conclusion, it would be considered an [[informal fallacy]] whereas the former can be a persuasive way to shift the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in an argument or [[debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walton |first=Douglas |title=Nonfallacious arguments from ignorance |publisher=American Philosophical Quarterly |year=1992 |pages=381–387 |url=http://dougwalton.ca/papers%20in%20pdf/92nonfallacious.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Sagan]] criticized such "impatience with ambiguity" with cosmologist [[Martin Rees]]' maxim, "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altman|first1=Douglas G|last2=Bland|first2=J Martin|title=Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence|journal=British Medical Journal|date=1995|volume=311|issue=19 August|page=485|pmid=7647644|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/311/7003/485.long|accessdate=19 December 2016|pmc=2550545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark |last=Sagan |first=Carl |authorlink= Carl Sagan |year= 1997 |edition=1st |page=213 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books|Ballantine]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-345-40946-9 |oclc=32855551 |quote=Appeal to ignorance—the claim that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa (e.g., ''There is no compelling evidence that UFOs are not visiting the Earth; therefore UFOs exist—and there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe.'' Or: ''There may be seventy kazillion other worlds, but not one is known to have the moral advancement of the Earth, so we're still central to the Universe.'') This impatience with ambiguity can be criticized in the phrase: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Attic-roof-DE-0a.jpg|thumb|200px|An [[Proof by exhaustion|exhaustive inspection]] of the attic for vermin can provide evidence of absence, but any sign of mice will always suffice to the contrary.]]
In carefully designed [[science|scientific]] experiments, even [[null result]]s can be evidence of absence. For instance, a hypothesis may be [[falsifiability|falsified]] if a vital predicted observation is not found [[empiricism|empirically]]. (At this point, the underlying [[hypothesis]] may be rejected or revised and sometimes, additional [[ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc explanations]] may even be warranted.) Whether the [[scientific community]] will accept a null result as evidence of absence depends on many factors, including the [[statistical power|detection power]] of the applied methods, the [[confidence interval|confidence]] of the inference, as well as confirmation bias within the community.

===Proof and evidence===
{{main|problem of induction}}

The [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian]] skeptic, [[Sextus Empiricus]], questioned the [[apodicticity]] of [[inductive reasoning]] because a [[universal rule]] cannot be established from an incomplete set of [[particular]] instances: "When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars. But if they review some, the induction will be insecure, since some of the particulars omitted in the induction may contravene the universal; while if they are to review all, they will be toiling at the impossible, since the particulars are infinite and indefinite".&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' trans. [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.G. Bury]] (Loeb edition) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Until about the middle of the previous century induction was treated as a quite specific method of inference: inference of a [[universal affirmative]] proposition (All swans are white) from its instances (a is a white swan, b is a white swan, etc.) The method had also a probabilistic form, in which the conclusion stated a probabilistic connection between the properties in question... The Oxford English Dictionary defines “induction”, in the sense relevant here, as follows: "[The] process of inferring a general law or principle from the observation of particular instances..."

[Much] of what contemporary [[epistemology]], logic, and the philosophy of science count as induction infers neither from observation nor from particulars and does not lead to general laws or principles. [Induction] was understood to be what we now know as ''[[enumerative induction]] or universal inference''; inference from particular instances:
:''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', …, ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are all ''F''s that are also ''G''... [to a general law or principle] All ''F''s are ''G''.

A weaker form of enumerative induction, singular predictive inference, leads not to a generalization but to a singular prediction:
:1. ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', …, ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are all ''F''s that are also ''G''.
:2. ''a&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also ''F''... [therefore]
:3. ''a&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also ''G''.

Singular predictive inference also has a more general probabilistic form:
:1. The proportion ''p'' of observed ''F''s have also been ''G''s.
:2. ''a'', not yet observed, is an ''F''... [therefore]
:3. The probability that ''a'' is ''G'' is ''p''.&lt;ref name="sep-induction-problem"&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Vickers |editor=Edward N.

==Proving a negative==
A [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] claim is a colloquialism for an affirmative claim that asserts the non-existence or exclusion of something.&lt;ref name="Hales4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hales|first=Steven D.|date=Summer 2005|title=Thinking tools: You ''can'' prove a negative|url=http://departments.bloomu.edu/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/proveanegative.pdf|journal=[[Think (journal)|Think]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=4|issue=10|pages=109–112|doi=10.1017/S1477175600001287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that it is impossible to prove a negative is a pseudologic, because there are many proofs that substantiate negative claims in mathematics, science, and economics, including [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]. There can be multiple claims within a [[debate]]. Nevertheless, whoever makes a claim carries the burden of proof regardless of positive or negative content in the claim.

A negative claim may or may not exist as a counterpoint to a previous claim. A [[proof of impossibility]] or an evidence of absence argument are typical methods to fulfill the burden of proof for a negative claim.&lt;ref name="Hales4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Attacking Faulty Reasoning|Attacking faulty reasoning: a practical guide to fallacy-free arguments]]|last=Damer|first=T.

Philosopher Steven Hales argues that typically one can logically be as confident with the negation of an affirmation. Hales says that if one's [[epistemology|standards]] of [[certainty]] leads them to say "there is never 'proof' of [[non-existence]]", then they must also say that "there is never 'proof' of ''existence'' either". Hales argues that there are many cases where we may be able to prove something does not exist with as much certainty as proving something does exist.&lt;ref name="Hales"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://departments.bloomu.edu/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/proveanegative.pdf |first=Steven D. |last=Hales |title=Thinking Tools: You ''can'' Prove a Negative |journal=Think |doi=10.1017/S1477175600001287 |year=2005 |pages=109–112 |issue=10 |volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fa''' ({{zh|s=法}};{{IPA-cmn|fà}}) is a concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] that covers ethics, logic, and law. It can be translated as "law" in some contexts, but more often as "model" or "standard." First gaining importance in the [[Mohism|Mohist]] school of thought, the concept was principally elaborated in [[Chinese Legalism|Legalism]]. In [[Han Fei]]'s philosophy, the king is the sole source of ''fa'' (law), taught to the common people so that there would be a harmonious society free of chance occurrences, disorder, and "appeal to privilege". High officials were not to be held above ''fa'' (law or protocol), nor were they to be allowed to independently create their own ''fa'', uniting both [[Fiat (policy debate)|executive fiat]] and [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Han Fei. (2003). Basic Writings. Columbia University Press: New York, p. 7, 21- 28, 40, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]], a philosopher that would end up being foundational in [[Han dynasty]] [[Confucianism]], also took up ''fa'', suggesting that it could only be properly assessed by the Confucian [[Sage (Sophos)|sage]] (ruler), and that the most important ''fa'' were the very rituals that Mozi had ridiculed for their ostentatious waste and lack of benefit for the people at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Robins |first=Dan |title=Xunzi |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Fall 2008 |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/xunzi/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohism and the School of Names==
The concept of ''fa'' first gained importance in the [[Mohism|Mohist]] school of thought. To [[Mozi]], a standard must stand "three tests" in order to determine its efficacy and morality.&lt;ref name="University of Idaho Press"&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/308/mozipp.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these tests was its origin; if the standard had precedence in the actions or thought of the semi-mythological [[Three Sovereigns and the Five Emperors|sage kings]] of the [[Xia dynasty]] whose examples are frequently cited in classical Chinese philosophy. The second test was one of validity; does the model stand up to evidence in the estimation of the people? The third and final test was one of applicability; this final one is a [[utilitarian]] estimation of the net good that, if implemented, the standard would have on both the people and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Mozi. (2003). Basic Writings. Burton Watson, Ed. Columbia University Press: New York, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The third test speaks to the fact that to the Mohists, a ''fa'' was not simply an abstract model, but an active tool. The real-world use and practical application of ''fa'' were vital. Yet ''fa'' as models were also used in later Mohist logic as principles used in [[Inference|deductive]] reasoning. As classical Chinese philosophical logic was based on [[analogy]] rather than [[syllogism]], ''fa'' were used as benchmarks to determine the validity of logical claims through comparison. There were three ''fa'' in particular that were used by these later Mohists (or "[[School of Names|Logicians]]") to assess such claims, which were mentioned earlier. The first was considered a "root" standard, a concern for precedence and origin. The second, a "source", a concern for [[empiricism]]. The third, a "use", a concern for the [[Consequentialism|consequence]] and pragmatic utility of a standard. These three ''fa'' were used by the Mohists to both promote social welfare and denounce ostentation or wasteful spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=Chris |title=Mohism |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2010 |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/mohism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Gasification''' is a process that converts [[biomass|organic]]- or [[fossil fuel]]-based [[carbonaceous]] materials into [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures (&gt;700&amp;nbsp;°C), without combustion, with a controlled amount of [[oxygen]] and/or [[steam]]. The resulting gas mixture is called [[syngas]] (from synthesis gas) or [[producer gas]] and is itself a fuel. The power derived from gasification and combustion of the resultant gas is considered to be a source of [[renewable energy]] if the gasified compounds were obtained from biomass.&lt;ref name="nnfcc"&gt;{{cite web| author =[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]|url= http://wiki.gekgasifier.com/f/Review+of+Biomass+Gasification+Technologies.NNFCC.Jun09.pdf |title =Review of Technologies for Gasification of Biomass and Wastes, NNFCC project 09/008|accessdate = 2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomass.uk.com/gasification.php The Clean and Renewable Energy Source], biomass.uk.com, accessed 16.05.11 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910155717/http://www.biomass.uk.com/gasification.php |date=2011-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gastechnology.org/webroot/app/xn/xd.aspx?it=enweb&amp;xd=iea/homepage.xml Thermal Gasification of Biomass, International Energy Agency Task 33], http://www.gastechnology.org, accessed 16.05.11 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509002845/http://www.gastechnology.org/webroot/app/xn/xd.aspx?it=enweb&amp;xd=iea%2Fhomepage.xml |date=2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://waste-management-world.com/a/plasma-gasification-clean-renewable-fuel-through-vaporization-of-waste|title = Plasma gasification: Clean renewable fuel through vaporization of waste |website = www.waste-management-world.com|accessdate = May 16, 2011|date =January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of gasification is that using the syngas (synthesis gas H2/CO) is potentially more efficient than direct combustion of the original fuel because it can be combusted at higher temperatures or even in [[fuel cell]]s, so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by [[Carnot's rule]] is higher or (in case of fuel cells) not applicable. Syngas may be burned directly in [[internal combustion engines|gas engines]], used to produce [[methanol]] and hydrogen, or converted via the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] into [[synthetic fuel]]. Gasification can also begin with material which would otherwise have been disposed of such as [[organic waste|biodegradable waste]]. In addition, the high-temperature process refines out corrosive ash elements such as [[chloride]] and [[potassium]], allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels. Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Higman and Maarten van der Burgt. ''Gasification'', Second Edition, Elsevier (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Adler Diplomat 3 GS mit Holzgasgenerator-hinten rechts.JPG|thumb|right|[[Adler Diplomat]] 3 with gas generator (1941)]]

The process of producing energy using the gasification method has been in use for more than 180 years. In the early time [[coal]] and [[peat]] were used to power these plants. Initially developed to produce [[town gas]] for lighting and cooking in the 1800s, this was replaced by electricity and [[natural gas]], it was also used in [[blast furnaces]] but the bigger role was played in the production of [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] chemicals where it has been in use since the 1920s.

During both [[world wars]], especially the [[World War II]], the need for fuel produced by gasification reemerged due to the shortage of petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://membres.lycos.fr/rotarysu/nouvelle.htm Gas Generator Project] History of the Gasogene technology&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wood gas generator]]s, called Gasogene or Gazogène, were used to power motor vehicles in [[Europe]]. By 1945 there were trucks, buses and agricultural machines that were powered by gasification. It is estimated that there were close to 9,000,000 vehicles running on producer gas all over the world.

==Chemical reactions==
In a gasifier, the carbonaceous material undergoes several different processes:
[[File:pyrolysis.svg|frame|Pyrolysis of carbonaceous fuels]]
[[File:gasification.gif|frame|Gasification of char]]
# The [[dehydration reaction|dehydration]] or drying process occurs at around 100&amp;nbsp;°C.  Typically the resulting steam is mixed into the gas flow and may be involved with subsequent chemical reactions, notably the water-gas reaction if the temperature is sufficiently high (see step #5).
# The ''[[pyrolysis]]'' (or devolatilization) process occurs at around 200–300&amp;nbsp;°C.  Volatiles are released and [[charring|char]] is produced, resulting in up to 70% weight loss for coal. The process is dependent on the properties of the carbonaceous material and determines the structure and composition of the char, which will then undergo gasification reactions.
# The ''[[combustion]]'' process occurs as the volatile products and some of the char react with oxygen to primarily form carbon dioxide and small amounts of carbon monoxide, which provides heat for the subsequent gasification reactions. Letting '''C''' represent a carbon-containing [[organic compound]], the basic reaction here is &lt;math&gt;{\rm C} + {\rm O}_2 \rarr {\rm CO}_2&lt;/math&gt;
# The ''gasification'' process occurs as the char reacts with steam to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen, via the reaction &lt;math&gt;{\rm C} + {\rm H}_2 {\rm O} \rarr {\rm H}_2 + {\rm CO}&lt;/math&gt;
# In addition, the [[reversible reaction|reversible]] gas phase [[water-gas shift reaction]] reaches [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] very fast at the temperatures in a gasifier. This balances the concentrations of carbon monoxide, steam, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. &lt;math&gt;{\rm CO} + {\rm H}_2 {\rm O} \lrarr {\rm CO}_2 + {\rm H}_2&lt;/math&gt;

In essence, a limited amount of oxygen or air is introduced into the reactor to allow some of the organic material to be "burned" to produce carbon dioxide and energy, which drives a second reaction that converts further organic material to hydrogen and additional carbon dioxide. Further reactions occur when the formed carbon monoxide and residual [[water]] from the organic material react to form methane and excess carbon dioxide (&lt;math&gt;4 {\rm CO} + 2 {\rm H}_2{\rm O} \rarr {\rm CH}_4 + 3 {\rm CO}_2&lt;/math&gt;). This third reaction occurs more abundantly in reactors that increase the [[Residence time distribution|residence time]] of the reactive gases and organic materials, as well as heat and pressure. [[Catalysts]] are used in more sophisticated reactors to improve reaction rates, thus moving the system closer to the reaction equilibrium  for a fixed residence time.

==Processes==
[[File:Gasifier types.svg|500px|thumb|Main gasifier types]]
Several types of gasifiers are currently available for commercial use: counter-current fixed bed, co-current fixed bed, [[fluidized bed]], entrained flow, plasma, and free radical.&lt;ref name="nnfcc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beychok, M.R., ''Process and environmental technology for producing SNG and liquid fuels'', U.S. EPA report EPA-660/2-75-011, May 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beychok, M.R., ''Coal gasification for clean energy'', Energy Pipelines and Systems, March 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beychok, M.R., ''Coal gasification and the Phenosolvan process'', American Chemical Society 168th National Meeting, Atlantic City, September 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-current fixed bed ("up draft") gasifier===
A fixed bed of carbonaceous fuel (e.g. coal or biomass) through which the "gasification agent" (steam, oxygen and/or air) flows in counter-current configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Thanapal SS, Annamalai K, Sweeten J, Gordillo G, (2011), “Fixed bed gasification of dairy biomass with enriched air mixture”. Appl Energy, doi:10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.11.072&lt;/ref&gt; The ash is either removed in the dry condition or as a [[slag]]. The slagging gasifiers have a lower ratio of steam to carbon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|title=Development Status of BGL-Gasification|url=http://www.iec.tu-freiberg.de/conference/conference_05/pdf/21_Picard.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Kamka|first1=Frank|last2=Jochmann|first2=Andreas|date=June 2005|conference=International Freiberg Conference on IGCC &amp; XtL Technologies|others=speaker Lutz Picard|accessdate=2011-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095948/http://www.iec.tu-freiberg.de/conference/conference_05/pdf/21_Picard.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieving temperatures higher than the ash fusion temperature. The nature of the gasifier means that the fuel must have high mechanical strength and must ideally be non-caking so that it will form a permeable bed, although recent developments have reduced these restrictions to some extent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} The throughput for this type of gasifier is relatively low. Thermal efficiency is high as the temperatures in the gas exit are relatively low. However, this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures, so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use. The tar can be recycled to the reactor.

In the gasification of fine, undensified biomass such as [[rice husks|rice hulls]], it is necessary to blow air into the reactor by means of a fan. This creates very high gasification temperature, as high as 1000 C. Above the gasification zone, a bed of fine and hot char is formed, and as the gas is blow forced through this bed, most complex hydrocarbons are broken down into simple components of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Co-current fixed bed ("down draft") gasifier===
Similar to the counter-current type, but the gasification agent gas flows in co-current configuration with the fuel (downwards, hence the name "down draft gasifier"). Heat needs to be added to the upper part of the bed, either by combusting small amounts of the fuel or from external heat sources. The produced gas leaves the gasifier at a high temperature, and most of this heat is often transferred to the gasification agent added in the top of the bed, resulting in an energy efficiency on level with the counter-current type. Since all tars must pass through a hot bed of char in this configuration, tar levels are much lower than the counter-current type.

===Fluidized bed reactor===

The fuel is [[fluidization|fluidized]] in oxygen and steam or air. The ash is removed dry or as heavy agglomerates that defluidize. The temperatures are relatively low in dry ash gasifiers, so the fuel must be highly reactive; low-grade coals are particularly suitable. The agglomerating gasifiers have slightly higher temperatures, and are suitable for higher rank coals. Fuel throughput is higher than for the fixed bed, but not as high as for the entrained flow gasifier. The conversion efficiency can be rather low due to [[elutriation]] of carbonaceous material.  Recycle or subsequent combustion of solids can be used to increase conversion. Fluidized bed gasifiers are most useful for fuels that form highly corrosive ash that would damage the walls of slagging gasifiers. Biomass fuels generally contain high levels of corrosive ash.

===Entrained flow gasifier===
A dry pulverized solid, an atomized liquid fuel or a fuel slurry is gasified with oxygen (much less frequent: air) in co-current flow. The gasification reactions take place in a dense cloud of very fine particles. Most coals are suitable for this type of gasifier because of the high [[operating temperature]]s and because the coal particles are well separated from one another.

The high temperatures and pressures also mean that a higher throughput can be achieved, however thermal efficiency is somewhat lower as the gas must be cooled before it can be cleaned with existing technology. The high temperatures also mean that tar and methane are not present in the product gas; however the oxygen requirement is higher than for the other types of gasifiers. All entrained flow gasifiers remove the major part of the ash as a slag as the operating temperature is well above the ash fusion temperature.

A smaller fraction of the ash is produced either as a very fine dry [[fly ash]] or as a black colored fly ash slurry. Some fuels, in particular certain types of biomasses, can form slag that is corrosive for ceramic inner walls that serve to protect the gasifier outer wall. However some entrained flow type of gasifiers do not possess a ceramic inner wall but have an inner water or steam cooled wall covered with partially solidified slag. These types of gasifiers do not suffer from corrosive slags.

Some fuels have ashes with very high ash fusion temperatures. In this case mostly limestone is mixed with the fuel prior to gasification. Addition of a little limestone will usually suffice for the lowering the fusion temperatures. The fuel particles must be much smaller than for other types of gasifiers. This means the fuel must be pulverized, which requires somewhat more energy than for the other types of gasifiers. By far the most energy consumption related to entrained flow gasification is not the milling of the fuel but the production of oxygen used for the gasification.

===Plasma gasifier===
In a [[Plasma gasification|plasma gasifier]] a high-voltage current is fed to a torch, creating a high-temperature arc. The inorganic residue is retrieved as a glass like substance.

==Feedstock==
There are a large number of different feedstock types for use in a gasifier, each with different characteristics, including size, shape, bulk density, moisture content, energy content, chemical composition, ash fusion characteristics, and homogeneity of all these properties. Coal and petroleum coke are used as primary feedstocks for many large gasification plants worldwide. Additionally, a variety of biomass and waste-derived feedstocks can be gasified, with wood pellets and chips, waste wood, plastics and aluminium, [[Municipal Solid Waste]] (MSW), [[Refuse-derived fuel]] (RDF), agricultural and industrial wastes, sewage sludge, switch grass, discarded seed corn, corn stover and other crop residues all being used.&lt;ref name="nnfcc"/&gt;

[[Chemrec]] has developed a process for gasification of [[black liquor]].&lt;ref name="chemrec"/&gt;

===Waste disposal===
[[File:HTCW reactor.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|HTCW reactor, one of several proposed waste gasification processes.]]

Waste gasification has several advantages over incineration:
* The necessary extensive flue gas cleaning may be performed on the syngas instead of the much larger volume of [[flue gas]] after combustion.
* [[Electric power]] may be generated in [[internal combustion engine|engines]] and [[gas turbine]]s, which are much cheaper and more efficient than the [[Rankine cycle|steam cycle]] used in incineration. Even fuel cells may potentially be used, but these have rather severe requirements regarding the purity of the gas.
* Chemical processing ([[Gas to liquids]]) of the syngas may produce other synthetic fuels instead of electricity.
* Some gasification processes treat ash containing heavy metals at very high temperatures so that it is released in a glassy and chemically stable form.

A major challenge for waste gasification technologies is to reach an acceptable (positive) gross electric efficiency. The high efficiency of converting syngas to electric power is counteracted by significant power consumption in the waste preprocessing, the consumption of large amounts of pure oxygen (which is often used as gasification agent), and gas cleaning. Another challenge becoming apparent when implementing the processes in real life is to obtain long service intervals in the plants, so that it is not necessary to close down the plant every few months for cleaning the reactor.

Environmental advocates have called gasification "incineration in disguise" and argue that the technology is still dangerous to air quality and public health.  "Since 2003 numerous proposals for waste treatment facilities hoping to use... gasification technologies failed to receive final approval to operate when the claims of project proponents did not withstand public and governmental scrutiny of key claims," according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.no-burn.org/downloads/Incinerators%20in%20Disguise:%20Case%20Studies%20of%20Gasification,%20Pyrolysis,%20and%20Plasma%20in%20Europe,%20Asia,%20and%20the%20United%20States%20.pdf |title=GAIA Report |access-date=2013-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503091440/http://www.no-burn.org/downloads/Incinerators%20in%20Disguise:%20Case%20Studies%20of%20Gasification,%20Pyrolysis,%20and%20Plasma%20in%20Europe,%20Asia,%20and%20the%20United%20States%20.pdf |archive-date=2012-05-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One facility which operated from 2009–2011 in Ottawa had 29 "emissions incidents" and 13 "spills" over those three years.

Several waste gasification processes have been proposed, but few have yet been built and tested, and only a handful have been implemented as plants processing real waste, and most of the time in combination with fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/wtd/679004/679021/679065/ Gasification case studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060804215602/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/wtd/679004/679021/679065/ |date=2006-08-04 }} by the [[Environment Agency]] of England and Wales&lt;/ref&gt;

One plant (in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], Japan using the Thermoselect process&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermoselect.com Thermoselect website] — A waste gasification plant supplier&lt;/ref&gt;) has been processing industrial waste with natural gas and purified oxygen since year 2000, but has not yet documented positive net energy production from the process.

In 2007 [[Ze-gen]] erected a waste gasification demonstration facility in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. The facility was designed to demonstrate gasification of specific non-MSW waste streams using ''liquid metal gasification''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Also in the US, in 2011 a plasma system delivered by PyroGenesis Canada Inc. was tested to gasify municipal solid waste, hazardous waste and biomedical waste at the Hurlburt Field Florida Special Operations Command Air Force base. The plant, which cost $7.4 million to construct,&lt;ref&gt;http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/5745/pyrogenesis-perfecting-plasma&lt;/ref&gt; was closed and sold at a government liquidation auction in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govliquidation.com/auction/view?auctionId=6241220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rewmag.com/dod-gasification-auction-pyrogenesis.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018222036/http://www.rewmag.com/dod-gasification-auction-pyrogenesis.aspx |archivedate=2014-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening bid was $25.  The winning bid was sealed.

==Current applications==
Syngas can be used for heat production and for generation of mechanical and electrical power. Like other gaseous fuels, producer gas gives greater control over power levels when compared to solid fuels, leading to more efficient and cleaner operation.

Syngas can also be used for further processing to liquid fuels or chemicals.

===Heat===
Gasifiers offer a flexible option for thermal applications, as they can be retrofitted into existing gas fueled devices such as [[oven]]s, [[furnace]]s, [[boiler]]s, etc., where syngas may replace fossil fuels. [[Heating value]]s of syngas are generally around 4–10 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Electricity===
Currently Industrial-scale gasification is primarily used to produce electricity from fossil fuels such as coal, where the syngas is burned in a gas turbine. Gasification is also used industrially in the production of electricity, ammonia and liquid fuels (oil) using Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles ([[Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle|IGCC]]), with the possibility of producing methane and hydrogen for fuel cells. IGCC is also a more efficient method of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture as compared to conventional technologies. IGCC demonstration plants have been operating since the early 1970s and some of the plants constructed in the 1990s are now entering commercial service.

===Combined heat and power===
In small business and building applications, where the wood source is sustainable, 250–1000 kWe and new zero carbon biomass gasification plants have been installed in Europe that produce tar free syngas from wood and burn it in reciprocating engines connected to a generator with heat recovery. This type of plant is often referred to as a wood biomass CHP unit but is a plant with seven different processes: biomass processing, fuel delivery, gasification, gas cleaning, waste disposal, electricity generation and heat recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=6 Wood Gasification CHP / Cogeneration Plants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110458/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=6 |date=2011-07-07 }}, 02.09.09&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport fuel===
[[Diesel engine]]s can be operated on dual fuel mode using producer gas. Diesel substitution of over 80% at high loads and 70–80% under normal load variations can easily be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kedco.com/ind/industrial/principles-of-gasification/ Gasification Appliances Review]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 04.02.08&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spark ignition engine]]s and [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s can operate on 100% gasification gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orbit.dtu.dk/getResource?recordId=209388&amp;objectId=1&amp;versionId=1 Characterization of biomass producer gas as fuel for stationary gas engines in combined heat and power production], Ph.D. Thesis by Jesper Ahrenfeldt, Technical University of Denmark March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biocellus.com/pdf/High_temperature_electrolyte.pdf High temperature electrolyte supported Ni-GDC/YSZ/LSM SOFC operation on two-stage Viking gasifier product gas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217093848/http://www.biocellus.com/pdf/High_temperature_electrolyte.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }}, Ph. Hofmann ''et al''. in Journal of Power Sources 173 (2007) 357–366&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical energy from the engines may be used for e.g. driving water pumps for irrigation or for coupling with an alternator for electrical power generation.

While small scale gasifiers have existed for well over 100 years, there have been few sources to obtain a ready to use machine. Small scale devices are typically [[DIY]] projects. However, currently in the United States, several companies offer gasifiers to operate small engines.

===Renewable energy and fuels===
[[File:Holzvergaser Güssing.jpg|thumb|230px|Gasification plant Güssing, Austria (2001-2015)]]
In principle, gasification can proceed from just about any organic material, including [[biomass]] and [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]]. The resulting syngas can be combusted. Alternatively, if the syngas is clean enough, it may be used for power production in gas engines, gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to [[dimethyl ether]] (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the [[Sabatier reaction]], or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]]. In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]] properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.

Regardless of the final fuel form, gasification itself and subsequent processing neither directly emits nor traps [[greenhouse gases]] such as carbon dioxide. Power consumption in the gasification and syngas conversion processes may be significant though, and may indirectly cause CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions; in slagging and plasma gasification, the electricity consumption may even exceed any power production from the syngas.

Combustion of syngas or derived fuels emits exactly the same amount of carbon dioxide as would have been emitted from direct combustion of the initial fuel. Biomass gasification and combustion could play a significant role in a renewable energy economy, because biomass production removes the same amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere as is emitted from gasification and combustion. While other biofuel technologies such as biogas and [[biodiesel]] are [[carbon neutral]], gasification in principle may run on a wider variety of input materials and can be used to produce a wider variety of output fuels.

There are at present a few industrial scale biomass gasification plants. Since 2008 in Svenljunga, Sweden, a biomass gasification plant generates up to 14 MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;, supplying industries and citizens of Svenljunga with process steam and [[district heating]], respectively. The gasifier uses [[biomass fuels]] such as [[Chromated copper arsenate|CCA]] or [[creosote]] impregnated waste wood and other kinds of recycled wood to produces syngas that is combusted on site.&lt;ref name="Elmia"&gt;[http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressroom/elmia/pressrelease/view/foergasning-ger-laegre-utslaepp-mindre-stoft-och-bredare-braenslebas-nyhet-paa-elmia-recycling-to-energy-2010-381629 Gasification allows less emissions, less dust and fuel flexibility] – News at Elmia Recycling to Energy 2010, 03.03.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iqr.se/en/products/combustion/sfc.aspx SFC – Soot Free Combustion: large scale biomass gasification], 03.03.11&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a similar gasifier, using the same kinds of fuels, is being installed at [http://munkforsenergi.se/ Munkfors Energy]'s [[Cogeneration|CHP]] plant. The CHP plant will generate 2 MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (electricity) and 8 MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; ([[district heating]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/view/pressrelease/biofuel-gasification-in-unique-chp-plant-601686 Biofuel gasification in unique CHP plant], 04.04.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170324155355/http://www.nordiskaprojekt.se/kraftvarme/1738/munkfors-energi-investerar-i-ny-kraftvaermeanlaeggning.aspx Munkfors Energy invests in new combined heat and power plant], 03.03.11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Among the Pitṛs (''forefathers'')===

* 1 day of pitras = 1 solar ''masa'' (month) &lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;
* 30 days of pitras = 1 month of pitras&lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;
* 12 months of pitras = 1 year of pitras&lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;
The Lifespan of the pitras is 100 years of pitras (3,000 Solar years).&lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;

===Among the Devas===

The life span of any Hindu [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] spans nearly (or more than) 4.5&amp;nbsp;million years. Statistically, we can also look it as:
* 12000 Deva Years = Life Span of Devas = 1 Mahā-Yuga.&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4ICDiER4Wy&amp;sig=mvB9BIjm8SmryEb0nKku0olSyoQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA6uHlktHVAhUGP48KHcKDDXQQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&amp;f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|page=50|author=Hans Kng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vishnu Purana|{{IAST|Viṣṇu Purāṇa}}]] Time measurement section of the [[Vishnu Purana|{{IAST|Viṣṇu Purāṇa}}]] Book I Chapter III explains the above as follows:
* 2 Ayanas (6-month periods, see above) = 1 human year or 1 day of the devas
* 4,000 + 400 + 400 = 4,800 divine years (= 1,728,000 human years) = 1 [[Satya Yuga]]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;

* 12 months of Brahma = 1 year of Brahma (3.1104&amp;nbsp;trillion human years)
* 50 years of Brahma = 1 Parārdha (156,764,160,000,000 human years)
* 2 parardhas = 100 years of Brahma = 1 Para = 1 Mahā-Kalpa (the lifespan of Brahma) (313,528,320,000,000 human years)

One day of Brahma is divided into 1000 parts called ''charaṇas''.&lt;ref name="Bryan E.

&lt;/timeline&gt;

The cycle repeats itself, so altogether there are 1,000 cycles of Mahā-Yuga in one day of Brahma.

:*One cycle of the above four ''Yuga''s is one '''Mahā-Yuga''' (4.32&amp;nbsp;million [[solar year]]s)
:*as is confirmed by the Gītā Śloka 8.17 (statement) "sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ rātriṁ yuga-sahasrāntāṁ te 'ho-rātra-vido janāḥ", meaning, a day of brahma is of 1000 Mahā-Yuga. Thus a day of Brahma, Kalpa, is of duration: 4.32 billion solar years. Two ''Kalpa''s constitute a day and night (Adhi Sandhi) of [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/8/verse/17|title=Bhagavad Gita The Song of God|author=Swami Mukundananda}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*A ''Manvantara'' consists of 71 Mahā-Yuga (306,720,000 solar years). Each Manvantara is ruled by a Manu.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;
:*After each Manvantara follows one ''[[Sandhi|{{IAST|Saṃdhi}}]] Kāla'' of the same duration as a ''Kṛta Yuga'' (1,728,000 = 4 Charaṇas). (It is said that during a [[Sandhi|{{IAST|Saṃdhi}}]] Kāla, the entire earth is submerged in water.)&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;
:*A ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]]'' consists of a period of 4.32 Billion solar years followed by 14 Manvataras and [[Sandhi|{{IAST|Saṃdhi}}]] Kalas.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;
:* A day of Brahma equals
::(14 times 71 Mahā-Yuga) + (15 × 4 Charaṇas)
::= 994 Mahā-Yuga  +  (15 * 4800)
::= 994 Mahā-Yuga + (72,000 years)[deva years] / 6 = 12,000[deva years] viz. one maha yuga.
::= 994 Mahā-Yuga + 6 Mahā-Yuga
::= 1,000 Mahā-Yuga.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;

==Current date==

Currently, 50 years of Brahma have elapsed. The last Kalpa at the end of the 50th year is called Padma Kalpa. We are currently in the first 'day' of the 51st year.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 21&lt;/ref&gt; This Brahma's day, Kalpa is named as Shveta-Varaha Kalpa. Within this Day, six Manvantaras have already elapsed&lt;ref name="Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 22"&gt;Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 22&lt;/ref&gt; and this is the seventh Manvantara, named as – Vaivasvatha Manvantara (or Sraddhadeva Manvantara). Within the Vaivasvatha Manvantara, 27 Mahayugas&lt;ref name="Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 22"/&gt; (4 Yugas together is a Mahayuga), and the Krita,&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 23&lt;/ref&gt; Treta and Dwapara Yugas of the 28th Mahayuga have elapsed. This Kaliyuga is in the 28th Mahayuga. This Kaliyuga began in the year 3102 BCE in the proleptic Julian Calendar.&lt;ref name="Burgess, p17"&gt;Burgess, p17&lt;/ref&gt; Since 50 years of Brahma have already elapsed, this is the second Parardha, also called as Dvithiya Parardha.
 
===Calculating the elapsed time since current Brahma's creation===
 
432000 × 10 × 1000 × 2 = 8.64&amp;nbsp;billion years (2 Kalpa (day and night))
 
8.64 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; × 30 × 12 = 3.1104 Trillion Years (1 year of Brahma)&lt;br /&gt;3.1104 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; × 50 = 155.52&amp;nbsp;trillion years (50 years of Brahma)
 
(6 × 71 × 4320000) + 7 × 1.728 × 10^6 = 1852416000 years elapsed in first six Manvataras, and Sandhi Kalas in the current [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]]
 
27 × 4320000 = 116640000 years elapsed in first 27 Mahayugas of the current Manvantara
 
1.728 × 10^6 + 1.296 × 10^6 + 864000 = 3888000 years elapsed in current Mahayuga
 
3102 + 2017 = 5119 years elapsed in current Kaliyuga.
 
So the total time elapsed since current Brahma is
 
155520000000000 + 1852416000 + 116640000 + 3888000 + 5119 = '''''155,521,972,949,120 years'''''

(one hundred fifty-five trillion, five hundred twenty-one billion, nine hundred seventy-two million, nine hundred forty-nine thousand, one hundred twenty years) as of 2018 AD

Total age of Brahma is 100 (Brahma Years) which is equal to '''''311,040,000,000,000 Human years'''''
 
The current Kali Yuga began at midnight 17 February / 18 February in 3102 BCE in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Ebenezer [https://books.google.com/books?id=jpE7AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Translation of the Sûrya-Siddhânta: A text-book of Hindu astronomy, with notes and an appendix''] Originally published: ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''6''' (1860) 141–498 , p17"&lt;/ref&gt; As per the information above about Yuga periods, only 5,120 years are passed out of 432,000 years of current Kali Yuga, and hence another 426,880 years are left to complete this 28th Kali Yuga of Vaivaswatha Manvantara.{{refn|group=note|According to [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]], guru of [[Paramahansa Yogananda]],  The ascending phase of the Kali Yuga began in September 499 CE. Since September 1699, we have been in the ascending phase of the Dwapara Yuga. According to Sri Yukteswar, nobody wanted to announce the bad news of the beginning of the descending Kali Yuga, so they kept adding years to the Dvapara date (at that time 2400 Dvapara) only retitling the epoch to Kali.{{sfn|Yukteswar|1949}}}}

[[File:Летний лагерь Альтаир. Шенкурск (1).JPG|right|thumb|300px|Summer camps for children are often associated with homesickness, particularly for children who are away from their parents for the first time.]]

'''Homesickness''' is the distress caused by being away from [[home]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Kerns, Brumariu, Abraham. Kathryn A., Laura E., Michelle M.(2009/04/13). Homesickness at summer camp. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Its cognitive hallmark is preoccupying thoughts of home and attachment objects.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 2007"&gt;Thurber, C.A. &amp; Walton, E.A. (2007). Preventing and treating homesickness. ''Pediatrics, 119'', 843–858.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers typically report a combination of [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] and [[Anxiety|anxious]] symptoms, withdrawn behavior and difficulty focusing on topics unrelated to home.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 1999"&gt;Thurber, C.A., Sigman, M.D., Weisz, J.R., &amp; Schmidt, C.K. (1999). Homesickness in preadolescent and adolescent girls: Risk factors, behavioral correlates, and sequelae.

In its mild form, homesickness prompts the development of coping skills and motivates healthy attachment behaviors, such as renewing contact with loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;Thurber, C.A. &amp; Weisz, J.R. (1997). "You Can Try or You Can Just Give Up": The impact of perceived control and coping style on childhood homesickness. ''Developmental Psychology, 33'', 508–517.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, nearly all people miss something about home when they are away, making homesickness a nearly universal experience.&lt;ref&gt;van Tilburg, M.A.L. &amp; Vingerhoets, A. (Eds.) (1997). ''Acculturation stress and homesickness''. Tilburg, The Netherlands: Tilburg University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, intense homesickness can be painful and debilitating.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 2012"&gt;Thurber, C.A. &amp; Walton, E.A. (2012). Homesickness and adjustment in university students. ''Journal of American College Health, 60'', 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S. &amp; Hood, B. (1987).

''British Journal of Psychology, 78'', 425–441.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical references ==
Homesickness is an ancient phenomenon, mentioned in both the [[Old Testament]] books of ''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'' and ''[[Book of Psalms|Psalm]]'' 137:1 ("By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion") as well as Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', whose opening scene features [[Athena]] arguing with [[Zeus]] to bring [[Odysseus]] home because he is homesick ("...longing for his wife and his homecoming..."). The Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] (ca. 460–377 BC) believed that homesickness—also called "heimveh" (old German word for "[[German language|Heimweh]]") or a "nostalgic reaction"—was caused by a surfeit of black bile in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Zwingmann, C. (1959). "Heimveh" or "nostalgic reaction": A conceptual analysis and interpretation of a medico-psychological phenomenon [dissertation]. Stanford (CA): Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent history homesickness is first mentioned specifically with [[Swiss people|Swiss]] people being abroad in [[Europe]] ("Heimweh") for a longer period of time in a document dating back to 1691.&lt;ref&gt;''Schweizerisches Idiotikon'' Bd. XV Sp. 42&amp;nbsp;f., Artikel [http://www.idiotikon.ch/Register/faksimile.php?band=15&amp;spalte=42 ''Heimwē'']&lt;/ref&gt; A normal phenomenon amongst the many common [[Swiss mercenaries]] serving in different countries and many rulers across [[Europe]] at that time. It was not uncommon for them staying many years away from home and, if lucky enough, return home if still alive. This phenomenon at that time was first only thought to affect Swiss people until this was revised, probably caused by big migration streams across [[Europe]] suggesting the same symptoms and thus homesickness found its way into general [[Germany|German]] medical literature in the 19th century. American contemporary histories, such as Susan J. Matt's ''Homesickness: An American History'' eloquently describe experiences of homesickness in colonists, immigrants, gold miners, soldiers, explorers and others spending time away from home. First understood as a brain lesion, homesickness is now known to be a form of normative psychopathology that reflects the strength of a person's attachment to home, native culture and loved ones, as well as their ability to regulate their emotions and adjust to novelty. Cross-cultural research, with populations as diverse as refugees and [[boarding school]] students, suggests considerable agreement on the definition of homesickness.&lt;ref name="Tilburg, M.A.A. 1997"&gt;van Tilburg, M.A.A. &amp; Vingerhoets, A. (Eds.). (1997). Acculturation Stress and Homesickness. Tilburg, The Netherlands. Tilburg University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional historical perspectives on homesickness and place attachment can be found in books by van Tilburg &amp; Vingerhoets,&lt;ref name="Tilburg, M.A.A. 1997" /&gt; Matt,&lt;ref&gt;Matt, S.J. (2011). Homesickness: An American History. USA: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, A. (Ed.). (1999). Therapeutic Landscapes: The Dynamic Between Place and Wellness. New York: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis and epidemiology ==
Whereas [[separation anxiety disorder]] is characterized by "inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached" &lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders." 5th ed. Washington, DC: Author: 2013&lt;/ref&gt; symptoms of homesickness are most prominent ''after ''a separation and include ''both ''depression ''and'' anxiety. In DSM terms, homesickness may be related to Separation Anxiety Disorder, but it is perhaps best categorized as either an Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (309.28) or, for immigrants and foreign students as a V62.4, Acculturation Difficulty. As noted above, researchers use the following definition: "Homesickness is the distress or impairment caused by an actual or anticipated separation from home. Its cognitive hallmark is preoccupying thoughts of home and attachment objects." Recent pathogenic models support the possibility that homesickness reflects both insecure attachment and a variety of emotional and cognitive vulnerabilities, such as little previous experience away from home and negative attitudes about the novel environment.

The prevalence of homesickness varies greatly, depending on the population studied and the way homesickness is measured.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 1995"&gt;Thurber, C.A. (1995). The experience and expression of homesickness in preadolescent and adolescent boys. "Child Development, 66", 1162–1178.&lt;/ref&gt; One way to conceptualize homesickness prevalence is as a function of severity. Nearly all people miss something about home when they are away, so the absolute prevalence of homesickness is close to 100%, mostly in a mild form. Roughly 20% of university students and children at summer camp rate themselves at or above the midpoint on numerical rating scales of homesickness severity. And only 5–7% of students and campers report intense homesickness associated with severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, in adverse or painful environments, such as the hospital or the battlefield, intense homesickness is far more prevalent. In one study,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Thurber, C.A., Patterson, D., &amp; Mount, K.K. (2007). Homesickness and children's adjustment to hospitalization: Toward a preliminary model. "Children's Healthcare, 36", 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt; 50% of children scored themselves at or above the midpoint on a numerical homesickness intensity scale (compared to 20% of children at summer camp). Soldiers report even more intense homesickness, sometimes to the point of suicidal misery. Naturally, aversive environmental elements, such as the trauma associated with war, exacerbate homesickness and other mental health problems.

In sum, homesickness is a normative pathology that can take on clinical relevance in its moderate and severe forms.

== Risk and protective factors ==
[[File:US Army 52421 CAMP TAJI, Iraq - Forty-one Soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, raise their right hands during a re-enlistment ceremony held at.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Newly enlisted soldiers sometimes experience homesickness when they are staying in an army [[Recruit training|boot camp]].]]

Risk factors (constructs which increase the likelihood or intensity of homesickness) and protective factors (constructs that decrease the likelihood or intensity of homesickness) vary by population. For example, a seafarers on board, the environmental stressors associated with a hospital, a military [[Recruit training|boot camp]] or a foreign country may exacerbate homesickness and complicate treatment. Generally speaking, however, risk and protective factors transcend age and environment.

=== Risk factors ===
The risk factors for homesickness fall into five categories: experience, personality, family, attitude and environment.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 2007" /&gt; More is known about some of these factors in adults—especially personality factors—because more homesickness research has been performed with older populations.&lt;ref&gt;Verschuur, M.J., Eurelings-Bontekoe, E.H.M., Spinhoven, P., &amp; Duijsens, I.J. (2003). Homesickness, temperament and character. "Journal of Personality and Individual Differences, 35", 757–770.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a growing body of research is elucidating the etiology of homesickness in younger populations, including children at summer camp,&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; hospitalized children&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; and students.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 2012" /&gt;

* Experience factors: Younger age; little previous experience away from home (for which age can be a proxy); little or no previous experience in the novel environment; little or no previous experience venturing out without primary caregivers.
* Attitude factors: The belief that homesickness will be strong; negative first impressions and low expectations for the new environment; perceived absence of social support; high perceived demands (e.g., on academic, vocational or sports performance); great perceived distance from home
* Personality factors: Insecure attachment relationship with primary caregivers; low perceived control over the timing and nature of the separation from home; anxious or depressed feelings in the months prior to the separation; low self-directedness; high harm avoidance; rigidity; a wishful-thinking coping style.
* Family factors: decision control (e.g., caregivers forcing young children to spend time away from home against their wishes);

=== Protective factors ===
Factors which mitigate the prevalence or intensity of homesickness are essentially the inverse of the risk factors cited above. Effective coping (reviewed in the following section) also diminishes the intensity of homesickness over time. Prior to a separation, however, key protective factors can be identified. Positive adjustment to separation from home is generally associated with the following factors:

* Experience factors: Older age; substantial previous experience away from home (for which age can be a proxy); previous experience in the novel environment; previous experience venturing out without primary caregivers.
* Attitude factors: The belief that homesickness will be mild; positive first impressions and high expectations for the new environment; perceptions of social support; low perceived demands (e.g., on academic or vocational performance); short perceived distance from home
* Personality factors: Secure attachment relationship with primary caregivers; high perceived control over the timing and nature of the separation from home; good [[mental health]] in the months prior to the separation; high self-directedness; adventure-seeking; flexibility; an instrumental coping style.
* Family factors: High decision control (e.g., caregivers including a young person in the decision to spend time away from home); individuals making their own choice about military service; supportive caregiving; caregivers who express confidence and optimism about the separation (e.g., "Have a great time away. I know you'll do great.")
* Environmental factors: Low cultural contrast (e.g., same language, similar customs, familiar food in the new environment); physical and emotional safety; few changes to familiar daily schedule; plenty of information about the new place prior to relocation; feeling welcome and accepted in the new place.

== Theories of coping ==
How people—especially young people—cope with homesickness deserves careful study for at least three reasons. First, homesickness is experienced by millions of people who spend time away from home (see McCann, 1941, for an early review&lt;ref&gt;McCann, W.H. (1941). Nostalgia: A review of the literature. "Psychological Bulletin, 38", 165–182.&lt;/ref&gt;) including children at boarding schools,&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S., Elder, L., &amp; Peacock, G. (1990). Homesickness in a school in the Australian Bush. "Children's Environments Quarterly, 7", 15–22.&lt;/ref&gt; residential summer camps&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 1995" /&gt; and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J.V. Recreational therapy program alleviates homesickness. "Hospital Topics, 44", 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, severe homesickness is associated with significant distress and impairment. There is evidence that homesick persons present with non-traumatic physical ailments significantly more than their non-homesick peers.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S., Frazer, N., &amp; Murray., K. (1986). Homesickness and health in boarding school children. "Journal of Environmental Psychology, 6", 35–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Homesick boys and girls complain about somatic problems and exhibit more internalizing and externalizing behaviors problems than their nonhomesick peers. First-year college students are three times more likely to drop out of school than their nonhomesick peers.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, C. (1993). Concentration and academic ability following the transition to university: An investigation of the effects of homesickness. "Journal of Environmental Psychology, 13", 333–342.&lt;/ref&gt; Other data have pointed to concentration and academic problems in homesick students. And maladjustment to separation from home has been documented in hospitalized young people and is generally associated with slower recovery. See Thurber &amp; Walton (2012) for a review.

Third, learning more about how people cope with homesickness is a helpful guide to designing treatment programs. By complementing existing theories of depression, anxiety and attachment, a better theoretical understanding of homesickness can shape applied interventions. Among the most relevant theories that could shape interventions are those concerned with Learned Helplessness&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, L.Y., Seligman, M.E.P., &amp; Teasdale, J.D. (1978). Learned helplessness in humans: Critique and reformation. "Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 87", 49–74.&lt;/ref&gt; and Control Beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Weisz, J.R., (1990). Development of control-related beliefs, goals, and styles in childhood and adolescence: A clinical perspective. In K.W. Schaie, J. Rodin, &amp; C. Scholler (Eds.), "Self-directedness and efficacy: Causes and effects throughout the life course (pp. 103–145). New York: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Learned helplessness predicts that persons who develop a belief that they cannot influence or adjust to their circumstance of separation from home will become depressed and make fewer attempts to change that circumstance. Control beliefs theory predicts that negative affect is most likely in persons who perceive personal incompetence in the separation environment (e.g., poor social skills at a summer camp or university) and who perceive contingency uncertainty (e.g., uncertainty about whether friendly behavior will garner friends). Although these are not the only broad etiologic theories that inform homesickness, note that both theories hinge on control, the perception of which "reflects the fundamental human need for competence" (Skinner, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;8). This is particularly relevant to coping, because people's choice of ''how'' to respond to a stressor hinges partly on their perception of a stressor's controllability.

An equally important coping factor is social connection, which for many people is the antidote to homesickness. As the results of several studies have suggested, social connection is a powerful mediator of homesickness intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, B., Rosen, D., &amp; Aune, R.K., (2010). An analysis of friendship networks, social connectedness, homesickness and satisfaction levels of international students. "International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 35", 281–295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerns, K.A., Brumariu., L.E., &amp; Abraham, M.M., (2008). Homesickness at summer camp: associations with the mother-child relationship, social self-concept, and peer relationships in middle childhood. "Journal of Developmental Psychology, 54", 473–498.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ways of coping ===
The most effective way of coping with homesickness is mixed and layered. Mixed coping is that which involves both primary goals (changing circumstances) and secondary goals (adjusting to circumstances). Layered coping is that which involves more than one method. This kind of sophisticated coping is learned through experience, such as brief periods away from home without parents. As an example of mixed and layered coping, one study&lt;ref&gt;Thurber, C.A. &amp; Weisz, J.R., (1997). "You can try or you can just give up": The impact of perceived control and coping style on childhood homesickness." ''Developmental Psychology, 33'', 508–517.&lt;/ref&gt; revealed the following method-goal combinations to be the most frequent and effective ways for boys and girls:

* Doing something fun (observable method) to forget about being homesick (secondary goal)
* Thinking positively and feel grateful (unobservable method) to feel better (secondary goal)
* Simply changing feelings and attitudes (unobservable method) to be happy (secondary goal)
* Reframing time (unobservable method) in order to perceive the time away as shorter (secondary goal)
* Renewing a connection with home, through letter writing (observable method) to feel closer to home (secondary goal)
* Talking with someone (observable method) who could provide support and help them make new friends (primary goal)

Sometimes, people will engage in wishful thinking, attempt to arrange a shorter stay or (rarely) break rules or act violently in order to be sent home. These ways of coping are rarely effective and can produce unintended negative side effects.

== Popular culture ==
Homesickness is a major theme of the film [[Brooklyn (film)|''Brooklyn'']] (2015). One critic said that the [[protagonist]]'s depiction of homesickness "as a physical, implacable reality is acute, and it's backed up by what we see around her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/brooklyn-an-irish-twist-on-the-agonies-and-ecstasy-of-a-migrants-story-20160211-gmq32f.html|title = Brooklyn: An Irish twist on the agonies and ecstasy of a migrant's story|last = Byrnes|first = Paul|date = 13 February 2016|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = 20 February 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1988">In US law, the '''independent source doctrine''' is an exception to the [[exclusionary rule]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nix v. Williams'', 467 U.S. 431, 443-44 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine applies to evidence initially discovered during, or as a consequence of, an unlawful search, but later obtained independently from activities untainted by the initial illegality.&lt;ref&gt;''Murray v. United States'', 487 U.S. 533, 537 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Nix v. Williams]]'', provided the policy rationale for admitting tainted evidence: &lt;blockquote&gt; The independent source doctrine teaches us that the interest of society in deterring unlawful conduct and the public interest in having juries receive all probative evidence of a crime are properly balanced by putting the police in the same, not a ''worse'', position that they would have been in if no police error or misconduct had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;''Nix'', 467 U.S. at 443 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Murray v. United States]]'' provided the current independent source doctrine rule. The ''Murray'' court held that a state may not rely on the independent source doctrine if (1) the agents' decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial entry or (2) if information obtained during that entry was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to issue the warrant.&lt;ref&gt;''Murray'', 487 U.S. at 542 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Expanded" independent source doctrine==

The expanded independent source doctrine refers to situations where states invoke the independent source doctrine, and courts admit partially tainted warrants if the untainted information in the warrant is enough to establish probable cause.&lt;ref&gt; ''State v. Boll'', 2002 S.D. 114, 651 N.W. 2d 710, 719.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C. Darwin, On the Expression of the Emotions Wellcome L0031428.jpg|thumb|A man "shrugging the shoulders", simulating indignation, from {{Cite book|title=[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=John Murray|year=1872|location=London|pages=264-265|author-link=Charles Darwin}}]]

'''Indignation''' is a complex and discrete emotion that is triggered by social emotions and social environments. Feelings of anger and disgust are some emotions that make up indignation. The feeling of indignation can occur when one is mistreated by another or negative feelings are sparked when a situation is out of the normal realm of society. When situations or actions that are considered to be unjust behavior occur, the feeling of indignation is experienced. With unjust actions and behaviors comes to blame. Blame also helps to make up the emotion of indignation. When blameworthy actions take place, the emotion of indignation occurs and negative feelings are projected onto the person who is to blame.  Which can be brought on by disturbances that go against social normative. According to Claude Miller, “indignation is defined as a non-primary, discrete, social emotion, specifying disapproval of someone else's blameworthy action, as that action is explicitly viewed to be in violation of the objective order, and implicitly perceived as injurious to the perceiver’s self-concept” (Miller et al, 2007, pg.1).  Indignation is experienced when violations are made to our daily lives. Indignation is an emotion that is considered to be an adaptive behavior. Social environment and social emotions being a the stimuli for indignation. Our emotions and behaviors adapt depending on certain situations. Internal and external social norms play a part in experiencing the emotion of indignation. It is expected that everyone coexists and follows the social normative behaviors society has put in place. When something disrupts what is considered to be a social norm, a violation occurs, both internally and externally. A range of feelings are experienced internally, as well as a desire to be removed from the situation externally. When norms are disrupted, offense is taken and the emotion of indignation is ignited.

The [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] process is integral in the development of indignation. It is the split-second assessments a person makes (attributions) about their own behavior or in the behavior of others in order to figure out the reason or cause behind it. Behaviors can be classified as situational (external) or dispositional (internal).&lt;ref name="zuckerman" /&gt; [[Fritz Heider]] wrote that people tend to view behavior in one of two ways; the cause of situational factors or of dispositional factors. From this, an individual is either an [[Implicit personality theory|Entity theorist]] or an [[Implicit personality theory|Incremental theorist]] when considering event or categorization but is not exclusive to either group.  According to one scholar,  ”People's implicit theories create a framework for processing information, forming inferences, determining attributions, shaping predictions, understanding others’ behaviors, and construction representations of social events”.&lt;ref name="cmiller"&gt;Miller C.H., ["Indignation, defensive attribution and implicit theories of moral character"] ''Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences of Engineering'', March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="dweck96"&gt;Dweck, C.S., ["Implicit theories as organizers of goals and behavior"]''The psychology of action: Linking cognition and motivation to behavior. New York:Guilford'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69–90}} Taking this into account and based on a persons classification of entity or incremental theorist (which delineates how a person views behavior in relation to its driving factors), research demonstrates that said person is inclined to experience indignation with more or less frequency and severity respectively.&lt;ref name="cmiller" /&gt;

==Entity theory==

[[Sphere (1998 film)|Entity]] Theorists believe that judgements of [[moral character]] can be made from merely a few or even a single observation(s). They are most often found making [[stereotype]]s about people or events, and believe that disposition based attributions are innate, and rarely ever change. ‘You can’t teach an old dog new tricks’ explains how entity theorists might explain a situation. Behavior, to them, is caused by the unchanging, internal (character) attributes.&lt;ref name="dweck96" /&gt; Hypothetically, if the two different types of people were sitting on a parole board for a jailed criminal, those who exemplify traits of entity theorists might say ‘once a criminal always a criminal’ and reason that the criminal behavior was driven by the immoral nature of the person and they would do it again, no matter the circumstance, when given the opportunity.

[[Entity Theory]] Dispositional traits are used within the entity theory as a basic unit of analysis. Either positive or negative attributes are experienced and possibly expressed. With indignations the attributes experienced are going to be negative. These tendencies are most likely going to remain the same and be predictable with little to no room for change. An assumption is made and judgments are carried out. Entity theory creates and holds judgements based on a single behavioral observation. Once something is believed to be true, it is almost permanently labeled. Objective situational evidence is neglected to be taken into consideration. While disposition-relevant information is the main focus due to the fact that it feeds the reinforcement of negative information.

==Incremental theory==

Incremental theorists believe just the opposite position of some entity theorists. They can make judgements of moral character more based on changing external factors (situational) and factors such as effort, desire such as goals.&lt;ref name="cmiller" /&gt;{{rp|18}} When formulating judgements, incremental theorists take recent evidence into account and avoid broad character attributions. For example, those of those who are considered to be incremental theorists might argue that, the aforementioned criminal’s behavior, was possibly the subsequent result of a poor upbringing or was drug induced, and while, in prison, the incarcerated changed his/her lifestyle through exemplary behavior and service to others. Thus they would not be a threat to the public anymore, in theory.

===Defensive Attribution Theory===
{{main article|Defensive attribution hypothesis}}
Defensive Attribution Theory aims at describing how an individual ultimately wants to explain behavior in a way that protects their ego and is flattering to the self.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, D.T., &amp; Ross, M., ["Self-Serving Biases in the Attribution of Causality: Fact or Fiction?"]'' Psychological Bulletin, 82 ,2'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213–235}} Attributions are deemed as biased because an individual, in explaining behavior, will "take credit for good outcomes and avoid responsibility for the bad".&lt;ref name="cmiller" /&gt;{{rp|25}}  In this, a person is trying to exert a varying degree of control over their environment. It should be easier to distort one’s judgments of dissimilar others—with whom one does not readily identify—than with similar others—with whom one not only more readily identifies, but from whom one should also expect a greater measure of empathy. Moreover, since entity theory promotes internal characterological attributions, we should expect entity theorists to be more sensitive and defensive with regard to perceptions of similarity than incremental theorists. ( Miller et al 2007, pg. 12).

====Actor-Observer Effect====
The [[actor-observer effect]] is when an individual ascribes personal successes as the cause of factors concerning ''disposition'' (I, the student, did well on the test because I studied hard) and personal failures as the cause of ''situational'' factors (I, the student, did poorly on the test because the test questions were very difficult). The opposite is true of when an individual is assessing the behavior of others. When the actor views an observer (other people) succeeding, they will believe that the success was the result of ''situational'' factors. The classmate did well on the test because the questions were easy. If the actor sees the observer experience failure, the actor will say that it was because of something, usually negative, that deals with the observer's ''disposition''.&lt;ref name="zuckerman"&gt;Zuckerman, M., ["Attribution of success and failure revisited, or: The motivational biases alive and well in attribution theory"]'' Journal of Personality, 47'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|245–287}} The classmate did poorly because he/she is lazy and did not study.

==Applications==
Indignation has been applied in many different settings.

===In politics===
Indignation has a large role in politics. This is because politicians hold the power to offend many people based the decisions that they make. The decisions that politicians make impact hundreds, thousands, or millions of people. Certain decisions they make may cause many constituents to feel indignant because they feel like those decisions go against what they stand for or believe in, especially if the constituents belong to the same party as the politician. Politicians themselves also feel indignant because if people are not in favor of their policies or are competing against them, they will attack their self-construct. For example, this can be seen when politicians are debating. The other politician typically questions their policies and procedures in hopes to make their competition feel indignant. By doing this, the hope would be that the debate would be stifled.

It has been stated that indignation provides the capacity to think through certain situations (Bromell, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;290).&lt;ref name="bromell"&gt;Bromell, N., ["Demographic indignation: black american thought and the politics of dignity"], ''Political Theory'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|290}} The person feeling indignant wants to think about why they are feeling indignant so that they can figure out an appropriate response and pin-point whatever caused them to feel indignant. It has been stated that “when indignation does not express itself immediately as violence, it becomes an investigation of (and what he believes is a more appropriate response to) whatever has caused it” &lt;ref name="bromell" /&gt;{{rp|290}}

===In religion===
{{Main article|Righteous indignation}}
Righteous indignation is typically a reactive [[emotion]] of [[anger]] over perceived mistreatment, insult, or malice. It is akin to what is called the [[injustice|sense of injustice]]. In some [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrines, righteous indignation is considered the only form of anger which is not sinful, e.g., when [[Jesus]] drove the [[Cleansing of the Temple|money lenders out of the temple]]. ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 21).

* [('''Feigndignation''' (false display of indignation)

Pretense of indignation and or outrage has become common currency in politics in recent years. Its most effective application has been not in the houses of "big P politics," but rather in the public media. It serves three purposes: The first is to attempt to elicit at a minimum an explanation of, or apology and confession, for the purported cause of the indignation, offense, or hurt feelings. The second purpose is more sinister in that by "going public" the reader or viewer is invited to be part of the accusers cohort or worse its lynch mob.

There is a third, more sinister, effect yet. By creating public outrage the provocateur hopes for public protest which will ultimately become rioting. This naturally occupies the time efforts and resources of the political accused to seem ineffective, and the provocateur is thus distanced from the effects of his or her feigndignation.

Feigndignation has become a favorite tool of provocateurs a.k.a. "community organizers," and it been used mostly to settle issues by character assassination in political issues where the accuser is either unable or unwilling to engage in simple civil discourse, or that their case is simply specious: In effect, why have a discussion when you can cancel it.

{{rquote|right|The fundamental error of modern times lies in the fact that the '''yawning abyss of quality in the difference between God and man''' has been removed. The result in dogmatic theology is a mockery of God ...|[[Søren Kierkegaard]]|''Journals'', November 20, 1847&lt;ref name="Journals1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |others=translated by Alexander Dru |title=Journals of Søren Kierkegaard |publisher=Oxford |date=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

The '''infinite qualitative distinction''' ({{lang-da|den uendelige kvalitative forskel}}; {{lang-de|unendliche qualitative Unterschied}}), sometimes translated as '''infinite qualitative difference''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Søren |last=Kierkegaard |title=Training in Christianity, and the Edifying discourse which 'accompanied' it |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ |date=1941 |others=Transl. by [[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22the+infinite+qualitative+difference+between+God+and+man%22 139 ("the infinite qualitative difference between God and man")]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept coined by the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. The distinction emphasizes the very different attributes of finite and temporal men and the infinite and eternal qualities of a supreme being. This concept fits into the [[apophatic theology#20th_century|apophatic theology]] tradition and therefore is fundamentally at odds with theological theories which posit a supreme being able to be fully understood by man. The theologian [[Karl Barth]] made the concept of infinite qualitative distinction a cornerstone of his theology.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, 2006, pp. 225-227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For Kierkegaard, direct communication with God is impossible, as the idea of God and man are infinitely different. He argues that indirect communication with God is the only way of communication. For example, in [[Christian]] belief, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] posits that [[Jesus Christ]] is God incarnate. The infinite qualitative distinction is opposed to rational theology in the sense that, whereas the latter argues one can prove empirically Jesus is God incarnate, the former argues that [[empirical evidence]] is ultimately insufficient in making that conclusion. The paradoxical nature of the Incarnation, that God is embodied in a man, is offensive to reason, and can only be comprehended indirectly, through [[faith]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorrien, Gary. ''The Barthian revolt in modern theology''. Westminster Press, 1999. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barth's book ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'' also emphasizes such a gulf. In the preface to the Second Edition of his commentary, Barth writes, "if I have a system, it is limited to a recognition of what Kierkegaard called the 'infinite qualitative distinction' between time and eternity, and to my regarding this as possessing negative as well as positive significance: 'God is in heaven, and thou art on earth'. The relation between such a God and such a man, and the relation between such a man and such a God, is for me the theme of the Bible and the essence of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Barth |authorlink=Karl Barth |title=The Epistle to the Romans |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1968 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=3OrYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 1933] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19500294-6 |id={{ISBN|978-0-195-00294-2}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard doesn't believe God is so objective toward human beings but rather that he is the absolute subjective being. He put it this way in 1846: {{Quotation|The subjective thinker is a dialectician dealing with the existential, and he has the passion of thought requisite for holding fast to the qualitative disjunction. But on the other hand, if the qualitative is applied in empty isolation, if it is applied to the individual in an altogether abstract fashion, one may risk saying something infinitely decisive and be quite correct in what one says, and yet, ludicrously enough, say nothing at all. Hence it is a psychologically noteworthy phenomenon, that the absolute disjunction may be used quite disingenuously, precisely for the purpose of evasion. When the death-penalty is affixed to every crime, it ends in no crime being punished at all.  So also in the case of the injunction. Applied abstractly it becomes an unpronounceable mute letter, or if pronounced, it says nothing. The subjective thinker has the absolute disjunction ready to hand; therefore, as an essential existential moment he holds it fast with a thinker’s passion, but he holds it as a last decisive resort, to prevent everything from being reduced to merely quantitative differences. He holds it in reserve, but does not apply it so as by recurring to it abstractly to inhibit existence. Hence the subjective thinker adds to his equipment aesthetic and ethical passion, which gives him the necessary concreteness. All existential problems are passionate problems, for when existence is interpenetrated with reflection it generates passion.

The '''Institute of All Nations for Advanced Studies, Inc.''' (IAN) was established by Dr. Rama C. Mohanty and others in 1964. Mohanty, IAN’s General Secretary, is a Professor of Physics at [[Southern University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]]. He moved to found the organization after being deeply affected by the brutal murder of thousands of innocent people, including children and women, as a result of religious and communal rioting in his native [[India]].

Convinced that the promotion of [[inner peace]] within each individual is vital to the establishment of meaningful [[world peace]], IAN seeks to become:

*  A non-political, non-partisan, non-sectarian society.
*  A community of scholars and humanitarians dedicated to peace.
*  An institution devoted to the humanization, re-education of mankind and the development of [[international law]].
*  An organization of ''people'' as well as governments
*  A true parliament of humanity, serving as a forum for all men and women of goodwill everywhere.

Permanently chartered as a private, nonprofit educational 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation in [[New York (state)|New York]], the Institute began under the co-chairmanship of former [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice [[Arthur J. Goldberg|Arthur (Joseph) Goldberg]], and former [[United Nations]] Ambassador Arthur S. Lall's niece, Dr. Anurita Kapur, M.D. a neurosurgeon in New York. Since 1998, IAM has promoted '''World Peace Day''' internationally on 1 October to raise mass awareness against violence at home and abroad as well as honor those working to promote [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Confusingly, this decision seems to have been taken without regard to the long pre-existing [[International Day of Peace]], 21 September, and [[World Day of Peace]], i January, both sometimes unofficially known as '''World Peace Day'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learned optimism''' is the idea in [[positive psychology]] that a talent for joy, like any other, can be cultivated. It is contrasted with [[learned helplessness]]. Learning optimism is done by consciously challenging any negative [[Intrapersonal communication|self talk]].

== Overview ==
Learned optimism was defined by [[Martin Seligman]] and published in his 1990 book, ''Learned Optimism''.&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise cited, all conceptual information and processes come from Seligman's book&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of an optimistic outlook are many: Optimists are higher achievers and have better overall health. Pessimism, on the other hand, is much more common; pessimists are more likely to give up in the face of adversity or to suffer from [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Seligman invites pessimists to learn to be optimists by thinking about their reactions to adversity in a new way. The resulting optimism—one that grew from pessimism—is a learned optimism. The optimist's outlook on failure can thus be summarized as "What happened was an unlucky situation (not personal), and really just a setback (not permanent) for this one, of many, goals (not pervasive)".

Other differences exist between pessimists and optimists in terms of [[explanatory style]]:

*'''Permanence''': Optimistic people believe bad events to be more temporary than permanent and bounce back quickly from failure, whereas others may take longer periods to recover or may never recover. They also believe good things happen for reasons that are permanent, rather than seeing the transient nature of positive events. Optimists point to specific temporary causes for negative events; pessimists point to permanent causes.
*'''Pervasiveness''': Optimistic people compartmentalize helplessness, whereas pessimistic people assume that failure in one area of life means failure in life as a whole. Optimistic people also allow good events to brighten every area of their lives rather than just the particular area in which the event occurred.
*'''Personalization''': Optimists blame bad events on causes outside of themselves, whereas pessimists blame themselves for events that occur. Optimists are therefore generally more confident. Optimists also quickly internalize positive events while pessimists externalize them.

==Criticism==
Martin Seligman's learned optimism now orients the U.S. armed services' psychological stance{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}. [[Keith Ablow]] blamed this in part for the actions of the U.S. soldier accused of killing 16 civilians in [[Afghanistan]]. He wrote that soldiers are "taught to deny stress and trauma, and false bravado is actually encouraged, under the banner of 'resilience.' It's a bad, bad idea that pushes soldiers to 'fake good' until they fall apart. And, then, the system continues to withhold needed care, particularly of a psychotherapeutic, [[Insight#Psychiatry|insight]]-oriented variety."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/03/14/bad-psychiatric-policy-and-afghan-massacre/#ixzz1qAshgG5N&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Seligman came to the concept of learned optimism through a scientific study of [[learned helplessness]], the idea that a certain reoccurring negative event is out of the person's control. As he was performing [[experiment|tests]] to study helplessness further, he began to wonder why some people resisted helplessness-conditioning. He noticed that, while some subjects blamed themselves for negative outcomes, others blamed the experiment for setting them up to fail.

Seligman shifted his focus to attempting to discover what it is that keeps some people from ever becoming helpless. The answer was optimism. Using his knowledge about [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]] people to be helpless in the lab, he shifted his focus to conditioning people to be optimists. The result of these experiments led to defining the processes of learning optimism.

==Research==
In a study completed by Martin Seligman and Gregory Buchanan at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and published by the [[American Psychological Association]], learned optimism techniques were found to significantly reduce [[Depression (mood)|depression]] in a class of college freshmen. As incoming students to the university, a survey determined the most pessimistic students and they were invited to participate in the study. They were [[random assignment|randomly assigned]], half to attend a 16-hour workshop on the techniques of learning optimism, and half were the [[control group]]. In an 18-month follow up, 32% of the control group suffered moderate to severe depression and 15% suffered moderate to severe anxiety disorder, whereas only 22% of the workshop participants were depressed and 7% had [[anxiety]] issues. Those who participated in the learned optimism workshop also reported fewer health problems over the 18-month period of the study than those students in the control group.&lt;ref&gt;Discovery Health 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by Peter Schulman at the [[Wharton School]], published in the ''Journal of Selling and Sales Management'', looked to determine the effects of applying learned optimism in business. After measuring the optimism levels of an insurance sales force, it was determined that the optimistic sales people sold 35 percent more, and identified pessimists were two times more likely to quit in the first year than optimists. As a result of his studies, he recommends testing sales job candidates for optimism levels to fit them to appropriate positions, training employees in learned optimism techniques, and designing an organization overall to have attainable goals set and good support from management.&lt;ref name="Schulman 1999"&gt;Schulman 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, a study conducted by Mark Ylvisaker of the [[College of Saint Rose]] and Timothy Feeney of the Wildwood Institute looked at children with executive function impairment. The children had brain functioning impairments affecting motor skills, [[memory]], or the ability to focus. Learned optimism was not taught to the children themselves, but rather to their caretakers, who often are more likely to feel helpless than optimistic in regards to caring for the child. It was found that learned optimism in caretakers of children with [[brain damage]] actually led the children to develop more functioning than children without optimistic caretakers. Thus Ylvisaker concludes that the optimism of professional rehabilitators can affect the results of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;Ylivisaker and Feeney 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seligman's method of learning optimism ===
According to [[Martin Seligman]], anyone can learn optimism. Whether currently an optimist or a pessimist, benefits can be gained from exposure to the process of learned optimism to improve response to both big and small adversities. A [http://www.stanford.edu/class/msande271/onlinetools/LearnedOpt.html learned optimism test] (developed by Seligman) is used to determine an individual's base level of optimism. Being in the more pessimistic categories means that learning optimism has a chance of preventing depression, helping the person achieve more, and improve physical health.

Seligman's process of learning optimism consists of a simple method to train a new way of responding to adversity, specifically, by learning to talk themselves through personal defeat. It begins with the Ellis ABC model of adversity, belief, and consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman worked with Steven Hollon, a [[psychologist]] at [[Vanderbilt University]], and Arthur Freeman, a [[psychiatrist]] at [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]], on this program using the ABC model developed by psychologist Albert Ellis.&lt;/ref&gt; Adversity is the event that happens, Belief is how that adversity is interpreted, and Consequences are the feelings and actions that result from the beliefs. This is demonstrated in the example below:

*Adversity: Someone cuts you off in traffic.
*Belief: You think, "I can't believe that idiot was so rude and selfish!"
*Consequence: You are overcome with anger, yelling profanity at the other driver.

In the journey to learning optimism, emphasis is placed on first understanding one's current reaction to and interpretation of adversity. Learners are asked to keep a journal for two days in which they note small adverse events and the beliefs and consequences that followed. Next the learner returns to the journal to highlight pessimism (e.g.,&amp;nbsp; pervasiveness: "it doomed me...") in their written descriptions of the events.

To the ABC model, Seligman adds "D" (disputation) and E (energization). Disputation centers on generating counter-evidence to any of the following: the negative beliefs in general, the causes of the event, or the implications. D also means reminding oneself of any potential usefulness of moving on from the adversity. Disputation for the above traffic example might sound like this: "I am overreacting. I don't know what situation he is in. Maybe he is on his way to his daughter's piano recital and is running late. I'm sure I have cut people off before without meaning to, so I should really cut him a break. I am not in a hurry anyway."

Over time, responses like this are predicted to change feelings to be more hopeful and positive. Successful disputation leads to energization, the E in the ABCDE model. One is energized, and should indeed try to actively celebrate, the positive feelings and sense of accomplishment that come from successful disputation of negative beliefs. Disputation and Energization (celebration) are the keys to Seligman's method.

Teaching children learned optimism by guiding them through the ABCDE techniques can help children to better deal with adversity they encounter in their lives. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} If children are taught early then the thought process of disputation is claimed {{By whom|date=January 2016}} to become ingrained in them. They do not, then, have to focus on being optimistic, but rather optimism becomes automatic and leads to a more positive life for the child. {{Dubious|date=July 2013}}

==Applications==
If learnable, optimism techniques could be practical in life. They are used today in many areas such as [[parenting]], business, therapy, and education. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Business would benefit from more optimistic workers, as they are more successful {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Seligman's focus in business is on "the personal wall" that is each individual worker's set-point of discouragement. Putting the ABCDE model into practice attempts to allow workers to respond to this "wall" with a readiness to conquer rather than to feel dejected.  The [[Attributional Style Questionnaire]] is often used to measure optimism of job candidates during the interview process by asking the participant to write down causes for situational failures. Participants attributions may be used to help  understand if the candidate will be a high or low performer in his/her projected role based on his level of optimism.&lt;ref name="Schulman 1999"/&gt;

Learned optimism has been used to combat depression during cognitive behavioral therapy. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. This is based on the idea that patients may be depressed in part because they have a pessimistic outlook {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Rather than perceiving adversity as a constant thing that cannot be overcome, and taking personal blame for that adversity, patients come out of cognitive behavioral therapy with the belief that they can control how they respond to adversity. A shift toward optimism is a shift away from depression.

'''Les amis du bus des femmes''' is a French association established in 1990 by former [[sex workers]] as a support group for sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deschamps|first=Catherine|title=Femmes publiques: Les féminismes à l'épreuve de la prostitution|year=2009|publisher=Amsterdam|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-915547-08-5|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpUnAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Les+amis+du+bus+des+femmes%22&amp;dq=%22Les+amis+du+bus+des+femmes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D_UDUujBFaTuyAGx6IH4AQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBTgK|author2=Souryis, Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original initiative stemmed from a need to educate sex workers on [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Égré" /&gt; It quickly became established as a bridging organisation between sex workers on the street and the provision of medical, social and administrative services. Its [[Paris]] headquarters is open daily to the population it serves. In addition it has eight permanent mobile units ([[buses]]) operating day and night in the areas frequented by sex workers in the capital, staffed by organisational and health professionals.&lt;ref name="Égré"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Égré |first1=Pascale |title=Confidences dans le Bus des femmes |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/confidences-dans-le-bus-des-femmes-15-05-2000-2001375118.php |accessdate=12 August 2018 |language=fr |date=May 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal mission of the association, whose administration consists of both sex workers and non-sex workers, is to work with and for sex workers to prevent [[HIV]], [[hepatitis]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. They distribute condoms and encourage sex workers to visit the office to get help with administrative, medical, and social needs, and conducts job searches for those who decide to transition out of sex work. Emphasis is placed on helping workers access their health, social and human rights. The objective is to enable workers to develop an environment that supports an active role for them in stating their needs and demands. In working with and for sex workers, the association fights against [[discrimination]], [[social exclusion]] and [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name="Égré" /&gt;&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

The association opposes abolitionism and its objective to eradicate sex work, and recognizes that some women have freely chosen to engage in sex work and that that choice must be respected. The association deals with both voluntary and involuntary sex workers, such as those trafficked from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

Currently the association has fourteen employees including doctors and nurses, facilitators and an employment counsellor. It is funded from government grants which are allocated by agencies such as [[Direction départementale des Affaires sanitaires et sociales|DDASS]] Paris (Direction départementale des Affaires sanitaires et sociales), the Paris [[conseil général]], the CPAM de Paris (Caisse primaire d'assurance maladie) and the [[Conseil régional]].&lt;ref name="florian"&gt;{{cite web |title=Les Amis du bus des femmes |url=http://florian-cabirol.com/bus-des-femmes/qui-sommes-nous/ |website=florian-cabirol.com |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also receives funding from the [[European Commission]]'s Daphne Funding Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daphne Toolkit |url=https://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants/results/daphne-toolkit/en/content/la-pr%C3%A9vention-des-violences-faites-aux-femmes-travaillant-dans-le-milieu-de-la-prostitution |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linked timestamping''' is a type of [[trusted timestamping]] where issued time-stamps are related to each other.

==Description==
Linked timestamping creates time-stamp tokens which are dependent on each other, entangled in some [[authenticated]] [[data structure]]. Later modification of the issued time-stamps would invalidate this structure. The temporal order of issued time-stamps is also protected by this data structure, making backdating of the issued time-stamps impossible, even by the issuing server itself.

The top of the authenticated data structure is generally ''published'' in some hard-to-modify and widely witnessed media, like printed [[newspaper]] or public [[blockchain]]. There are no (long-term) [[Public-key cryptography|private keys]] in use, avoiding [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]-related risks.

Suitable candidates for the authenticated data structure include:
* Linear [[hash chain]]
* [[Merkle tree]] (binary hash tree)
* [[Skip list]]

The simplest linear hash chain-based time-stamping scheme is illustrated in the following diagram:
[[File:Hashlink timestamping.svg|none|600px]]

The linking-based [[Timestamping authority|time-stamping authority]] (TSA) usually performs the following distinct functions:

;Aggregation
:For increased scalability the TSA might group time-stamping requests together which arrive within a short time-frame. These requests are ''aggregated'' together without retaining their temporal order and then assigned the same time value. Aggregation creates a [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] connection between all involved requests; the authenticating aggregate value will be used as input for the ''linking'' operation.

;Linking
:Linking creates a verifiable and ordered cryptographic link between the current and already issued time-stamp tokens.

[[File:Root of Merkle tree as published in Widely Witnessed Media.png|thumb|321px|right|Example newspaper publication of hash-linked time-stamping service]]

;Publishing
:The TSA periodically ''publishes'' some links, so that all previously issued time-stamp tokens depend on the published link and that it is practically impossible to forge the published values. By publishing widely witnessed links, the TSA creates unforgeable verification points for validating all previously issued time-stamps.

==Security==
Linked timestamping is inherently more secure than the usual, public-key signature based time-stamping. All consequential time-stamps "seal" previously issued ones - hash chain (or other authenticated dictionary in use) could be built only in one way; modifying issued time-stamps is nearly as hard as finding a preimage for the used [[cryptographic hash function]]. Continuity of operation is observable by users; periodic publications in widely witnessed media provide extra transparency.

Tampering with absolute time values could be detected by users, whose time-stamps are relatively comparable by system design.

Absence of secret keys increases system trustworthiness. There are no keys to leak and hash algorithms are considered more future-proof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-88702-7_3| isbn = 978-3-540-88701-0| title = Post-Quantum Cryptography| year = 2009| last1 = Buchmann | first1 = J.| chapter = Hash-based Digital Signature Schemes| last2 = Dahmen | first2 = E.| last3 = Szydlo | first3 = M.| pages = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; than modular arithmetic based algorithms, e.g. [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]].

Linked timestamping scales well - hashing is much faster than public key cryptography. There is no need for specific cryptographic hardware with its limitations.

The common technology&lt;ref&gt;See ISO/IEC 18014-1:2002 Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; for guaranteeing long-term attestation value of the issued time-stamps (and digitally signed data&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[XAdES|XAdES-A]].&lt;/ref&gt;) is periodic over-time-stamping of the time-stamp token. Because of missing key-related risks and of the plausible safety margin of the reasonably chosen hash function this over-time-stamping period of hash-linked token could be an order of magnitude longer than of public-key signed token.

Haber and Stornetta proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00196791 | title = How to time-stamp a digital document | year = 1991 | last1 = Haber | first1 = S. | issue = 2 | last2 = Stornetta | first2 = W. S. | journal = Journal of Cryptology | volume = 3| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/haber91how.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 to link issued time-stamps together into linear hash-chain, using a collision-resistant hash function. The main rationale was to diminish [[Timestamping authority|TSA]] trust requirements.

Tree-like schemes and operating in rounds were proposed by Benaloh and de Mare in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Benaloh and de Mare constructed a one-way accumulator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/3-540-48285-7_24| isbn = 978-3-540-57600-6| title = Advances in Cryptology — EUROCRYPT '93| year = 1994| last1 = Benaloh| chapter = One-Way Accumulators: A Decentralized Alternative to Digital Signatures | first1 = J.| last2 = Mare | first2 = M.| volume = 765| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| pages = 274| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/benaloh94oneway.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994 and proposed its use in time-stamping. When used for aggregation, one-way accumulator requires only one constant-time computation for round membership verification.

Surety&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surety.com/&lt;/ref&gt; started the first commercial linked timestamping service in January 1995. Linking scheme is described and its security is analyzed in the following article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/266420.266430 | isbn = 0897919122 | title = Proceedings of the 4th ACM conference on Computer and communications security  - CCS '97 | year = 1997 | last1 = Haber | chapter = Secure names for bit-strings | first1 = S. | last2 = Stornetta | first2 = W. S. | pages = 28| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.46.7776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Haber and Sornetta.

[[Ahto Buldas|Buldas]] et al. continued with further optimization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BFb0055749| title = Time-stamping with binary linking schemes| isbn = 3-540-64892-5| year = 1998| last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laud | first2 = P.| last3 = Lipmaa | first3 = H.| last4 = Villemson | first4 = J.| journal = LNCS| volume = 1462| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| pages = 486| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.9724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and formal analysis of binary tree and threaded tree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Skip-list based time-stamping system was implemented in 2005; related algorithms are quite efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/11751595_43| isbn = 978-3-540-34075-1| title = Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2006| year = 2006| last1 = Blibech| chapter = A New Timestamping Scheme Based on Skip Lists | first1 = K.| last2 = Gabillon | first2 = A.| volume = 3982| pages = 395| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Sciencef}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provable security===

Security proof for hash-function based time-stamping schemes was presented by Buldas, Saarepera&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Buldas
| first = Ahto
| last2 = Saarepera
| first2 = Märt
| title = On Provably Secure Time-Stamping Schemes
| pages = 500–514
| journal = LNCS
| volume = 3329
| year = 2004
| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.65.8638
| doi = 10.1007/b104116}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004. There is an explicit upper bound &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; for the number of time stamps issued during the aggregation period; it is suggested that it is probably impossible to prove the security without this explicit bound - the so-called black-box reductions will fail in this task. Considering that all known practically relevant and efficient security proofs are black-box, this negative result is quite strong.

Next, in 2005 it was shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buldas|first1=A.|last2=Laud|first2=P.|last3=Saarepera|first3=M. R.|last4=Willemson|first4=J.|date=|year=2005|title=Universally Composable Time-Stamping Schemes with Audit.|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.59.2070|journal=LNCS|volume=3650|pages=359–373|doi=10.1007/11556992+26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that bounded time-stamping schemes with a trusted audit party (who periodically reviews the list of all time-stamps issued during an aggregation period) can be made ''universally composable'' - they remain secure in arbitrary environments (compositions with other protocols and other instances of the time-stamping protocol itself).

Buldas, Laur showed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-71677-8_11 | isbn = 978-3-540-71676-1 | title = Knowledge-Binding Commitments with Applications in Time-Stamping | year = 2007 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laur | first2 = S.| journal = LNCS| volume = 4450 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 150–165| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.102.2680}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 that bounded time-stamping schemes are secure in a very strong sense - they satisfy the so-called "knowledge-binding" condition. The security guarantee offered by Buldas, Saarepera in 2004 is improved by diminishing the security loss coefficient from &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

The hash functions used in the secure time-stamping schemes do not necessarily have to be collision-resistant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-75670-5_9 | isbn = 978-3-540-75669-9 | title = Does Secure Time-Stamping Imply Collision-Free Hash Functions? | year = 2007 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Jürgenson | first2 = A.| journal = LNCS| volume = 4784 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 138–150| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.110.4564}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even one-way;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/11767480_4 | isbn = 978-3-540-34703-3 | title = Do Broken Hash Functions Affect the Security of Time-Stamping Schemes? | year = 2006 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laur | first2 = S.| journal = LNCS| volume = 3989 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 50–65| url = http://www.cs.ut.ee/~swen/publications/articles/buldas-laur-2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; secure time-stamping schemes are probably possible even in the presence of a universal collision-finding algorithm (i.e. universal and attacking program that is able to find collisions for any hash function). This suggests that it is possible to find even stronger proofs based on some other properties of the hash functions.

[[File:Hashtree timestamping.svg|thumb|none|600px|Hash tree based linking scheme]]
At the illustration above hash tree based time-stamping system works in rounds (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t+2&lt;/math&gt;, ...), with one aggregation tree per round. Capacity of the system (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) is determined by the tree size (&lt;math&gt;N=2^l&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; denotes binary tree depth). Current security proofs work on the assumption that there is a hard limit of the aggregation tree size, possibly enforced by the subtree length restriction.

==Standards==
[[ISO 18014]] part 3 covers 'Mechanisms producing linked tokens'.

[[American National Standards Institute|American National Standard]] for Financial Services, "Trusted Timestamp Management and Security" ([[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard]]) from June 2005 covers linking-based and hybrid time-stamping schemes.

There is no [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]] or standard draft about linking based time-stamping. RFC 4998 (Evidence Record Syntax) encompasses hash tree and time-stamp as an integrity guarantee for long-term archiving.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6014">Saint '''Mary the Younger''' ({{lang-el|Μαρία ή Νέα}}, to distinguish her from Saint [[Mary of Egypt]]; 875 – 16 February 902) is a [[Byzantine]] saint of [[Armenia]]n origin, the daughter of an Armenian noble.&lt;ref name="Halsall"&gt;Paul Halsall, ''Medieval Sourcebook: Life of Mary the Younger, d.c. 903''. (Bronx, New York: Fordham University Press, 1997), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some details of her life, including her following after the mid-10th century, are not known for certain; the text documenting some of her most noteworthy accomplishments was most likely written after 1025.&lt;ref name="MAT"&gt;Mary-Alice Talbot, ''Holy Women of Byzantium: Ten Saints’ Lives in English Translation''. (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, 1996), 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Her family originated from [[Greater Armenia]], where her father was among the local grandees. They had settled in [[Constantinople]], probably at the start of the reign of [[Basil I the Macedonian]] ({{reign|867–886}}), who called her father along with other Armenian grandees to enter his service.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}} Maria was born in 875, probably in Constantinople, shortly after the death of her father. She had four older siblings, two brothers and two sisters; the latter were already married, indicating that Maria was a late child of her parents.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}} She was raised by her mother, and as soon as she was of age ({{circa|888}}), she married the ''[[droungarios]]'' Nikephoros, an acquaintance of her brother-in-law Bardas Bratzes. Nikephoros distinguished himself in the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896|894–896 war]] against the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]], and was rewarded with a posting (probably as commander) to the division (''[[tourma]]'') of [[Bizye]].{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}}

The couple had four sons: Orestes, born {{circa|889/90}}, who died at the age of five; Bardanes, born after Orestes' death, who himself died in {{circa|895/6}}; and the twins Baanes and Stephen, born between 897 and 900, of whom Baaners became a soldier and Stephen a monk, under the [[monastic name]] Symeon.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}} Around 900 she was accused by the siblings of her husband, Helena and Alexios, of being profligate with money and of a liaison with their servant Demetrios. Mary vehemently denied these allegations, but Nikephoros posted a guard at her room and tortured her maidservant, Agathe, for interrogation. He furthermore removed the supervision of the household finances from Mary and gave it to the steward Drosos and a female servant, with express instructions not to give Mary any money. The latter was so distressed by her husband's treatment of her, that she developed a stomach ailment.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}}

In 902, according to her hagiography, she expressed her disapproval that her husband, along with his siblings and servants, did not observe the [[fasting]] of [[Lent]]. Her disapproval was transmitted to Nikephoros in much exaggerated form, according to which she claimed that he was no real Christian, but a devil. Enraged, he manhandled Mary, who hit her head trying to escape. She died ten days later, on 16 February.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}} Her funeral was led by the Bishop of Bizye, and was attended by almost the entire population of the town, who accompanied the funeral procession to the local cathedral, where she was buried.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}} In 927, her son Stephen had her corpse, which had been miraculously preserved until that time, removed from her wooden coffin and placed in the marble [[sarcophagus]] of his father, whose corpse on the other hand had rotted away and was reburied outside the church.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}}

==Attributes==
Mary the Younger was a symbol of female virtue. She is described as being merciful, having a pattern of divine love, and having high self-control, which was a stereotypical male quality. She also had duties as a wife and mother, while having a strong sense of loyalty to God.&lt;ref name="Halsall" /&gt; One of Mary the Younger’s defining characteristics was that she was highly charitable. She would send money to a tax collector who eased punishment for those imprisoned for not being able to pay the diokete- which was a public tribute tax for housekeeping. In addition, she sought gold to help individuals who were suffering, and protected widows and orphans.&lt;ref name="Halsall" /&gt; From a strictly religious perspective, Mary the Younger was steadfast in her faith to God, even through times of struggle. For example, after her son Orestes died, she praised the Lord in a sincere manner for having let her experience this. From a perspective of gender, the fact that she had a “Married” status was not a significant issue to those who admired her.&lt;ref name="Halsall" /&gt; At the same time, Mary the Younger was looked down upon and underestimated, particularly by males in high places of authority. One of the men who underestimated her was the Bishop of Bizye, who did not believe that a woman who died in a married state could perform miracles the way that a man could.&lt;ref name="MAT" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4694">The '''Master suppression techniques''' is a framework articulated in 1945 by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[psychologist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ingjald Nissen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ingjald Nissen]], ''Psykopatenes diktatur'' 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques identified by Nissen are ways to indirectly suppress and humiliate opponents. In the late 1970s the framework was popularized by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] [[Berit Ås]],&lt;ref name="kjerringrad"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ås |first=Berit |authorlink=Berit Ås|title=Hersketeknikker |journal=Kjerringråd |issue=1978:3  |pages=17–21 |location=Oslo |issn=0800-0565}}&lt;/ref&gt; who reduced Nissen's original nine means to five. Master suppression techniques are defined as strategies of social [[Crowd manipulation|manipulation]] by which a dominant group maintains such a position in a (established or unexposed) [[hierarchy]]. They are very prominent in Scandinavian scholarly and public debate, where the expression is also used to refer to types of social manipulation not part of Ås's framework.&lt;ref name="chef"&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrén |first=Maria |title=Så hanterar du skitsnacket |work=Chef |publisher=Ledarna |date=2008-03-11 |url=http://www.chef.se/dynamisk/index.php/ur_chef/senaste_numret_details/sa-hanterar-du-skitsnack/188651.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525084338/http://www.chef.se/dynamisk/index.php/ur_chef/senaste_numret_details/sa-hanterar-du-skitsnack/188651.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2009-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Master suppression techniques are sometimes called '''domination techniques'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/daphnetoolkit/files/projects/2002_181/int_domination_techniques_norway.pdf|title=Domination techniques: what they are and how to combat them|publisher=The Centre for Gender Equality, Norway|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121025075341/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/daphnetoolkit/files/projects/2002_181/int_domination_techniques_norway.pdf   |archive-date = 2012-10-25 | date=April 2001|pages=12|format=pdf|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five master suppression techniques according to Ås==
===Making invisible===
To silence or otherwise [[marginalize]] persons in opposition by ignoring them

===Ridicule===
{{see also|Appeal to ridicule}}
In a manipulative way to portray the arguments of, or their opponents themselves, in a [[Appeal to ridicule|ridiculing]] fashion


===Withhold information===
To exclude a person from the decision making process, or knowingly not forwarding information so as to make the person less able to make an informed choice


===Double bind===
{{see also|Double bind}}
To punish or otherwise belittle the actions of a person, regardless of how they act


===Heap blame or put to shame===
To embarrass someone, or to insinuate that they are themselves to blame for their position

==Later additions by Ås==
Berit Ås has since added two supplementary master suppression techniques.&lt;ref name="womeninwhite"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ås|first=Berit|authorlink=Berit Ås|editor-last=Evengård|editor-first=Birgitta|title=Women In White: The European Outlook|year=2004|publisher=Stockholm City Council|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-631-5716-0|pages=78–83|chapter=The Five Master Suppression Techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectifying===
{{see also|Objectification}}
To discuss the appearance of one or several persons in a situation where it is irrelevant

===Force or threat of force===
To threaten with or use one's physical strength towards one or several persons

==Countermeasures against master suppression techniques==
A group of PhD students at Stockholm University&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamstallt.se/docs/ENSU%20bekraftartekniker.pdf  ENSU, Empowerment-Nätverket vid Stockholms Universitet (2004) ”Bekräftartekniker och motstrategier - sätt att bemöta maktstrukturer och förändra sociala klimat.”, 2010-07-01]&lt;/ref&gt; has formulated five ''counter strategies'':
* Take place
* Questioning
* The cards on the table
* Break the pattern
* Intellectualise

They have also formulated five ''confirmation techniques'':
* Visualizing
* Adherence
* Inform
* Double reward
* Confirm reasonable standards


The [[Centre for Gender Equality]] in Norway has also published an article about how to combat this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://organizingforpower.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/forms-of-domination.pdf Domination techniques: what they are and how to combat them]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20268">'''Modelling biological systems''' is a significant task of [[systems biology]] and [[mathematical biology]].{{efn|Sometimes called theoretical biology, dry biology, or even biomathematics.}} '''Computational systems biology'''{{efn|Computational systems biology is a branch that strives to generate a system-level understanding by analyzing biological data using computational techniques.}}&lt;ref&gt;Andres Kriete, Roland Eils, Computational Systems Biology, Elsevier Academic Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; aims to develop and use efficient [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], [[Biological data visualization|visualization]] and communication tools with the goal of [[computer modelling]] of biological systems. It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of biological systems, including [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems (such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s), to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tavassoly|first=Iman|last2=Goldfarb|first2=Joseph|last3=Iyengar|first3=Ravi|date=2018-10-04|title=Systems biology primer: the basic methods and approaches|url=http://essays.biochemistry.org/content/early/2018/10/02/EBC20180003|journal=Essays in Biochemistry|volume=62|issue=4|language=en|pages=487–500|doi=10.1042/EBC20180003|issn=0071-1365|pmid=30287586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Artificial life]] or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.

An unexpected [[emergent property]] of a [[complex system]] may be a result of the interplay of the cause-and-effect among simpler, integrated parts (see [[biological organisation]]).  Biological systems manifest many important examples of emergent properties in the complex interplay of components. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which quantities of data are gathered by category, such as concentration over time in response to a certain stimulus. Computers are critical to analysis and modelling of these data. The goal is to create accurate real-time models of a system's response to environmental and internal stimuli, such as a model of a cancer cell in order to find weaknesses in its signalling pathways, or modelling of ion channel mutations to see effects on cardiomyocytes and in turn, the function of a beating heart.

==Standards==
By far the most widely accepted standard format for storing and exchanging models in the field is the [[Systems Biology Markup Language| Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)]]&lt;ref&gt;Klipp, Liebermeister, Helbig, Kowald and Schaber. (2007). "Systems biology standards—the community speaks" (2007), Nature Biotechnology 25(4):390–391.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://sbml.org/ SBML.org] website includes a guide to many important software packages used in computational systems biology.  A large number of models encoded in SBML can be retrieved from [[BioModels]]. Other markup languages with different emphases include [[BioPAX]] and [[CellML]].

Creating a cellular model has been a particularly challenging task of [[systems biology]] and [[mathematical biology]]. It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of the many [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.

The complex network of biochemical reaction/transport processes and their spatial organization make the development of a [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] of a living cell a grand challenge for the 21st century, listed as such by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5806/1696.full American Association for the Advancement of Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

A whole cell computational model for the bacterium ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'', including all its 525 genes, gene products, and their interactions, was built by scientists from Stanford University and the J. Craig Venter Institute and published on 20 July 2012 in Cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2812%2900776-3 Karr, J. (2012) A Whole-Cell Computational Model Predicts Phenotype from Genotype Cell]&lt;/ref&gt;

A dynamic computer model of intracellular signaling was the basis for Merrimack Pharmaceuticals to discover the target for their cancer medicine MM-111.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2012/02/17/1535-7163.MCT-11-0820.short McDonagh, CF (2012) Antitumor Activity of a Novel Bispecific Antibody That Targets the ErbB2/ErbB3 Oncogenic Unit and Inhibits Heregulin-Induced Activation of ErbB3. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Membrane computing]] is the task of modelling specifically a [[cell membrane]].

===Multi-cellular organism simulation===
An open source simulation of C. elegans at the cellular level is being pursued by the [[OpenWorm]] community. So far the physics engine [https://github.com/openworm/OpenWorm/wiki/Geppetto--Overview Gepetto] has been built and models of the neural connectome and a muscle cell have been created in the NeuroML format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openworm.org/downloads.html OpenWorm Downloads&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein folding===
{{Main|Protein folding problem}}
Protein structure prediction is the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a [[protein]] from its [[amino acid]] sequence—that is, the prediction of a protein's [[tertiary structure]] from its [[primary structure]].  It is one of the most important goals pursued by [[bioinformatics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]]. [[Protein structure prediction]] is of high importance in [[medicine]] (for example, in [[drug design]]) and [[biotechnology]] (for example, in the design of novel [[enzymes]]). Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the [[CASP]] experiment.

===Human biological systems===

====Brain model====
The [[Blue Brain Project]] is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] the [[mammalian brain]] down to the molecular level. The aim of this project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the ''[[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|École Polytechnique]]'' in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, is to study the brain's architectural and functional principles. The project is headed by the Institute's director, Henry Markram. Using a [[Blue Gene]] [[supercomputer]] running Michael Hines's [[Neuron (software)|NEURON software]], the simulation does not consist simply of an [[artificial neural network]], but involves a partially biologically realistic model of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name="Brainsim"&gt;Graham-Rowe, Duncan. [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7470--mission-to-build-a-simulated-brain-begins.html "Mission to build a simulated brain begins"], ''NewScientist'', June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Jason. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8012496.stm Simulated brain closer to thought], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped by its proponents that it will eventually shed light on the nature of [[consciousness]].
There are a number of sub-projects, including the [[Cajal Blue Brain]], coordinated by the [[Supercomputing and Visualization Center of Madrid]] (CeSViMa), and others run by universities and independent laboratories in the UK, U.S., and Israel. The Human Brain Project builds on the work of the Blue Brain Project.&lt;ref name="hbp_homepage"&gt;[http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/index.html The Human Brain Project.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705000755/http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/index.html |date=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hbp_video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4a-Om-1MrQ Video of Henry Markram presenting The Human Brain Project on 22 June 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of six pilot projects in the Future Emerging Technologies Research Program of the European Commission,&lt;ref name="FET_flagships_homepage"&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/programme/fet/flagship/home_en.html FET Flagships Initiative homepage.]&lt;/ref&gt; competing for a billion euro funding.

====Model of the immune system====
The last decade has seen the emergence of a growing number of simulations of the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/5qn66fvhu6cvlyvc/ Multi-criterion Evolutionary Algorithm with Model of the Immune System to Handle Constraints for Task Assignments - Springer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090518111729.htm|title=Computer Simulation Captures Immune Response To Flu|accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Virtual liver====
The [[virtual liver network|Virtual Liver]] project is a 43 million euro research program funded by the German Government, made up of seventy research group distributed across Germany. The goal is to produce a virtual liver, a dynamic mathematical model that represents human liver [[mathematical physiology|physiology]], morphology and function.&lt;ref name="virtual liver"&gt;[http://www.virtual-liver.de/ Virtual Liver Network.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree model===
{{Main|Simulated growth of plants}}
Electronic trees (e-trees) usually use [[L-system]]s to simulate growth. L-systems are very important in the field of [[complexity science]] and [[A-life]].
A universally accepted system for describing changes in plant morphology at the cellular or modular level has yet to be devised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html |title=Simulating plant growth |accessdate=2009-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209022645/http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html |archivedate=2009-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most widely implemented tree generating algorithms are described in the papers [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218427 "Creation and Rendering of Realistic Trees"], and [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0nacdyjpyvxnnef/ Real-Time Tree Rendering]

===Ecological models===
{{Main|Ecosystem model}}
Ecosystem models are [[mathematics|mathematical]] representations of [[ecosystem]]s.  Typically they simplify complex [[food web|foodwebs]] down to their major components or [[trophic level]]s, and quantify these as either numbers of [[organism]]s, [[biomass]] or the [[inventory]]/[[concentration]] of some pertinent [[chemical element]] (for instance, [[carbon]] or a [[nutrient]] [[chemical species|species]] such as [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]]).

===Models in ecotoxicology===
The purpose of models in [[ecotoxicology]] is the understanding, simulation and prediction of effects caused by toxicants in the environment. Most current models describe effects on one of many different levels of biological organization (e.g. organisms or populations). A challenge is the development of models that predict effects across biological scales. [http://www.ecotoxmodels.org/ Ecotoxicology and models] discusses some types of ecotoxicological models and provides links to many others.

===Modelling of infectious disease===
{{Main|Mathematical modelling of infectious disease|Epidemic model}}
It is possible to model the progress of most infectious diseases mathematically to discover the likely outcome of an [[epidemic]] or to help manage them by [[vaccination]]. This field tries to find [[parameter]]s for various [[infectious disease]]s and to use those parameters to make useful calculations about the effects of a mass [[vaccination]] programme.

[[File:Motion Camouflage Principle.svg|thumb|upright=&lt;!--width for readable text--&gt;1.7|Principle of motion camouflage by mimicking the optic flow of the background. An attacker flies towards a target, choosing its path so that it remains on a line between target and a real point behind the attacker; this path differs from [[classical pursuit]]. The attacker looms larger as it closes on target, but does not otherwise appear to move]]
[[File:Red eyed tree frog edit2.jpg|thumb|Animals such as [[frog]]s are very good at detecting motion,&lt;ref name=Anstis/&gt; making motion camouflage a priority for predators.]]

'''Motion camouflage''' is [[camouflage]] which provides a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or [[Disruptive coloration|breaks up their outlines]]. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's mimicking the [[optic flow]] of the background as seen by its target. This enables the attacker to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The attacker chooses its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the attacker move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the attacker is moving is its [[looming]], the change in size as the attacker approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.

First discovered in [[hoverflies]] in 1995, motion camouflage by minimising optic flow has been demonstrated in another insect order, [[dragonflies]], as well as in two groups of [[vertebrates]], [[falcon]]s and [[Animal echolocation|echolocating]] [[bat]]s. Since bats hunting at night cannot be using the strategy for camouflage, it has been named, describing its mechanism, as constant absolute target direction. This is an efficient homing strategy, and it has been suggested that [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missile]]s could benefit from similar techniques.

Camouflage is sometimes facilitated by motion, as in the [[leafy sea dragon]] and some [[stick insect]]s. These animals complement their passive camouflage by swaying like plants, either preventing predators from detecting them, or appearing as something other than prey.

==Camouflage of approach motion==
{{further|List of camouflage methods}}

Many animals are highly [[motion perception|sensitive to motion]]; for example, [[frog]]s readily detect small moving dark spots but ignore stationary ones.&lt;ref name=Anstis&gt;{{cite web |last1=Anstis |first1=Stuart |title=Seeing Isn't Believing |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/43036/title/Seeing-Isn-t-Believing/ |publisher=The Scientist |accessdate=28 April 2017 |date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, motion signals can be used to defeat camouflage.&lt;ref name=Troscianko/&gt; Moving objects with [[disruptive camouflage]] patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, especially if other similar objects are nearby, even though they are detected, so motion does not completely 'break' camouflage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Joanna R.|last2=Cuthill|first2=Innes C.|last3=Baddeley|first3=Roland|last4=Shohet|first4=Adam J.|last5=Scott-Samuel|first5=Nicholas E. |title=Camouflage, detection and identification of moving targets |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |date=7 May 2013 |volume=280 |issue=1578 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.0064 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1758/20130064.long|pmc=3619462}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All the same, the conspicuousness of motion raises the question of whether and how motion itself could be camouflaged. Several mechanisms are possible.&lt;ref name=Troscianko&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Stevens, Martin|editor2=Merilaita, Sami |last=Troscianko |first=T. |title=Animal Camouflage: Mechanisms and Function |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10TCvK-9v70C&amp;pg=PA128 |year=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-49623-0 |pages=128–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hunting tiger edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Predator]]s such as [[tiger]]s stalk prey very slowly, to minimise motion cues.]]

===Stealthy movements===
One strategy is to minimise actual motion, as when [[predator]]s such as [[tiger]]s stalk prey by moving very slowly and stealthily. This strategy effectively avoids the need to camouflage motion.&lt;ref name=Troscianko/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macdonald |first1=David |last2=Loveridge |first2=Andrew |title=The Biology and Conservation of Wild Felids |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6USDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-923444-8 |pages=84–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimising motion signal===
When movement is required, one strategy is to minimise the motion signal, for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns that do not cause flicker when seen by the prey from straight ahead.&lt;ref name=Troscianko/&gt; [[Cuttlefish]] may be doing this with their [[active camouflage]] by choosing to form stripes at right angles to their front-back axis, minimising motion signals that would be given by occluding and displaying the pattern as they swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shohet, A.J.|author2=Baddeley, R.J.|author3=Anderson, J.C.|author4=Kelman, E.J.|author5=Osorio, D. |date=2006 |title=Cuttlefish responses to visual orientation of substrates, water flow and a model of motion camouflage |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=209 |pages=4717–4723 |url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/1767/1/Shohet_et_al_J_Exp_Biol_2006.pdf |doi=10.1242/jeb.02580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disrupting perception of motion===
Disrupting the attacker's perception of the target's motion was the main intended purpose of [[dazzle camouflage]] as used on ships in the [[First World War]], though its effectiveness is disputed. This type of dazzle does not appear to be used by animals.&lt;ref name=Troscianko/&gt;

{{anchor|Optic flow}}

===Mimicking optic flow of background===
[[File:Australian Emperor in flight.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Australian emperor]] dragonfly mimics the optic flow of its background using real-point motion camouflage to enable it to approach rivals.]]

Some animals mimic the [[optic flow]] of the background, so that the attacker does not appear to move when seen by the target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it.&lt;ref name=Troscianko/&gt;&lt;ref name="Srinivasan and Davey"/&gt; 

====Pursuit strategies====

An attacker can mimic the background's optic flow by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore does not move from the landmark point as seen by the target, though it inevitably [[looming|looms larger]] as it approaches. This is not the same as moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic flow from the background. The strategy works whether the background is plain or textured.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan and Davey"/&gt;

This motion camouflage strategy was discovered and modelled as [[algorithm]]s in 1995 by M. V. Srinivasan and M. Davey while they were studying mating behaviour in [[hoverflies]]. The male hoverfly appeared to be using the tracking technique to approach prospective mates.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan and Davey"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Strategies for active camouflage of motion |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/259/1354/19.short |author1=Srinivasan, M.

The strategy appears to work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage results in a more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies in a straight line or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.&lt;ref name=Glendinning&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691618/pdf/15129957.pdf | title=Motion Camouflage | publisher=The Royal Society | work=The mathematics of motion camouflage | date=27 January 2004 | accessdate=November 25, 2011 | author=Glendinning, Paul | pmc=1691618 | pmid=15129957 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2622 | volume=271 | pages=477–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Troscianko/&gt;

In [[sailing]], it has long been known that if the bearing from the target to the pursuer remains constant, known as [[constant bearing, decreasing range]] (CBDR), equivalent to taking a fixed reference point at infinite distance, the two vessels are on a collision course, both travelling in straight lines. In a simulation, this is readily observed as the lines between the two remain parallel at all times.&lt;ref name=Glendinning/&gt;&lt;ref name=Troscianko/&gt;

[[Animal echolocation|Echolocating]] [[bat]]s follow an infinity-point&lt;ref name=Troscianko/&gt; path when hunting insects in the dark.

The steering laws to achieve motion camouflage have been analysed mathematically. The resulting paths turn out to be extremely efficient, often better than classical pursuit. Motion camouflage pursuit may therefore be adopted both by predators and missile engineers (as "parallel navigation", for an infinity-point algorithm) for its performance advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Justh |first1=E.

==Camouflage by motion==
[[File:Australian Walking Stick.jpg|thumb|Cryptic [[stick insect]] ''[[Extatosoma tiaratum]]'' sways in the wind like foliage.]]

===Swaying: motion crypsis or masquerade===

Swaying behaviour is practised by highly cryptic animals such as the [[leafy sea dragon]] and the [[stick insect]] ''[[Extatosoma tiaratum]]''. These animals resemble vegetation with their coloration, strikingly disruptive body outlines with leaflike appendages, and the ability to sway effectively like the plants that they mimic. ''E. tiaratum'' actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is a gust of [[wind]], with a [[frequency]] distribution like foliage rustling in the wind. This behaviour may represent motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two, and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage.&lt;ref name="Bian2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bian |first1=Xue |last2=Elgar |first2=Mark A. |last3=Peters |first3=Richard A. |title=The swaying behavior of Extatosoma tiaratum : motion camouflage in a stick insect? |journal=Behavioral Ecology |date=2016 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=83–92 |doi=10.1093/beheco/arv125 |url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/27/1/83/1742619/The-swaying-behavior-of-Extatosoma-tiaratum-motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Murder of pregnant women''' is a type of [[homicide]] often resulting from [[domestic violence]]. Domestic violence&amp;mdash;or [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV)&amp;mdash;is suffered by many, and when analyzing cases in which victims came forward, majority of them are women.{{Citation needed|reason= 221 studies say otherwise: http://web.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm|date=March 2017}} Many of these women fear harm not just to themselves but also to their unborn children. Recently, more focus has been placed on pregnancy-associated deaths due to violence.&lt;ref name="Martin, SL 2007"&gt;Martin, S. L., Macy, R. J., Sullivan, K., and Magee, M. L. (2007) Pregnancy-Associated Violent Deaths: The Role of Intimate Partner Violence. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse. (8), 135-148.&lt;/ref&gt; IPV may begin when the victim becomes pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, B., McFarlane, J., and Soeken, K. (1994) Abuse During Pregnancy: Effects on Maternal Complications and Birth Weight in Adult and Teenage Women. Obstet Gynecol. 323-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that abuse while pregnant is a red flag for pregnancy-associated homicide.&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 2007"&gt;Campbell, J. C., Glass, N., Sharps, P. W., Laughon, K., and Bloom, T. (2007) Intimate Partner Homicide: Review and Implications of Research and Policy. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse. (8), 246-269.&lt;/ref&gt;

The murder of pregnant women represents a relatively recently studied class of [[murder]]. Limited statistics are available as there is no reliable system in place yet to track such cases.&lt;ref name="Wash Post"&gt;{{cite web|first=Donna|last=St. George|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10074-2004Dec18.html|title=Many New or Expectant Mothers Die Violent Deaths|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=December 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether [[pregnancy]] is a [[Causality|causal factor]] is hard to determine.

==Statistics==
ABC News have reported that studies in Maryland, New York, and Chicago found that approximately 20 percent of women who die during pregnancy are victims of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3316485&amp;page=1&amp;GMA=true|title=Murder Is One of Top Causes of Death for Pregnant Women|date=June 26, 2007|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' examined death-record data across the US which documented the killings of 1,367 pregnant women and new mothers since 1990. The newspaper reports:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he killings span racial and ethnic groups. In cases whose details were known, 67 percent of women were killed with firearms. Many women were slain at home &amp;mdash; in bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens &amp;mdash; usually by men they knew. Husbands. Boyfriends. Lovers.&lt;ref name="Wash Post"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Isabelle Horon and Diana Cheng of the [[Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] conducted a study of pregnancy-associated deaths in [[Maryland]] between 1993 and 1998, defining pregnancy-associated death as death during pregnancy or within a year of pregnancy ending. They found that homicide was the leading cause of pregnancy-associated death, accounting for 20% of such deaths. In contrast, homicide was only the fifth leading cause of death for women of reproductive age who had not been pregnant in the year previous to their death, and accounted for 6.4% of deaths in this group. The second leading cause of pregnancy-associated death, heart disease, accounted for 19%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horon|first=Isabelle L.|last2=Cheng|first2=Diana|date=2001|title=Enhanced Surveillance for Pregnancy-Associated Mortality—Maryland, 1993-1998|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/193666|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]|volume=285|pages=1455–1459|doi=10.1001/jama.285.11.1455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20010320/number-1-cause-of-death-in-pregnant-women-murder|title=No. 1 Cause of Death in Pregnant Women: Murder|author=|date=|website=webmd.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study using data from the District of Columbia also found that homicide was the leading cause of pregnancy-associated death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krulewitch|first=Cara J.|last2=Pierre-Louis|first2=Marie Lydie|last3=de Leon-Gomez|first3=Regina|last4=Guy|first4=Richard|last5=Green|first5=Richard|date=2001|title=Hidden from view: violent deaths among pregnant women in the District of Columbia, 1988-1996|journal=[[Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health]]|volume=46|pages=4–10|doi=10.1016/s1526-9523(00)00096-9|pmid=11300307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Homicide a leading cause of death in pregnant women.

A [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] study reported that "the overall pregnancy-associated homicide ratio was 1.7 deaths per 100 000 live births", and that homicide was not the leading cause of pregnancy-associated death, though it was still highlighted as among the leading causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Berg|first2=C.

They suggested a need for US states to improve their collection of data on pregnancy-associated deaths.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horon|first=Isabelle|last2=Cheng|first2=Diana|date=2005|title=Underreporting of pregnancy-associated deaths|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=95|pages=1879|doi=10.2105/ajph.2005.072017|pmid=16195505|pmc=1449445}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported in 2004 that "13 states said they had no way of telling how many pregnant and postpartum women had been killed in recent years".&lt;ref name="Wash Post" /&gt; In 2003, California remedied this by changing its [[death certificate]] documentation to include a female victim's maternity status.&lt;ref name="Wash Post" /&gt;

Homicide was the second-leading cause of death among women ages 20 to 24 and fifth among women ages 25–34 in 1999. The top cause of death in both age groups is accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kim|last=Curtis|url=http://www.now.org/issues/violence/043003pregnant.html|title=Murder: The Leading Cause of Death for Pregnant Women|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=April 23, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120233913/http://www.now.org/issues/violence/043003pregnant.html|archivedate=November 20, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws and policies==
The [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], passed in 2004, defines a fetus as a "child in uterus" and a person as being a legal crime victim "if a fetal injury or death occurs during the commission of a federal violent crime."&lt;ref&gt;Ghazaleh, S., Martin, S. L., and Schiro, S. (2010) Homicide Among Pregnant and Postpartum Women in the United States: A Review of the Literature. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse. (11), 42-54.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., 38 states have laws with more harsh penalties if the victim is murdered while pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrlc.org/federal/unbornvictims/statehomicidelaws092302/|title=State Homicide Laws That Recognize Unborn Victims|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nrlc.org|publisher=National Right to Life Committee|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx|title=Fetal Homicide State Laws|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these laws defining the fetus as being a person, "for the purpose of criminal prosecution of the offender" (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2008). [[Murder of Laci Peterson|Laci Peterson]], murdered in 2002, is one of the more high-profile homicides.

Currently in the [[North Carolina Senate]], a bill called the SB 353 Unborn Victims of Violence Act is being considered for legislation that would create a separate criminal offense for the death of a fetus when the mother is murdered. The North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence does not support this law for numerous reasons including failure to see violence against the mother as the cause of the fetal death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCCADV Position Statement: Fetal Murder Legislation|url=http://www.nccadv.org/pdf/2008/finalNCCADVSTATEMENTfetalmurder07.pdf|publisher=North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition does, however, support the position of the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]] regarding the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Intervention==
While it is almost impossible to determine an exact intervention point to prevent pregnancy-associated homicides, some possible opportunities can be pinpointed. The medical community is one of those points. Women may feel safe speaking to their health care providers about the abuse, especially after discovering they are pregnant. Some medical office and hospital policies specify that doctors will examine the patient privately without allowing the partner access. In a 2001 editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Victoria Frye writes, "Homicide by intimate partners may offer a focal point for effective pregnancy-associated mortality prevention efforts because many of these women come into contact with the health care system before their deaths."&lt;ref&gt;Frye, V. (2001) Examining Homicide's Contribution to Pregnancy-Associated Deaths. Journal of American Medical Association. (11), 1510-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of Intimate Partner Homicide policy and research has identified several needs: System-wide training in healthcare on signs of domestic violence&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 2007"/&gt; and system-wide screening for domestic violence by health care providers, as well as the knowledge of where to refer women to that need services when abuse is disclosed.&lt;ref name="Martin, SL 2007"/&gt;

==Motives==
Statistics for pregnancy as being a motivating factor in the murder of a pregnant woman are usually unavailable. Motives may vary, with a woman's pregnancy at the time of death sometimes being coincidental.

In [[information theory]] and [[statistics]], '''negentropy''' is used as a measure of distance to normality.  The concept and phrase "negative entropy" was introduced by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in his 1944 popular-science book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]]''&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger, Erwin, ''What is Life – the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell'', Cambridge University Press, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Léon Brillouin]] shortened the phrase to ''negentropy'',&lt;ref&gt;Brillouin, Leon: (1953) "Negentropy Principle of Information", ''J. of Applied Physics'', v. '''24(9)''', pp. 1152–1163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Léon Brillouin, ''La science et la théorie de l'information'', Masson, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; to express it in a more "positive" way: a living system imports negentropy and stores it.&lt;ref&gt;Mae-Wan Ho, [http://www.i-sis.org.uk/negentr.php What is (Schrödinger's) Negentropy?], Bioelectrodynamics Laboratory, Open university Walton Hall, Milton Keynes&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] proposed replacing the term ''negentropy'' with ''syntropy''. That term may have originated in the 1940s with the Italian mathematician [[Luigi Fantappiè]], who tried to construct a unified theory of [[biology]] and [[physics]]. [[Buckminster Fuller]] tried to popularize this usage, but ''negentropy'' remains common.

In a note to ''[[What is Life?]]'' Schrödinger explained his use of this phrase.
{{cquote|[...] if I had been catering for them [physicists] alone I should have let the discussion turn on ''[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]'' instead. It is the more familiar notion in this context. But this highly technical term seemed linguistically too near to ''[[energy]]'' for making the average reader alive to the contrast between the two things.}}

In 2009, Mahulikar &amp; Herwig redefined negentropy of a dynamically ordered sub-system as the specific entropy deficit of the ordered sub-system relative to its surrounding chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Mahulikar, S.P. &amp; Herwig, H.: (2009) "Exact thermodynamic principles for dynamic order existence and evolution in chaos", ''Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals'', v. '''41(4)''', pp. 1939–1948&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, negentropy has SI units of (J kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) when defined based on specific entropy per unit mass, and (K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) when defined based on specific entropy per unit energy. This definition enabled: ''i'') scale-invariant thermodynamic representation of dynamic order existence, ''ii'') formulation of physical principles exclusively for dynamic order existence and evolution, and ''iii'') mathematical interpretation of Schrödinger's negentropy debt.

==Information theory==
In [[information theory]] and [[statistics]], negentropy is used as a measure of distance to normality.&lt;ref&gt;Aapo Hyvärinen, [http://www.cis.hut.fi/aapo/papers/NCS99web/node32.html Survey on Independent Component Analysis, node32: Negentropy], Helsinki University of Technology Laboratory of Computer and Information Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aapo Hyvärinen and Erkki Oja, [http://www.cis.hut.fi/aapo/papers/IJCNN99_tutorialweb/node14.html Independent Component Analysis: A Tutorial, node14: Negentropy], Helsinki University of Technology Laboratory of Computer and Information Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruye Wang, [http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/ica/node4.html Independent Component Analysis, node4: Measures of Non-Gaussianity]&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] with a given mean and variance, the normal or [[Gaussian distribution]] is the one with the highest entropy. Negentropy measures the difference in entropy between a given distribution and the Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance. Thus, negentropy is always nonnegative, is invariant by any linear invertible change of coordinates, and vanishes [[if and only if]] the signal is Gaussian.

Negentropy is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;J(p_x) = S(\varphi_x) - S(p_x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S(\varphi_x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[differential entropy]] of the Gaussian density with the same [[mean]] and [[variance]] as &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S(p_x)&lt;/math&gt; is the differential entropy of &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;S(p_x) = - \int p_x(u) \log p_x(u) \, du&lt;/math&gt;

Negentropy is used in [[statistics]] and [[signal processing]]. It is related to network [[Information entropy|entropy]], which is used in [[independent component analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Comon, Independent Component Analysis – a new concept?, ''Signal Processing'', '''36''' 287–314, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Didier G. Leibovici and Christian Beckmann, [http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/techrep/tr01dl1/tr01dl1/tr01dl1.html An introduction to Multiway Methods for Multi-Subject fMRI experiment], FMRIB Technical Report 2001, Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), Department of Clinical Neurology, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headley Way, Headington, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correlation between statistical negentropy and Gibbs' free energy==
[[File:Wykres Gibbsa.svg|275px|thumb|right|[[Willard Gibbs]]’ 1873 '''available energy''' ([[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]) graph, which shows a plane perpendicular to the axis of ''v'' ([[volume]]) and passing through point A, which represents the initial state of the body. MN is the section of the surface of [[dissipated energy]]. Qε and Qη are sections of the planes ''η'' = 0 and ''ε'' = 0, and therefore parallel to the axes of ε ([[internal energy]]) and η ([[entropy]]) respectively. AD and AE are the energy and entropy of the body in its initial state, AB and AC its ''available energy'' ([[Gibbs energy]]) and its ''capacity for entropy'' (the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume) respectively.]]
There is a physical quantity closely linked to [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] ([[free enthalpy]]), with a unit of entropy and isomorphic to negentropy known in statistics and information theory. In 1873, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Willard Gibbs]] created a diagram illustrating the concept of free energy corresponding to [[free enthalpy]]. On the diagram one can see the quantity called [[capacity for entropy]]. This quantity is the amount of entropy that may be increased without changing an internal energy or increasing its volume.&lt;ref&gt;Willard Gibbs, [http://www.ufn.ru/ufn39/ufn39_4/Russian/r394b.pdf A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces], ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy'', 382–404 (1873)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a difference between maximum possible, under assumed conditions, entropy and its actual entropy. It corresponds exactly to the definition of negentropy adopted in statistics and information theory. A similar physical quantity was introduced in 1869 by [[François Jacques Dominique Massieu|Massieu]] for the [[isothermal process]]&lt;ref&gt;Massieu, M. F. (1869a).

In 1953, [[Léon Brillouin]] derived a general equation&lt;ref&gt;Leon Brillouin, The negentropy principle of information, ''J. Applied Physics'' '''24''', 1152–1163 1953&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the changing of an information bit value requires at least kT ln(2) energy. This is the same energy as the work [[Leó Szilárd]]'s engine produces in the idealistic case. In his book,&lt;ref&gt;Leon Brillouin, ''Science and Information theory'', Dover, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; he further explored this problem concluding that any cause of this bit value change (measurement, decision about a yes/no question, erasure, display, etc.) will require the same amount of energy.

'''Neurofeedback''' ('''NFB'''), also called '''neurotherapy''' or '''neurobiofeedback''', is a type of [[biofeedback]] that uses real-time displays of brain activity—most commonly [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), to teach self-regulation of brain function. Typically, sensors are placed on the scalp to measure activity, with measurements displayed using video displays or sound.

==Definition==

Neurofeedback is a type of [[biofeedback]] that measures brain waves to produce a signal that can be used as feedback to teach self-regulation of brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Napoletano|first1=Margo | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neurofeedback: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.childandfamilycenter.com/services-specialized-neurofeedback.htm|website=Child and Family Counseling Center|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurofeedback is commonly provided using video or sound, with positive feedback for desired brain activity and negative feedback for brain activity that is undesirable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Related technologies include [[hemoencephalography]] biofeedback (HEG) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) biofeedback.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===ADHD===
Clinical guidelines on neurofeedback as a treatment for ADHD are mixed. Biofeedback is graded by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] with their Level 2 evidence-based treatment for ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.braintrainuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/How-AAP-reached-conclusion-other-recent-evidence-July-2013-V3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2016}} The [[NICE]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53652/ guideline for ADHD] leaves the efficacy of biofeedback an open question (p.&amp;nbsp;412). In page 202 states "Biofeedback has been employed as a non-invasive treatment for children with ADHD since the 1970s but is probably not used as a significant intervention in UK clinical practice".  However this is unsurprising since in the UK, NICE evaluates whether treatments should  be recommended on the basis of the cost of a [[quality-adjusted life year]]. [http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/112/index.html SIGN guideline no 112] in page 24 mentions "Neurofeedback is presently considered to be an experimental intervention in children and young people with ADHD/HKD. There are no standardised interventions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network|title=Management of attention deficit and hyperkinetic disorders in children and young people: A national clinical guideline|year=2009|publisher=NHS Quality Improvement Scotland|pages=24|url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/112/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [https://www.icsi.org/guidelines__more/catalog_guidelines_and_more/catalog_guidelines/catalog_behavioral_health_guidelines/adhd/ guideline on Diagnosis and Management of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Primary Care for School-Age Children and Adolescents] in page 41 mentions neurofeedback lacks enough research evidence for efficacy in ADHD.&lt;ref name=ICSI&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnosis and Management of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Primary Care for School-Age Children and Adolescents|year=2012|publisher=Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement|page=41|url=https://www.icsi.org/guidelines__more/catalog_guidelines_and_more/catalog_guidelines/catalog_behavioral_health_guidelines/adhd/|author=Dobie C, |author2=Donald WB |author3=Hanson M |author4=Heim C |author5=Huxsahl J |author6=Karasov R |author7=Kippes C |author8=Neumann A |author9=Spinner P |author10=Staples T |author11=Steiner L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall research into neurofeedback is considered to have been limited and of low quality,&lt;ref name=ICSI/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22930416"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid25220087/&gt; although others have disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arns M, de Ridder S, Strehl U, Breteler M, Coenen A | title = Efficacy of neurofeedback treatment in ADHD: the effects on inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity: a meta-analysis | journal = Clinical EEG and Neuroscience | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 180–9 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19715181 | doi = 10.1177/155005940904000311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued there is some indication on the effectiveness of biofeedback for [[ADHD]] but that it is not conclusive: several studies have yielded positive results, however the best designed ones have either shown absent or reduced effects.&lt;ref name=ICSI/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22930416"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid25220087&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holtmann M, Sonuga-Barke E, Cortese S, Brandeis D | title = Neurofeedback for ADHD: a review of current evidence | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 789–806 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25220087 | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2014.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22890816"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lofthouse N, Arnold LE, Hurt E | title = Current status of neurofeedback for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 536–42 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22890816 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-012-0301-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts have proposed that standard neurofeedback protocols for ADHD, such as theta/beta, SMR and slow cortical potentials neurofeedback are well investigated and have demonstrated specificity.&lt;ref name="arns2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arns M, Heinrich H, Strehl U | title = Evaluation of neurofeedback in ADHD: the long and winding road | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 95 | pages = 108–15 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24321363 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.11.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No serious adverse side effects from neurofeedback have been reported.&lt;ref name="pmid22930416"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moriyama TS, Polanczyk G, Caye A, Banaschewski T, Brandeis D, Rohde LA | title = Evidence-based information on the clinical use of neurofeedback for ADHD | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 588–98 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22930416 | pmc = 3441929 | doi = 10.1007/s13311-012-0136-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

QEEG has been used to develop EEG models of ADHD. According to this model, persons with ADHD often have too many slow theta brain waves (associated with relaxation) and not enough fast beta wave activity (associated with mental focus).&lt;ref name = "Butnik"&gt;Butnik, Steven M.

The applications of neurofeedback to enhance performance extend to the arts in fields such as music, dance, and acting. A study with conservatoire musicians found that [[alpha wave|alpha-theta]] training benefitted the three music domains of [[musicality]], communication, and technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Egner T, Gruzelier JH | title = Ecological validity of neurofeedback: modulation of slow wave EEG enhances musical performance | journal = Neuroreport | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 1221–4 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12824763 | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200307010-00006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, alpha-theta training, a form of neurofeedback, was created to assist creativity by inducing [[hypnagogia]], a “borderline waking state associated with creative insights”, through facilitation of neural connectivity.&lt;ref name=Gruzelier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruzelier|first=John | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neurofeedback and the performing arts|journal=Neuroscience Letters|date=1 July 2011|volume=500|pages=e15|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2011.05.106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alpha-theta training has also been shown to improve novice singing in children. Alpha-theta neurofeedback, in conjunction with [[heart rate variability|heart rate variability training]], a form of [[biofeedback]], has also produced benefits in dance by enhancing performance in competitive ballroom dancing and increasing cognitive creativity in contemporary dancers. Additionally, neurofeedback has also been shown to instil a superior [[flow (psychology)|flow state]] in actors, possibly due to greater immersion while performing.&lt;ref name=Gruzelier/&gt;

However, randomized control trials have found that neurofeedback training (using either sensorimotor rhythm or theta/beta ratio training) did not enhance performance on attention-related tasks or creative tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doppelmayr M, Weber E |title=Effects of SMR and Theta/Beta Neurofeedback on Reaction Times, Spatial Abilities, and Creativity|journal=Journal of Neurotherapy|date=20 May 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=115–129|doi=10.1080/10874208.2011.570689 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that claims made by proponents of alpha wave neurofeedback training techniques have yet to be validated by randomized, double-blind, controlled studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Beyerstein |first=Barry L | name-list-format = vanc |title=Brainscams: Neuromythologies of the New Age|journal=International Journal of Mental Health|date=1990|volume=19|issue=3|pages=27–36 |doi=10.1080/00207411.1990.11449169}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view which even some supporters of alpha neurofeedback training have also expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Vernon D, Dempster T, Bazanova O, Rutterford N, Pasqualini M, Andersen S |title=Alpha Neurofeedback Training for Performance Enhancement: Reviewing the Methodology|journal=Journal of Neurotherapy|date=30 Nov 2009|volume=13|issue=4|pages=214–227|doi=10.1080/10874200903334397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and application ==

In 1924, the German psychiatrist [[Hans Berger]] connected a couple of electrodes (small round discs of metal) to a patient's scalp and detected a small current by using a ballistic [[galvanometer]].  During the years 1929-1938 he published 14 reports about his studies of EEGs, and much of our modern knowledge of the subject, especially in the middle frequencies, is due to his research.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaiser David A |year=2005 |title=Basic Principles of Quantitative EEG | journal=Journal of Adult Development |volume=12 |issue=2/3 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berger analyzed EEGs qualitatively, but in 1932&amp;nbsp;G. Dietsch applied [[Fourier analysis]] to seven records of EEG and became the first researcher of what later is called QEEG (quantitative EEG).&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;

Later, [[Joe Kamiya]] popularized neurofeedback in the 1960s when an article&lt;ref name="Kamiya1971"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamiya J | year = 1971 | title = Operant Control of the EEG Alpha Rhythm and Some of its Reported Effects on Consciousness | journal = Biofeedback and Self-Control: an Aldine Reader on the Regulation of Bodily Processes and Consciousness }}&lt;/ref&gt; about the alpha brain wave experiments he had been conducting was published in ''Psychology Today'' in 1968. Kamiya’s experiment had two parts. In the first part, a subject was asked to keep his eyes closed and when a tone sounded to say whether he thought he was in [[alpha rhythm|alpha]]. He was then told whether he was correct or wrong. Initially the subject would get about fifty percent correct, but some subjects would eventually develop the ability to better distinguish between states.&lt;ref name="Frederick2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frederick JA | title = Psychophysics of EEG alpha state discrimination | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 1345–54 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22800733 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2012.06.009 | url = http://www.brainm.com/documents/Publications/Frederick.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second part of the study, subjects were asked to go into alpha when a bell rang once and not go into the state when the bell rang twice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Once again some subjects were able to enter the state on command. Alpha states were connected with relaxation, and alpha training had the possibility to alleviate stress and stress-related conditions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Despite these claims, the universal correlation of high alpha density to a subjective experience of calm cannot be assumed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Alpha states do not seem to have the universal stress-alleviating power indicated by early observations.&lt;ref name="Hardt1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hardt JV, Kamiya J | title = Anxiety change through electroencephalographic alpha feedback seen only in high anxiety subjects | journal = Science | volume = 201 | issue = 4350 | pages = 79–81 | date = July 1978 | pmid = 663641 | doi = 10.1126/science.663641 | bibcode = 1978Sci...201...79H }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, [[Martin Theodore Orne|Martin Orne]] and others challenged the claim that alpha biofeedback actually involved the training of an individual to voluntarily regulate brainwave activity.&lt;ref name="Paskewitz1973"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paskewitz DA, Orne MT | title = Visual effects on alpha feedback training | journal = Science | volume = 181 | issue = 4097 | pages = 360–3 | date = July 1973 | pmid = 4719909 | doi = 10.1126/science.181.4097.360 | bibcode = 1973Sci...181..360P }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Hardt and Joe Kamiya, then at [[University of California, San Francisco|UC San Francisco]]'s [[Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute|Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute]] published a paper that supported biofeedback.&lt;ref name="Hardt1976"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hardt JV, Kamiya J | title = Conflicting results in EEG alpha feedback studies: why amplitude integration should replace percent time | journal = Biofeedback and Self-Regulation | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–75 | date = March 1976 | pmid = 990344 | doi = 10.1007/bf00998691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late sixties and early seventies, [[Barbara Brown (scientist)|Barbara Brown]], one of the most effective popularizers of Biofeedback, wrote several books on biofeedback, making the public much more aware of the technology.  The books included ''New Mind New Body'', with a foreword from [[Hugh Downs]], and ''Stress and the Art of Biofeedback''. Brown took a creative approach to neurofeedback, linking brainwave self-regulation to a switching relay which turned on an electric train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forghan|first1=Bahamin| name-list-format = vanc |title=Investigation brain Neuro biofeedback |url= https://www.academia.edu/660583/Investigation_brain_Neuro_biofeedback |website=Academia|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Barry Sterman, Joel F. Lubar and others has been relevant on the study of beta training, involving the role of sensorimotor rhythmic EEG activity.&lt;ref name="Sterman1962"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sterman MB, Clemente CD | title = Forebrain inhibitory mechanisms: cortical synchronization induced by basal forebrain stimulation | journal = Experimental Neurology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–102 | date = August 1962 | pmid = 13916975 | doi = 10.1016/0014-4886(62)90080-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This training has been used in the treatment of epilepsy,&lt;ref name="Sterman1972"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sterman MB, Friar L | title = Suppression of seizures in an epileptic following sensorimotor EEG feedback training | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–95 | date = July 1972 | pmid = 4113278 | doi = 10.1016/0013-4694(72)90028-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterman2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sterman MB | title = Basic concepts and clinical findings in the treatment of seizure disorders with EEG operant conditioning | journal = Clinical EEG | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–55 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10638352 | doi = 10.1177/155005940003100111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; attention deficit disorder and hyperactive disorder.&lt;ref name="Lubar1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lubar JF, Swartwood MO, Swartwood JN, O'Donnell PH | year = 1995 | title = Evaluation of the effectiveness of EEG neurofeedback training for ADHD in a clinical setting as measured by changes in TOVA scores, behavioral ratings, and WISC-R performance | journal = Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–99 | doi = 10.1007/bf01712768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) is rhythmic activity between 12 and 16 hertz that can be recorded from an area near the sensorimotor cortex. SMR is found in waking states and is very similar if not identical to the sleep spindles that are recorded in the second stage of sleep.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

For example, Sterman has shown that both monkeys and cats who had undergone SMR training had elevated thresholds for the convulsant chemical monomethylhydrazine. These studies indicate that SMR may be associated with an inhibitory process in the motor system.&lt;ref name=Sterman2000 /&gt;

Within the last 5–10 years, neurofeedback has taken a new approach in taking a look at deep states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hammond |first1=D. Corydon | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neurotherapy also called Neurofeedback or EEG Biofeedback |url=http://www.appliedneuroscience.org.au/neurotherapy |website=Applied Neuroscience Society of Australasia |publisher=Applied Neuroscience Society of Australasia |access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha-theta training has been tried with patients with alcoholism,&lt;ref name="SokhadzeEtal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sokhadze TM, Cannon RL, Trudeau DL | title = EEG biofeedback as a treatment for substance use disorders: review, rating of efficacy, and recommendations for further research | journal = Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–28 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18214670 | pmc = 2259255 | doi = 10.1007/s10484-007-9047-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; other addictions as well as [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="SokhadzeEtal2008" /&gt; This low frequency training differs greatly from the high frequency beta and SMR training that has been practiced for over thirty years and is reminiscent of the original alpha training of Elmer Green and Joe Kamiya.&lt;ref name="SokhadzeEtal2008" /&gt; Beta and SMR training can be considered a more directly physiological approach, strengthening sensorimotor inhibition in the cortex and inhibiting alpha patterns, which slow metabolism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Alpha-theta training, however, derives from the psychotherapeutic model and involves accessing of painful or repressed memories through the alpha-theta state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reel |first1=Justine J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Eating Disorders: An Encyclopedia of Causes, Treatment, and Prevention |date=2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-4408-0058-0 |page=300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The alpha-theta state is a term that comes from the representation on the EEG.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

A recent development in the field is a conceptual approach called the Coordinated Allocation of Resource Model (CAR) of brain functioning which states that specific cognitive abilities are a function of specific electrophysiological variables which can overlap across different cognitive tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thornton K. |author2=Carmody D. |year=2009 |title=Eyes-Closed and Activation QEEG Databases in Predicting Cognitive Effectiveness and the Inefficiency Hypothesis | journal=Journal of Neurotherapy |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1080/10874200802429850}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activation database guided EEG biofeedback approach initially involves evaluating the subject on a number of academically relevant cognitive tasks and compares the subject's values on the QEEG measures to a normative database, in particular on the variables that are related to success at that task.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Organizations===
The [[Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback]] (AAPB) is a non-profit scientific and professional society for biofeedback and neurofeedback. The International Society for Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR) is a non-profit scientific and professional society for neurofeedback.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bfe.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The Biofeedback Federation of Europe (BFE) sponsors international education, training, and research activities in biofeedback and neurofeedback.

==Neuroplasticity==

In 2010, a study provided some evidence of [[neuroplastic]] changes occurring after brainwave training. Half an hour of voluntary control of brain rhythms led in this study to a lasting shift in cortical excitability and intracortical function.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100310114936.htm Science Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors observed that the cortical response to [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) was significantly enhanced after neurofeedback, persisted for at least 20&amp;nbsp;minutes, and was correlated with an EEG time-course indicative of [[activity-dependent plasticity]].&lt;ref name="Ros2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ros T, Munneke MA, Ruge D, Gruzelier JH, Rothwell JC | title = Endogenous control of waking brain rhythms induces neuroplasticity in humans | journal = The European Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 770–8 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20384819 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07100.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1547">The '''Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative''' or '''Northwest Straits Initiative''' ('''NWSI''') was established under Title IV of Public Law 105–384 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;105th Congress. (1998, November 13). Title IV. Public Law 105-384, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of the [[Northwest Straits Commission]], the [[Marine Resources Committees]], and the [[Northwest Straits Foundation]].

The NWSI was born from political deadlock over the proposed formation of a federal marine sanctuary in the waters of northwest Washington, including Strait of Juan de Fuca and the San Juan Islands. Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Republican Congressman Jack Metcalf proposed the Initiative as an alternative to the marine sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;"Giving locals a chance."

'''Oceanic heat content''' (OHC) is the heat stored in the ocean. [[Oceanography]] and [[climatology]] are the science branches which study ocean heat content. Changes in the ocean heat content play an important role in the [[sea level rise]], because of [[thermal expansion]]. It is with high confidence that ocean warming accounts for 90% of the energy accumulation from [[global warming]] between 1971 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Summary for policymakers |year = 2013 |url=http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf |author = IPCC AR5 WG1 |website=www.climatechange2013.org |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one third of that extra heat has been estimated to propagate to depth below 700 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/ocean-depths-are-trapping-heat-19922|title=Study: Deep Ocean Waters Trapping Vast Store of Heat|year=2016|work=[[Climate Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and measurement==
The areal density of ocean heat content between two depth levels is defined using a [[definite integral]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dijkstra|first=Henk A.|title=Dynamical oceanography|year=2008|publisher=Springer Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540763758|page=276|edition=[Corr. 2nd print.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H= \rho c_p \int_{h2}^{h1}  T(z) dz&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is [[seawater]] density, &lt;math&gt;c_p &lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] of sea water, h2 is the lower depth, h1 is the upper depth, and &lt;math&gt; T(z) &lt;/math&gt; is the temperature profile. In [[SI units]], &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; has units of J&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Integrating this density over an ocean basin, or entire ocean, gives the total heat content, as indicated in the figure to right. Thus, the total heat content is the product of the density, specific heat capacity, and the [[volume integral]] of temperature over the three-dimensional region of the ocean in question.

Ocean heat content can be estimated using temperature measurements obtained by a [[Nansen bottle]], an [[Argo (oceanography)|ARGO float]], or [[ocean acoustic tomography]].  The [[World Ocean Database Project]] is the largest database for temperature profiles from all of the world’s oceans.

The upper Ocean heat content in most North Atlantic regions is dominated by heat transport convergence (a location where ocean currents meet), without large changes to temperature and salinity relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heat content variability in the North Atlantic Ocean in ocean reanalyses|doi=10.1002/2015GL063299|authors=Sirpa Häkkinen, Peter B Rhines, and Denise L Worthen|year=2015|pmc=4681455|pmid=26709321|volume=42|journal=Geophys Res Lett|pages=2901–2909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent changes==
Several studies in recent years have found a [[multi-decadal oscillation]] increase in OHC of the deep and upper ocean regions and attribute the heat uptake to [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A review of global ocean temperature observations: Implications for ocean heat content estimates and climate change |year = 2013 |author = Abraham|doi= 10.1002/rog.20022 |display-authors=etal |volume=51 |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |pages=450–483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies based on ''ARGO'' indicate that ocean surface [[wind]]s, especially the [[subtropical ridge|subtropical trade winds]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], change ocean heat vertical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Distinctive climate signals in reanalysis of global ocean heat content |year = 2013 |author = Balmaseda, Trenberth &amp; Källén |doi=  10.1002/grl.50382 |volume=40 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |pages=1754–1759}} [http://www.rmets.org/weather-and-climate/climate/has-global-warming-stalled Essay]&lt;/ref&gt; This results in changes among [[ocean current]]s, and an increase of the [[thermohaline circulation#Movement of thermohaline circulation|subtropical overturning]], which is also related to the [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]] phenomenon.

The '''Official Information Act 1997''' ({{lang-th|พระราชบัญญัติข้อมูลข่าวสารของราชการ พ.ศ. ๒๕๔๐}}) is a Thai act which guarantees the people's right to have full access to government information. It was approved by the [[National Assembly of Thailand|Thai National Assembly]] in July 1997 and entered into application on 8 December 1997.

== Background ==
The constitutions of [[Constitution of Thailand#1991 constitutions|1991]] and [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997]] had already recognised the right to information. The Official Information Act was passed at the same time as the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]], and was designed to formally define the conditions of access to information. The Act was the culmination of a period of political reform which started in 1992 with the [[Black May (1992)|popular protest in Bangkok]] against the government of General [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]], and was precipitated by [[1997 Asian financial crisis#Thailand|Thailand’s economic crisis]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="Blanton, Thomas 2009"&gt;Blanton, Thomas. "The World’s Right to Know." ''Foreign Policy'', 11 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the latter, the government perpetuated the tradition of non-disclosure towards the public. When the gravity of the crisis became evident, its lack of credibility, especially after the seriousness of the crisis became apparent, an [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] intervention was welcomed since it was considered as a way to guarantee to the Thai public relevant information on the scope of the crisis and on official actions to limit its consequences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Grigorescu, A. (2003), ''International Organizations and Government Transparency: Linking the International and Domestic Realms''. International Studies Quarterly, 47: 643–667.&lt;/ref&gt;

This chain of events led to the adoption of an official Act in 1997. According to Alexandru Grigorescu, the act was less the result of [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] demands for transparency than a signal by the Thai government that future information it offered would be verifiable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thailand was the first country in South East Asia to implement a [[Freedom of information|FOI]] law.

== Legal content and functioning ==
The Official Information Act guarantees people’s rights regarding official information (defined under section 4 as “information in possession or control of a State agency, whether it is the information relating to the operation of the State or the information relating to a private individual”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;"Official Information Act, B.E. 2540 (1997)." ''Thailawonline.''&lt;/ref&gt;), including the right to get advice (section 7&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;), to inspect, to request a copy (section 9&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;), and to ask the state to correct or change personal information (section 25&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

The law functions essentially through three mechanisms :
* state agencies (defined under section 4 as “central administration, provincial administration, local administration, State enterprise, Government agency attached to the [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly]], Court only in respect of the affairs unassociated with the trial and adjudication of cases”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) are to publish a list of official information in an official “Government Gazette” (section 7)
* they are also to make available a list of official information for public inspection (section 9)
* finally, they are to provide any official information other than that already published in the Gazette or made available for public inspection upon individual request (section 11)
The act established the Official Information Board (OIB), the leader of which is to be appointed by the [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]], and which is responsible for the implementation of the act.

=== Exemptions ===
A global principle states that state agencies are not to release information unless they are convinced that the request is necessary for the protection of the rights and liberties of an individual person or is beneficial to the public (section 11&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"''The Right to Information in Thailand.''", Country reports, Article 19, 15 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;).

One absolute exemption exists: official information which could harm the interests of the [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thai monarchy]] can never be disclosed (section 14&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

Other exemptions exist, although they are not absolute, and thus may or may not be a motive for the prohibition of the disclosure of official information. They are listed under section 15 and include information which may jeopardize the national security or international relations, information which may endanger the life or safety of a person, and medical reports. A Royal Decree can at any time add an element to the list of exemptions.

=== Appeals ===
If the disclosure of official information is refused, the requester can, invoking section 18, either file a complaint at the OIB, or appeal through the OIB to the Information Disclosure Tribunal, which is composed of non-civil servants, and they have a total of 15 days to do so after they have received an order prohibiting the disclosure. An appeal to this tribunal is final (except when a further appeal is submitted to the administrative court).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== The Official Information Act in practice ==
A case involving [[Kasetsart University Laboratory School|Kasetsart University Demonstration School]] is often cited as a reference, and one of the first successful cases putting the Official Information Act in practice. In 1998, Sumalee Limpa-ovart requested to see the examination sheets and marks of the entrance test, after her daughter failed the test. Her request was rejected, and she filed a complaint at the OIB, which failed. She then appealed to the Information Disclosure Tribunal, which concluded that all the exam papers and marks were to be considered as official information. After having accessed the sheets, she realized that candidates with lower marks than her daughter had been admitted because of family connections.&lt;ref&gt;Lintner, Bertil, Sheila S. Coronel and Chongkittavorn, Kavi. ''The Right to Know: Access to Information in Southeast Asia''. Quezon City, Philippines: Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Thailand's Ministry of University Affairs ordered a massive reform of admission procedures in the country. According to Andrew Harding and Peter Leyland, the case contributed greatly to the [[Education in Thailand|education system]] of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Andrew and Leyland, Peter. ''The Constitutional System of Thailand: A Contextual Analysis; Historical Analysis and Contemporary Issues in Thai Constitutionalism'' (2011), SOAS School of Law Legal Studies Research Paper Series No. 07/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Less successful applications were made to gain access to an official report on the [[Black May (1992)|popular protests of 1992]] by newspapers and families whose relatives were killed during the events. After months of no response, the [[Ministry of Defence (Thailand)|Ministry of Defence]] eventually released a report from 1992. However, it was, according to many of the victims' families, a “whitewash of events”,&lt;ref&gt;Streckfuss, David. ''Truth on Trial in Thailand: Defamation, Treason, and LeÌse-majesté''. Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the requesters were threatened of prosecution should the information be disseminated more widely.&lt;ref&gt;"''FOI International Focus : Thailand.''" Thailand. Ucl.ac.uk, 30 Sept. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Two years after its implementation, in the concluding remarks of his report on the act, Nakorn Serirak argued that it was “a crucial component of democratic development as it encourages people to enjoy more political participation by directly expressing their opinions and proposing their needs or suggestions to the state”.&lt;ref&gt;Serirak, Nakorn. "Thailand's Information Law." ''Freedom of Information Review''. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; More than half a million Thais utilized the Official Information Act in its first three years.&lt;ref name="Blanton, Thomas 2009"/&gt;

In 2000, following the creation of the OIB, the [[Bank of Thailand]] established an office to provide the public with access to financial and economic information.&lt;ref&gt;''Des Institutions Pour Les Marchés : Abrégé''. New York: Banque Mondiale, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Thailand|Thai government]] proclaimed 2002 the Year of Access to Official Information.

== Critiques and demand for refinement ==
Despite a relatively high amount of requests, a lack of public awareness of the act is often deplored (and the fact that a majority of these requests are made by citizens, not by journalists).

A forum entitled “14 years of Thailand’s Official Information Act: Time for a Change” was organized in 2011 by the [[Southeast Asian Press Alliance|Southeast Asian Press Alliance (SEAPA)]]. Thienchai Na Nakorn, Thailand’s Information Commissioner, acknowledged the existence of a culture of fear in the civil service that discouraged officials from providing information to the public, and that a reform of the act was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom of Information Law in Need of Reforms." ''SEAPA Southeast Asian Press Alliance'', 21 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue often raised regards time periods. When it has received a request, a State agency must reply “within a reasonable period of time” (section 11&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;). This period of time is not defined precisely in the act, however [[Article 19]]’s report on the state of Thailand’s FOI law indicates that the term has been “interpreted rather liberally by State officials”. Their research has found that delays of months followed by a refusal to release without an explanation are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Article 19, ''Freedom of Expression and the Media: Thailand'', December 2005, pp.106-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai journalist Kavi Chongkittavorn has published an article in [[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]] (although it is not available on the newspaper's website anymore) also asking for a reform of the act, describing it as a “tale of disappointment, betrayal and procrastination”.&lt;ref name="uppercaise"&gt;Chongkittavorn, Kavi. "Thais Let down by Free-info Reform." ''Uppercaise''. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes the fact that the OIB is, under section 27,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; under the control of the [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]]’s Office – and thus, part of the bureaucracy – rather than being an independent body like the Tribunal. In fact, the Board or its members do not have any specific duty to act independently.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf, G. W. ''Asian Data Privacy Laws: Trade and Human Rights Perspectives''. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chongkittavorn also deplores the coordinated adaptation of state agencies to the implementation of the act : &lt;blockquote&gt;“After some of the big fish were caught red-handed in the first three years, all government agencies were up in arms against the OIA in order to shield them from further disclosure and possibly prosecution. Understanding was reached among them that information disclosure would be at a snail’s pace to dissuade the public from using the OIA. Apparently, this strategy has been working unchallenged.”&lt;ref name="uppercaise" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Omphaloskepsis''''' or '''navel-gazing''' is contemplation of one's [[navel]] as an aid to [[meditation]].&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|omphaloskepsis|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] words {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὀμφαλός|ὀμφᾰλός]]}} ({{transl|grc|[[Omphalos|omphalós]]}}, {{Literal translation|'navel'|lk=on}}) and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σκέψις|σκέψῐς]]}} ({{transl|grc|sképsis}}, {{Literal translation|'viewing, examination, speculation'}}).&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;

Actual use of the practice as an aid to contemplation of basic principles of the cosmos and [[human nature]] is found in the practice of [[yoga]] of [[Hinduism]] and sometimes in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Continuum Encyclopedia of Symbols| first=Udo| last=Becker| publisher=[[Continuum International]]| year=2000| page=210| isbn=978-0-8264-1221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In yoga, the navel is the site of the manipura (also called nabhi) [[chakra]], which yogis consider "a powerful chakra of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Whispers beyond the Edge| first=Royal L.| last=Craig| publisher=[[Xlibris]]| year=2010| page=99| isbn=978-1-4500-7972-3}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Yantra Yoga| first=Chogyal Namkhai| last=Norbu| publisher=Snow Lion| year=2008| page=15| isbn=978-1-55939-308-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monks of [[Mount Athos]], Greece, were described as ''Omphalopsychians'' by J.G. Minningen, writing in the 1830s, who says they "...pretended or fancied that they experienced celestial joys when gazing on their umbilical region, in converse with the Deity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39074/39074-h/39074-h.htm#Page_40 |title=Curiosities of Medical Experience |publisher=Richard Bentley |edition=2nd |date=1839 |location=London |first=J.G. |last=Millingen |page=40 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, phrases such as "contemplating one's navel" or "[[wikt:navel-gazing|navel-gazing]]" are frequently used, usually in [[jocular]] fashion, to refer to self-absorbed pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Abbreviations Acronyms Glossary for American Readers| first=E.R.| last=Lyn

In [[lexical semantics]], '''opposites''' are words lying in an inherently incompatible binary relationship, like the opposite pairs ''big : small'', ''long : short'', and ''precede : follow''. The notion of incompatibility here refers to the fact that one word in an opposite pair [[Logical consequence|entails]] that it is not the other pair member. For example, something that is ''long'' entails that it is not ''short''. It is referred to as a 'binary' relationship because there are two members in a set of opposites. The relationship between opposites is known as '''opposition'''. A member of a pair of opposites can generally be determined by the question ''What is the opposite of &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;X&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;?''

The term '''antonym''' (and the related antonymy) is commonly taken to be synonymous with opposite, but antonym also has other more restricted meanings. Graded (or gradable) antonyms are word pairs whose meanings are opposite and which lie on a continuous spectrum (hot, cold). Complementary antonyms are word pairs whose meanings are opposite but whose meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum (''push'', ''pull''). [[Relational antonym]]s are word pairs where opposite makes sense only in the context of the relationship between the two meanings (''teacher'', ''pupil''). These more restricted meanings may not apply in all scholarly contexts, with Lyons (1968, 1977) defining antonym to mean gradable antonyms, and Crystal (2003) warns that antonymy and antonym should be regarded with care.

==General discussion==
Opposites are simultaneously different and similar in meaning. Typically, they differ in only one dimension of meaning, but are similar in most other respects, including similarity in grammar and positions of semantic abnormality. Additionally, not all words have an opposite. Some words are non-opposable. For example, animal or plant species have no binary opposites (other than possible sex opposites such as lion/lioness, etc.); the word [[platypus]] therefore has no word that stands in opposition to it (hence the unanswerability of ''What is the opposite of &lt;u&gt;platypus&lt;/u&gt;?'').

Other words are opposable but have an [[accidental gap]] in a given language's [[lexicon]]. For example, the word ''devout'' lacks a lexical opposite, but it is fairly easy to conceptualize a parameter of devoutness where ''devout'' lies at the positive pole with a missing member at the negative pole. Opposites of such words can nevertheless sometimes be formed with the prefixes ''un-'' or ''non-'', with varying degrees of naturalness. For example, the word ''undevout'' appears in Webster's dictionary of 1828, while the pattern of ''non-person'' could conceivably be extended to ''non-platypus''. Conversely, some words appear to be a prefixed form of an opposite, but the opposite term does not exist, such as ''inept,''  which appears to be ''in-'' + *''ept;'' such a word is known as an [[unpaired word|unpaired]] word￼￼. 

Opposites may be viewed as a special type of incompatibility.&lt;ref&gt;Incompatibility can be compared to [[exclusive disjunction]] in logic.&lt;/ref&gt; Words that are incompatible create the following type of [[entailment]] (where ''X'' is a given word and ''Y'' is a different word incompatible with word X):&lt;ref&gt;There are four types of entailment useful to lexical semantics:
* '''unilateral entailment''': ''It's a fish'' unilaterally entails ''It's an animal''. (It is unilateral, i.e. one-directional, because ''It's an animal'' does not entail ''It's a fish'' since ''it'' could be a dog or a cat or some other animal.)
* '''[[logical equivalence]]''' (or multilateral entailment): ''The party commenced at midnight'' entails ''The party began at midnight'' AND ''The party began at midnight'' also entails ''The party commenced at midnight''.
* '''contrariety''': The sentences 'X is blue all over' and 'X is red all over' are contraries since both cannot be simultaneously true. On the Aristotelian square of opposition, the A and E type propositions ('All As are Bs' and 'No As are Bs', respectively) are contraries of each other. Propositions that cannot be simultaneously false (e.g. 'Something is red' and 'Something is not red') are said to be '''subcontraries'''.
* '''contradiction''': ''It's dead'' entails ''It's not alive'' AND ''It's not alive'' entails ''It's dead'' AND ''It's alive'' entails ''It's not dead'' AND ''It's not dead'' entails ''It's alive''. ''It's dead'' and ''It's alive'' are said to be in a contradictory relation.&lt;/ref&gt;

: sentence ''A is &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;X&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;'' &amp;nbsp;entails&amp;nbsp; sentence ''A is not &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;Y&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;'' &lt;ref&gt;Stated differently, if the proposition expressed by the sentence ''A is &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;X&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;'' is TRUE, then the proposition expressed by the sentence ''A is not &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;Y&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;'' is also TRUE.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an incompatible pair of words is ''cat : dog'':

: ''It's &lt;u&gt;a cat&lt;/u&gt;'' &amp;nbsp;entails&amp;nbsp; ''It's not &lt;u&gt;a dog&lt;/u&gt;'' &lt;ref&gt;It is assumed here that ''it'' has the same [[referent]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This incompatibility is also found in the opposite pairs ''fast : slow'' and ''stationary : moving'', as can be seen below:

: ''It's &lt;u&gt;fast&lt;/u&gt;'' &amp;nbsp;entails&amp;nbsp; ''It's not &lt;u&gt;slow&lt;/u&gt;'' &lt;ref&gt;It is also assumed here the reference point of comparison for these adjectives remains the same in both sentences. For example, a rabbit might be fast compared to turtle but slow compared to a sport car. It is essential when determining the relationships between the lexical meaning of words to keep the situational context identical.&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''It's &lt;u&gt;stationary&lt;/u&gt;'' &amp;nbsp;entails&amp;nbsp; ''It's not &lt;u&gt;moving&lt;/u&gt;''

Cruse (2004) identifies some basic characteristics of opposites:

* binarity
* inherentness
* patency
'''

== Antonyms ==
An antonym is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings. Each word in the pair is the antithesis of the other. A word may have more than one antonym. There are three categories of antonyms identified by the nature of the relationship between the opposed meanings. Where the two words have definitions that lie on a continuous spectrum of meaning, they are gradable antonyms. Where the meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum and the words have no other lexical relationship, they are complementary antonyms. Where the two meanings are opposite only within the context of their relationship, they are relational antonyms.

=== Gradable antonyms ===
A gradable antonym is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings where the two meanings lie on a continuous spectrum. Temperature is such a continuous spectrum so ''hot'' and ''cold'', two meanings on opposite ends of the spectrum, are gradable antonyms. Other examples include: ''heavy'' : ''light'', ''fat'' : ''skinny'', ''dark'' : ''light'', ''young'' : ''old'', ''early'' : ''late'', ''empty'' : ''full'', ''dull'' : ''interesting''.

=== Complementary antonyms ===
A complementary antonym, sometimes called a binary or contradictory antonym (Aarts, Chalker &amp; Weiner 2014), is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings, where the two meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum. There is no continuous spectrum between ''odd'' and ''even'' but they are opposite in meaning and are therefore complementary antonyms. Other examples include: ''mortal'' : ''immortal'', ''exit'' : ''entrance'', ''exhale'' : ''inhale'', ''occupied'' : ''vacant''.

=== Relational antonyms ===
A [[Converse (semantics)|relational antonym]] is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings, where opposite makes sense only in the context of the relationship between the two meanings. There is no lexical opposite of ''teacher'', but ''teacher'' and ''pupil'' are opposite within the context of their relationship. This makes them relational antonyms. Other examples include: ''husband'' : ''wife'', ''doctor'' : ''patient'', ''predator'' : ''prey'', ''teach'' : ''learn'', ''servant'' : ''master'', ''come'' : ''go'', ''parent'' : ''child''.

== Opposite ==
Some [[planned language]]s abundantly use such devices to reduce vocabulary multiplication.
[[Esperanto vocabulary#Affixes|Esperanto]] has ''mal-'' (compare ''bona'' = "good" and ''malbona'' = "bad"), [[Damin]] has ''kuri-'' (''tjitjuu'' "small", ''kuritjitjuu'' "large") and [[Newspeak]] has ''un-'' (as in ''ungood'', "bad").

===Directional opposites===
* ''antipodals''
* ''pseudo-opposites''
* ''reversives''
* [[Converse (semantics)|''converses'']] (or ''relational opposites'' or ''relational antonyms''), pairs in which one describes a relationship between two objects and the other describes the same relationship when the two objects are reversed, such as ''parent'' and ''child'', ''teacher'' and ''student'', or ''buy'' and ''sell''.

==Auto-antonyms==
An [[auto-antonym]] is a word that can have opposite meanings in different contexts or under separate definitions:
* [[enjoin]] (to prohibit, issue [[injunction]]; to [[General order|order]], [[wikt:command|command]])
* [[wiktionary : fast#Adjective|fast]] (moving quickly; fixed [[wiktionary : firmly|firmly]] in place)
* [[wiktionary : cleave|cleave]] (to [[wiktionary : split|split]]; to [[wiktionary : adhere|adhere]])
* [[wiktionary : sanction|sanction]] ([[punishment]], prohibition; permission)
* [[wiktionary:stay|stay]] ([[wiktionary : remain|remain]] in a specific place, postpone; [[wiktionary : guide|guide]] direction, movement)

'''Paramatman''' ([[Sanskrit]]: परमात्मन्, [[IAST]]: Paramātmāṇ) or '''Paramātmā''' is the Absolute [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Supreme self) in [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] philosophies in the [[Hindu]] theology. The Paramatman is the “Primordial Self” or the “Self Beyond” who is spiritually practically identical with the Absolute, identical with the [[Brahman]]. Selflessness is the attribute of Paramatman, where all personality/individuality vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Occult Glossary:A Comendium of Oriental and Theosophical Terms|author=T. Depurucker|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=130|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eRztON94euYC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word stem ''paramātma'' (परमात्मन्, pronounced {{IPA-sa|pərəmaːtmən|}}, its nominative singular being ''paramātmā'' — परमात्मा, pronounced {{IPA-sa|pərəmaːtmaː|}}) is formed from two words, ''parama'', meaning "supreme" or "highest", and ''ātma'', which means individual self.

The word “[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]” generally denotes the Individual Self, but by the word “Paramatman” which word also expresses Boundless Life, Boundless Consciousness, Boundless Substance in Boundless Space, is meant the Atman of all atmans or the Supreme Self or the Universal Self. The word “Atman” which literally means non-darkness or light, is Brahman the subtlest indestructible Divine existence. The word “Paramatman” refers to the Creator all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atman and Paramatman|url=http://autobiography.swami.center.org/atman-and-paramatman.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paramatman in Jain theology==
{{main|Jīva (Jainism)}}
In [[Jainism]], each atman or individual self is a potential Paramatman or God, both are essentially the same. It remains as atman only because of its binding [[karma|"karmic"]] limitations, until such time as those limitations are removed. As Paramatman, the atman represents the ultimate point of spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|page=245|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgNHE-48jNcC&amp;pg=PA245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Jain [[mysticism]] centers around Atman and Paramatman because it believes in the existence of soul, in Jainism, which accepts neither [[Vedic]] authority nor [[Monism]], all enlightened souls are referred to as Paramatman and regarded as gods. Jainism honours the soul of each man as its own eternally distinct [[Messiah|savior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The World’s Great Religions:An Anthology of Sacred Texts|author=Selwyn Gurney Champion|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|page=149|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wEjIX4FldtkC&amp;pg=PA149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Paramatman of Jainism is unable to create and govern the world, there is no place of God as a creator and bestower of fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Jaina Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion|author=Arvind Sharma|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |p=4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BtbbLjvTkGMC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paramatman in Buddhism==

Buddhism rejects a metaphysics of "ground" such as the paramatman.

==Description of Paramatman in the Upanishads==

The sage of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] IV.4.2, though not using the word “Paramatman”, explains that at the time of release the portion (aspect) of the Paramatman and the portion (aspect) of the [[Jiva]] presiding in the right eye become unified with the Paramatman and the Jiva presiding in the heart, then the Jiva does not see, smell, taste, speak, hear, feel, touch and know; when Paramatman goes out, the Chief [[Prana]] goes out after Him, followed by the Lower Prana. Paramatman goes out riding on the Jiva following consciousness and work, knowledge of former life or natural capacity. In the [[Prashna Upanishad]] IV.11 the word “Atman” cannot refer to Jiva because the Jiva cannot of its own accord throw off its body or understand avidya, therefore, it refers to Paramatman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus, Vol. 15. Part(2)|author=Baman Das Basu|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=522,527|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dn_SVa0vgzcC&amp;pg=PA522&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jiva attains [[Moksha]] when he actually knows the Paramatman, the Asarira Prajnatman, to be thousand-headed, to be the governor of all and to be superior to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|author=B.D.Basu, S.C.Vasu|publisher= Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0sIq2gHSxgkC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qmvVUKfQLo3zrQeVqIG4AQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Paramatman is one of the many aspects of [[Brahman]] and has all attributes of Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dhanyashtakam|author=Swami Tejomayanand|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-f-MxhUxa4oC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atman (Spirit) and Paramatman (God) are one, some say they are distinct as well as one, they are one with reference to Shakti but distinct with reference to that power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theosophist Magazine February-March 1909|author=Annie Wood Besant|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jzvSqNTx7oC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Parable of the Two Birds==

The word, Paramatman, is not to be found in the [[Rig Veda]] but through allusion referring to Paramatman as Isha. This distinction is made because all of its mantras which in the form of prayers are addressed to gods. In its great Riddle Hymn (Sukta I.164) is the famous mantra - R.V.I.164.20, that was revealed to Rishi Deergatamaah Auchathyah and borrowed  by [[Mundaka Upanishad]] III.1.1-3, which belongs to [[Atharva Veda]], to weave the parable of the Two Birds:-Two birds.
 
:::Two birds, beautiful of wings, close companions, cling to one common tree: of the two one eats the sweet fruit of that tree; the other eats not but watches his companion. The self is the bird that sits immersed on the common tree; but because he is not lord he is bewildered and has sorrow. But when he sees that other who is the Lord and the beloved, he knows that all is His greatness and his sorrow passes away from him. When, a seer, he sees the Golden-hued, the maker, the Lord, the Spirit who is the source of Brahman, then he becomes the knower and shakes from his wings sin and virtue; pure of all stains he reaches the supreme identity.

-Translation of Verses 1-3 of Third Mundaka Upanishad by Sri Aurobindo.

Here at, [[Aurobindo]] makes the [[Spirit]] or [[Purusha]] as the Source of everything, including [[Brahman]]. He makes Purusha more fundamental. Thus, he does not have to say Brahman to be the source of inferior Brahman, and he also dismisses the sense of Reality revealed in imaginative and emotional build-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Parable of Two Birds|author=Ry Deshpande|url=http://archives.mirroroftomorrow.org/blog/_archives/2010/9/30/4631783.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415120619/http://archives.mirroroftomorrow.org/blog/_archives/2010/9/30/4631783.html|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case of Two souls==

The Dualistic School of Philosophy initiated by Anandatirtha draws its support from  the afore-cited passage as well as from the passage of [[Katha Upanishad]] I.3.1  of an earlier Upanishad that speaks about two souls which taste the fruits of action, both of which are lodged in the recess of the human heart, and which are different from each other as light and shade, that carried the flaw – how could the Universal soul be regarded as enjoying the fruits of action? The followers of [[Madhava (Vishnu)|Madhava]] draw their support from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] XV.16 that speaks about two persons in this world, the Mutable and the Immutable; the Mutable is all these things, while the Immutable is the one who exists at the top of them, one is the Jivatman and the other, Paramatman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=151|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jivatman is ''chit'', the sentient, and Paramatman is [[Isvara]], both have the same attributes; they are inseparably present together on the tree which is ''achit'', the insentient, or the gross ''Avidya'' component of existence. Jivatman and Paramatman are both seated in the heart, the former is driven by the three modes of nature and acts, the latter simply witnesses as though approving the former’s activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two birds in a tree - Soul and Supersoul|url=http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/philosophy/two-birds-in-a-tree-soul-and-supersoul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Paramātmā, the Universal Self, and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|'ātma]], the Individual Self, is likened to the indwelling God and the soul within one's heart. Paramatman is one of the many aspects of [[Brahman]]. Paramatman is situated at the core of every individual [[jiva]] in the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]]. The [[Upanishad]]s do compare Atman and Paramatman to two birds sitting like friends on the branch of a tree (body) where the Atman eats its fruits ([[karma]]), and the Paramatman only observes the Atman as a witness (sākṣin) of His friend's actions.

==Advaita==
In [[Advaita]] philosophy, individual souls are called Jīvātman, and the Highest Brahman is called Paramātman. The Jivatman and the Paramatman are known to be one and the same when the Jivatman attains the true knowledge of the Brahman (Skt. ''Brahmajñāna'')  . In the context of Advaita, the word Paramatman is invariably used to refer to [[Nirguna Brahman]], with [[Ishvara]] and [[Bhagavan]] being terms used to refer to Brahman with qualities, or [[Saguna Brahman]].

[[Brahman]] and [[Isvara]] are not synonymous words, the apparent similarity is on account of similar looking attributes imagined with regard to the impressions these two words activate. According to Advaita, Isvara is Brahman associated with Maya in its excellent aspect, as the empirical reality it is the determinate Brahman; Isvara has no reality apart from Brahman. The [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] developed the conception of a personal God. The [[Katha Upanishad]] states that never has any man been able to visualise Paramatman by means of sight, heart, imagination or mind. The Anandamaya-kosha is the Isvara of the Upanishads. [[Gaudapada]] called duality Maya, and non-duality, the only reality. Maya is the Cosmic Nescience that has in it the plurality of subject and object and therefore, Isvara is organically bound with the world. Beyond the Prana or Isvara is the state of the Infinite limitless Brahman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|pages=189–197|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is why in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] VII.24, Krishna tells Arjuna – “not knowing My unsurpassable and undecaying supreme nature the ignorant believe Me to have assumed a finite form through birth.”

With regard to the cause of [[Samsāra]], as to where it resides and the means of its removal, [[Adi Shankara]] in his [[Vivekachudamani]].49. instructs that the individual self is the Paramatman in reality, the association of the individual self with ''ajnana'' i.e. with ''avidya'', which he terms as ''anatmabandhah'', bondage by the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|anatman]] or non-atman, makes it to identify itself with gross, subtle and causal bodies and from that arises [[Samsāra]] which is of the form of superimposition of qualities of ''sukha'', ''dukha'' etc., on itself, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;dq=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cSjAUOuVM4vprQe-moHoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brahma Kumaris==
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]] religion, Paramatma (Supreme Soul) is called [[Shiva]], or Shiva Baba. His form is a point of infinitesimal light and his abode is Paramdham or [[Nirvana]].

==Vaishnavism==
Paramatman is beyond knowledge and ignorance, devoid of all material attributes ([[upadhi]]). In Chapter 13 of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Paramatman is described as [[Krishna]] residing in the hearts of all beings and in every atom of matter. He is the overseer and the permitter of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/bg/13/23/en Bhagavad Gita 13.23] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312211826/http://vedabase.net/bg/13/23/en |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/7/14/38/en Bhagavata Purana 7.14.38] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312212902/http://vedabase.net/sb/7/14/38/en |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramatman is different from five elements (pancha mahabhutas), the [[sense]]s, [[mind]], [[pradhana]] and jiva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en Bhagavata Purana 3.28.41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217121958/http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en |date=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaishnavism#Vaishnava sampradayas|Vaishnava sects]] maintain that attaining knowledge of Brahman and identification of Atman with Brahman is an intermediate stage of self-realization, and only [[Bhakti Yoga]] can lead to the next step of Paramatman realization as the indwelling God, ultimately leading up to liberation ([[Moksha|Mukti]]) by God-realization.

The Viṣṇu or the deity of the ''quality of goodness'' in the material world is the puruṣa-avatāra known as [[Ksirodakasayi Vishnu|Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu]] or ''Paramātmā''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20101123213949/http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/23/en]

In Bengal, Vaishnava Krishna is viewed as one endowed with his essential svarupa-shakti, he is Bhagawat in full manifestation endowed with Jivasakti and Mayasakti, he the Paramatman and Brahman. Brahman, Paramatman and Bhagavan are 3 gradations of the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traditions of Mysticism in Bengal|author=Sandhu Santidev|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGeitIm_--cC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time==
[[Time]] is described in Vedas:

{{quote|My Lord, I consider Your Lordship to be eternal time, the supreme controller, without beginning and end, the all-pervasive one. ... Eternal time is the witness of all our actions, good and bad, and thus resultant reactions are destined by Him. It is no use saying that we do not know why and for what we are suffering. We may forget the misdeed for which we may suffer at this present moment, but we must remember that Paramātmā is our constant companion, and therefore He knows everything, past, present and future. And because the Paramātmā feature of Lord Kṛṣṇa destines all actions and reactions, He is the supreme controller also. Without His sanction not a blade of grass can move.[http://vedabase.net/sb/1/8/28/en]}}

Pluralistic ignorance may help to explain the [[bystander effect]].&lt;ref name="kitts2003"/&gt; If no-one acts, onlookers may believe others believe action is incorrect, and may therefore themselves refrain from acting.

==Research==
[[Deborah Prentice|Prentice]] and Miller found that, on average, private levels of comfort with drinking practices on campus were much lower than the perceived average. In the case of men, they found a shifting of private attitudes toward this perceived norm, a form of [[cognitive dissonance]]. Women, on the other hand, were found to have an increased sense of alienation on the campus but lacked the attitude change detected in men, presumably because norms related to alcohol consumption on campus are much more central for men than for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Pluralistic ignorance and alcohol use on campus: Some consequences of misperceiving the social norm.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1993|volume=64|issue=2|pages=243–256|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.2.243|pmid=8433272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that pluralistic ignorance plagues not only those who indulge, but also those who abstain: from gambling, smoking and drinking and among some who follow vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schanck|first1=Richard Louis|title=A study of a community and its groups and institutions conceived of as behaviors of individuals.|journal=Psychological Monographs|date=1932|volume=43|issue=2|pages=i–133|doi=10.1037/h0093296}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has found that pluralistic ignorance can be caused by the structure of the underlying social network, not cognitive dissonance.

The theory of pluralistic ignorance was studied by [[Floyd Henry Allport]] and his students [[Daniel Katz (psychologist)|Daniel Katz]] and [[Richard Schanck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Gorman |first1=Hubert J. |title=The discovery of pluralistic ignorance: An ironic lesson |journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences |date=October 1986 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=333-347 |doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198610)22:4&lt;333::AID-JHBS2300220405&gt;3.0.CO;2-X |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced studies of racial stereotyping and prejudice, and attitude change, and his pursuit of the connections between individual psychology and social systems helped to found the field of [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organizational psychology]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], in her [[spiral of silence]] theory, argued that media biases lead to pluralistic ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Noelle-Neumann, Elisabeth (1993) ''The Spiral of Silence: Public Opinion – Our Social Skin'' (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Pluralistic ignorance was blamed for exacerbating support for [[racial segregation in the United States]]. It has also been named a reason for the illusory popular support that kept the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in power, as many opposed the regime but assumed that others were supporters of it. Thus, most people were afraid to voice their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Gorman|first1=Hubert J.|title=Pluralistic Ignorance and White Estimates of White Support for Racial Segregation|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=1975|volume=39|issue=3|pages=313|doi=10.1086/268231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case of pluralistic ignorance concerns drinking on campus in countries where alcohol use is prevalent at colleges and universities. Students drink at weekend parties and sometimes at evening study breaks. Many drink to excess, some on a routine basis. The high visibility of heavy drinking on campus, combined with reluctance by students to show any public signs of concern or disapproval, gives rise to pluralistic ignorance: Students believe that their peers are much more comfortable with this behavior than they themselves feel.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz chapter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=TL |last2=Laker |first2=J |title=How College Men Feel about Being Men and "Doing the Right Thing." |publisher=Routledge, Kegan &amp; Paul Publishers |location=Masculinities in Higher Education: Theoretical and Practical Implications. |pages=Ch. 10 |url=http://alanberkowitz.com/articles/college_men.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale  "[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]"&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, H.C. (1837). Andersen's Fairy Tales. Children's Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; is a famous fictional case of pluralistic ignorance. In this story two con artists come into the Emperor's kingdom and convince him that they make the finest clothes in all of the land that can only be seen by anyone who was not stupid. The con artists continued to steal gold, silk and other precious items for their "unique creation". Out of fear for being seen as stupid, all of the emperor's men and townspeople kept silent about the fact they could not see the emperor's clothes until finally a small child comes forth and says that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes. Once the child is willing to admit that he cannot see any clothes on the emperor, the emperor and townspeople finally admit that the emperor has been tricked and that there was never an outfit being made.

Pluralistic ignorance has also been blamed for large majorities of the public remaining silent on climate change — while 'solid majorities' of the American and UK public are concerned about climate change, most erroneously believe they are in the minority with their concern.&lt;ref name="Climate of Silence"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geiger |first1=Nathaniel |last2=Swim |first2=Janet K |title=Climate of silence: Pluralistic ignorance as a barrier to climate change discussion |journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology |date=September 2016 |volume=47 |pages=79-90 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.05.002 |url=https://climateaccess.org/sites/default/files/Climate%20of%20silence-%20Pluralistic%20ignorance%20as%20a%20barrier%20tClimate%20of%20silence-%20Pluralistic%20ignorance%20as%20a%20barrier%20to%20climate%20change%20discussiono%20climate%20change%20discussion.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's been suggested that pollution-intensive industries have contributed to the public's underestimation of public support for climate solutions.&lt;ref name="Second-Order Opinions for Climate Politics"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mildenberger |first1=Matto |last2=Tingley |first2=Dustin |title=Beliefs about Climate Beliefs: The Importance of Second-Order Opinions for Climate Politics |journal=British journal of political science |date=December 2017 |pages=1-29 |doi=10.1017/S0007123417000321 |url=https://climateadvocacylab.org/system/files/mildenbergertingley_bjps.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the U.S., support for pollution pricing is high,&lt;ref name="Politics and Global Warming, March 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leiserowitz |first1=A |last2=Maibach |first2=E |last3=Roser-Renouf |first3=C |last4=Cutler |first4=M |last5=Kotcher |first5=J |title=Politics and Global Warming, March 2018 |url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf |publisher=Yale University and George Mason University |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yale Climate Opinion Maps"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marlon |first1=Jennifer |last2=Howe |first2=Peter |last3=Mildenberger |first3=Matto |last4=Leiserowitz |first4=Anthony |last5=Wang |first5=Xinran |title=Yale Climate Opinion Maps 2018 |url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=reducetax&amp;type=value&amp;geo=cd |website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet public perception of public support is much lower.&lt;ref name="Second-Order Opinions for Climate Politics"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mildenberger |first1=Matto |last2=Tingley |first2=Dustin |title=Beliefs about Climate Beliefs: The Importance of Second-Order Opinions for Climate Politics |journal=British journal of political science |date=December 2017 |pages=1-29 |doi=10.1017/S0007123417000321 |url=https://climateadvocacylab.org/system/files/mildenbergertingley_bjps.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some{{who|date=November 2018}} will argue that pluralistic ignorance is why public concern for climate change exists at all.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Men's conceptions of how they are expected to conform to norms of masculinity present additional examples of pluralistic ignorance. Specifically, most men are uncomfortable with other men "bragging about sexual acts and giving details," but erroneously believe themselves to be in the minority for their discomfort. Similarly, men underestimate other men's "desire to make sure they have consent when sexually active." This "role-conflict" can have deleterious consequences for men's physical and mental health, as well as for society.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz chapter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=TL |last2=Laker |first2=J |title=How College Men Feel about Being Men and "Doing the Right Thing." |publisher=Routledge, Kegan &amp; Paul Publishers |location=Masculinities in Higher Education: Theoretical and Practical Implications. |pages=Ch. 10 |url=http://alanberkowitz.com/articles/college_men.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Pluralistic ignorance has been linked to a wide range of deleterious consequences. For example, victims of pluralistic ignorance see themselves as deviant members of their peer group: less knowledgeable than their classmates, more uptight than their peers, less committed than their fellow board members, less competent than their fellow nurses (see the [[Dunning&amp;ndash;Kruger effect]] operating in the opposite direction). This can leave them feeling bad about themselves and alienated from the group or institution of which they are a part. In addition, pluralistic ignorance can lead groups to persist in policies and practices that have lost widespread support: This can lead college students to persist in heavy drinking, corporations to persist in failing strategies, and governments to persist in unpopular foreign policies. At the same time, it can prevent groups from taking actions that would be beneficial in the long run: actions to intervene in an emergency, for example, or to initiate a personal relationship.

Pluralistic ignorance can be dispelled, and its negative consequences alleviated, through education. For example, students who learn that support for heavy drinking practices is not as widespread as they thought drink less themselves and feel more comfortable with the decision not to drink. Alcohol intervention programs now routinely employ this strategy to combat problem drinking on campus.&lt;ref name="Prentice"&gt;Prentice, D. (2007). Pluralistic ignorance. In Encyclopedia of Social Psychology. Sage Publishing Retrieved from http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/socialpsychology/n402.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misconceptions==
Pluralistic ignorance can be contrasted with the [[false consensus effect]]. In pluralistic ignorance, people privately disdain but publicly support a norm (or a belief), while the false consensus effect causes people to wrongly assume that most people think like they do, while in reality most people do not think like they do (and express the disagreement openly). For instance, pluralistic ignorance may lead a student to drink alcohol excessively because she believes that everyone else does that, while in reality everyone else also wishes they could avoid binge drinking, but no one expresses that due to the fear of being ostracized.&lt;ref name="kitts2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitts|first1=James A.|title=Egocentric Bias or Information Management? Selective Disclosure and the Social Roots of Norm Misperception|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=September 2003|volume=66|issue=3|pages=222|doi=10.2307/1519823}}&lt;/ref&gt; A false consensus for the same situation would mean that the student believes that most other people do not enjoy excessive drinking, while in fact most other people do enjoy that and openly express their opinion about it. 

A study done by Greene, House, and Ross used simple circumstantial questionnaires on Stanford undergrads to gather info on FCE. They compiled thoughts on the choice they felt people would or should make, considering traits such as shyness, cooperativeness, trust, and adventurousness. Studies found that when explaining their decisions, participants gaged choices based on what they explained as "people in general" and their idea of "typical" answers. For each of the stories those subjects said that they personally would follow a given behavioral alternative also tended to rate that alternative as relatively probable for "people in general": those subjects who claimed that they would reject the alternative tended to rate it as relatively improbable for "people in general". It was evident that the influence of the subjects' own behavior choice affected the estimates of commonness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Lee|last2=Greene|first2=David|last3=House|first3=Pamela|title=The "false consensus effect": An egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=May 1977|volume=13|issue=3|pages=279–301|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(77)90049-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it would seem as if the two are built on the same premise of social norms, they take two very oppositional stances on a similar phenomenon. The false consensus effect considers that in predicting an outcome, people will assume that the masses agree with their opinion and think the same way they do on an issue, whereas the opposite is true of pluralistic ignorance, where the individual does not agree with a certain action but go along with it anyway, believing that their view is not shared with the masses (which is usually untrue).

'''The primary/secondary quality distinction''' is a conceptual distinction in [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]], concerning the nature of [[reality]].  It is most explicitly articulated by [[John Locke]] in his ''[[Essay concerning Human Understanding]]'', but earlier thinkers such as [[Galileo]] and [[Descartes]] made similar distinctions.

'''Primary qualities''' are thought to be [[properties]] of objects that are independent of any observer, such as [[solid]]ity, [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]], [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[number]] and [[shape|figure]]. These characteristics convey facts. They exist in the thing itself, can be determined with certainty, and do not rely on subjective judgments. For example, if an object is spherical, no one can reasonably argue that it is triangular.

'''Secondary qualities''' are thought to be properties that produce [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s in observers, such as [[color]], [[taste]], [[olfaction|smell]], and [[sound]]. They can be described as the effect things have on certain people. [[Knowledge]] that comes from secondary qualities does not provide objective facts about things.

Primary qualities are measurable aspects of physical reality. Secondary qualities are subjective.

==History==

* "By convention there are sweet and bitter, hot and cold, by convention there is color; but in truth there are atoms and the void"
:—Democritus, Fragment 9.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Sextus Empiricus, ''Adversus Mathematicos'' vii 135&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on are no more than mere names so far as the object in which we locate them are concerned, and that they reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be wiped away and annihilated"
:—Galileo Galilei, ''The Assayer'' (published 1623).&lt;ref&gt;As reprinted in (Drake, 1957, p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[I]t must certainly be concluded regarding those things which, in external objects, we call by the names of light, color, odor, taste, sound, heat, cold, and of other tactile qualities, [...]; that we are not aware of their being anything other than various arrangements of the size, figure, and motions of the parts of these objects which make it possible for our nerves to move in various ways, and to excite in our soul all the various feelings which they produce there."
:—René Descartes, ''Principles of Philosophy'' (published 1644/1647).&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, René.  ''Principles of Philosophy''.  1644/1647.  Trans. Valentine Rodger Miller and Reese P. Miller.  D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1984.  Page 282.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For the rays, to speak properly, are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain power and disposition to stir up a sensation of this or that colour."
:—Isaac Newton, ''Optics'' (3rd ed. 1721, original in 1704).&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in (Newton, 1953, ed. Chris Jamieson, p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Leibniz===

[[Leibniz]] was an early critic of the distinction, writing in his 1686 ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'' that "[i]t is even possible to demonstrate that the ideas of size, figure and motion are not so distinctive as is imagined, and that they stand for something imaginary relative to our perceptions as do, although to a greater extent, the ideas of color, heat, and the other similar qualities in regard to which we may doubt whether they are actually to be found in the nature of the things outside of us."&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, G. W.  ''Discourse on Metaphysics'', XII.  1686.  Trans. George R. Montgomery.  The Open Court Publishing Company, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berkeley===

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}

[[George Berkeley]] wrote his famous critique of this distinction in his book [[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]. Berkeley maintained that the ideas created by sensations are all that people can know for sure. As a result, what is perceived as real consists only of ideas in the mind. The crux of Berkeley's argument is that once an object is stripped of all its secondary qualities, it becomes very problematic to assign any acceptable meaning to the idea that ''there is'' some object.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Georges Dicker, ''Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, Part III, paragraph 8: "Berkeley's Attack on the Theory of Primary and Secondary Qualities"&lt;/ref&gt; Not that one cannot picture to oneself (in one's mind) that some object could exist apart from any perceiver — one clearly can do this — but rather, that one cannot give any ''content'' to this idea. Suppose that someone says that a particular mind-independent object (meaning, an object free of all secondary qualities) exists at some particular spatio-temporal location (in Newtonian terms, in some particular place and at some particular time). Now, none of this particularly means anything if one cannot specify a place and time. In that case it's still a purely imaginary, empty idea. This is not generally thought to be a problem because realists imagine that they can, in fact, specify a place and time for a 'mind-independent' object.  What is overlooked is that they can only specify a place and time in place and time ''as we experience them''. Berkeley did not doubt that one can do this, but that it is objective. One has simply related ideas to experiences (the idea of an ''object'' to our ''experiences of space and time''). In this case there is no space and time, and therefore no objectivity. Space and time as we experience them are always piecemeal (even when the piece of space is big, as in some astronomical photos), it is only in imagination that they are total and all-encompassing, which is how we definitely imagine (!) 'real' space and time as being. This is why Berkeley argued that the materialist has merely an ''idea'' of an unperceived object: because people typically do take our imagining or picturing, as guaranteeing an objective reality to the 'existence' of 'something'. In no adequate way has it been specified nor given any acceptable meaning. As such Berkeley comes to his conclusion that having a compelling image in the mind, one which connects to no specifiable thing external to us, does not guarantee an objective existence.

===Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science]]'', claimed that primary, as well as secondary, qualities are subjective. They are both mere appearances that are located in the mind of a knowing observer. In  § 13, Remark II, he wrote: "Long before Locke's time, but assuredly since him, it has been generally assumed and granted without detriment to the actual existence of external things, that many of their predicates may be said to belong not to the things in themselves, but to their appearances, and to have no proper existence outside our representation. Heat, color, and taste, for instance, are of this kind. Now, if I go farther, and for weighty reasons rank as mere appearances the remaining qualities of bodies also, which are called primary, such as extension, place, and in general space, with all that which belongs to it (impenetrability or materiality, space, etc.)—no one in the least can adduce the reason of its being inadmissible."

{{evolutionary biology}}
The '''theory of recapitulation''', also called the '''biogenetic law''' or '''embryological parallelism'''—often expressed using [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s phrase  "'''ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny'''"—is a historical hypothesis that the [[embryogenesis|development]] of the [[embryo]] of an animal, from [[fertilization]] to gestation or hatching ([[ontogeny]]), goes through stages resembling or representing successive stages in the evolution of the animal's remote ancestors ([[phylogeny]]). It was formulated in the 1820s by  [[Étienne Serres]]  based on the work of [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]], after whom it is also known as '''Meckel–Serres law'''.

Since [[evolutionary developmental biology|embryos also evolve in different ways]], the shortcomings of the theory had been recognized by the early 20th century, and it had been relegated to "biological mythology"&lt;ref name="Ehrlich1963"&gt;[[Paul R. Ehrlich|Ehrlich, Paul]]; Richard Holm; Dennis Parnell (1963) ''The Process of Evolution''. New York: McGraw–Hill, pg. 66: "Its shortcomings have been almost universally pointed out by modern authors, but the idea still has a prominent place in biological mythology.  The resemblance of early vertebrate embryos is readily explained without resort to mysterious forces compelling each individual to reclimb its phylogenetic tree."&lt;/ref&gt; by the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="Blechschmidt77"&gt;Blechschmidt, Erich (1977) ''The Beginnings of Human Life''. Springer-Verlag, p. 32: "The so-called basic law of biogenetics is wrong. No buts or ifs can mitigate this fact. It is not even a tiny bit correct or correct in a different form, making it valid in a certain percentage. It is totally wrong."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert2006"/&gt;

Analogies to recapitulation theory have been formulated in other fields, including [[cognitive development]]&lt;ref name="Foster1994p387"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David G. Payne, Michael J. Wenger (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zpgQAQAAIAAJ ''Cognitive Psychology''] p.352 quotation: {{quotation|Faulty logic and problematic proposals relating the development of an individual to the development of the species turn up even today. The hypothesis that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny has been applied and extended in a number of areas, including cognition and mental activities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and art criticism.&lt;ref name="Medicus92p2"&gt;Medicus (1992) p.2 quotation: {{quotation|...many biologists accept the rule with respect to behavioral ontogeny in animal species.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embryology==

===Meckel, Serres, Geoffroy===

The idea of recapitulation was first formulated in [[biology]] from the 1790s onwards by the German [[natural philosopher]]s [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]], [[Étienne Serres]], and [[Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer]],&lt;ref name="Mayr94"&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which, [[Marcel Danesi]] states, it soon gained the status of a supposed [[biogenetic]] law.&lt;ref name="Danesi93p65"&gt;{{Harv|Danesi|1993|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embryological theory was formalised by Serres in 1824–26, based on Meckel's work, in what became known as the "Meckel-Serres Law". This attempted to link [[comparative embryology]] with a "pattern of unification" in the organic world. It was supported by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], and became a prominent part of his ideas. It suggested that past transformations of life could have been through environmental causes working on the embryo, rather than on the adult as in [[Lamarckism]]. These [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] ideas led to disagreements with [[Georges Cuvier]]. The theory was widely supported in the Edinburgh and London schools of higher anatomy around 1830, notably by [[Robert Edmond Grant]], but was opposed by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]]'s [[von Baer's laws (embryology)|ideas of divergence]], and attacked by [[Richard Owen]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|1989|pp=52–53, 86–88, 337–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haeckel drawings.jpg|thumb|350px|[[George Romanes]]'s 1892 copy of [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s controversial [[embryo drawing]]s{{efn|George Romanes's 1892 version of the figure is often attributed incorrectly to Haeckel.}}&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Keuck (2002) "Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development," p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Haeckel===
{{see|Embryo drawing}}

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) attempted to synthesize the ideas of [[Lamarckism]] and [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' with [[Charles Darwin]]'s concepts.  While often seen as rejecting Darwin's theory of branching evolution for a more linear Lamarckian view of progressive evolution, this is not accurate: Haeckel used the Lamarckian picture to describe the ontogenetic and phylogenetic history of individual species, but agreed with Darwin about the branching of all species from one, or a few, original ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Robert J. 2008.

Pp.&amp;nbsp;136–142&lt;/ref&gt; Since early in the twentieth century, Haeckel's "biogenetic law" has been refuted on many fronts.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://11e.devbio.com/ |title=Ernst Haeckel and the Biogenetic Law |accessdate=2008-05-03 |author=Scott F Gilbert |year=2006 |work=Developmental Biology, 8th edition |publisher=Sinauer Associates |quote=Eventually, the Biogenetic Law had become scientifically untenable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haeckel formulated his theory as "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny". The notion later became simply known as the recapitulation theory. [[Ontogeny]] is the growth (size change) and development (structure change) of an individual organism; [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] is the [[evolution]]ary history of a species. Haeckel claimed that the development of advanced species passes through stages represented by adult organisms of more primitive species.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2006" /&gt; Otherwise put, each successive stage in the development of an individual represents one of the adult forms that appeared in its evolutionary history.

For example, Haeckel proposed that the pharyngeal grooves between the [[pharyngeal arch]]es in the neck of the human embryo not only roughly resembled gill slits of fish, but directly represented an adult "fishlike" developmental stage, signifying a fishlike ancestor. Embryonic pharyngeal slits, which form in many animals when the thin branchial plates separating pharyngeal pouches and pharyngeal grooves perforate, open the [[pharynx]] to the outside. Pharyngeal arches appear in all [[tetrapod]] embryos: in [[mammal]]s, the first pharyngeal arch develops into the lower [[jaw]] ([[Meckel's cartilage]]), the [[malleus]] and the [[stapes]]. But these embryonic pharyngeal arches, grooves, pouches, and slits in human embryos can not at any stage carry out the same function as the [[gill]]s of an adult fish.

Haeckel produced several [[embryo drawing]]s that often overemphasized similarities between embryos of related species. The misinformation was propagated through many biology textbooks, and popular knowledge, even today. Modern biology rejects the literal and universal form of Haeckel's theory, such as its possible application to behavioural ontogeny, i.e. the psychomotor development of young animals and human children.&lt;ref name="Medicus1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gerhard Medicus |year=1992 |title=The Inapplicability of the Biogenetic Rule to Behavioral Development |journal=Human Development |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |issn=0018-716X |url=https://www.uibk.ac.at/psychologie/humanethologie/einfuehrung-in-die-humanethologie/dateien/humandevelopment.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-04-30 |quote=The present interdisciplinary article offers cogent reasons why the biogenetic rule has no relevance for behavioral ontogeny. ...

These facts lead to the conclusion that attempts to establish a psychological theory on the basis of the biogenetic rule will not be fruitful. |doi=10.1159/000277108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary criticism ===

Haeckel's drawings were such a misrepresentation of observed human embryonic development that he attracted the opposition of several members of the scientific community, including the anatomist [[Wilhelm His Sr.|Wilhelm His]], who had developed a rival "causal-mechanical theory" of human embryonic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Making visible embryos: Forgery charges | url=http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/visibleembryos/s4_2.html | publisher=University of Cambridge | accessdate=27 October 2016| quote=Rütimeyer’s ex-colleague, Wilhelm His, who had developed a rival, physiological embryology, which looked, not to the evolutionary past, but to bending and folding forces in the present. He now repeated and amplified the charges, and lay enemies used them to discredit the most prominent Darwinist. But Haeckel argued that his figures were schematics, not intended to be exact. They stayed in his books and were widely copied, but still attract controversy today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Wilhelm His, Sr | publisher=Embryo Project Encyclopedia | year=2007 | accessdate=27 October 2016 | url=http://embryo.asu.edu/pages/wilhelm-his-sr-1831-1904 | quote=In 1874 His published his ''Über die Bildung des Lachsembryos'', an interpretation of vertebrate embryonic development.

These differences were, in turn, caused by "heredity". &lt;!--Wilhelm --&gt;His&lt;!-- anatomist--&gt; compared the shapes of embryonic structures to those of rubber tubes that could be slit and bent, illustrating these comparisons with accurate drawings. [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s attack on Haeckel's recapitulation theory was far more fundamental than that of any empirical critic, as it effectively stated that Haeckel's "biogenetic law" was irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Gould1977"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gould | first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould | title=Ontogeny and phylogeny | publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | year=1977 | isbn=0-674-63941-3 | pages=189–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ray RS, Dymecki SM |title=Rautenlippe Redux -- toward a unified view of the precerebellar rhombic lip |journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=741–7 |date=December 2009  |pmid=19883998 |pmc=3729404 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2009.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haeckel vs von Baer.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Embryology theories of [[Ernst Haeckel]] and [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] compared]]

Darwin's view was that embryos resembled each other, since they shared a common ancestor, which presumably had a similar embryo, but that development did not necessarily recapitulate phylogeny: in his view, there was no reason to suppose that an embryo at any stage resembled an adult of any ancestor. Darwin supposed further that embryos were subject to less intense selection pressure than adults, and had therefore changed less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barnes |first1=M.

=== Modern status ===

Modern [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo) follows von Baer, rather than Darwin, in pointing to active evolution of embryonic development as a significant means of changing the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of adult bodies. Two of the key principles of evo-devo, namely that changes in the timing ([[heterochrony]]) and positioning within the body ([[heterotopy]]) of aspects of embryonic development would change the shape of a descendant's body compared to an ancestor's, were however first formulated by Haeckel in the 1870s. These elements of his thinking about development have thus survived, whereas his theory of recapitulation has not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=B. K. |title=Evo-Devo: evolutionary developmental mechanisms |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |date=2003 |volume=47 |issue=7–8 |pages=491–495 |pmid=14756324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haeckelian form of recapitulation theory is considered defunct.&lt;ref name=Lovtrup&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lovtrup | first1=S | year=1978 | title=On von Baerian and Haeckelian Recapitulation | url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/3/348.full.pdf | journal=Systematic Zoology | volume=27 | issue=3| pages=348–352 | doi=10.2307/2412887| jstor=2412887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, embryos do undergo a period where their morphology is strongly shaped by their phylogenetic position, rather than selective pressures.&lt;ref name="Kalinka2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Kalinka | first1=A. T. | last2=Tomancak | first2=P. | title=The evolution of early animal embryos: Conservation or divergence? | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.007 | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | year=2012 | volume=27 | issue=7 | pages=385–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern view is summarised by the [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]]:

{{quote|Embryos do reflect the course of evolution, but that course is far more intricate and quirky than Haeckel claimed. Different parts of the same embryo can even evolve in different directions. As a result, the Biogenetic Law was abandoned, and its fall freed scientists to appreciate the full range of embryonic changes that evolution can produce—an appreciation that has yielded spectacular results in recent years as scientists have discovered some of the [[Evo-devo gene toolkit|specific genes that control development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Early Evolution and Development: Ernst Haeckel | series=Evolution 101 | publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology | url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/history/early_evodevo.shtml | accessdate=2013-02-20 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222105021/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/history/early_evodevo.shtml | archivedate=2012-12-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Applications to other areas==
The idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny has been applied to some other areas.

===Cognitive development===
Research in the late 20th century confirmed that "both biological evolution and the stages in the child's cognitive development follow much the same progression of evolutionary stages as that suggested in the archaeological record".&lt;ref name="Foster1994p387"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Symbolism: the foundation of culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Foster, Mary LeCron | editor=[[Tim Ingold]] | year=1994 | pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=j6Y2hNf35J4C&amp;pg=PA387 p.387]}} quotation: {{quotation|While ontogeny does not generally recapitulate phylogeny in any direct sense (Gould 1977), both biological evolution and the stages in the child's cognitive development follow much the same progression of evolutionary stages as that suggested in the archaeological record (Borchert and Zihlman 1990, Bates 1979, Wynn 1979) ... Thus, one child, having been shown the moon, applied the word 'moon' to a variety of objects with similar shapes as well as to the moon itself (Bowerman 1980). This spatial globality of reference is consistent with the archaeological appearance of graphic abstraction before graphic realism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] was one of the most energetic promoters of evolutionary ideas to explain many phenomena. He compactly expressed the basis for a cultural recapitulation theory of [[education]] in the following claim, published in 1861, five years before Haeckel first published on the subject:&lt;ref name="EganEducatedMind"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Kieran Egan (educationist) |author=Egan, Kieran |title=The Educated Mind: How Cognitive Tools Shape Our Understanding |titlelink=The Educated Mind |page=27 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=1997 |isbn=0-226-19036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{quotation|If there be an order in which the human race has mastered its various kinds of knowledge, there will arise in every child an aptitude to acquire these kinds of knowledge in the same order. ... Education is a repetition of civilization in little.&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;{{cite book | author=Herbert Spencer |authorlink=Herbert Spencer | year=1861 | title=Education | pages = 5 | url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=98953755}}&lt;/ref&gt; | Herbert Spencer}}

[[G. Stanley Hall]] used Haeckel's theories as the basis for his theories of child development. His most influential work, "Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion and Education" in 1904&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=G. Stanley |title=Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion and Education |date=1904 |publisher=D. Appleton and Company |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/adolescenceitsps01hall/page/n5}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that each individual's life course recapitulated humanity's evolution from "savagery" to "civilization". Though he has influenced later childhood development theories, Hall's conception is now generally considered racist.&lt;ref name="Lesko 1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lesko | first=Nancy | title=Past, Present, and Future Conceptions of Adolescence | journal=Educational Theory | volume=46 | issue=4 | year=1996 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-5446.1996.00453.x | pages=453–472}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Developmental psychologist [[Jean Piaget]] favored a weaker version of the formula, according to which ontogeny ''parallels'' phylogeny because the two are subject to similar external constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1977|pp=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Austrian pioneer in psychoanalysis, [[Sigmund Freud]], also favored Haeckel's doctrine. He was trained as a biologist under the influence of recapitulation theory at the time of its domination, and retained a [[Lamarckian]] outlook with justification from the recapitulation theory.&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1977|pp=156–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also distinguished between physical and mental recapitulation, in which the differences would become an essential argument for his [[Defence mechanisms#Level 1: "Psychotic"|theory of neuroses]].&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt;

===Art criticism===

The musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] in 2005 applied the term "ontogeny becomes phylogeny" to the process of creating and recasting art history, often to assert a perspective or argument. For example, the peculiar development of the works by modernist composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (here an "ontogeny") is generalized in many histories into a "phylogeny" – a historical development ("evolution") of Western music toward atonal styles of which Schoenberg is a representative. Such historiographies of the "collapse of traditional tonality" are faulted by art historians as asserting a rhetorical rather than historical point about tonality's "collapse".&lt;ref name=Taruskin&gt;{{cite book | last=Taruskin | first=Richard | title=The Oxford History of Western Music | volume=4 | year=2005 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0-195-38630-1  | pages=358–361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taruskin also developed a variation of the motto into the pun "ontogeny recapitulates ontology" to refute the concept of "absolute music" advancing the socio-artistic theories of the musicologist [[Carl Dahlhaus]]. [[Ontology]] is the investigation of what exactly something is, and Taruskin asserts that an art object becomes that which society and succeeding generations made of it. For example, composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''St. John Passion'', composed in the 1720s, was appropriated by the [[Nazi]] regime in the 1930s for propaganda. Taruskin claims the historical development of the ''Passion'' (its ontogeny) as a work with an anti-Semitic message does, in fact, inform the work's identity (its ontology), even though that was an unlikely concern of the composer. Music or even an abstract visual artwork can not be truly autonomous ("absolute") because it is defined by its historical and social reception.&lt;ref name=Taruskin/&gt;

'''Reduction in rank''' may refer to three separate concepts:
*In [[military law]], a ''reduction in rank'' or ''degradation''&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|degrade}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[demotion]] in [[military rank]] as punishment for a [[crime]] or wrongdoing, imposed by a [[court-martial]] or other [[authority]]. It may be imposed in conjunction with other punishments, such as a [[Military discharge|bad conduct or dishonorable discharge]], loss of wages, [[wikt:confinement|confinement]] to [[barracks]], or [[Prison|imprisonment]] in a [[military prison]].
*''Reduction in rank'' may also refer to the voluntary, non-punitive practice of taking a lower rank, often as part of joining another [[military unit]] or [[military service]]. For example, those who join the [[Special Air Service]] or [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment]] take the rank of [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]], often a lower rank than their previous rank but with greater pay, prestige, and responsibilities.
*There is a ''reversion'' in rank after an officer has been temporarily promoted to a higher rank while occupying a position requiring that rank; the officer reverts to the permanent rank on vacating the position bearing the higher rank. In the US military, this occurs most often to three- or four-star general or flag officers, who can be reduced in rank to no lower than their permanent rank of two stars. This occurs because three- and four-star ranks are always temporary ranks and are linked to their position's office. A three- or four-star officer could revert non-punitively to a lower rank because they no longer hold a position bearing the higher rank. Reversion of this type is less usual for lower US ranks as such temporary promotions are uncommon.

==History==
Reduction in rank ([[Latin]] ''gradus deiectio'' meaning position degradation) was a [[Roman military decorations and punishments|Roman military punishment]].&lt;ref name="Brand2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clarence Eugene Brand|title=Roman Military Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rbh7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT172|year=1968|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-75817-9|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, [[Courts-martial in the United States|courts-martial]] may adjudge reduction to any enlisted member to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|page=131|chapter=Part II|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Courts-martial in the United States#Summary court-martial|summary court-martial]] may not sentence a person to reduction by more than one grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|pages=191–192|chapter=Part II|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 15 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) authorizes [[commanding officer]]s to "in addition to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand" impose "reduction to the next inferior [[pay grade]], if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction." Additionally, an officer of the grade of [[Major (United States)|major]], [[lieutenant commander]], or above is authorized to impose "reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction, but an enlisted member in a pay grade above [[Pay grade#Pay grades and associated ranks by branch of service|E-4]] may not be reduced more than two pay grades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|pages=5–6|chapter=Appendix 2|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, article 58a of the UCMJ provides that, unless otherwise provided in regulation, an enlisted member above the pay grade of E-1 sentenced by a court-martial to confinement, a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or hard labor without confinement, shall be automatically reduced to the pay grade of E-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|page=19|chapter=Appendix 2|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==
In other countries, there is such a punishment, which is sometimes much more severe than that in the US.  It usually is assigned for serious crimes in peacetime and wartime.

===Russian Empire and USSR===
In the Russian Empire and in the USSR, most often it was a demotion in rank to private. 
In the Russian Empire to this punishment was added also other penalties such as beatings with whips, which were all the staff. Personnel lined up in formation, then each dealt one blow sentenced. Most often, this has led to the death of the convict from his injuries.

====For example====
Lieutenant-General Marquis [[Philip Osipovich Paulucci]], being quartermaster General of the [[Russian Caucasus Forces (before 1865)|Caucasus army]], on 3 November 1810, wrote in his diary: "the Tiflis infantry regiment non-commissioned officer Ermolaev, the former in the recruit depot when you split the party on the shelves, took the recruit 5 rubles brazenly. For any impermissible and intolerable service act, reducted thereof in the ordinary non-commissioned officer, require him to drive the rods through 500 people one time, and taken money from him to take away and give to a recruit. Flogging this very same to do tomorrow in 8 hours. This case put the body on view at the end of the Lord to the heads of regiments are strictly watched so that the lower ranks no one had injustices..."

Demoted in rank, with the exception only of occasions a great military feat, can get officer rank except by  Highest permission about not reading an incurred penalty obstacle to the awards; to enter with the idea of this is permitted no sooner than after three years after a demotion (article 43). On the basis of article 60, 556, 634, and 727&amp;nbsp;kN. SV VII. military. post. demoted cannot be produced in the non-commissioned officers, not assigned to any trip, you don't leave and transferred to the reserve only with a special permission.

===USSR===
In the USSR, demotion in rank to [[Ryadovoy|private]] begin to see use as a punishment immediately after the creation of the [[Soviet Armed Forces|red army]]. As a rule, it punished those who made unforgivable mistakes during combat, especially those who led to serious losses or tactical defeat. In addition, it also punished those who committed serious crimes while serving. In the second case, a demotion in rank was usually not the only punishment administered, and often accompanied an imprisonment or execution.
During the second world war, those demoted in rank were not imprisoned away from the front lines but instead made to serve in the [[Penal military unit|penal divisions]].
After the second world war, the punishment no longer meant execution or service in a penal unit, but did mean dismissal from service and forfeiture of all military awards. Most often it was imposed for serious crimes which entail criminal liability. In modern Russia this post-[[WW2]] version of the punishment is still used.

===Post-Soviet Ukraine===
On December 22, 2015, Konstantin Grishin (better known as [[Semen Semenchenko]]) was demoted in rank while serving as the commander of the voluntary [[Donbas Battalion|Donbass]] battalion.  While all of the other punishments he received. The reason for the demotion in rank was the fact that he does not have the appropriate training and education to carry the title of Lieutenant.

===Germany===
For example, during the Third Reich, the [[SS]] officer [[Helmut Knochen]] was demoted in rank because, during [[Operation Valkyrie|the coup attempt of 20 July 1944]], he did not adequately resist the conspirators, and got himself arrested.

'''Revolving rivers''' are a surprising, uncommon way of [[sand]] pile growth that can be found in a few sands around the world, but has been studied in detail only for one [[Cuba]]n sand from a place called Santa Teresa ([[Pinar del Rio]] province).

==Description==

When pouring "revolving" sand on a flat surface from a fixed position, the growth of a conical pile does not occur by the common [[avalanche]] mechanism, where sand slides down the pile in a more or less random fashion. What happens in that a relatively thin "river" of flowing sand travels from the pouring point at the apex of the pile to its base, while the rest of the sand at the surface is static. In addition, the river "revolves" around the pile either in clockwise or counter-clockwise directions (looking from top) depending on the initial conditions of the experiment. Actually the river constitutes the "cutting edge" of a layer of sand that deposits as a helix on the conical pile, and makes it grow.
For small sandpiles, rivers are continuous, but they become intermittent
for larger piles.

== History and state of the art ==

The phenomenon was observed first by E. Altshuler at the [[University of Havana]] in 1995, but at the time he assumed that it was well known, and temporarily forgot about it. In 2000, being at the [[University of Houston]], he told K. E. Bassler, who showed a vivid interest in the matter. Embarrassingly enough, Altshuler was unable to demonstrate it before Bassler using a random sand from Houston, so he had to send him a video from [[Cuba]] after his return to the island.

Once the existence of the strange phenomenon was confirmed for everyone, E. Altshuler and a number of collaborators performed a systematic study in [[Havana]], which was then jointly published with Bassler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=

Further work has been done to understand in more detail the
phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=

However, the connection between the physical, chemical (and possibly biological) properties of the grains in a specific sand, the nature of the inter-grain interactions, and the emergence of the revolving rivers is still an open question.

Sand from Santa Teresa is made of almost pure [[silicon dioxide]] grains with an average [[grain size]] of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm approximately and no visible special features regarding grain shape. But in spite of its apparent simplicity, many puzzles still remain. For example, after many experiments one batch of sand may stop showing revolving rivers (just as [[singing sand]] eventually stops singing), which suggests that the decay is connected to certain properties of the surface of the grains that degrade by continued friction.

Videos of the effect are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=YouTubeRiosEng| author=Complexperiments |date=2010 |

The '''self-expansion model''' is based on two key principles. The first is that humans have a primary motivation to self expand. The second principle is that individuals often achieve self-expansion through close relationships which allow the inclusion of the other in the self.

==Self-expansion motivation==

One of the underlying themes of self-expansion is that individuals have a very basic [[Motivation|motive]] to self-expand. Self-expansion is the desire to enhance an individual's potential [[efficacy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Knowledge Structure in Close Relationships: A Social Psychological Approach|last1=Aron|first1=A.|last2=Aron|publisher=Erlbaum|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8058-1432-3|editor-last=Fletcher|editor-first=Garth|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=325–344|chapter=Self and self expansion in relationships|oclc=477410911|ref=harv|editor-last2=Fitness|editor-first2=Julie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Interpersonal Processes|last1=Aron|first1=Arthur|last2=Aron|first2=Elaine N.|last3=Norman|first3=Christina|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd|year=2003|isbn=978-0-470-99855-7|editor-last=Fletcher|editor-first=Garth|volume=2|location=Oxford|pages=478–501|chapter=Self-expansion Model of Motivation and Cognition in Close Relationships and Beyond|doi=10.1002/9780470998557.ch19|ref=harv|editor-last2=Clark|editor-first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivational models often refer to self-efficacy as one's belief that they are competent and can achieve specific goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=1977|title=Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change.|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.315.4567&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Psychological Review|volume=84|issue=2|pages=191–215|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191|issn=1939-1471|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within the self-expansion model, potential efficacy is used instead, as it only refers to obtaining resources that will make goal attainment possible. Achievement of this goal is a secondary concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=Arthur|last2=Norman|first2=Christina|last3=Aron|first3=Elaine|date=1 January 1998|title=The self-expansion model and motivation|journal=Representative Research in Social Psychology|volume=22|pages=1–13|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the self-expansion model, people increase potential efficacy by creating close [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], which in turn, increases material and social resources, perspectives, and identities. Some examples of resources include the following: social support, possessions, information, and friendship networks. Perspectives are the way people appreciate the world and ascribe causal explanations for people's behaviors. Identities refer to a person's memories and characteristics. Self-expansion is not [[consciously]] motivated. A person does not explicitly attempt to be part of a close relationship for the sole intention of increasing physical and psychological resources.

However, the motivation to self-expand still does influence attraction to others for a potential close relationship. Aron and Aron suggest that our attraction is broken down into two components based on Rotter's value-expectancy approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Desirability is the perceived total amount of self-expansion possible from a potential close relationship. The second factor, probability, refers to the likelihood that the close relationship with the individual can actually be formed. It can also be conceptualized as the likelihood that self-expansion will occur. Consequently, individuals will seek a partner that has high social status and a greater number of resources. However, to maximize self-expansion, consideration is also given to how likely this person will be loyal and desires to be in the close relationship. Self expansion is when you motivate yourself and trust yourself.

==Including the other in the self==

The second principle of the self-expansion model is that people use close relationships to self expand by including the other in the self. The self is often described as the content or the knowledge of who we are.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Psychology|last1=Aronson|first1=Elliot|last2=Wilson|first2=T. D|last3=Akert|first3=R. M.|last4=Fehr|first4=B.|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2007|isbn=978-0-13-228410-3|edition=3rd Canadian|location=Toronto|oclc=911743379|ref=harv}}{{Pages needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aron and Aron, when entering a close relationship a person should perceive that the self and other should begin to overlap by including aspects of the other in the self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More specifically, when the other makes his or her resources available, this leads to the belief that these resources are now included in the self. These new resources lead to greater inclusion of the other in the self by also incorporating the other's perspectives and identities in the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=Arthur|last2=McLaughlin-Volpe|first2=Tracy|last3=Mashek|first3=Debra|last4=Lewandowski|first4=Gary|last5=Wright|first5=Stephen C.|last6=Aron|first6=Elaine N.|date=1 January 2004|title=Including others in the self|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=101–132|doi=10.1080/10463280440000008|issn=1046-3283|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron, Aron, Tudor and Nelson conducted several classic studies that scientifically demonstrated that we include the other in the self.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, A., Aron, E. N., Tudor, M., &amp; Nelson, G. (1991). Close relationships as including other in the self. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60(2), 241-253. {{doi|10.1037/0022-3514.60.2.241}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one experiment, participants were more likely to distribute money equally between the self and the close other in comparison to distributing the money between oneself and a stranger. The sharing of resources was suggestive of including the self in the other. In a second experiment, participants were more likely to remember more nouns for a stranger than a close other (one's mother). This supported the IOS phenomenon, as participants were more likely to take the perspective of the close other thus not being able to remember descriptive nouns of that person. In a final experiment participants were required to make yes/no decisions on whether certain traits belonged to themselves. Decisions on traits that were different between a participant and a close other had longer reaction times than decisions on traits that were different between a participant and a stranger. It was suggested that the increased confusion between the self and the close other was directly related to integrating the other in the self. The degree of closeness in the relationship affects the self and other reaction studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=Arthur|last2=Fraley|first2=Barbara|date=1 June 1999|title=Relationship Closeness as Including Other in the Self: Cognitive Underpinnings and Measures|journal=Social Cognition|volume=17|issue=2|pages=140–160|doi=10.1521/soco.1999.17.2.140|issn=0278-016X|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As two individuals become closer, there is greater confusion and therefore a longer reaction time. As a result, as closeness of a relationship increases, there will be a greater inclusion of the other in the self.

===Measuring inclusion of the other in the self===
[[File:Inclusion of other in the self scale.png|alt=Adapted inclusion of other in the self scale.|thumb|Adapted inclusion of other in the self scale.]]
The Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale (IOS Scale)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=Arthur|last2=Aron|first2=Elaine N.|last3=Smollan|first3=Danny|date=1992|title=Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=4|pages=596–612|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.596|issn=0022-3514|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most frequently used tools to assess this phenomenon. The scale consists of seven Venn diagram-like pairs of circles that vary on the level of overlap between the self and the other. Respondents are asked to select the pair of circles that best represents their current close relationship. Several studies have showed that this measurement tool is effective in getting accurate depictions of the amount of closeness and the inclusion of the other in the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agnew|first1=Christopher R|last2=Van Lange|first2=Paul AM|last3=Rusbult|first3=Caryl E|last4=Langston|first4=Christopher A|date=1998|title=Cognitive interdependence: Commitment and the mental representation of close relationships.|url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/17663/Agnew_JournalOfPersonalityAndSocialPsychology_74(4)_1998_u.pdf?sequence=2|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=74|issue=4|pages=939|issn=1939-1315|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gächter|first=Simon|last2=Starmer|first2=Chris|last3=Tufano|first3=Fabio|date=2015-06-12|title=Measuring the Closeness of Relationships: A Comprehensive Evaluation of the 'Inclusion of the Other in the Self' Scale|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129478|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=e0129478|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0129478|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4466912|pmid=26068873}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOS has also been assessed with the Continuous IOS, a [[Java applet|Java-based applet]] suitable for online surveys that measures IOS on a continuous scale from 0-100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy|last1=Agnew|first1=Christopher R.|last2=Loving|first2=T.

The IOS Scale has also been adapted to measure inclusion in other contexts, for example community connectedness via the Inclusion of Community in the Self Scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mashek|first1=Debra|last2=Cannaday|first2=Lisa W.|last3=Tangney|first3=June P.|date=1 March 2007|title=Inclusion of community in self scale: A single-item pictorial measure of community connectedness|journal=Journal of Community Psychology|volume=35|issue=2|pages=257–275|doi=10.1002/jcop.20146|issn=1520-6629|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptability of IOS is broad as demonstrated by recent versions substituting target with "X."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Inclusion of the ingroup in the self==

The idea of including the other in the self has been extended to include an entire ingroup in the self.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Self: Cognitive, Interpersonal and Intergroup Perspectives|last1=Wright|first1=S. C.|last2=Aron|first2=A.|last3=Tropp|first3=L. R.|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-317-76276-8|editor-last=Forgas|editor-first=Joseph|location=New York|pages=342–363|chapter=Including others (and groups) in the self: Self expansion and intergroup relations|ref=harv|editor-last2=Williams|editor-first2=Kipling|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuPJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA343}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ingroup is an interdependent set of individuals with which a person identifies. The individual believes he or she is a member of this group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In fact, several academic groups have found similar findings in the me/not me reaction time paradigm at a group level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Eliot R.|last2=Henry|first2=Susan|date=1 June 1996|title=An In-Group Becomes Part of the Self: Response Time Evidence|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=22|issue=6|pages=635–642|doi=10.1177/0146167296226008|issn=0146-1672|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants showed a slower reaction time for traits that were incongruent between the self and ingroup. This was in comparison to quicker reaction times for traits that were congruent between the self and ingroup. The slow reaction times were consistent with the inclusion of the ingroup in the self claim as it suggested that the individual had included group characteristics in the self. As a result, there was difficulty recalling if a trait belong to the self or ingroup. Several researchers have examined the role of ingroup identification (i.e. a person's prolonged psychological connection to an ingroup) and self-expansion. In fact, Trop and Wright refined the meaning of ingroup identification and believed it was analogous to the inclusion of the ingroup in the self.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tropp|first1=Linda R.|last2=Wright|first2=Stephen C.|date=1 May 2001|title=Ingroup Identification as the Inclusion of Ingroup in the Self|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Wright6/publication/238334130_Ingroup_Identification_as_the_Inclusion_of_Ingroup_in_the_Self/links/54686e600cf2f5eb18037d07.pdf|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=27|issue=5|pages=585–600|doi=10.1177/0146167201275007|issn=0146-1672|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors found that the degree of connectedness to the ingroup will affect confusion of self-descriptors. People who highly identified with an ingroup showed slower reaction times for self-descriptors that did not relate to the ingroup (this is consistent with previous findings). However, low ingroup identification lead to no differences in reaction times between whether or not the self-descriptors were also descriptive of the ingroup. This demonstrated that the level of identification with an ingroup can be conceptualized as the degree to which we will include the ingroup in the self.

The central motivation for including the ingroup in the self parallels the self-expansion model at the interpersonal level. The self-expansion model suggests that we are strongly motivated to expand ourselves by including the other in the self. This occurs when an individual incorporates the other's perspectives, identities and resources. Likewise, it has been proposed that including an ingroup in the self, or ingroup identification, is partly influenced by the self-expansion motive. Inclusion of the ingroup's perspectives and resources can increase one's confidence in completing a variety of goals. Thus, a group's attractiveness is often based on the potential for self-expansion. A group with higher social status and a greater amount of potential resources is more likely to be included in the self.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Inclusion and Exclusion|last1=McLaughlin-Volpe|first1=T.|last2=Aron|first2=A.|last3=Wright|first3=S.

===Measurement of inclusion of the ingroup in the self===

Tropp and Wright created an instrument to measure the extent that an individual includes the ingroup in the self.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Inclusion of the Ingroup in the Self Scale (ISS Scale) was based on the Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale. Similar to the original scale, seven pairs of circles vary on the degree of overlap between the self and the particular ingroup. The scale has been well validated and the degree of inclusion of the ingroup in the self is said to capture the sense of ingroup identification.

==Self-expansion, including the outgroup in the self, and intergroup relations==

An abundance of research focuses on the negative interactions between different groups (e.g. negative attitudes, intolerance, discrimination). However, there is sparse evidence to explain the positive aspects of intergroup relations such as reduction of prejudice. The contact hypothesis(by [[Gordon Allport]]) is one area of psychology that focuses on positive aspects of intergroup relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Prejudice|last=Allport|first=Gordon Willard|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1954|isbn=|location=Reading, Mass.|pages=|oclc=601412540|ref=harv}}{{Pages needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Thomas F.|date=1998|title=Intergroup Contact Theory|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/oneworld/system/files/annurev.psych_.49.1.65-2.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=49|issue=1|pages=65–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.65|pmid=15012467|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis suggests that when there is cooperation, equal status, common goals and authority support then contact between members of different groups can result in reduced negative attitudes. In addition, positive emotions between intergroup members was said to be of utmost importance as it would lead to positive attitudes which, in turn, would generalize to the entire outgroup.&lt;ref&gt;Pettrigrew, T. (1997). Generalized intergroup effects on prejudice. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 173-185. {{doi|10.1177/0146167297232006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An outgroup is set of individuals with which the individuals does not identify.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was unclear how this attitude generalization actually happened. Recently, the process of including the outgroup in the self was used as an explanatory mechanism for this [[generalization]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Including the outgroup in the self is based on the similar self-expansion notion of including the other or ingroup in the self. As a person becomes a friend with an outgroup member, the aspects of the outgroup is included in the self when that group is made salient. Essentially, representation of the outgroup and its identity is shared with our representation of the self. Including the outgroup in the self can vary; a person may actually become a member of an outgroup.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, in certain circumstances this is virtually impossible and we simply psychologically identify with the group even though we are aware that we are not part of it. Upon inclusion of the outgroup in the self, we now give that group several benefits. These benefits include taking pride in the group, sharing resources, and positive biases in causal explanations of the group. These benefits all increase the likelihood for reduced outgroup prejudice, hence its use as a mechanism for the contact hypothesis.

It is important to note that the focus of the inclusion of the outgroup in the self is initially at the interpersonal level (i.e. between individuals).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Psychology of Prejudice: Historical and Contemporary Issues|last1=Pettigrew|first1=Thomas F|last2=Wright|first2=S. C.|last3=Brody|first3=S. M.|last4=Aron|first4=A.|publisher=Lewinian Press|year=2005|editor-last=Crandall|editor-first=Christian|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=119–146|chapter=Intergroup contact: Still our best hope for improving intergroup relations|oclc=135635378|ref=harv|editor-last2=Schaller|editor-first2=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction needs to have interpersonal closeness for inclusion of the self in the other to occur. Consequently, a decategorized approach to contact should be used where the focus is on personal identities instead of group identities. By focusing on personalization, there is a greater chance for the development of closeness. Eventually, group membership needs to become available so that an individual can now include the outgroup in the self as well. However, it is believed that group membership will become more central in a natural manner as the close relationship develops.

Empirical evidence seems to support the inclusion of the outgroup in the self hypothesis. In one study white women were paired off with either another white woman (ingroup member) or a Latina woman (outgroup member).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The pairs of women met over an extended period of time completing different activities together, which led to a measurable close friendship. Women with an intergroup friendship were more likely to have positive intergroup attitudes, less likely to endorse anti-minority policies and less likely to demonstrate intergroup anxiety. The study suggests that the intergroup close relationship led to improved attitudes towards the entire outgroup as suggested by the inclusion of the outgroup in the self mechanism. Another study also found that the level of inclusion of the outgroup in the self would affect the amount of decreased prejudicial attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=Rhiannon N.|last2=Hewstone|first2=Miles|last3=Voci|first3=Alberto|last4=Vonofakou|first4=Christiana|date=2008|title=A test of the extended intergroup contact hypothesis: The mediating role of intergroup anxiety, perceived ingroup and outgroup norms, and inclusion of the outgroup in the self.|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/3762643/2008JPSP.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=95|issue=4|pages=843–860|doi=10.1037/a0011434|issn=1939-1315|ref=harv}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, simply including a friend in the self who has a close relationship with an outgroup member can decrease outgroup prejudiced attitudes. Knowing that a friend includes an outgroup member in the self allows for the individual to include that entire outgroup in the self. In turn, this also leads to positive attitudes about the outgroup.

===Self-expansion motive===

It may be the case that individuals want to make friends with outgroup members (instead of oppress and mistreat the outgroup) because of the self-expansion motive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on Aron and Aron's original work, people want to expand the self and an optimal way of doing so is to make close friendships that give the opportunity for increased perspectives, identities and resources. People who are most similar to ourselves provide a diminished capacity for self-expansion.  As a result, an individual may turn to outgroup members for friendship because they are different from one's self-concept. These differences allow for a greater likelihood to increase resources, identities and perspectives, which is consistent with the self-expansion motive. A recent study has shown that, consistent with this idea, priming high self-expansion motivation enhances outgroup self-expansion and the quality and outcomes of outgroup interactions (e.g. greater self-efficacy, reported closeness, and self-growth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dys-Steenbergen|first1=Odilia|last2=Wright|first2=Stephen C.|last3=Aron|first3=Arthur|date=1 January 2016|title=Self-expansion motivation improves cross-group interactions and enhances self-growth|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=19|issue=1|pages=60–71|doi=10.1177/1368430215583517|issn=1368-4302|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barriers to self-expansion at the intergroup level===

Self-expansion motives can explain why people may appreciate intergroup contact, however, it can also provide explanations for why we avoid this intergroup contact. People may be cautious of self-expansion due to a sense of self-loss. As we self-expand in one area we may put ourselves at risk of losing aspects of the self in another area. Consequently, people may be fearful of creating a close relationship with an outgroup member as this may trigger animosity from original ingroup members. Often individuals must balance between potential benefits of including the outgroup in the self with the potential loss of ingroup friends and the associated resources. If the self-loss outweighs the self-expansion, it is possible for a decrease in perceived self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A second barrier for self-expansion is the notion for an overabundance of self-expansion in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Improving Intergroup Relations Building on the Legacy of Thomas F. Pettigrew|last1=Wright|first1=S. C.|last2=Aron|first2=A.|last3=Brody|first3=S. M.|publisher=Blackwell Pub|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4443-0311-7|editor-last=Wagner|editor-first=Ulrich|location=Oxford|pages=143–159|chapter=Extended contact and including the others in the self: Building on the Allport/Pettigrew legacy|oclc=839361889|ref=harv|editor-last2=Tropp|editor-first2=L.|editor-last3=Finchilescu|editor-first3=G.|editor-last4=Tredoux|editor-first4=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accumulation of new resources and perspectives in our self-concept leads to a need for self-integration (i.e. combining different resources, identities and perspectives into single overarching self-concept). An excessive amount of self-expansion without proper self-integration can be quite stressful (e.g. moving to a new city, or starting a new job). It has been suggested that when a person is socially stable, self-expansion via an outgroup member is most likely to be successful. Consequently, the likelihood for cross-group contact and the inclusion of the outgroup in the self is dependent on the degree of self-expansion in other domains. Expansion = motivation and believing.

===Self-expansion beyond relationships===
More recently, self-expansion research has begun to shift away from investigating self-expansion in a social context (e.g. romantic relationships)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=Helen E.|last2=Xu|first2=Xiaomeng|last3=Aron|first3=Arthur|last4=Brown|first4=Lucy L.|date=2016|title=Intense, Passionate, Romantic Love: A Natural Addiction?

Similar to findings from social self-expansion literature, individual self-expansion also has positive effects and includes the same processes (e.g. motivation, self-efficacy). Self-expansion has also been presented theoretically within a framework of self-concept change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mattingly | first1=Brent A. | last2=Lewandowski | first2=Gary W. | last3=McIntyre | first3=Kevin P. | title="You make me a better/worse person": A two-dimensional model of relationship self-change | journal=Personal Relationships | date=1 March 2014 | pages=176–190 | doi=10.1111/pere.12025 | issn=1475-6811 | volume=21 | issue=1 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, self-concept change can be thought of as occurring along two independent dimensions: valence (positive vs. negative content) and direction of change (increase vs. decrease in content) and self-expansion represents one of the four possible processes of self-concept change (increasing positive content).

'''Sexualization''' (or '''sexualisation''') is to make something [[Human sexuality|sexual]] in character or quality, or to become aware of sexuality,&lt;ref name="Sexualization"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualization (definition) | publisher= ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''| accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sexualization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexualize"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualize | publisher = ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' | accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/sexualize}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in relation to men and women. Sexualization is linked to [[sexual objectification]]. According to the [[American Psychological Association]], sexualization occurs when "individuals are regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness."&lt;ref name=Dewar&gt;{{cite web | last = Dewar | first = Gwen | title = The sexualization of girls: Is the popular culture harming our kids? | url = http://www.parentingscience.com/sexualization-of-girls.html | website = parentingscience.com | publisher = Parenting Science | date = October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "In study after study, findings have indicated that women more often than men are portrayed in a sexual manner (e.g., dressed in revealing clothing, with bodily postures or facial expressions that imply sexual readiness) and are objectified (e.g., used as a decorative object, or as body parts rather than a whole person). In addition, a narrow (and unrealistic) standard of physical beauty is heavily emphasized. These are the models of femininity presented for young girls to study and emulate."&lt;ref name=Exec&gt;{{citation | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | contribution = Executive Summary | editor-last = APA Task Force | editor-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who embrace their sexual desires are considered to be sexy and attractive to men who want nothing more than to have a woman as a sex toy. In the eyes of men, women that practice this behavior serve the pure purpose of providing satisfaction and showcasing their human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peter | first1 = Jochen | last2 = Valkenburg | first2 = Patti M. | title = Adolescents' exposure to a sexualized media environment and their notions of women as sex objects | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 383–384 | date = March 2007 | doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9176-y | ref = harv }} [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11199-006-9176-y.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Media Education Foundation's, ''[[Killing Us Softly|Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women]]'', the sexualization of girls in media and the ways women are portrayed in the dominant culture are detrimental to the development of young girls as they are developing their identities and understanding themselves as sexual beings.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne &gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Jean Kilbourne]] (writer/presenter), [[Sut Jhally]] (director) and David Rabinovitz | date= 2010 | accessdate= 30 December 2015 | title= Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women | medium= Video | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2507550/ | publisher= [[Media Education Foundation]] | location = Northampton, Massachusetts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports have found that sexualization of younger children is becoming increasingly more common in advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Donohue | first1 = William | last2 = Gold | first2 = Steven R. | last3 = McKay | first3 = J.

Medical and social science researchers generally deployed "sexualization" to refer to a liminal zone between sexual abuse and normal family life, in which the child's relationship with their parents was characterized by an "excessive", improper sexuality, though without recognizable forms of abuse having occurred.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite book | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 | oclc = 123130352 }} [http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; American Psychological Association also argues that the sexualization of young girls contributes to sexist attitudes within society, and a societal tolerance of sexual violence.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

From 2003 to 2005, "sexualization" began to ascend to the status of an issue in the public eye. The cause of this rise was that it became positioned by a number of discursive actors as a feminist issue. This is not to say that a single "feminist perspective on sexualization" emerged in this period; among discursive actors mobilizing feminist discourses, or identifying themselves explicitly with feminism, there were a host of different views. Yet a particular, relatively cohesive position emerged after 2003 among a number of media discourses: these discourses tended to emphasize that, in the context of a commercialized and sexist culture, young women are unable to exercise meaningful choice even when they experience themselves as doing so. These media actors, in their problematization of sexualization, positioned themselves as the true heirs to the feminist tradition and its critical insights, in contrast to contemporary youth.

[[Consumerism]] and [[globalization]] has led to sexualization of girls occurring across all [[advanced economies]], in media and advertisements, to clothing and toys marketed for young girls.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "sexualization" itself only emerged in Anglophone discourse in recent decades. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the term was infrequently drawn upon by English writers to refer the assignation of a gendered frame to a particular object, such as the gendering of nouns (e.g., de Quincey [1839]1909, 195).&lt;ref name="de Quincey"&gt;{{citation | author-last = de Quincey | author-first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas De Quincey | contribution = Style and language | editor-last1 = de Quincey | editor-first1 = Thomas | editor-last2 = Darbishire | editor-first2 = Helen | editor-link1 = Thomas De Quincey | editor-link2 = Helen Darbishire | title = De Quincey's literary criticism | pages = 181&amp;ndash;196 | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Digital Library | location = New York, NY | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781411457836 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term "asexualization" saw greater use, as a synonym for sterilization in eugenics discourse from around the turn of the twentieth century (e.g., Lydston 1904).&lt;ref name="Lydston"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lydston | first = G.

== Effects on children ==

In 2006, an Australian report called ''Corporate paedophilia: sexualisation of children in Australia''&lt;ref name=Australia /&gt; was published. The Australian report summarises its conclusion as follows:

:Images of sexualised children are becoming increasingly common in advertising and marketing material. Children who appear aged 12 years and under are dressed, posed and made up in the same way as sexy adult models. Children that appear on magazines are seen older than they really are because of the sexualised clothes they are given to pose in.  "Corporate paedophilia" is a metaphor used to describe advertising and marketing that sexualises children in these ways.

In 2007, the [[American Psychological Association]] published a report titled ''Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls'', discussed below.

In 2010, the [[American Psychological Association]] published an additional report titled " Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls", which performed a study where college students were asked to try on and evaluate either a swimsuit or a sweater. While they waited for 10 minutes wearing the garment, they completed a math test. The results revealed that young women in swimsuits performed significantly worse on the math problems than did those wearing sweaters.The hypothesis is that individuals about to try on the sweaters had less pressure to look beautiful because they were not wearing revealing clothing therefore they performed better.

In 2012, an American study found that self-sexualization was common among 6–9-year old girls. Girls overwhelmingly chose the sexualized doll over the non-sexualized doll for their ideal self and as popular. However other factors, such as how often mothers talked to their children about what is going on in TV shows and maternal religiosity, reduced those odds. Surprisingly, the mere quantity of girls' [[media consumption]] (TV and movies) was unrelated to their self-sexualization for the most part; rather, maternal self-objectification and maternal religiosity moderated its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Christine | last2 = Ferguson | first2 = Gail | title = Sexy dolls, sexy grade-schoolers? Media &amp; maternal influences on young girls' self-sexualization | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 67 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 463–476 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-012-0183-x | date = October 2012 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232686658 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2010 the [[Scottish Executive]] released a report titled ''External research on sexualised goods aimed at children''.&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; The report considers the drawbacks of the United States and Australian reviews, concluding:

{{Quote|[T]here is no indication [in the APA report] that the media might contain any positive images about human relationships, or that children might critically evaluate what they see.}}

The Scottish review also notes that:

{{Quote|[s]uch accounts often present the sexualisation of children as a relatively recent development, but it is by no means a new issue …  While the public visibility of the issue, and the terms in which it is defined, may have changed, sexualised representations of children cannot be seen merely as a consequence of contemporary consumerism.}}

It also notes that previous coverage "rests on moral assumptions … that are not adequately explained or justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mayo | first1 = Ed | last2 = Nairn | first2 = Agnes | author-link1 = Ed Mayo | title = Consumer kids: how big business is grooming our children for profit | publisher = Constable | location = London | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781845298807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letting Children be Children: Report of an Independent Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood (UK)'''
The report 'Letting Children Be Children',&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; also known as the Bailey Report, is a report commissioned by the UK government on the subject of the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. The report was published in June 2011 and was commissioned as a result of concerns raised as to whether children's lives are negatively affected by the effects of commercialisation and sexualisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=NSPCC | author-link1 =NSPCC |title= Premature sexualisation: understanding the risks: outcomes of the NSPCC's expert seminar series |date= 2011 | publisher= NSPCC | location= London }} [https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/information-service/seminars-premature-sexualisation-understanding-risks.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailey Report is so-called as it was researched and compiled by Reg Bailey, the Chief Executive of the Mothers' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.mothersunion.org/ | website = mothersunion.org | publisher = Mothers' Union | accessdate = 6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "charity supporting parents and children in 83 countries in the world".&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; The report asked for contributions from parents; children; organisations; businesses and the general public in order to consider their views and inform their recommendations and identified four themes that were of particular concern to parents and the wider public. These themes were:
*1) the "wallpaper" of children's lives
*2) clothing, products and services for children
*3) children as consumers
*4) making parents' voices heard

The report returned recommendations based on the research from interested parties, on each of the key themes, in the form of "what we would like to see". On the theme of "the wallpaper of children's lives" it said that it would like to see that sexualised images used in public places should be more in line with what parents find acceptable, to ensure that images in public spaces becomes more child friendly. On theme two "clothing, products and services for children" the Bailey report said that it would like to see retailers no longer selling or marketing inappropriate clothing, products or services for children. What they would like to see on theme three "children as consumers" is comprehensive regulation protecting children from excessive commercial pressures across all media in-line with parental expectations; that marketers are ethical and do not attempt to exploit gaps in the market to influence children into becoming consumers and to ensure that parents and children have an awareness of marketing techniques and regulations.

There is a motion for a [[European Parliament]] resolution going through which gives the following definition of sexualization: {{Quotation|[S]exualization consists of an instrumental approach to a person by perceiving that person as an object for sexual use disregarding the person's dignity and personality traits, with the person's worth being measured in terms of the level of sexual attractiveness; sexualization also involves the imposition of the sexuality of adult persons on girls, who are emotionally, psychologically and physically unprepared for this at their particular stage of development; sexualization&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As opposed to its meaning in relation to [[human sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt;  not being the normal, healthy, biological development of the sexuality of a person, conditioned by the individual process of development and taking place at the appropriate time for each particular individual.&lt;ref name=draft&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skrzydlewska|first=Joanna|authorlink=Joanna Skrzydlewska|title=Draft report on the sexualization of girls (2012/2047 (INI)) | journal = European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.

== Effects on women of color ==
The sexualization of women of color is different than the sexualization of white women.  The media plays a significant role in this sexualization. "The media are likely to have powerful effects if the information is presented persistently, consistently, and corroborated among forms. As a media affect, stereotypes rely on the repetition to perpetuate and sustain them."&lt;ref name="Eva"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Merskin | first = Debra | title = Three faces of Eva: perpetuation of the hot-Latina stereotype in ''Desperate Housewives'' | journal = Howard Journal of Communications | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–151 | doi = 10.1080/10646170701309890 | date = 2007 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Celine Parrenas Shimizu]], "To see race is to see sex, and vice versa."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Park | first = Samuel | title = ''The hypersexuality of race: performing Asian/American women on screen and scene'' (review) | journal = [[Theatre Journal]] | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 346–347 | doi = 10.1353/tj.0.0193 | date = May 2009 | ref = harv }}

=== Black women ===
In an NPR interview with Professor Herbert Samuels at LaGuardia Community College in New York and Mireille Miller-Young a professor at UC Santa Barbara they talk about sexual stereotypes of black bodies in America and how even in sex work, already a dangerous job, black women are treated much worse than their counterparts due to the effects of their oversexualization and objectification in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[Farai Chideya]] (host/producer), Herbert Samuels (guest) and Mireille Miller-Young (guest) |date= 7 May 2007 |title= Sex stereotypes of African Americans have long history |medium= Radio program |series= [[NPR|NPR news]] |language= English |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 |access-date= 9 December 2015 |publisher= [[NPR]] }} [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 Transcript.]&lt;/ref&gt; Black women's bodies are either invisible or hypervisible. In the 1800s, a South African woman named [[Sarah Baartman]] was known as "Hottentot Venus" and her body was paraded around in London and Paris where they looked at her exotic features such as large breasts and behind. Her features were deemed lesser and oversexual. There is also the ''Jezebel'' stereotype that portrays black women as "hypersexual, manipulative, animalistic and promiscuous females who cannot be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mowatt | first1 = Rasul A. | title = Black/female/body hypervisibility and invisibility: a Black feminist augmentation of feminist leisure research | journal = Journal of Leisure Research, Special Issue: Feminist Leisure Research in the Contemporary Era | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 644–660 | doi = 10.18666/JLR-2013-V45-I5-4367 | date = 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominican Women ===
In the Dominican Republic, women are frequently stereotyped as sultry and sexual as the reputation of Dominican sex workers grows.&lt;ref name="Race_class"&gt;Brennan, Denise (2004), "[https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/brennan_selling-sex-for-visas.pdf Selling sex for visas: sex tourism as a stepping-stone to international migration]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Pauline | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 243&amp;ndash;248 | publisher = Wadsworth/Thomson Learning | location = Belmont, California | edition = 9th | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780534609030 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many poor women have resorted to sex work because the demand is high and the hours and pay are often dictated by the workers themselves.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; White European and American men "exoticize dark-skinned 'native' bodies" because "they can buy sex for cut-rate prices".&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; This overgeneralizing of the sexuality of Dominican women can also carries back to the women's homes.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; Even "women who...worked in Europe have become suspect..." even if they had a legal job.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; They have become "exports" instead of people because of their sexualization.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt;

=== Asian women ===
The image of Asian women in Hollywood cinema is directly linked to sexuality as essential to any imagining about the roles they play as well as her actual appearance in popular culture. Asian female fatale's hypersexualized subjection is derived from her sexual behaviour that is considered as natural to her particular race and culture. Two types of Asian stereotypes that are commonly found in media are the Lotus Flower and the Dragon Lady. The Lotus Flower archetype is the "self-sacrificing, servile, and suicidal Asian women." The dragon lady archetype is the opposite of the lotus flower, a "self-abnegating Asian woman…[who] uses her 'Oriental' femininity, associated with seduction and danger to trap white men on behalf of conniving Asian males." According to film-maker and film scholar, Celine Shimizu, "The figure of the Asian American femme fatale signifies a particular deathly seduction. She attracts with her soft, unthreatening, and servile femininity while concealing her hard, dangerous, and domineering nature."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Native American women ===
Starting from the time of white colonization of Native American land, some Native American women have been referred to as "squaw," an Algonquin word for vagina. "The 'squaw' [stereotype] is the dirty, subservient, and abused tribal female who is also haggard, violent, and eager to torture tribal captives."  Another stereotype is the beautiful Indian princess who leaves her tribe and culture behind to marry a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mihesuah | first = Devon Abbott | contribution = Finding a modern American indigenous female identity | editor-last = Mihesuah | editor-first = Devon Abbott | title = Indigenous American women: decolonization, empowerment, activism | page = 102 | publisher = [[University of Nebraska Press]] | location = Lincoln, Nebraska and London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780803282865 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the hot Latina stereotype lies three categories of representation: the Cantina Girl, the Faithful, self-sacrificing señorita, and the vamp. The Cantina Girl markers are "'great sexual allure,' teasing, dancing, and 'behaving in an alluring fashion.'" The faithful, self-sacrificing Señorita starts out as a good girl and turns bad by the end. The Señorita, in an attempt to save her Anglo love interest, utilizes her body to protect him from violence. The Vamp representation "uses her intellectual and devious sexual wiles to get what she wants." The media represents Latinas "as either [a] hot-blooded spitfire" or "[a] dutiful mother".&lt;ref name="Vargas 1993"&gt;{{citation | last = Vargas | first = Deborah R. | contribution = Representations of Latina/o sexuality in popular culture | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Patricia | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Cengage Learning | location = Boston, Massachusetts | edition = 9th | year = 2016 | origyear = 1993 | isbn = 9781305093614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual implications of the "hot-blooded" Latina has become an overgeneralized representation of Latin people.

Some believe it to be wrong simply because the interpretation of this culture seems to go against white, Western culture.&lt;ref name="Vargas 1993" /&gt; Culturally, the Latina is expected to dress "as a proper señorita" in order to be respected as a woman which conflicts with the Western ideals that a girl is sexual if she dresses "too 'mature' for [her] age".&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993"&gt;{{citation | last = Cofer | first = Judith O. | contribution = The myth of the Latin woman: ''I Just Met a Girl Named Maria'' | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Patricia | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Cengage Learning | location = Boston, Massachusetts | edition = 9th | year = 2016 | origyear = 1993 | isbn = 9781305093614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the business world this stereotype continues; "tight skirts and jingling bracelets [are misinterpreted] as a come-on". This sexualization can also be linked to certain stereotypical jobs. The image of the Latina woman often is not in the business world but in the domestic.&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993" /&gt; The sexualization of Latina women sexualizes the positions that they are expected to occupy. Domestic servants, maids, and waitresses are the typical "media-engendered" roles that make it difficult for Latinas to gain "upward mobility" despite the fact that many hold PhDs.&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993" /&gt;

== American Psychological Association view ==

=== Definition ===
The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in its 2007 Report looked at the cognitive and emotional consequences of sexualization and the consequences for mental and physical health, and impact on development of a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt; The report considers that a person is sexualized in the following situations:
*a person's value comes only from his or her [[Sexual attraction|sexual appeal]] or [[Human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], to the exclusion of other characteristics;
*a person is held to a standard that equates [[physical attractiveness]] (narrowly defined) with being sexy;
*a person is [[sexual objectification|sexually objectified]]—that is, made into a thing for others' sexual use, rather than seen as a person with the capacity for independent action and decision making; and/or
*sexuality is inappropriately imposed upon a person.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

=== Children ===
Some [[cultural critic]]s have postulated that over recent decades children have evidenced a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behaviour inappropriate for their age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaeser | first = Fred | title = Towards a better understanding of children's sexual behavior | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/74965/towardsabetterunderstandingofchildrenssexualbehavior.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = NYU Child Study Center | date = 30 October 2001 | quote = We know that exposure to sexualized messages, particularly those that are incomprehensible, can have several effects on children. }} ''Fred Kaeser Ed.D. is the Director of Health Services for Community School District Two, NYC.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chambers | first = Suzanna | title = Outrage as Argos sells G-strings for children | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=109621&amp;in_page_id=1770) | work = [[The Mail on Sunday|Mail on Sunday]] | publisher = [[DMG Media]] | date = 14 April 2002 | accessdate = 22 February 2007 | quote = High Street chain Argos has been branded irresponsible for promoting a range of sexually provocative lingerie designed for primary schoolgirls. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of parental oversight and [[discipline]]; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school [[sex education]] programs.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb_Therapy&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Sharon | author-link1 = Sharon Lamb | title = Sex, therapy, and kids: addressing their concerns through talk and play | publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780393704792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For girls and young women in particular, the APA reports that studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their "[[self-image]] and healthy development".&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

The APA cites the following as advertising techniques that contribute to the sexualization of girls:&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;
*Including girls in ads with sexualized women wearing matching clothing or posed seductively.
*Dressing girls up to look like adult women.
*Dressing women down to look like young girls.
*The employment of youthful celebrity adolescents in highly sexual ways to promote or endorse products.
The APA additionally further references the teen magazine market by citing a study by [[Donald F. Roberts|Roberts]] ''et al'' that found that "47% of 8- to 18-year-old [girls] reported having read at least 5 minutes of a magazine the previous day."&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1= Roberts |first1= Donald F. |last2= Foehr |first2= Ulla G. |last3= Rideout |first3= Victoria | author-link1 = Donald F.

==== Cognitive and emotional consequences ====
Studies have found that thinking about the body and comparing it to sexualized cultural ideals may disrupt a girl's mental concentration, and a girl's sexualization or objectification may undermine her confidence in and comfort with her own body, leading to emotional and self-image problems, such as shame and anxiety.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research has linked sexualization with three of the most common mental health problems diagnosed in girls and women: eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression or depressed mood.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research suggests that the sexualization of girls has negative consequences on girls' ability to develop a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

A result of the sexualization of girls in the media is that young girls are "learning how to view themselves as sex objects".&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; When girls fail to meet the [[thin ideal]] and dominant culture's standard of beauty they can develop anxieties.&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; Sexualization is problematic for young children who are developing their sexual identity as they may think that turning themselves into sex objects is empowering and related to having sexual agency.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

== Products for children ==

Some commercial products seen as promoting the sexualization of children have drawn considerable media attention:
* ''[[Bratz]] Baby'' Dolls marketed at 6-year-old girls that feature sexualized clothing, like fishnet stockings, feather boas, and miniskirts&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt;   
* Highly sexualized and gendered Halloween costumes marketed at young girls, such as the "sexy firefighter", a costume that consists of a tight fitted mini dress and high heeled boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Delisle | first = Riana | title = Halloween costumes are sexualizing our youngest trick-or-treaters | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/raina-delisle/halloween-costumes-sexy-inappropriate_b_6006922.html | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | publisher = [[AOL]] | location = Canada | date = 18 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Clothing such T-shirts being marketed for young children in preschool and elementary school with printed slogans like "So Many Boys So Little Time"&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; 
* Padded bras on bikinis aimed at seven-year-old girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barr | first = Robert (in London) | title = Outrage at girls' padded bikinis | url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/outrage-at-girls-padded-bikinis-20100415-shjf.html | work = [[The Age]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people regard [[training bra]]s similarly. However, there is also evidence that with the mean age of puberty declining in Western cultures, functional brassieres are required by a higher percentage of preteen girls than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aksglaede | first1 = Lise | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Kaspar | last3 = Petersen | first3 = Jørgen H. | last4 = Skakkebæk | first4 = Niels E. | last5 = Juul | first5 = Anders | title = Recent decline in age at breast development: the Copenhagen Puberty Study | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = e932–e939 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2008-2491 | pmid = 19403485 | date = May 2009| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Executive]] report&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; surveyed 32 High street UK retailers and found that many of the larger chains, including [[Tesco]], Debenhams, JJ Sports, and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] did not offer sexualized goods aimed at children. The report noted that overall prevalence was limited but this was based on a very narrow research brief. Whilst this shows that not all High street retailers were aiming products deemed sexualized by the researchers, the research cannot be taken out of context and used to say that there is not an issue of sexualization.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}}

== Culture and media ==
{{For2|more on the mainstreaming of sex in media and culture|[[pornographication]]}}
Sexualization has also been a subject of debate for academics who work in media and [[cultural studies]].

The terms "[[pornographication|pornification]]" and "[[pornographication]]" have also been used to describe the way that aesthetics that were previously associated with pornography have become part of popular culture, and that mainstream media texts and other cultural practices "citing pornographic styles, gestures and aesthetics" have become more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paasonen | first1 = Susanna | last2 = Nikunen | first2 = Kaarina |last3 = Saarenmaa | first3 = Laura | authorlink1 = Susanna Paasonen | title = Pornification: sex and sexuality in media culture | publisher = Berg | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781845207045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which Brian McNair has described as a "pornographication of the mainstream".&lt;ref name=McNair&gt;{{cite book | last = McNair | first = Brian | title = Striptease culture sex, media and the democratization of desire | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415237345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed alongside an expansion of the cultural realm of pornography or "pornosphere" which itself has become more accessible to a much wider variety of audiences. According to McNair, both developments can be set in the context of a wider shift towards a "striptease culture" which has disrupted the boundaries between public and private discourse in late modern Western culture, and which is evident more generally in cultural trends which privilege lifestyle, reality, interactivity, self-revelation and public intimacy.&lt;ref name=McNair /&gt;

Children and adolescents spend more time engaging with media than any other age group. This is a time in their life that they are more susceptible to information that they receive. Children are getting sex education from the media, little kids are exposed to sexualized images and more information than ever before in human history but are not able to process the information, they are not developmentally ready to process it, and this impacts their development and behavior.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

Sexualization of young girls in the media and infantilization of women creates an environment where it becomes more acceptable to view children as "seductive and sexy".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; It makes having healthy sexual relationships more difficult for people and creates sexist attitudes.

The Australian writers, [[Catharine Lumby]] and Kath Albury (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lumby | first1 = Catharine | last2 = Albury | first2 = Kath | title = Introduction: children, young people, sexuality and the media | journal = Media International Australia | volume = 135 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–60 | doi = 10.1177/1329878X1013500108 | date = May 2010 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that sexualization is "a debate that has been simmering for almost a decade" and concerns about sex and the media are far from new. Much of the recent writing on sexualization has been the subject of criticism that because of the way that it draws on "one-sided, selective, overly simplifying, generalizing, and negatively toned" evidence&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Vanwesenbeeck | first = Ine | title = The risks and rights of sexualization: an appreciative commentary on Lerum and Dworkin's "''Bad Girls Rule''" | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 268–270 | doi = 10.1080/00224490903082694 | pmid = 19657946 | date = July 2009 | ref = harv }}

The sexualization of women being influenced by society is a problem that should be avoided due to its impact on how women value and present themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">In [[applied mathematics]], the two-dimensional '''Spectral [[signal-to-noise ratio]]''' (SSNR) measures the normalised cross-correlation coefficient between several two-dimensional images over corresponding rings in Fourier space as a function of spatial frequency {{harv|Unser|1987}}. It is a multi-particle extension of the Fourier ring correlation (FRC), which is related to the [[Fourier shell correlation]]. The SSNR is a popular method for finding the resolution of a class average in [[cryo-electron microscopy]].

== Calculation ==

:&lt;math&gt;
SSNR (r)
 = 
\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in R}\left|\sum_{k_i}{ F_{r_i,k} }\right|^2}
{\displaystyle \frac{K}{K-1} \sum_{r_i \in R}\sum_{k_i}{ \left|{ F_{r_i,k} - \bar{F}_{r_i}}\right|^2}} -1
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
:&lt;math&gt;
 =
\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in R}\left|\sum_{k_i}{ F_{r_i,k} }\right|^2}
{\displaystyle \frac{K}{K-1} \sum_{r_i \in R} 
\left| \sum_{k_i}F^2_{r_i,k} - \frac{1}{K}\left(\sum_{k_i}F_{r_i,k}\right)^2 \right|}
&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_{r_i,k}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex structure Factor for image k for a pixel &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; at radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. It is possible convert the SSNR into an equivalent FRC using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;
FRC = \frac{SSNR}{SSNR + 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6643">'''Systems medicine''' is an interdisciplinary field of study that looks at the systems of the human body as part of an integrated whole, incorporating biochemical, physiological, and environment interactions. Systems medicine draws on [[systems science]] and [[systems biology]], and considers complex interactions within the human body in light of a patient's [[genomics]], behavior and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Federoff |first1= Howard| last2= Gostin|first2= Lawrence O.| url= http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=184479 |title=Evolving from Reductionism to Holism: Is There a Future for Systems Medicine?| journal= Journal of the American Medical Association|volume= 302|issue=9 |year=2009| pages=994–996 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1264 | pmid=19724047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest uses of the term ''systems medicine'' appeared in 1992, in an article on systems medicine and pharmacology by B.J. Zeng &lt;ref&gt;Zeng (B.) J., On the holographic model of human body, 1st National Conference of Comparative Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine and West Medicine, Medicine and Philosophy, April, 1992 ( termed "systems medicine and pharmacology").&lt;/ref&gt; and in a paper on systems biomedicine by T. Kamada.&lt;ref&gt;Kamada T. ,System biomedicine: a new paradigm in biomedical engineering. Front Med Biol Eng. 1992;4(1):1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important topic in systems medicine and [[systems biomedicine]] is the development of computational models that  describe disease progression and the effect of therapeutic interventions.

'''''What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell''''' is a 1944 science book written for the lay reader by physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]].  The book was based on a course of public lectures delivered by Schrödinger in February 1943, under the auspices of the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].  The lectures attracted an audience of about 400, who were warned "that the subject-matter was a difficult one and that the lectures could not be termed popular, even though the physicist’s most dreaded weapon, mathematical deduction, would hardly be utilized."&lt;ref name="Margulis"&gt;[[Lynn Margulis|Margulis, Lynn]]. &amp; Sagan, Dorion. (1995). ''What Is Life?'' (pg. 1). Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schrödinger's lecture focused on one important question: "how can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?"&lt;ref name="Margulis"/&gt;

In the book, Schrödinger introduced the idea of an "aperiodic crystal" that contained genetic information in its configuration of covalent [[chemical bond]]s. In the 1950s, this idea stimulated enthusiasm for discovering the genetic molecule.  Although the existence of some form of hereditary information had been hypothesized since 1869, its role in reproduction and its helical shape were still unknown at the time of Schrödinger's lecture.  In retrospect, Schrödinger's aperiodic crystal can be viewed as a well-reasoned theoretical prediction of what biologists should have been looking for during their search for [[genetic material]]. Both [[James D. Watson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|authorlink=James D. Watson |first=James D. |last=Watson|year=2007 |title=Avoid Boring People: (Lessons from a life in science) |isbn=978-0-375-41284-4 |page=353|location=New York|publisher=Knopf}}. Page 28 details how Watson came to appreciate the significance of the gene.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Francis Crick]], who jointly proposed the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]] structure of [[DNA]] based on [[X-ray diffraction]] experiments by [[Rosalind Franklin]], credited Schrödinger's book with presenting an early theoretical description of how the storage of [[Genetics|genetic]] information would work, and each independently acknowledged the book as a source of inspiration for their initial researches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/04/erwin.html|title=Book Review: ''What Is Life?''

== Background ==

The book is based on lectures delivered under the auspices of the Institute at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], in February 1943 and published in 1944. At that time DNA was not yet accepted as the carrier of hereditary information, which only was the case after the [[Hershey–Chase experiment]] of 1952.  One of the most successful branches of physics at this time was [[statistical physics]], and [[quantum mechanics]], a theory which is also very statistical in its nature. Schrödinger himself is one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics.

[[Max Delbrück|Max Delbrück's]] thinking about the physical basis of life was an important influence on Schrödinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dronamraju KR |title=Erwin Schrödinger and the origins of molecular biology |journal=Genetics |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=1071–6 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10545442 |pmc=1460808 |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/153/3/1071#Delbrucks_model}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, long before the publication of ''What is Life?'', geneticist and 1946 Nobel-prize winner [[H. J. Muller]] had in his 1922 article "Variation due to Change in the Individual Gene"&lt;ref&gt;American Naturalist 56 (1922)&lt;/ref&gt; already laid out all the basic properties of the "heredity molecule" (then not yet known to be DNA) that Schrödinger was to re-derive in 1944 "from first principles" in ''What is Life?'' (including the "aperiodicity" of the molecule), properties which Muller specified and refined additionally in his 1929 article "The Gene As The Basis of Life"&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the International Congress of Plant Sciences 1 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Pursuit of the Gene. From Darwin to DNA |first=James |last=Schwartz |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-674-02670-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, [[H. J. Muller]] himself wrote in a 1960 letter to a journalist regarding ''What Is Life?'' that whatever the book got right about the "hereditary molecule" had already been published before 1944 and that Schrödinger's were only the wrong speculations; Muller also named two famous geneticists (including Delbrück) who knew every relevant pre-1944 publication and had been in contact with Schrödinger before 1944. But DNA as the molecule of heredity became topical only after [[Oswald Avery]]'s most important bacterial-transformation experiments in 1944. Before these experiments, proteins were considered the most likely candidates.

== Content ==

In chapter I, Schrödinger explains that most physical laws on a large scale are due to chaos on a small scale. He calls this principle "order-from-disorder." As an example he mentions [[diffusion]], which can be modeled as a highly ordered process, but which is caused by random movement of atoms or molecules. If the number of atoms is reduced, the behaviour of a system becomes more and more random. He states that life greatly depends on order and that a naïve physicist may assume that the master code of a living organism has to consist of a large number of atoms.

In chapter II and III, he summarizes what was known at this time about the hereditary mechanism. Most importantly, he elaborates the important role [[mutation]]s play in [[evolution]]. He concludes that the carrier of hereditary information has to be both small in size and permanent in time, contradicting the naïve physicist's expectation. This contradiction cannot be resolved by [[classical physics]].

In chapter IV, Schrödinger presents [[molecule]]s, which are indeed stable even if they consist of only a few atoms, as the solution. Even though molecules were known before, their stability could not be explained by classical physics, but is due to the discrete nature of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, [[mutation]]s are directly linked to [[Atomic electron transition|quantum leaps]].

He continues to explain, in chapter V, that true [[solid]]s, which are also permanent, are [[crystal]]s. The stability of molecules and crystals is due to the same principles and a molecule might be called "the germ of a solid." On the other hand, an [[amorphous]] solid, without crystalline structure, should be regarded as a [[liquid]] with a very high [[viscosity]]. Schrödinger believes the heredity material to be a molecule, which unlike a crystal does not repeat itself. He calls this an aperiodic crystal. Its aperiodic nature allows it to encode an almost infinite number of possibilities with a small number of atoms. He finally compares this picture with the known facts and finds it in accordance with them.

In chapter VI Schrödinger states:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ...living matter, while not eluding the "laws of physics" as established up to date, is likely to involve "other laws of physics" hitherto unknown, which however, once they have been revealed, will form just as integral a part of science as the former.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He knows that this statement is open to misconception and tries to clarify it. The main principle involved with "order-from-disorder" is the [[second law of thermodynamics]], according to which [[entropy]] only increases in a closed system (such as the universe). Schrödinger explains that living matter evades the decay to [[thermodynamical equilibrium]] by homeostatically maintaining [[negative entropy]] (today this quantity is called [[information]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|authorlink1=Claude Shannon|last1=Shannon|first1=Claude |authorlink2=Warren Weaver|last2=Weaver|first2=Warren|title=The Mathematical Theory of Communication|year=1949|isbn=0-252-72546-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in an open system.

In chapter VII, he maintains that "order-from-order" is not absolutely new to physics; in fact, it is even simpler and more plausible. But nature follows "order-from-disorder", with some exceptions as the movement of the [[celestial bodies]] and the behaviour of mechanical devices such as clocks. But even those are influenced by thermal and frictional forces. The degree to which a system functions mechanically or statistically depends on the temperature. If heated, a clock ceases to function, because it melts. Conversely, if the temperature approaches [[absolute zero]], any system behaves more and more mechanically. Some systems approach this mechanical behaviour rather fast with room temperature already being practically equivalent to absolute zero.

Schrödinger concludes this chapter and the book with [[philosophy|philosophical]] speculations on [[determinism]], [[free will]], and the mystery of human [[consciousness]]. He attempts to "see whether we cannot draw the correct non-contradictory conclusion from the following two premises: (1) My body functions as a pure mechanism according to Laws of Nature; and (2) Yet I know, by incontrovertible direct experience, that I am directing its motions, of which I foresee the effects, that may be fateful and all-important, in which case I feel and take full responsibility for them. The only possible inference from these two facts is, I think, that I – I in the widest meaning of the word, that is to say, every conscious mind that has ever said or felt 'I' – am the person, if any, who controls the 'motion of the atoms' according to the Laws of Nature". Schrödinger then states that this insight is not new and that Upanishads considered this insight of "ATHMAN&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;BRAHMAN" to "represent quintessence of deepest insights into the happenings of the world. Schrödinger rejects the idea that the source of consciousness should perish with the body because he finds the idea "distasteful". He also rejects the idea that there are multiple immortal souls that can exist without the body because he believes that consciousness is nevertheless highly dependent on the body. Schrödinger writes that, to reconcile the two premises,&lt;blockquote&gt;The only possible alternative is simply to keep to the immediate experience that consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing…&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any intuitions that consciousness is plural, he says, are illusions. Schrödinger is sympathetic to the [[Hindu]] concept of [[Brahman]], by which each individual's consciousness is only a manifestation of a [[collective consciousness|unitary consciousness]] pervading the [[universe]] — which corresponds to the Hindu concept of God. Schrödinger concludes that "...'I' am the person, if any, who controls the 'motion of the atoms' according to the Laws of Nature." However, he also qualifies the conclusion as "necessarily subjective" in its "philosophical implications". In the final paragraph, he points out that what is meant by "I" is not the collection of experienced events but "namely the canvas upon which they are collected." If a hypnotist succeeds in blotting out all earlier reminiscences, he writes, there would be no loss of personal existence — "Nor will there ever be."&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger references ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]] as a "beautiful book" leveling with the view he has taken in the last chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schrödinger's "paradox" ==

In a world governed by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], all [[isolated system]]s are expected to approach a state of maximum disorder. Since life approaches and maintains a highly ordered state, some argue that this seems to violate the aforementioned second law, implying that there is a paradox. However, since the [[biosphere]] is not an isolated system, there is no paradox. The increase of order inside an organism is more than paid for by an increase in disorder outside this organism by the loss of heat into the environment. By this mechanism, the second law is obeyed, and life maintains a highly ordered state, which it sustains by causing a net increase in disorder in the Universe. In order to increase the complexity on Earth—as life does—[[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] is needed and in this case is provided by the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;''What is Life?'' p.&amp;nbsp;91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'' Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Feilitzen and Linne (1975),&lt;ref name="Feilitzen"&gt;Feilitzen, C., &amp; Linne, O. (1975). Identifying with television characters. Journal of Communication, 25, 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt; '''wishful identification''' is the extension of [[Identification (literature)|identification]], which refers to people’s desire to become or to act in the same way as a certain [[Character (arts)|media character]]. The majority of research about wishful identification has focused on its impacts on media users’ [[intimate relationship]]s with, attachment to, identification with, imitation of, or interaction with [[Media celebrity|media figures]]. From this perspective, research into effects of wishful identification are helpful to understand how mediated messages can be effectively conveyed, and how mediated behaviors and figures can be shaped to positively influence [[social attitude]]s and [[Social behavior|behaviors]].

Participants in relevant [[research]] primarily consist of children and adolescents, as they do not have significant life and social experience ([[Albert Bandura|Bandura]], 1977;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bandura, A. |year=1977 |title=Social Learning Theory |publisher=General Learning Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffner, 1996&lt;ref name="Hoffner"&gt;Hoffner, C. (1996). Children’s wishful identification and parasocial interaction with favorite television characters. Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 40, 389–402.&lt;/ref&gt;). They have greater needs than adults for [[role model]]s so that they as children may develop and adjust their own social behaviors. As mentioned by Comstock (1993),&lt;ref name=" Comstock "&gt;Comstock, G. (1993). The medium and the society: The role of television in American life. In G. L. Berry, &amp; J. K. Asamen (Eds.), children and television: Images in a changing [[Sociocultural system|sociocultural world]] (pp. 117-131). Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; “[[television]] is a catalogue of modes of behavior; whether they affect what viewers do depends on their being taken as rewarding, acceptable, and applicable” (p.&amp;nbsp;128).

==Wishful Identification &amp; Identification==
There has been some inconsistency in the definition of identification. Some researchers define identification as hoping to be a certain media figure, to be in a certain mediated situation of that media figure, or to act a similar way to that media figure. However, this definition is not applied as widely as the one introduced by Cohen (2001):&lt;ref name=" Cohen"&gt;Cohen, J. (2001). Defining identification: A theoretical look at identification of audiences with media characters. Mass Communication &amp; Society, 4, 245-264.&lt;/ref&gt; “a mechanism through which [[audience member]]s experience reception and interpretation of the text from the inside, as if the events were happening to them.” While identification is characterized as sharing media figures’ [[point of view (philosophy)|points of view]], [[Vicariousness|vicarious]] participation, and imaginability, wishful identification focuses on media users’ desire and tendency.

==Wishful Identification &amp; Perceived Similarity==
Perceived similarity is found to be a significant predictor of wishful identification (Hoffner &amp; Cantor, 1991).&lt;ref name="Cantor"&gt;Hoffner, C., &amp; Cantor, J. (1991). Perceiving and responding to mass media characters. In J. Bryant &amp; D. Zillmann (Eds.), Responding to the screen: Reception and reaction processes (pp. 63–101). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived similarity can predict not only media users’ desire to be a certain media character, but also the level of that desire.

==Wishful Identification &amp; Imitation==
In early research and some recent research, [[imitation]] is an interchangeable word for wishful identification. Hoffner (1996) &lt;ref name="Hoffner"/&gt; defines imitation as a “desire to be like or behave in ways similar to a character” (p.&amp;nbsp;19). The limitation of this conceptualization, however, is apparent. The essence of wishful identification is media users’ desire, but imitation is not about people’s expectations; rather, it is about modeling, either for [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] or for behavior. While wishful identification implies anything but an actual [[Imitation|emulating action]], the best nature of imitation is action.

'''Womyn-born womyn''' ('''WBW''') is a term developed during [[second-wave feminism]] to designate women who were [[sex assignment|identified as female at birth]], were raised as girls, and identify as [[woman|women]] (or [[womyn]], a deliberately [[Satiric misspelling|alternative spelling]] that challenges the centering of [[male as norm]]).

Events and organizations that have womyn-born-womyn-only policies bar access to anyone who was assigned [[male]] at birth: male children of attendees, [[Trans woman|trans women]], [[gay men]], [[bisexual men]] and [[heterosexual men]]. These [[cisgender]] [[women-only space]]s have raised a number of concerns from transgender groups.

==Second-wave feminism==
The term gained usage and popularity during the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] movement. In 1978, the [[Lesbian Organization of Toronto]] adopted a womyn-born  womyn-only policy in response to a request for admittance by a transgender woman who identified as lesbian. Womyn-born womyn policies held that the nature of the feminine experience over the course of a lifetime could only be experienced by someone who experienced life presenting as a woman.&lt;ref name=raymond1994&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transsexual Empire |last=Raymond|first=Janice|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=978-0807021644|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to create a space for only women, defined not by identity but experience, defined in a way that excluded transgender women.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys1990&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anticlimax: a feminist perspective on the sexual revolution|last=Jeffreys|first=Sheila|publisher=Women's Press|year=1990|isbn=9780704342033|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave feminism is a period in the feminist movement lasting from the 1960s until around the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Gamble2001&gt;Sarah Gamble, ed. ''The Routledge companion to feminism and postfeminism'' (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}} Some feminists of the period such as scholars [[Sheila Jeffreys]], [[Janice Raymond]], and [[Theology|theologist]] [[Mary Daly]] were proponents of womyn-born womyn policies. These policies created controversy and scholarly discussion.

Raymond's ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]'' (1979) is often seen as the characterizing work of this movement. It is known for its view of trans women as privileged men who did not previously live in the oppression of the [[patriarchy]], stating, "We know who we are. We know that we are women who are born with female chromosomes and anatomy, and that whether or not we were socialised to be so-called normal women, patriarchy has treated and will treat us like women. Transsexuals have not had this same history."&lt;ref name=raymond1994 /&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|quote=|source=The surgeons and hormone therapists of the transsexual kingdom, in their effort to give birth, can be said to produce feminine persons. They cannot produce women. – Mary Daly&lt;ref name=Daly1990&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Mary|title=Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism|date=1990|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|isbn=978-0807014134|page=68|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=19%}}

Jeffreys was similarly outspoken in her criticisms of trans women, arguing that the feminine characteristics they were adopting are simply those that women must adopt to avoid punishment from the patriarchy. She believed trans women adopt [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] attributes that are enforced by the patriarchy and were political signifiers of the oppression of women.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys1990 /&gt;

[[Judith Butler]], despite being opposed to womyn-born womyn policies, is often used as an argument for them by modern second-wave feminists. Butler's ''Gender Trouble'' (1990) contained discussion of [[performativity]] versus performance, which second-wave feminists used to exclude trans women on account of their performativity through repetition of [[gender norm]]s, which is "real only to the extent that it is performed", which was used as a separator from experience.&lt;ref name=Disch2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Disch|first1=Lisa Jane|last2=Hawkesworth|first2=M. E.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_X8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA575|year=2016|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|page=575|oclc=967840756|isbn=978-0-19-932858-1|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olivia Records]], a feminist music collective, employed transgender employees, notably [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]].&lt;ref name=Vogel1977&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eminism.org/michigan/1977-lettertooliviarecords.pdf|title=Sister, June 1977 Letter|last=Vogel|first=Lisa|date=1977|website=Eminism Archives|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Michigan Womyn's Music Festival's primary owner in 1977, Lisa Vogel, issued a letter to the music collective along with other second wave feminists:
{{quote|Dear Olivia:

We are writing concerning your decision to employ Sandy Stone as your recording engineer and sound technician. We feel that it was and is irresponsible of you to have presented this person as a woman to the women’s community when in fact he is a post-operative transsexual.

Given the narrow options available to us, it is also likely that many of us would have to work with Stone. Some of us have already done so without the knowledge that this person was not a woman. When we did discover the truth about Stone and tried to discuss this with you, we were told that you considered him very much a woman, a lesbian, and that you trusted him more than middle class, heterosexual women. This was very painful to hear and indicated a great lack of respect and love for women and our struggle. We do not believe that a man without a penis is a woman any more than we would accept a white woman with dyed skin as a Black woman.&lt;ref name=Vogel1977 /&gt;}}

=== Women-only spaces ===
Throughout the final quarter of the twentieth century, [[women's music]] festivals often enacted womyn-born womyn policies. Although [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] people had been present in [[women-only space|"women-only spaces"]] for decades (usually [[closeted]] or [[passing (gender)|passing]]),{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} the term garnered wider attention in response to the exclusion of trans women from the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] (MichFest) after it was described as a gathering for "women born as women and living as women".&lt;ref name=vitello2006&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vitello|first1=Paul|title=The Trouble When Jane Becomes Jack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/fashion/20gender.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 20, 2006|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, a gender survey was taken at MichFest by Nancy Burkholder&lt;ref name=Taormino2000 /&gt; that asked, "Do you think male-to-female transsexuals should be welcome at Michigan?"&lt;ref name=Burkholder1992&gt;{{Cite web|last=Burkholder|first=Nancy|title=MWMF Anti-TS Awareness: 1992 Gender Survey Results|url=http://eminism.org/michigan/documents.html|website=Eminism.org|date=28 April 1993|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of approximately 7500 women present, 633 responded to the inquiry with 73.1% (463) responding "yes" and 22.6% (143) responding "no" (the margin of error was 3.8%). Although admitting that the sample was not "randomly selected", surveyors calculated the results as indicating that "less than 1 in 100,000" attendees would be against the exclusion of transsexual women from the festival; and while the replies about "female-to-male transsexuals" were not tabulated, it was determined that "80% of respondents were against their inclusion".&lt;ref name=Burkholder1992 /&gt; However, the presence of male-to-female transsexual people at MichFest was understood to exist.&lt;ref name=myths2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Myths and The Truth About the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|url=http://www.thetruthaboutthemichiganfestival.com|website=thetruthaboutthemichiganfestival.com|date=September 2014|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cogswell2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cogswell|first1=Kelly|title=Dyke-Baiting, Trans-Hating, and the MichFest Debacle|url=http://gaycitynews.nyc/dyke-baiting-trans-hating-michfest-debacle/|website=[[Gay City News]]|date=April 29, 2015|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[third-wave feminism]], objections to womyn-born womyn policies increased.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Many women-only music festivals also began to close. The RadFem Collective, which describes its membership as "restricted to 'women born women and living as women'", continues to promote womyn-born womyn policies.&lt;ref name=Kaveney2012&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kaveney|first= Roz|title=Radical feminists are acting like a cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/25/radical-feminism-trans-radfem2012?INTCMP=SRCH|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 May 2012|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement for the 2015 conference was rephrased in explanatory form to read "RadFems Resist is a women only, feminist event. Our conference is a space for women to share our experiences as women, to politically self organise for women's liberation and to celebrate womanhood in a safe environment. We welcome all women who were raised and socialized as girls to join us...We are gender abolitionists who have been raised and socialized as girls and women *because of our female bodies* in the context of patriarchy."&lt;ref name=RadFems2015&gt;{{Cite web|title=RadFems Resist 2015|url=http://www.radfemcollective.org/upcoming-events/radfemsresist2015|website=RadFem Collective|date=2015|accessdate= February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 40 years, the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival held its last event in 2015.&lt;ref name=dearsisters2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|title=Dear Sisters, Amazon, Festival family|url=https://www.facebook.com/michfest/posts/10153186431364831|website=[[Facebook]]|date=April 21, 2015|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This final gathering followed the withdrawal of support by the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]], [[National LGBTQ Task Force]], and ''The TransAdvocate'' [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] website, of a boycott petition against MichFest and its womyn-born womyn intention.&lt;ref name=Ring2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|title=This Year's Michigan Womyn's Music Festival Will Be the Last|url=https://www.advocate.com/michfest/2015/04/21/years-michigan-womyns-music-festival-will-be-last|website=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=April 21, 2015|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other instances where transgender women have been denied access to, or been evicted from, women's spaces; for example, the [[Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter]] and [[Mountain Moving Coffeehouse]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Third-wave feminism ==
The [[feminist sex wars]] signaled a divide in second-wave feminism on issues of sex expression, pornography, sexuality, and gender identity. It led to many trans-affirming feminist views, and more criticism toward the womyn-born womyn culture that thrived in [[radical feminism]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} With the rise of [[third-wave feminism]], the radical feminism that supports womyn-born womyn policies and agendas became less prevalent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Judith Butler]] was characteristic in her approach to third-wave feminist opposition of womyn-born womyn politics. The fluidity in gender, a more modern adaptation in feminist thought, is reflected in her views, "We form ourselves within the vocabularies that we did not choose, and sometimes we have to reject those vocabularies, or actively develop new ones.  For instance, gender assignment is a 'construction' and yet many [[genderqueer]] and trans people refuse those assignments in part or in full.  That refusal opens the way for a more radical form of self-determination, one that happens in solidarity with others who are undergoing a similar struggle."&lt;ref name=TERF2014&gt;{{Cite web|last=Admin|url=http://theterfs.com/2014/05/01/judith-butler-addresses-terfs-and-the-work-of-sheila-jeffreys-and-janice-raymond/|title=Judith Butler addresses TERFs and the work of Sheila Jeffreys and Janice Raymond|website=The TERFs|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in response to claims by Jeffreys and others of the time who believed that those born womyn embodied true patriarchal struggle, while transgender women still benefited from the patriarchy. In a more direct reaction from Butler, she states, "The feminist police comes along to expose the construction and dispute a trans person's sense of their lived reality. I oppose this use of social construction absolutely, and consider it to be a false, misleading, and oppressive use of the theory."&lt;ref name=TERF2014 /&gt; Some prominent figures in the second wave also readjusted views when presented with changing times, such as [[Gloria Steinem]], who previously referred to transgender women as men with mutilated bodies in the late 1970s, and has since revised her beliefs as stated in a 2013 opinion piece: "I believe that transgender people, including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned."&lt;ref name=Steinem2013&gt;{{Cite web|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/10/02/op-ed-working-together-over-time|title=Op-ed: On Working Together Over Time|website=The Advocate|date= 2 October 2013|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transfeminism ===
The understanding of gender, gender politics, and [[transfeminism|trans politics]] has changed over the latter half of the twentieth century and  has led to more [[LGBT|LGBTQ]]-led opposition to womyn-born womyn policies and the music festivals that tend to employ them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Kelsie Brynn Jones, a transgender woman and advocate, wrote that "in [radical feminists'] words, a transgender woman is a ''[sic]'' nothing but a 'self loathing gay man' and they claim that trans women are gay men who, rather than stand up and come out as gay, would rather 'hide' by being transgender, as if it makes things more palatable for friends, family and co-workers."&lt;ref name=Jones2014&gt;{{Cite web|last=Jones|first=Kelsie Brynn|title=Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism: What Exactly Is It, And Why Does It Hurt|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kelsie-brynn-jones/transexclusionary-radical-terf_b_5632332.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=August 2, 2014|accessdate= February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists for transgender-inclusionary policies often refer to those who promote womyn-born womyn policies as [[Feminist views on transgender topics#The term "TERF"|TERFs]], an acronym meaning "Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists".&lt;ref name=TERF2013&gt;{{Cite web|last=Admin|url=http://theterfs.com/|title= Rad Fem ≠ TERF|website=TheTERFs.com|date=March 2013|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Camp Trans ====
In 1991, Nancy Burkholder was kicked out of the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival for being transgender.&lt;ref name=Taormino2000&gt;{{Cite web|last=Taormino|first=Tristan|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/trouble-in-utopia-6417677|title=Trouble in Utopia|website=Village Voice|date=September 12, 2000|access-date=2016-03-23|archiveurl=https://archive.is/gdXp|archivedate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With support from the [[Lesbian Avengers]], she and other activists, specifically transgender women, created [[Camp Trans]] in 1992 to stage protests outside of the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival against its womyn-born womyn policy.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Transgender supporters passed out flyers and held workshops across the road from the festival.&lt;ref name=Taormino2000 /&gt; Transgender activist [[Julia Serano]] described the festival as insensitive and ignorant: "[The] idea that the femaleness of my mind, personality, lived experiences, and the rest of my body can somehow be trumped by the mere presence of a penis can only be described as phallocentric."&lt;ref name=Serano2007&gt;{{Cite book|last=Serano|first=Julia|title=Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|publisher=Seal Press|year=2007|location=|page=|isbn=978-1580051545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activist [[Riki Wilchins]] noted that Camp Trans "was the first time that significant numbers of the hard-core lesbian feminist community backed us”.
