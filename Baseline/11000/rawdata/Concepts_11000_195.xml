[[File:kilnerfig.jpg|thumb|200px|Representation of a human aura, after a diagram by [[Walter John Kilner]] (1847–1920).]]

An '''aura''' or '''human energy field''' is, according to [[New Age]] beliefs, a colored emanation said to enclose a human body or any animal or object.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=857}} In some esoteric positions, the aura is described as a [[subtle body]].{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=55}} [[Psychics]] and holistic medicine practitioners often claim to have the ability to see the size, color and type of vibration of an aura.{{sfn|Hines|2002|p=427}}

In New Age [[alternative medicine]], the human aura is seen as a hidden anatomy that affect the health of a client, and is often understood to comprise centers of vital force called [[chakra]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=857}} Such claims are not supported by [[scientific evidence]] and are [[pseudoscience]].{{sfn|Hines|2002|pp=362–69}} When tested under [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]], the ability to see auras has not been shown to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scheiber|first1=Béla|last2=Selby|first2=Carla|title=Therapeutic Touch|date=2000|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=1573928046|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]], ''aura'' means wind, breeze or breath. It was used in [[Middle English]] to mean "gentle breeze". By the end of the 19th century, the word was used in some spiritualist circles to describe a speculated subtle emanation around the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=aura |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marques|first1=A.|title=The Human Aura: A Study|publisher=Office of Mercury|pages=1–2 and preface|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Jj9DAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Charles Webster Leadbeater.019.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] is credited with developing and popularizing the concept of auras.]]
The concept of auras was first popularized by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], a former priest of the Church of England and a member of the mystic [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=686}} Leadbeater had studied [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] in India, and believed he had the capacity to use his clairvoyant powers to make scientific investigations.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=193}} He claimed that he had discovered that most men come from Mars but the more advanced men come from the Moon, and that [[hydrogen]] atoms are made of six bodies contained in an egg-like form.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=220–22}} In his book ''Man Visible and Invisible'' published in 1903, Leadbeater illustrated the aura of man at various stages of his moral evolution, from the "savage" to the [[saint]].{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=235}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leadbeater|first1=Charles Webster|title=Man Visible and Invisible: Examples of Different Types of Men as Seen by Means of Trained Clairvoyance|date=2012|publisher=New Theosophical Press|isbn=9781471747038|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMTJAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Leadbeater introduced the modern conception of auras by incorporating the [[Tantra|Tantric]] notion of [[chakra]]s in his book ''The Inner Life''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=183}} But Leadbeater didn’t simply present the Tantric beliefs to the West, he reconstructed and reinterpreted them by mixing them with his own ideas, without acknowledging the sources of these innovations. Some of Leadbeater’s innovations are describing chakras as energy vortexes, and associating each of them with a gland, an organ and other body parts.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=184–87}}

In the following years, Leadbeater’s ideas on the aura and chakras where adopted and reinterpreted by other Theosophists such as [[Rudolf Steiner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=Rudolf|last2=Creeger|first2=Catherine E.|title=Theosophy: An Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and in the Cosmos|date=1994|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|location=Hudson, New York|isbn=0880103736|page=159|edition=3rd|url=https://steiner.presswarehouse.com/sites/steiner/research/archive/theosophy/theosophy.pdf|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edgar Cayce]], but his occult anatomy remained of minor interest within the esoteric counterculture until the 1980s, when it was picked up by the New Age movement.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=187}}

In 1977, American esotericist [[Christopher Hills]] published the book ''Nuclear Evolution: The Rainbow Body'', which presented a modified version of Leadbeater’s occult anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hills|first1=Christopher|title=Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body|date=1977|publisher=University of the Trees Press|location=Boulder Creek, California|isbn=9780916438098|page=36|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=bXRWAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Leadbeater had drawn each chakras with intricately detailed shapes and multiple colors, Hills presented them as a sequence of centers, each one being associated with a color of the rainbow. Most of the subsequent New Age writers will base their representations of the aura on Hill’s interpretation of Leadbeater’s ideas.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=188}} Chakras became a part of mainstream esoteric speculations in the 1980s and 1990s. Many New Age techniques that aim to clear blockages of the chakras were developed during those years, such as [[crystal healing]] and aura-soma.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=92}} Chakras were, by the late 1990s, less connected with their theosophical  and Hinduist root, and more infused with New Age ideas. A variety of New Age books proposed different links between each chakras and colors, personality traits, illnesses, Christian sacraments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myss|first1=Caroline|title=Anatomy of the Spirit: The Seven Stages of Power and Healing|date=1997|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|isbn=9780609800140|page=71|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=NmwwRCv52SAC|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=189}} Various type of holistic healing within the New Age movement claim to use aura reading techniques, such as [[bioenergetic analysis]], [[energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] and [[energy medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brennan|first1=Barbara Ann|title=Hands of Light: A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field|date=1988|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0553345397|pages=109–10|edition=Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?output=html_text&amp;id=M3dOAgz05bQC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Character+structure |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Kirlian photography}}
There have been numerous attempts to capture an energy field around the human body, going as far back as photographs by a French army officer in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baraduc|first1=Hippolyte|title=L'ame humaine: ses mouvements, ses lumières et l'iconographie de l'invisible fluidique|date=1896|publisher=G. Carré|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tD8wAAAAYAAJ|page=61|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supernatural interpretations of these images have often been the result of a lack of understanding of the simple natural phenomena behind them, such as heat emanating from a human body producing aura-like images under [[infrared photography]].&lt;ref name=Nickell&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Nickell |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/aura_photography_a_candid_shot/ |title=Aura Photography: A Candid Shot  |publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baraducforcevital.tif|thumb|left|150px|Picture by Hippolyte Baraduc published in 1896, purported to show a "vital force" around a child.]]
In 1939, [[Semyon Davidovich Kirlian]] discovered that by placing an object or body part directly on photographic paper, and then passing a high voltage across the object, he would obtain the image of a glowing contour surrounding the object. This process became known as [[Kirlian photography]].{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=240–43}} Some parapsychologists, such as [[Thelma Moss]] of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], have proposed that these images show levels of psychic powers and bioenergies. However, studies have found that the Kirlian effect is caused by the presence of moisture on the object being photographed. Electricity produces an area of gas ionization around the object if it is moist, which is the case for living things. This causes an alternation of the electric charge pattern on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pehek|first1=JO|last2=Kyler|first2=HJ|last3=Faust|first3=DL|title=Image modulation in corona discharge photography |journal=Science |date=15 October 1976|volume=194|issue=4262|pages=263–70|pmid=968480}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rigorous experimentations, no mysterious process has been discovered in relation to the Kirlian photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=edited by Kendrick|title=The Hundredth monkey and other paradigms of the paranormal : a Skeptical inquirer collection|date=1991|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, New York|isbn=0879756551|pages=209–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hines|2002|pp=427–28}}

More recent attempts at capturing auras include the Aura Imaging cameras and software introduced by Guy Coggins in 1992. Coggins claims that his software uses [[biofeedback]] data to color the picture of the subject. The technique has failed to yield reproducible results.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;

==Tests==
[[File:Aura_testing.jpg|thumb|right|An aura reader tested in a [[Scientific control|controlled experiment]] at the [[Observatoire Zététique]], May 2004]]

Tests of psychic abilities to observe alleged aura emanations have repeatedly been met with failure.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;

One test involved placing people in a dark room and asking the psychic to state how many auras she could observe. Only chance results were obtained.&lt;ref name="Loftin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftin|first1=Robert W.|title=Auras: Searching for the Light|journal=The Skeptical Inquirer|date=1990|volume=24|pages=403–09|publisher=Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of auras has occasionally been tested on television. One test involved an ''aura reader'' standing on one side of a room with an opaque partition separating her from a number of slots which might contain either actual people or mannequins. The aura reader failed to identify the slots containing people, incorrectly stating that all contained people.&lt;ref name=skepdic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/auras.html |title= Auras|accessdate=2006-12-15|work=The Skeptic's Dictionary| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061205221945/http://skepdic.com/auras.html| archivedate= 5 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another televised test another aura reader was placed before a partition where five people were standing. He claimed that he could see their auras from behind the partition. As each person moved out, the reader was asked to identify where that person was standing behind the slot. He identified 2 out of 5 correctly.&lt;ref name=Randi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZeQGld5QBU |title=James Randi tests an aura reader|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to prove the existence of auras scientifically have repeatedly met with failure; for example people are unable to see auras in complete darkness, and auras have never been successfully used to identify people when their identifying features are otherwise obscured in controlled tests.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loftin/&gt;&lt;ref name=skepdic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Randi/&gt; A 1999 study concluded that conventional sensory cues such as radiated body heat might be mistaken for evidence of a metaphysical phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Bernhardt/publication/230683042_Perception_of_Conventional_Sensory_Cues_as_an_Alternative_to_the_Postulated'Human_Energy_Field'of_Therapeutic_Touch/links/55eda87108aedecb68fb074e.pdf |title=Perception of Conventional Sensory Cues as an Alternative to the Postulated'Human Energy Field'of Therapeutic Touch (PDF Download Available) |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine.|year=1999|issue=Fall/Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific explanation==

Bridgette Perez in a review for the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' has written "perceptual distortions, illusions, and hallucinations might promote belief in auras... Psychological factors, including absorption, fantasy proneness, vividness of visual imagery, and after-images, might also be responsible for the phenomena of the aura."&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bridgette M. Perez |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_aura_a_brief_review/ |title=The Aura: A Brief Review  |publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in laboratory conditions have demonstrated that the aura is best explained as a visual illusion known as an [[afterimage]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Harris, D. F. (1932). ''A psycho physiological explanation of the so-called human "aura"''.  British Journal of Medical Psychology 12: 174–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale, A., Anderson, D. &amp; Wyman, L. (1978).  ''Perceptual Aura: Not Spirit but Afterimage and Border Contrast Effects''.  ''[[Perceptual and Motor Skills]]'' 47: 653–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Neurologists contend that people may perceive auras because of effects within the brain: [[epilepsy]], [[migraine]]s, or the influence of [[psychedelic drugs]] such as [[LSD]].&lt;ref name="ASID"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Donna L|last2=Daroff|first2=Robert B|last3=Ducros|first3=Anne|last4=Newman|first4=Nancy J|last5=Biousse|first5=Valérie|title=Most Cases Labeled as "Retinal Migraine" Are Not Migraine|journal=Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology|date=March 2007|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–8|doi=10.1097/WNO.0b013e3180335222|url=http://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2007&amp;issue=03000&amp;article=00002&amp;type=abstract|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fole"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/23/1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015956/http://neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/23/1995 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |title=Familial occipitotemporal lobe epilepsy and migraine with visual aura |publisher=Neurology.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Andrew Neher has written that "there is no good evidence to support the notion that auras are, in any way, psychic in origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neher|first1=Andrew|title=The Psychology of Transcendence|date=1990|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0486261670|pages=186–88|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that auras may be the result of [[synaesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/auras.html |title=auras – The Skeptic's Dictionary |publisher=Skepdic.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2012 study discovered no link between auras and synaesthesia, concluding "the discrepancies found suggest that both phenomena are phenomenologically and behaviourally dissimilar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milán|first1=E.G.|last2=Iborra|first2=O.|last3=Hochel|first3=M.|last4=Rodríguez Artacho|first4=M.A.|last5=Delgado-Pastor|first5=L.C.|last6=Salazar|first6=E.|last7=González-Hernández|first7=A.|title=Auras in Mysticism and Synaesthesia: A Comparison|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=March 2012|volume=21|issue=1|pages=258–68|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2011.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical neurologist [[Steven Novella]] has written "Given the weight of the evidence it seems that the connection between auras and synaesthesia is speculative and based on superficial similarities that are likely coincidental."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novella |first=Steven |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/05/07/is-aura-reading-synaesthesia-probably-not/ |title=Is Aura Reading Synaesthesia? Probably Not |publisher=Skepticblog |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes may include disorders within the [[visual system]] provoking optical effects.

==In popular culture==
* The book ''[[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]]'', written by Cyril Henry Hoskin under the pseudonym [[Lobsang Rampa]], claims that Tibetan monks opened the spiritual third eye using [[trepanation]] in order to accelerate the development of clairvoyance and allow to see the aura. It also includes body gazing techniques purported to help achieve aura visualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rampa|first1=Lobsang|title=The Third Eye|date=1988|publisher=Ballantine|location=New York|isbn=9780345340382|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is considered to be a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yapp|first1=Nick|title=Hoaxers and Their Victims|date=1993|publisher=Parkwest|location=London|isbn=9780860517818|pages=140–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodin|first1=Thierry|title=Imagining Tibet: Perceptions, Projections, and Fantasies|date=2001|publisher=Wisdom Publishing|location=Boston|isbn=9780861711918|pages=196–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4695">In [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kaśmir Śaivism]] the world is described as being composed of four spheres ('''{{IAST|aṇḍa}}''') that contain a series of phenomenal elements ([[tattva]]). The four ''{{IAST|aṇḍa}}'' are described to appear by the means of the internal abundance of [[Shiva|Śiva]]'s divine powers.&lt;ref&gt;Essence of the Exact Reality or Paramārthasāra of Abhinavagupta, B.N. Pandit, 1991, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the four {{IAST|aṇḍa}} is [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Biva|Śiva tattva]] which is the substrate and essential nature of all the other tattvas.

=={{IAST|Śakti aṇḍa}}==
Projected by the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], '''{{IAST|Śakti aṇḍa}}''' is the first step of creation. Also called ''the pure creation'' because at this level the divine nature of [[Śiva]] is not obscured, it manifests a state of diversity in unity. The divine powers ([[Śakti]]) gradually descend from ''Ānanda Śakti'' (bliss) to ''Icchā Śakti'' (the power of will), ''Jñāna Śakti'' (the power of knowledge) and ''Kriyā Śakti'' (the power of action), at the same time creating the basis for the dual creation. At this stage, though, the duality is only "in concept"; there is no actual division or limitation yet. This ''{{IAST|aṇḍa}}'' contains [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Bakti|Śakti tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#sad.C4.81.C5.9Biva|Sadāśiva tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#.C4.AB.C5.9Bvara|Iśvara tattva]] and [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Buddha vidy.C4.81|Śuddha-vidyā tattva]] (all the pure tattvas except the first one, [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Biva|Śiva tattva]]).

=={{IAST|Māyā aṇḍa}}==
The ''sphere of [[Maya (illusion)|Māyā]]'' causes the divine nature and purity that exists in {{IAST|Śakti aṇḍa}} to be forgotten. The divine creation is covered with five limitations (''kañcuka'') that make the infinite, eternal, perfect in itself, all knowing and all powerful nature of [[God]], as manifested first in the ''{{IAST|Śakti Aṇḍa}}'', appear limited in space ([[The 36 tattvas#niyati - spatial limitation|Niyati tattva]]) and time ([[The 36 tattvas#k.C4.81la - limitation in time|Kāla tattva]]), incomplete ([[The 36 tattvas#r.C4.81ga - incompleteness.2C the limitation of desire|Rāga tattva]]), with limited knowledge ([[The 36 tattvas#vidy.C4.81 - the limitation of knowledge|Aśuddha-vidyā tattva]]) and power of action ([[The 36 tattvas#kal.C4.81 - limitation in power|Kalā tattva]]). This {{IAST|aṇḍa}} contains seven tattvas, from [[The 36 tattvas#m.C4.81y.C4.81 - the origin of illusion and duality|Māyā tattva]] to [[The 36 tattvas#puru.E1.B9.A3a|{{IAST|Puruṣa tattva}}]].&lt;ref name="Tantric Mysticism page 103"/&gt;

=={{IAST|Prakṛti aṇḍa}}==
'''{{IAST|Prakṛti aṇḍa}}''' describes the world as it is perceived from the common human level of consciousness. It contains the śakti of the individual soul ({{IAST|puruṣa}}): [[The 36 tattvas#prakṛti tattva|{{IAST|Prakṛti tattva}}]], the intellect ([[The 36 tattvas#buddhi - the intellect|Buddhi tattva]]), the ego ([[The 36 tattvas#aha.E1.B9.83k.C4.81ra - the empirical ego|Ahamkāra tattva]]), the sensory mind ([[The 36 tattvas#manas - the lower mind|Manas tattva]]), the five sense organs ([[The 36 tattvas#The five j.C3.B1.C4.81nendriyas - sense organs|Jñānendriya]]), the five organs of action ([[The 36 tattvas#The five karmendriyas - organs of action|Karmendriya]]), the five subtle essences ([[The 36 tattvas#The five tanm.C4.81tras - subtle mediums of the sensations|Tanmātra]]) and the last four physical elements ([[The 36 tattvas#The five mah.C4.81bh.C5.ABtas|Mahābhutā]]) : [[The 36 tattvas#.C4.81k.C4.81.C5.9Ba - ether|Ākāśa tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#v.C4.81yu - air|Vāyu tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#tejas - fire|Tejas tattva]] and [[The 36 tattvas#jala - water|Jala tattva]].&lt;ref name="Tantric Mysticism page 103"/&gt;

=={{IAST|Pṛthvī aṇḍa}}==
'''{{IAST|Pṛthvī aṇḍa}}''' is the terminal point of creation&amp;nbsp;– solid matter. There is only one tattva in this sphere: [[The 36 tattvas#p.E1.B9.9Bithv.C4.AB - earth|{{IAST|Pṛthivi tattva}}]]. This tattva has a special statute because it contains in essence all the other tattvas and is the home of [[Kundalini energy|{{IAST|Kuṇḍalinī Śakti}}]].&lt;ref name="Tantric Mysticism page 103"/&gt;

'''Basic hostility''' is a [[psychological]] concept first described by psychoanalyst [[Karen Horney]]. Horney described it as a bad attitude which child develops as a result of "basic evil". Horney generally defines ''basic evil'' as "invariably the lack of genuine warmth and affection".&lt;ref&gt;Horney, Karen. The neurotic personality of our time. WW Norton &amp; Company, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Basic evil includes all range of inappropriate parental behavior&amp;nbsp;– from lack of affection to [[child abuse|abuse]]

==The pattern of basic hostility==
* The child wants to leave, but cannot. Although the child wants to avoid the abuse, his parents are perpetrating it.
* The child cannot move away or fight back against his parents because he is dependent on them.
* The child therefore redirects his feelings and expressions of hostility toward people he does not depend on for support.

According to Horney, some children find Basic Hostility to be an aggressive coping strategy and continue using it to deal with life's problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6166">The '''Carltona doctrine''' (or '''Carltona principle''') expresses the idea that, in [[United Kingdom law]], the acts of government departmental officials are synonymous with the actions of the [[Minister (government)|minister]] in charge of that department. The point was established in ''Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works.''&lt;ref&gt;[1943] 2 All ER 560 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The judgment in ''Carltona''==

Faced with the requisition of their factory by the war-time government, the factory owners raised a [[Judicial Review in English Law|judicial review]] action to challenge the legality of the requisition order. The order had been made under the auspices of the Defence (General) Regulations 1939, which authorised the Commissioners of Works to requisition such land as they deemed necessary in the national interest. The Regulations specified that the Commissioner's powers were exercisable by, ''inter alia'' the Minister of Works and Planning. The factory owners sought to argue that the requisition was invalid because the order had not in fact been signed by the minister, but by an official within the Ministry of Works and Planning. In rejecting this contention, the [[Master of the Rolls]], [[Lord Greene]], acknowledged the realities of [[government]] in the 20th century:

{{Quotation|
"In the administration of government in this country the functions which are given to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers because they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no minister could ever personally attend to them...[therefore] The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case."}}

This statement of the way government operates has only become more true in recent decades as increased state interventionism and juridification have produced a rapid growth in the use of [[delegated legislation]]. Clearly, confronted with this reality, it would have been preposterous for the Court to construe the wording of the Regulations so narrowly that only the Minister, in person, could exercise the powers. Thus Lord Greene explained that:

{{Quotation|
"Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister."}}

It should be emphasised that the essence of the ''Carltona'' doctrine therefore lies in the elision of the identity of departmental officials with the relevant Minister. It is emphatically not the case that the Minister has delegated his decision-making power to a subordinate and therefore the doctrine achieves consistency with the principle that Parliament's delegatees have, unless specifically provided by statute, no power to delegate ([[Delegata potestas non potest delegari|''delegatus non potest delegare'']]).

Lord Greene proceeded to reconcile this with the doctrine of parliamentary accountability on the basis that:

{{Quotation|
"It is he [the minister] who must answer before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that ministers, being responsible to Parliament, will see that important duties are committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the place where complaint must be made against them."}}

==Scope of the rule==

Despite suggestions to the contrary by some academic commentators,&lt;ref&gt;De Smith, Woolf and Jowell ''Judicial Review of Administrative Action'' (5th edn.) para. 6-114&lt;/ref&gt; it seems that there is no restriction on the applicability of the doctrine on account of the nature of the power being wielded. In ''HMA v. Copeland''&lt;ref&gt;1988 SLT 249&lt;/ref&gt; it was opined, by the [[High Court of Justiciary|highest criminal court in Scotland]] that:

{{Quotation|
" ...there is no obligation on the minister to exercise his powers personally even when those powers involve a serious invasion of the freedom or property rights of the subject."
}}

However, in some instances Parliament has chosen to statutorily override this position by providing that the relevant minister must exercise the power in person.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. s.60(9)(a) Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (c.33) ("and not by a person acting under his authority") [https://archive.is/20120805181602/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;Year=1999&amp;number=33&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1888846&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1888933&amp;filesize=7868]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland ==

The [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] has confirmed that the Carltona doctrine applies to its fullest extent to the Irish civil service also- see ''Devanney v'' ''Shields'' [1998] 2 I.R. 230.

{{Certainty}}
'''Certainty''' is perfect [[knowledge]] that has total security from error, or the mental state of being without [[doubt]].

Objectively defined, certainty is total continuity and validity of all [[foundationalism|foundational]] inquiry, to the highest degree of precision. Something is certain only if no [[skepticism]] can occur. [[Philosophy]] (at least, historical [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] philosophy) seeks this state.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==History==

===Pyrrho – ancient Greece===
{{Main|Pyrrho|l1=Pyrrho}}

Pyrrho is credited as being the first Skeptic philosopher.
The main principle of Pyrrho's thought is expressed by the word [[acatalepsia]], which denotes the ability to withhold assent from doctrines regarding the truth of things in their own nature; against every statement its contradiction may be advanced with equal justification. Secondly, it is necessary in view of this fact to preserve an attitude of intellectual suspense, or, as Timon expressed it, no assertion can be known to be better than another.

===Ibn-Rushd – Averroes===
{{Main|Ibn Rushd}}
Averroes was a purveyor of certain parts of Aristotelian philosophy. His philosophy was considered controversial in Muslim circles.&lt;ref name="philosophybasics. com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_averroes.html |title=Averroës (Ibn Rushd) &gt; By Individual Philosopher &gt; Philosophy |publisher=Philosophybasics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in West with thinkers like St. Thomas Aquinas who said of Averroes, "the Arabian commentator as one who had, indeed, perverted the Peripatetic tradition, but whose words, nevertheless, should be treated with respect and consideration." Averroes' contribution to epistemology is only noted for the fact that he was one of the first to write on the topic and acted as a comparison for the traditional and definitive works of the Western tradition.{{cite web |url=https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/averroes |title=Averroes |last=Turner |first=William |website=Catholic Answers |publisher=Catholic Answers |access-date= February 28, 2018}}

===Descartes – 17th century===
[[Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' is a book in which Descartes first discards all belief in things which are not absolutely certain, and then tries to establish what can be known for sure. Although the phrase "[[Cogito, ergo sum]]" is often attributed to Descartes' ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', it is actually put forward in his ''Discourse on Method''. Due to the implications of inferring the conclusion within the predicate, however, he changed the argument to "I think, I exist"; this then became his first certainty.

===Ludwig Wittgenstein – 20th century===
''[[On Certainty]]'' is a series of notes made by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] just prior to his death. The main theme of the work is that [[Context (language use)|context]] plays a role in epistemology. Wittgenstein asserts an [[anti-foundationalism|anti-foundationalist]] message throughout the work: that every claim can be doubted but certainty is possible in a framework. "The function [propositions] serve in language is to serve as a kind of framework within which empirical propositions can make sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/wittgenstein/section4.rhtml |title=On Certainty |authorlink=Ludwig Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |publisher=[[SparkNotes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degrees of certainty==
{{see also|Inductive reasoning|Probability interpretations|Philosophy of statistics}}

Physicist [[Lawrence M. Krauss]] suggests that the need for identifying degrees of certainty is under-appreciated in various domains, including policy making and the understanding of science. This is because different goals require different degrees of certainty—and politicians are not always aware of (or do not make it clear) how much certainty we are working with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=edge.com |title= question center, SHAs – cognitive tools |url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Carnap]] viewed certainty as a matter of degree ("degrees of certainty") which could be [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] measured, with degree one being certainty. [[Bayesian analysis]] derives degrees of certainty which are interpreted as a measure of [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[psychological]] [[belief]].

Alternatively, one might use the [[Legal burden of proof|legal degrees of certainty]]. These standards of evidence ascend as follows: no credible evidence, some credible evidence, a preponderance of evidence, clear and convincing evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, and beyond any shadow of a doubt (i.e. ''undoubtable''—recognized as an impossible standard to meet—which serves only to terminate the list).

==Foundational crisis of mathematics==
{{Main|Foundations of mathematics#Foundational crisis}}
The ''foundational crisis of mathematics'' was the early 20th century's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics.

After several schools of the [[philosophy of mathematics]] ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century, the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be stated within [[mathematics]] itself began to be heavily challenged.

One attempt after another to provide unassailable foundations for mathematics was found to suffer from various [[paradox]]es (such as [[Russell's paradox]]) and to be [[consistency proof|inconsistent]].

Various schools of thought were opposing each other. The leading school was that of the [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] approach, of which [[David Hilbert]] was the foremost proponent, culminating in what is known as [[Hilbert's program]], which sought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a [[formal system]] proved sound by [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] [[finitism|finitistic]] means. The main opponent was the [[intuitionist]] school, led by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]], which resolutely discarded formalism as a meaningless game with symbols.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The fight was acrimonious. In 1920 Hilbert succeeded in having Brouwer, whom he considered a threat to mathematics, removed from the editorial board of ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'', the leading mathematical journal of the time.

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], proved in 1931, showed that essential aspects of Hilbert's program could not be attained. In [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s first result he showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent finitely axiomatizable system—such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of [[arithmetic]]—a statement that can be shown to be true, but that does not follow from the rules of the system. It thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in Hilbert's program. In a next result Gödel showed that such a system was not powerful enough for proving its own consistency, let alone that a simpler system could do the job. This dealt a final blow to the heart of Hilbert's program, the hope that consistency could be established by finitistic means (it was never made clear exactly what axioms were the "finitistic" ones, but whatever axiomatic system was being referred to, it was a ''weaker'' system than the system whose consistency it was supposed to prove). Meanwhile, the intuitionistic school had failed to attract adherents among working mathematicians, and floundered due to the difficulties of doing mathematics under the constraint of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]].

In a sense, the crisis has not been resolved, but faded away: most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the consistency of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the various logical paradoxes never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do (such as [[mathematical logic|logic]] and [[category theory]]), they may be avoided.

'''Colin Crouch''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (born 1944) is an English [[Sociology|sociologist]] and [[Political science|political scientist]]. He coined the [[post-democracy]] concept in 2000 in his book ''[[Coping with Post-Democracy]]''. Colin Crouch is currently Emeritus Professor at the [[University of Warwick]] and an External Scientific Member of the [[Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies]].

== Biography ==
Crouch gained his BA at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]] and his doctorate at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]]. In 1969, Crouch started as a lecturer in sociology at the London School of Economics.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.debretts.co.uk/people/biographies/browse/c/8264/Colin%20John%20CROUCH.aspx Prof. Colin Crouch's biography] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131208135859/http://www.debretts.co.uk/people/biographies/browse/c/8264/Colin%20John%20CROUCH.aspx |date=8 December 2013 }} on Debrett's site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;
From 1972 to 1973 he was a Lecturer at the [[University of Bath]]. From 1973 to 1985 he was Lecturer and Reader in Sociology at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]].

==Post Democracy==

Crouch coined the term "[[post-democracy]]" in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that are conducted by fully operating [[Democracy|democratic system]]s (elections are being held, governments fall and there is [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small elite is making the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''&lt;ref&gt;Colin Crouch. [http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&amp;title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] [[Policy Network]] , 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''. The term appeared to define a running evolution within democracies during the 21st century and is [[polemic]]al because it calls attention to recognized democracies losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}
'''Custom''' in [[law]] is the established pattern of behavior that can be objectively verified within a particular social setting. A claim can be carried out in defense of "what has always been done and accepted by law." Related is the idea of '''prescription'''; a right enjoyed through long custom rather than positive law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/prescription "Prescription"], The Free Dictionary by Farlex. Accessed: June 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Customary law''' (also, '''consuetudinary''' or '''unofficial law''') exists where:  
#a certain legal practice is observed and
#the relevant actors consider it to be law (''[[opinio juris]]'').

Most customary laws deal with ''standards of community'' that have been long-established in a given locale. However the term can also apply to areas of [[international law]] where certain standards have been nearly [[Universal jurisdiction|universal]] in their acceptance as correct bases of action &amp;ndash; in example, laws against [[piracy]] or [[slavery]] (see ''[[hostis humani generis]]''). In many, though not all instances, customary laws will have supportive court rulings and case law that has evolved over time to give additional weight to their rule as law and also to demonstrate the trajectory of evolution (if any) in the interpretation of such law by relevant courts.

==Nature, definition and sources of customary law==
A central issue regarding the recognition of custom is determining the appropriate methodology to know what practices and norms actually constitutes customary law. It is not immediately clear that classic Western theories of jurisprudence can be reconciled in any useful way with conceptual analyses of customary law, and thus some scholars (like John Comaroff and Simon Roberts)&lt;ref name=cr&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts.&lt;/ref&gt; have characterised customary law norms in their own terms.  Yet, there clearly remains some disagreement, which is seen in John Hund's critique of Comaroff and Roberts' theory, and preference for the contributions of [[H. L. A. Hart]]. Hund argues that Hart's [[H. L. A. Hart#The Concept of Law|''The Concept of Law'']] solves the conceptual problem with which scholars who have attempted to articulate how customary law principles may be identified, defined and how they operate in regulating social behaviour and resolving disputes.&lt;ref name=hund&gt;Hund.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customary law as an indefinite repertoire of norms ===
Comaroff and Roberts' famous work, "Rules and Processes",&lt;ref name=cr/&gt; attempted to detail the body of norms that constitute [[Tswana people|Tswana]] law in a way that was less legalistic (or rule-oriented) than had Isaac Schapera. They defined "mekgwa le melao ya Setswana" in terms of Casalis and Ellenberger definition: ''melao'' therefore being rules pronounced by a chief and ''mekgwa'' as norms that become customary law through traditional usage.&lt;ref name=cr70&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 70&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, however, they noted that the Tswana seldom attempt to classify the vast array of existing norms into categories&lt;ref name=cr70/&gt; and they thus termed this the 'undifferentiated nature of the normative repertoire'. Moreover, they observe the co-existence of overtly incompatible norms that may breed conflict, either due to circumstances in a particular situation, or inherently due to their incongruous content.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 73&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of rule classification and failure to eradicate internal inconsistencies between potentially conflicting norms allows for much flexibility in dispute settlement and is also viewed as a 'strategic resource' for disputants who seek to advance their own success in a case. The latter incongruities (especially of inconsistencies of norm content) are typically solved by elevating one of the norms (tacitly) from 'the literal to the symbolic'.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 75&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the accommodation of both as they now theoretically exist in different realms of reality. This is highly contextual, which further illustrates that norms cannot be viewed in isolation and are open to negotiation. Thus, although there are a small number of so-called non-negotiable norms, the vast majority are viewed and given substance contextually, which is seen as fundamental to the Tswana.

Comaroff and Roberts describe how outcomes of specific cases have the ability to change the normative repertoire, as the repertoire of norms is seen to be both in a state of formation and transformation at all times.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 79&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are justified on the grounds that they are merely giving recognition to de facto observations of transformation [219]. Furthermore, the legitimacy of a chief is a direct determinant of the legitimacy of his decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 81&lt;/ref&gt; In the formulation of legislative pronouncements, as opposed to decisions made in dispute resolution,&lt;ref name=cr82&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 82&lt;/ref&gt; the chief first speaks of the proposed norm with his advisors, then council of headmen, then the public assembly debate the proposed law and may accept or reject it. A chief can proclaim the law even if the public assembly rejects it, but this is not often done; and, if the chief proclaims the legislation against the will of the public assembly, the legislation will become melao, however it is unlikely that it will be executed because its effectiveness depends on the chief's legitimacy and the norm's consistency with the practices (and changes in social relations) and will of the people under that chief.&lt;ref name=cr82/&gt;

Regarding the invocation of norms in disputes, Comaroff and Roberts used the term, "paradigm of argument", to refer to the linguistic and conceptual frame used by a disputant, whereby 'a coherent picture of relevant events and actions in terms of one or more implicit or explicit normative referents' is created.&lt;ref name=cr85&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 85&lt;/ref&gt; In their explanation, the complainant (who always speaks first) thus establishes a paradigm the defendant can either accept and therefore argue within that specific paradigm or reject and therefore introduce his or her own paradigm (usually, the facts are not contested here). If the defendant means to change the paradigm, they will refer to norms as such, where actually norms are not ordinarily explicitly referenced in Tswana dispute resolution as the audience would typically already know them and just the way one presents one's case and constructs the facts will establish one's paradigm. The headman or chief adjudicating may also do same: accept the normative basis implied by the parties (or one of them), and thus not refer to norms using explicit language but rather isolate a factual issue in the dispute and then make a decision on it without expressly referring to any norms, or impose a new or different paradigm onto the parties.&lt;ref name=cr85/&gt;

=== Law as necessarily rule-governed ===
Hund finds Comaroff and Roberts' flexibility thesis of a 'repertoire of norms' from which litigants and adjudicator choose in the process of negotiating solutions between them uncompelling.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt; He is therefore concerned with disproving what he calls [[Scepticism in law|"rule scepticism"]] on their part. He notes that the concept of custom generally denotes convergent behaviour, but not all customs have the force of law. Hund therefore draws from Hart's analysis distinguishing social rules, which have internal and external aspects, from habits, which have only external aspects. Internal aspects are the reflective attitude on the part of adherents toward certain behaviours perceived to be obligatory, according to a common standard. External aspects manifest in regular, observable behaviour, but is not obligatory. In Hart's analysis, then, social rules amount to custom that has legal force.

Hart identifies three further differences between habits and binding social rules.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt; First, a social rule exists where society frowns on deviation from the habit and attempts to prevent departures by criticising such behaviour. Second, when this criticism is seen socially as a good reason for adhering to the habit, and it is welcomed. And, third, when members of a group behave in a common way not only out of habit or because everyone else is doing it, but because it is seen to be a common standard that should be followed, at least by some members. Hund, however, acknowledges the difficulty of an outsider knowing the dimensions of these criteria that depend on an internal point of view.

For Hund, the first form of rule scepticism concerns the widely held opinion that, because the content of customary law derives from practice, there are actually no objective rules, since it is only behaviour that informs their construction. On this view, it is impossible to distinguish between behaviour that is rule bound and behaviour that is not—i.e., which behaviour is motivated by adherence to law (or at least done in recognition of the law) and is merely a response to other factors. Hund sees this as problematic because it makes quantifying the law almost impossible, since behaviour is obviously inconsistent. Hund argues that this is a misconception based on a failure to acknowledge the importance of the ''internal element''. In his view, by using the criteria described above, there is not this problem in deciphering what constitutes "law" in a particular community.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt;

According to Hund, the second form of rule scepticism says that, though a community may have rules, those rules are not arrived at [[Deductive reasoning|'deductively']], i.e. they are not created through legal/moral reasoning only but are instead driven by the personal/political motives of those who create them. The scope for such influence is created by the loose and undefined nature of customary law, which, Hund argues, grants customary-lawmakers (often through traditional 'judicial processes') a wide discretion in its application. Yet, Hund contends that the fact that rules might sometimes be arrived at in the more ad hoc way, does not mean that this defines the system. If one requires a perfect system, where laws are created only deductively, then one is left with a system with no rules. For Hund, this cannot be so and an explanation for these kinds of law-making processes is found in Hart's conception of "secondary rules" (rules in terms of which the main body of norms are recognised). Hund therefore says that for some cultures, for instance in some sections of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] society, the secondary rules have developed only to the point where laws are determined with reference to politics and personal preference. This does not mean that they are not "rules". Hund argues that if we acknowledge a developmental pattern in societies' constructions of these secondary rules then we can understand how this society constructs its laws and how it differs from societies that have come to rely on an objective, stand-alone body of rules.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt;

==Customary law and codification==
{{main|Codification (law)}}
The modern [[Codification (law)|codification]] of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] developed from the tradition of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[custumal]]s, collections of local customary law that developed in a specific manorial or borough jurisdiction, and which were slowly pieced together mainly from [[case law]] and later written down by local [[jurist]]s. Custumals acquired the force of law when they became the undisputed rule by which certain [[rights]], entitlements, and [[obligation]]s were regulated between members of a community.&lt;ref&gt;In ''R. v Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'', [1982] 2 All E.R. 118, [[Lord Denning]] said "These customary laws are not written down. They are handed down by tradition from one generation to another. Yet beyond doubt they are well established and have the force of law within the community."&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples include [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]]'s ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' for England, the ''[[Coutume de Paris]]'' for the city of Paris, the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'' for northern Germany, and the many ''[[fuero]]s'' of Spain.

==International law==
{{Main|Customary international law}}

In [[international law]], ''customary law'' refers to the ''Law of Nations'' or the legal norms that have developed through the customary exchanges between [[Sovereign state|states]] over time, whether based on [[diplomacy]] or aggression.  Essentially, legal obligations are believed to arise between states to carry out their affairs consistently with past accepted conduct.  These customs can also change based on the acceptance or rejection by states of particular acts.  Some principles of customary law have achieved the force of [[peremptory norm]]s, which cannot be violated or altered except by a norm of comparable strength.  These norms are said to gain their strength from universal acceptance, such as the prohibitions against [[genocide]] and [[slavery]]. Customary international law can be distinguished from [[treaty]] law, which consists of explicit agreements between nations to assume obligations.  However, many treaties are attempts to codify pre-existing customary law.

==Customary law within contemporary legal systems==

Customary law is a recognized source of law within jurisdictions of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition, where it may be subordinate to both [[statutes]] and [[regulations]]. In addressing custom as a source of law within the civil law tradition, [[John Henry Merryman]] notes that, though the attention it is given in scholarly works is great, its importance is "slight and decreasing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Civil Law Tradition: An Introduction to the Legal Systems of Europe and Latin America|first=John Henry|last=Merryman|edition=3rd|year=2007|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|page=24|isbn=978-0-8047-5569-6|lccn=2007003956|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OJf9CbgKTkC&amp;pg=PA24|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in many countries around the world, one or more types of customary law continue to exist side by side with official law, a condition referred to as '''[[legal pluralism]]''' (see [[List of national legal systems]]).

In the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[custom (canon law)|custom]] is a source of law. [[Canonical jurisprudence]], however, differs from Civil law jurisprudence in requiring the express or implied consent of the legislator for a custom to obtain the force of law.

In the Common Law of [[England]], "Long usage" must be established.

It is a broad principle of property law that, if something has gone on for a long time without objection, whether it be using a right of way or occupying land to which one has no title, the law will eventually recognise the fact and give the person doing it the legal right to continue.

It is known in case law as
Customary Rights 
"Customary rights". Something which has been practised since time immemorial by reference to a particular locality may acquire the legal status of a custom, which is a form of local law.The legal criteria defining a custom are precise.  The most common claim in recent times, is for customary rights to moor a vessel.

The mooring must have been in continuous use for "Time Immemorial" which is  defined by legal precedent as 12 years (or 20 years for Crown Land) for the same purpose by people using them for that purpose.

To give two examples:- A custom of mooring which might have been established in past times for over two hundred years by the fishing fleet of local inhabitants of a coastal community will not simply transfer so as to benefit present day recreational boat owners who may hail from much further afield.

Whereas a group of houseboats on a mooring that has been in continuous use for the last 25 years 
with a mixture of owner occupiers and rented houseboats, may clearly continue to be used by houseboats, where the owners live in the same town or city.

Both the purpose of the moorings and the class of persons benefited by the custom must have been clear and consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ayb.ltd.uk/customary-mooring-rights/|title=Customary Mooring Rights|author=|work=|publisher=[[Associated Yacht Brokers]]|accessdate=19 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413152848/http://ayb.ltd.uk/customary-mooring-rights/|archivedate=13 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], customary aboriginal law has a constitutional foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html |title=Constitution Act, 1982, s. 35(1) |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=29 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320212057/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Const/annex_e.html |archivedate=20 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason has increasing influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Generic and Specific Aboriginal Rights|last=Slattery|first=Brian|authorlink=|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=6|pages=|url=http://www.law.uvic.ca/calder/Papers/Brian%20Slattery.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2008}} and {{cite book |title=Let Right Be Done: Aboriginal title, the Calder Case, and the Future of Indigenous Rights |last=Foster |first=Hamar |authorlink= |author2=Heather Raven and Jeremy Webber (eds.) |year=2007 |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |isbn= |volume=18 No. 7 (July, 2008) |page= |pages=574–578 |url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/foster0708.htm |accessdate=11 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830063039/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/foster0708.htm |archivedate=30 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Scandinavia]]n countries customary law continues to exist and has great influence. 

Customary law is also used in some [[Third World]] countries, such as those in [[Africa]], usually used alongside common or civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.droitcivil.uottawa.ca/world-legal-systems/eng-tableau.php#g |title=JuryGlobe |author= |work= |publisher=[[University of Ottawa]] |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Ethiopia]], despite the adoption of legal codes based on [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in the 1950s according to Dolores Donovan and Getachew Assefa there are more than 60 systems of customary law currently in force, "some of them operating quite independently of the formal state legal system." They offer two reasons for the relative autonomy of these customary law systems: one is that the Ethiopian government lacks sufficient resources to enforce its legal system to every corner of Ethiopia; the other is that the Ethiopian government has made a commitment to preserve these customary systems within its boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Dolores A. Donovan and Getachew Assefa, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3649118 "Homicide in Ethiopia: Human Rights, Federalism, and Legal Pluralism," ''American Journal of Comparative Law''], '''51''' (2003), p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[President of Kyrgyzstan]] [[Askar Akaev]] announced a decree to revitalize the ''[[aqsaqal]]'' courts of village elders. The courts would have jurisdiction over property, torts and family law.&lt;ref name="Beyer"&gt;Judith Beyer, Kyrgyz Aksakal Courts: Pluralistic Accounts of History, 53 J. OF L. PLURALISM 144 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''aqsaqal'' courts were eventually included under Article 92 of the Kyrgyz constitution. As of 2006, there were approximately 1,000 ''aqsaqal'' courts throughout Kyrgyzstan, including in the capital of [[Bishkek]].&lt;ref name="Beyer" /&gt; Akaev linked the development of these courts to the rekindling of Kyrgyz national identity.

In India many customs are accepted by law. For example, [[Hinduism|Hindu]] marriage ceremonies are recognized by the [[Hindu Marriage Act]].

In Indonesia, customary [[adat]] laws of the country's various indigenous ethnicities are recognized, and customary dispute resolution is recognized in [[Papua (province)|Papua]]. Indonesian adat law are mainly divided into 19 circles, namely [[Aceh]], [[Gayo Lues Regency|Gayo]], [[Alas people|Alas]], and [[Batak]], [[Minangkabau Highlands|Minangkabau]], [[South Sumatra]], the [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]] regions, [[Bangka Island|Bangka]] and [[Belitung]], [[Kalimantan]], [[Minahasa]], [[Gorontalo]], [[Toraja]], [[South Sulawesi]], [[Ternate]], the [[Molluccas]], [[Papua (province)|Papua]], [[Timor]], [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]], Central and East [[Java]] including the island of [[Madura]], [[Sunda Islands|Sunda]], and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] monarchies, including the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], [[Surakarta Sunanate]], and the [[Pakualaman]] and [[Mangkunegaran]] princely states.

==Custom in torts==
{{Confusing|section|date=November 2008}}

Custom is used in [[tort]] law to help determine [[negligence]].  Following or disregarding a custom is not determinative of negligence, but instead is an indication of possible best practices or alternatives to a particular action.

'''''Dedovshchina''''' ({{lang-rus|дедовщи́на|p=dʲɪdɐˈfɕːinə}}; lit. ''reign of grandfathers'') is the informal practice of initiation ([[hazing]]) and constant [[bullying]] of junior [[Military recruitment|conscripts]] during their service, formerly to the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and today to the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian armed forces]], [[Internal Troops]], and (to a much lesser extent) [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] [[Border Guard Service of Russia|Border Guards]], as well as the military forces of certain [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Republics]]. It consists of brutalization by more senior conscripts serving their last year of compulsory military service as well as [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]].

''Dedovshchina'' encompasses a variety of subordinating or humiliating activities undertaken by the junior ranks: from doing the chores of the senior ranks to violent and sometimes lethal [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]], not unlike an extremely vicious form of [[bullying]] or even [[torture]], including sexual torture and rape (cases of forcingly stucking bottles of glass or metal objects inside of one's anus are common). When not leaving army seriously injured, conscripts can suffer serious psychopathology for their life time. It is often cited as a major source of poor [[morale]] in the ranks.

Often with the justification of maintaining authority, physical violence or psychological abuse can be used to make the “youth” do certain fatiguing duties. In many situations, hazing is in fact not the goal. Conscripts with seniority exploit their juniors to provide themselves with a more comfortable existence, and the violent aspects arise when juniors refuse to "follow traditions".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  There have been occasions where soldiers have been seriously injured, or, in extraordinary situations, killed.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from "''ded''" ({{lang-ru|дед}}, meaning grandfather), which is the [[Russian Army]] army slang equivalent of ''gramps'', meaning soldiers after their third (or fourth, which is also known as "dembel" ({{lang-ru|дембель}} or "DMB" ({{lang-ru|ДМБ}}) half-year of compulsory service, stemming from a vulgarization of the word "[[demobilization]]" ({{lang-ru|демобилизация}} ''demobilizatsiya'') - this word is erroneously used by soldiers to describe the act of resigning from the army); soldiers also refer to "dembel"  half-year of [[conscription]], with the suffix ''-shchina'' which denotes a type of order, rule, or regime (compare [[Yezhovshchina]], [[Zhdanovshchina]]). Thus it can literally be translated as "rule of the grandfathers." This is essentially a folk system of seniority based on stage of service, mostly not backed by code or law, which only grants seniority to conscripts promoted to various [[Sergeant]] and [[Gefreiter|Efreitor]] ranks.

==History==
The origin of this problem is often attributed to the change in conscription term brought about by the law of October 12, 1967, causing two different groups of [[Conscription|conscript]]s to be simultaneously present in the army: those who were drafted for 3-year service and those only for 2-year service.&lt;ref&gt;Those who date the present dedovschina system to 1967 include {{cite book |author= [[William Eldridge Odom|Odom, William E.]] |title= The Collapse of the Soviet Military |publisher= Yale University Press |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-300-07469-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, a decision was reached to draft conscripts with a criminal history into the ranks, due to a demographic crisis following [[World War II]].  While oppression by older conscripts has probably always taken place in the army, after that date, with the introduction of the four-class system (created by the [[Conscription_in_Russia#Late Soviet Union|bi-annual call-ups]]){{Clarify|date=May 2011}} it became systematic and developed its own rules and ranks.

==Current situation==
Many young men are killed or commit suicide every year because of ''dedovshchina''.&lt;ref name="dedov"&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2004/russia1004/6.htm The Consequences of Dedovshchina], [[Human Rights Watch]] report, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ismailov"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://2006.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2006/51n/n51n-s11.shtml|title=Terrible dedovshchina in General Staff|first=Vjacheslav|last=Ismailov|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|language=Russian|date=2006-07-10|accessdate=2009-01-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that in 2006 at least 292 Russian soldiers were killed by ''dedovshchina'' (although the Russian military only admits that 16 soldiers were directly murdered by acts of ''dedovshchina'' and claims that the rest committed suicide).&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E7DF173EF930A2575BC0A9609C8B63|title=Hazing Trial Bares a Dark Side of Russia's Military | work=The New York Times | date=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' states: "On Aug. 4, it was announced by the chief military prosecutor that there had been 3,500 reports of abuse already this year (2006), compared with 2,798 in 2005". The BBC meanwhile reports that in 2007, 341 soldiers committed suicide, a 15% reduction on the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7425694.stm|title=Russia army suicides cause alarm|publisher=BBC News Online|date=29 May 2008|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia]] works to protect the rights of young soldiers.

In 2012, a draftee from [[Chelyabinsk]] region, Ruslan Aiderkhanov, was raped and tortured to death by his seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=21 Sep 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8779624/Russian-family-alleges-suicide-conscript-tortured-to-death.html |title=Russian family alleges 'suicide' conscript tortured to death |publisher=Telegraph |date=2011-09-21 |accessdate=2013-08-01 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one witness who was willing to testify against the alleged perpetrators, Danil Chalkin, was later found shot dead in his military base. A contract soldier, Alikbek Musabekov, was later arrested in this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newizv.ru/lenta/2012-02-13/159155-mladshij-serzhant-zastrelilsja-ne-vynesja-izdevatelstv-rjadovogo.html |script-title=ru:Младший сержант застрелился, не вынеся издевательств рядового  |work=[[Novye Izvestia]] |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2013-08-01|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government actions==
Overall, the state has done little to curtail ''dedovshchina''. In 2003, on the specific issues of denial of food and poor nutrition, Deputy Minister of Defense V. Isakov flatly denied the existence of such problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/russia1103/4.htm#_Toc55717189 |title=To Serve without Health? |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defense]] has published monthly statistics of incidents and crimes including cases of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.mil.ru/849/1048/1312/index.shtml Информация о происшествиях и преступлениях в Вооруженных Силах РФ], mil.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2007/08 the conscript service time was reduced from two years to one; dedovshchina primarily occurs when second year conscripts abuse first year conscripts, this measure is partially intended to curtail the practice.

==Dedovshchina in popular culture==
Several Soviet and Russian films portrayed the ''dedovshchina'' despite the military's abstention from helping the production. Following is the selected filmography:
*''[[Delay – raz! ("Delay – raz!: Do It - one!")|Do It - one!]] - Делай — раз!'' - 1990 
*''[[The Guard (1990 film)|The Guard]] - Караул'' - 1990
*''[[Afghan Breakdown]] - Афганский излом'' - 1990
*''[[100 Days Before the Command]] - Сто дней до приказа'' - 1990
*''[[:ru:Кислородный голод|Air Hunger]] - Кислородный голод'' - 1992
*''[[The Green Elephant]] - Зеленый слоник'' - 1999
*''[[Demobbed (2000 film)|Demobbed]] - ДМБ'' - 2000
*''[[The 9th Company]] - 9-я рота'' - 2005
*''[[The Search (2014 film)|The Search]] - 2014
Also, in the novel ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'', [[Tom Clancy]] writes that veteran Soviet naval captain [[Marko Ramius]] refused to allow ''dedovshchina'' to be practiced anywhere on his ship, dismissing it as "low-level terrorism".

{{Buddhism}} 
'''Dharmadhatu''' ([[Sanskrit]]) is the 'dimension', 'realm' or 'sphere' (dhātu) of the [[Dharma]] or [[Two Truths doctrine|Absolute Reality]].

==Definition==
In [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], dharmadhātu ({{lang-bo|chos kyi dbyings}}; {{zh|c=法界}}) means "realm of phenomena", "realm of Truth", and of the [[noumenon]]. It is referred to by several synonymous terms from Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, such as [[Tathata]] (Reality "as-it-is"), [[Shunyata|emptiness]], [[pratitya-samutpada|dependent co-arising]] and [[eternal Buddha]]. It is the "deepest nature, or essence".{{sfn|Chang|1992|p=253}}

Dharmadhātu is the purified mind in its natural state, free of obscurations. It is the essence-quality or nature of mind, the fundamental ground of consciousness of the [[trikaya]], which is accessed via the [[mindstream]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

When the [[buddha-nature]] has been realised, dharmadhātu is also referred to as the [[Dharmakāya]], the ''Body of Dharma Truth''.

It is associated with [[Vairocana]].

==Historical origin==
Kang-nam Oh traces the origin of dharmadhatu to the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. It has been further developed by the [[Huayan school|Hua-yen school]]:
{{quote|This idea of dharmadhātu-[[pratītyasamutpāda]] which was originally found in the Avataṁsaka-sūtra or [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] ching,{{refn|group=note|There are three Chinese translations in the name of Ta-fang-kuang-fo hua-yen-ching. 1) T.9, no. 278, tr. by Buddhabhadra in sixty fascicles during 418-420; 2) T.10, no. 279 , by Śiksānanda in eighty fascicles during 695-699; and 3) T.10, no. 293, by Prajñā in forty fascicles during 795-798. The last one is basically equivalent to the last chapter of the previous versions, i.e., the Chapter on Entering into Dharmadhātu. This chapter is available in Sanskrit as an independent sutra called Gaṇdavyuha-sūtra, one ed. by D. T.Suzuki and H. Idzumi (Kyoto: The Sanskrit Buddhist Texts Publishing Society, 1934-36), and the other ed. by P. L. Vaidya, Buddhist Sanskrit Texts, no. 5 (Darbhanga: The Mithila Institute of Post Graduate Studies and Research in Sanskrit Learning, 1960).}} was fully developed by the Hua-yen school into a systematic doctrine palatable to the Chinese intellectual taste. The dharmadhātu doctrine{{refn|group=note|To be exact, it should be called the “dharmadhātu-pratītyasamutpāda” doctrine. But for the sake of convenience, it will be referred to as dharmadhātu doctrine hereafter.}} can be said to have been, by and large, set forth by [[Dushun|Tu-shun]] (557~640 C.E.), formulated by Chih-yen (602~668), systematized by [[Fa-tsang]] (643~712), and elucidated by Ch’eng-kuan (ca. 737~838) and [[Tsung-mi]] (780~841).{{sfn|Oh|2000}}}}

==Understanding in Buddhist tradition==

===Indian Buddhism===

====Śrīmālādevī Sūtra====
The [[Śrīmālādevī Sūtra]] (3rd century CE{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=2}}), also named ''The Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala'', centers on the teaching of the [[tathagatagarbha]] as "ultimate soteriological principle".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=10}} It states that the tathagata-garbha is the "embryo" of the Dharmadhatu and the [[Dharmakaya]]:{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=106}}
{{quote|Lord, the Tathagatagarbha is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. The Tathagatagarbha is not the domain of beings who fall into the belief in a real personality, who adhere to wayward views, whose thoughts are distracted by [[Sunyata|voidness]]. Lord, this Tathagatagarbha is the embryo of the Illustrious Dharmadhatu, the embryo of the [[Dharmakaya]], the embryo of the supramundane ''dharma'', the embryo of the intrinsically pure ''dharma''.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=106}}}}

In the Śrīmālādevī Sūtra, there are two possible states for the Tathagatagarbha:
{{quote|[E]ither covered by [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]], when it is called only "embryo of the Tathagata"; or free from defilements, when the "embryo of the Tathagata" is no more the "embryo" (potentiality) but the [[Tathāgata]] (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;the [[Dharmakaya]])(actuality).{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}}}}

The sutra itself states it this way:
{{quote|This Dharmakaya of the Tathagata when not free from the store of defilement is referred to as the Tathagatagarbha.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=98}}}}

====''Dharmadhātustava''====
The ''Dharmadhātustava'' ("In praise of the Dharmadhatu"), attributed to [[Nāgārjuna]]{{sfn|Nagarjuna|1998}} though questioned, is a treatise on the dharmadhatu. According to the ''Dharmadhātustava'', the dharmadhatu is the ground which makes liberation possible:
{{quote|The dharmadhatu is the ground&lt;br /&gt;
For [[buddhahood]], [[nirvana]], purity, and permanence.{{sfn|Nagarjuna|1998}}{{refn|group=note|In cooperation with the Indian Khenpo, Krishna Pandita, it was translated (from Sanskrit to Tibetan) by Lotsawa Tsultrim Gyalwa. Based on teachings given by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, it has been translated from Tibetan into English by Jim Scott, April 1997, and edited by Ari Goldfield, September 1998.&lt;br&gt;Karl Brunholzl published another translation, with extensive commentaries, ''In Praise of Dharmadhatu'' (2008).}}}}

According to the ''Dharmadhātustava'', the dharmadhatu is seen when the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|afflictions]] are purified:
{{quote|As butter, though inherent in the milk,&lt;br /&gt;
Is mixed with it and hence does not appear,&lt;br /&gt;
Just so the dharmadhatu is not seen&lt;br /&gt;
As long as it is mixed together with afflictions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And just as the inherent butter essence&lt;br /&gt;
When the milk is purified is no more disguised,&lt;br /&gt;
When afflictions have been completely purified,&lt;br /&gt;
The dharmadhatu will be without any stain at all.{{sfn|Nagarjuna|1998}}}}

===Chinese Buddhism===

====Mahaparinirvana Sutra====
In the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], the Buddha states of himself that he is the "boundless Dharmadhatu" - the Totality itself.

===Tibetan Buddhism===

====Five Wisdoms====
The Dharmadhatu is comprehended by one of the [[Five Wisdoms]]:

'''Drafting''' is the preliminary stage of a written work in which the author begins to develop a more cohesive product. A '''draft document''' is the product the writer creates in the initial stages of the [[writing process]].

In the drafting stage, the author:
* develops a more cohesive text
* organizes thoughts
* explains examples/ideas
* uncovers transitions
* discovers a central argument/point
* elaborates on key ideas

In a book that became popular in the 1950s, ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', famed authors Strunk and White describe the first draft as being a less edited version of the final draft.  In their book, Strunk and White say, “the first principle of composition is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.&lt;ref&gt;The Elements of Style Fiftieth Anniversary Edition (2009), p. 15, {{ISBN|978-0-205-63264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This shape is the draft that eventually becomes the finished work.

More recently, [[Peter Elbow]], in his book ''Writing Without Teachers'', presents a very different view of the drafting stage in the [[writing process]]. He describes his stance on the writing process, saying “Writing is a way to end up thinking something you couldn’t have started out thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.15&lt;/ref&gt;” According to Elbow, the best way to accomplish this is a series of drafts which come together to produce an emerging “center of gravity” that then translates into the main focus on the work. This process should be a holistic process, not a linear process. Elbow’s reasoning behind this concept of multiple drafts follows the idea that, “if he learns to maximize the interaction among his own ideas or points of view, he can produce new ones that didn’t seem available to him.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;”

Whether being used as the creation of a less-edited final product (Strunk and White) or as a tool during the prewriting stage (Elbow), drafting is a necessary stage for the writer in the writing process.  Having created a draft, the author is then able to move onto the revision.

'''EcoHealth''' is an emerging field of study researching how changes in the earth’s [[ecosystems]] affect human health. It has many prospects. EcoHealth examines changes in the biological, physical, social and economic environments and relates these changes to human health. Examples of these changes and their effects abound. Common examples include increases in [[asthma]] rates due to [[air pollution]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] contamination of [[game fish]] in the [[Great Lakes]] of the [[United States]], and [[habitat fragmentation]] leading to increasing rates of [[Lyme disease]].

Recently [[virulent]] new [[infectious diseases]] such as [[SARS]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Nipah virus]], [[H5N1|bird flu]] and [[hantavirus]] have all been found to result from ecosystem change created by humans.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} These diseases have high death rates and very few effective therapies.

EcoHealth is bringing together [[physicians]], [[veterinarians]], [[ecologists]], [[economists]], [[social scientists]], [[urban planner|planners]] and others to study and understand how ecosystem changes affect human health. EcoHealth strives to provide innovative, practical solutions to reduce or reverse the negative health effects of ecosystem change.

==History==

Ecosystem approaches to health, or ecohealth, emerged as a defined field of inquiry and application in the 1990s, primarily through the global research supported by the [[International Development Research Centre]] in Ottawa (IDRC), Canada (Lebel, 2003). However, this was a resurrection of an approach to health and ecology that can be traced back, in Western societies, to [[Hippocrates]], and to much earlier eras in Eastern societies. The approach was prominent among many scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries, but fell into disfavour in the twentieth century, when technical professionalism and expertise were assumed to be sufficient to deal with health and disease. In this relatively brief era, evaluation of the negative human health impacts of environmental change (both the natural and built environment) was allotted to the fields of medicine and environmental health. One medicine, as championed by scholars and practitioners such as Calvin Schwabe, was largely considered a marginal activity.

Integrated approaches to health and ecology re-emerged in the 1990s, and included one health, conservation medicine, ecological resilience, ecological integrity, health communities, and a variety of other approaches. These new movements were able to draw on a tradition that stretches from Hippocrates, to [[Rudolf Virchow]] and [[Louis Pasteur]], who did not recognize the boundaries between human and animal medicine, and environmental and social change; to William Osler, who was a member of both the [[McGill University Faculty of Medicine|McGill medical faculty]] and the [[Université de Montréal Faculty of Veterinary Medicine|Montreal Veterinary College]]; Calvin Schwabe, whose 1984 book, Veterinary Medicine and Human Health, is a classic in the field; and [[James Harlan Steele|James Steele]], who founded the first veterinary public health unit in the United States.

Ecohealth approaches as currently practiced are participatory, systems-based approaches to understanding and promoting health and wellbeing in the context of social and ecological interactions. What differentiates these approaches from earlier integrative attempts is a firm grounding in complexity theories and post-normal science (Waltner-Toews, 2004; Waltner-Toews ''et al.'', 2008). While a variety of organizations promote integrative approaches such as One Health, the primary funder and promoter of ecohealth in particular, world-wide, is the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa (http://www.idrc.ca/ecohealth/).

After a decade of international conferences in North America and Australia under the more contentious umbrella of "[[ecosystem health]]", the first "ecosystem approach to human health" (ecohealth) forum was held in Montreal in 2003, followed by conferences and forums in Wisconsin, U.S., and Mérida, Mexico, all with major support from IDRC. Since then the International Association for Ecology and Health, and the journal Ecohealth have established the field as a legitimate scholarly and development activity (www.ecohealth.net).

==Differences==

EcoHealth studies differ from traditional, single discipline studies. A traditional epidemiological study may show increasing rates of malaria in a region, but not address how or why the rate is increasing. An environmental health study may recommend the spraying of a pesticide in certain amounts in certain areas to reduce spread. An economic analysis may calculate the cost and effectiveness per dollar spent on such a program.
An EcoHealth study uses a different approach. It brings the multiple specialist disciplines together with members of the affected community before the study begins. Through pre-study meetings the group shares knowledge and adopts a common language. These pre-study meetings often lead to creative and novel approaches and can lead to a more "socially robust" solution. EcoHealth practitioners term this synergy transdisciplinarity, and differentiate it from multidiscipline studies.
EcoHealth studies also value participation of all involved groups, including decision makers and believe issues of equity (between gender, socioeconomic classes, age and even species) are important to fully understand the problem to be studied.
Jean Lebel (2003) phrased ''transdisciplinarity, participation and equity the three pillars of EcoHealth'' (Lebel, 2003). 
The IDRC now speaks of six principles, instead of three pillars, namely transdisciplinarity, participation, gender and social equity, system-thinking, sustainability and research-to-action (Charron, 2011).

==Examples==

A short example of a transdisciplinary study in the field of EcoHealth appears below. This is excerpted from HEALTH: An Ecosystem Approach, by Jean Lebel. (IDRC 2003, {{ISBN|1-55250-012-8}}.)
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“In Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s, close to 24 000 of the 2.4 million people who caught malaria every year died as a result. Massive use of the powerful insecticide DDT was the linchpin of the government's effort to eradicate the disease. Over time, some progress was made against malaria, but the war was far from won. The use of DDT also posed its own threats to the health of the ecosystem. Moreover, as required by the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico had to completely eliminate the use of DDT by 2002.
To meet this challenge, an EcoHealth research project was set up to pool the knowledge of a team of specialists in epidemiology, computer science, entomology, and social sciences, from both government and academia.
This team has accumulated volumes of information about the prevalence of malaria in 2 000 villages. Data from powerful geographical information systems enabled them to conclude that mosquitoes do not travel very much. "If you have a place to lay your eggs and feed yourself, why go elsewhere?" explains Mario Henry Rodriguez, Director of Research on Infectious Diseases at the National Institute for Public Health (NIPH). In addition, as confirmed by Juan Eugenio Hernández, NIPH's Director of Informatics, it is now believed that "human beings are the vectors of malaria," which explains why more cases of malaria are found in villages located alongside roads.”
With community help, the team studied the population's living conditions, including behavioural differences between men and women. It was found that while women are more likely to be bitten by mosquitoes early in the morning when they go to fetch water, the men are likely to be bitten in the coffee plantations at night.
Several preventive actions have been taken. The scientists have proposed a new insecticide that, unlike DDT, does not persist in the environment. They have also developed a more effective pump that can spray 40 homes a day instead of 8, and uses less insecticide. A new malaria testing kit now detects the presence or absence of parasites in a patient's blood in only a few minutes, unlike laboratory tests that take three to four weeks to confirm a diagnosis. Previously, the need to wait for test results forced the authorities to treat everyone who showed vague symptoms of the illness, such as a high fever or headaches. Now, volunteers administer these tests to the people in close to 60 villages. "We have given communities the means to take care of themselves," says Mario Rodriguez.
The fight against malaria in Mexico is now no longer solely the responsibility of government employees. Women also play a role by removing, every two weeks, the algae that harbour mosquito larvae in bodies of water. As a result, the number of cases of malaria in the state of Oaxaca has dropped from 15 000 in 1998 to only 400 today — and all without using any DDT. "Our experience has taught us that we need to bolster the social science research component if we want to extend this program to other parts of the country, while maintaining it in Oaxaca. The challenge is to draw the lessons that will lead to application of the program on a much wider scale," says Dr Rodriguez.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This study reveals both the nature of the complex interactions of the problem and the extent to which a successful solution must cross research disciplines. The solution involved creative thinking on the part of many individuals, and produced a win-win situation for researchers, business and most importantly, for the community. 
Although many of the dramatic effects of ecosystem change and much of the research is focused in developing countries, the ecosystem of the built environment in urban areas of the developed world is also a major determinant of human health. Obesity, diabetes, asthma, and heart disease are all directly related to how humans interact with the local [[urban ecosystem]] in which they live. Urban design and planning determine car use, food choices available, air pollution levels and the safety and walkability of the neighborhoods in which people live.
Other examples of the EcoHealth approach can be found in Linking Social and Ecological Systems: Management Practice and Social Mechanisms for Building Resilience, edited by Fikrit Berkes and Carl Folke (1998, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-59140-6}}) and Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems, edited by Lance H. Gunderson and C. S. Holling (2002, Island Press, {{ISBN|1-55963-856-7}}).

==EcoHealth 101: education for ecosystem approaches==

Courses in ecosystem approaches to health have been developed and delivered in several [[North America]]n and [[Australia]]n universities. One innovative Canadian course involved a collaboration of all of Canada's veterinary colleges, and focused on integrative field cases in all parts of the country; another Canadian course was a joint effort of the medical school at the University of Western Ontario and the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph. In the years after 2003, communities of practice for ecosystem approaches to health in [[Canada]], Latin America and the Caribbean, and [[Africa]] (largely supported by the IDRC) created intensive graduate level courses that integrated systems approaches with participatory approaches, and used actual case studies so that students gained applied clinical experience in "transdisciplinary" problem solving (see www.copeh-canada.org for one example). CoPEH-Canada organizes a yearly professional development and graduate level intensive training course in ecosystem approaches to health and have created a teaching manual with much of their material which is free on their site in English, French and Spanish (www.copeh-canada.org).

Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the University of Wisconsin–Madison created a website to promote education in this area [http://www.ecohealth101.org EcoHealth (Environmental Change and Our Health)]. The website examines the changes that are transforming Earth and what they can mean for our health.

This website is geared to middle-school students and their teachers, and delivers scientific information in a kid-friendly, engaging, and visually vibrant manner. Since its initial partnership with the Journey to Planet Earth television mini-series, hosted and narrated by actor Matt Damon and aired on PBS in Spring 2003 and 2004, the website has become an educational complement to this [[television|TV]] series, as well as a dynamic stand-alone tool for students and teachers. Since then, the site's appeal has grown far broader, reaching high-school students, and anyone interested in environmental and health issues—or simply wanting a reliable and fun resource for being able to sort the science from the sound bites. [http://www.ecohealth101.org EcoHealth 101] provides the in-depth analysis and context behind today's headline news.

"The idea for the site grew from the positive feedback following public lectures I've given on global environmental health", says Dr. Jonathan Patz, associate professor at the University of Wisconsin &amp; adjunct associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "'Students should really learn about how their health is tied so closely to the global environment,' was the comment I often heard."

"The site is very exciting because it deals with serious and thought-provoking topics", adds Dr. Patz. "Nonetheless, it shows middle-school students how to have fun with the visual elements and discover what potential solutions exist for alleviating the negative effects of climate change and other changes to our planet."

In a rapidly changing world, our school curriculum must expand to include accurate science on global warming, environmental degradation, and its negative effects on human, wildlife and [[ecosystem health]]. The mission of [http://www.ecohealth101.org EcoHealth 101] is to educate and inform the next generation of leaders who may have the answers to today's problems. Chapters from the website include Global Warming, Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, The Balance of Nature, Modern Agriculture and Drinking Water, and Globalization and Disease Without Borders.

The site was reviewed for accuracy and fairness by science, health, and environmental experts in a wide range of specialties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

EcoPlanet Bamboo plants species of tropical clumping ([[sympodial]]) bamboos, using only highly degraded&lt;ref&gt;''EcoPlanet Bamboo uses the UNFCCC tool for the Identification of Degraded Land.''&lt;/ref&gt; and marginal land to produce a tree free, [[deforestation]] free fiber. The Company has developed a framework for what sustainability means in respect to [[bamboo]]. Farms reach maturity in 5–7 years and the fiber is targeted towards [[Fortune 500|Fortune 500 companies]] dependent on wood and fiber as their raw resource.

The company is highly decentralized with individual bamboo plantations operating under EcoPlanet Bamboo Groups standardized operational framework to achieve [[Forest restoration|Forest Landscape Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etfrn.org/file.php/302/4.6-ecoplanet-bamboo.pdf|format=PDF|title=4.6 Commercial bamboo plantations as a tool for restoring landscapes|website=Etfrn.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full set of qualified managerial staff exists on each farm and is overseen by a core managerial team.

==Bamboo in China==
Although bamboo is a plant that has been grown and harvested in China for generations, it occurs only within a smallholder model. There are few commercial or large scale managed plantations. The majority of area under bamboo comprises plots of a few Mu in size, owned by individual farmers or families, and managed as part of a [[Crop diversity|diverse]] mix of livelihood crops. Throughout China bamboo has been planted only in areas not suitable for agriculture, which generally mean mountainous land that is often inaccessible. Most of China's bamboo industry is focused on a single iconic species – [[Phyllostachys edulis|Moso (''Phyllostachys edulis'')]]

The processing of bamboo in China is dominated by low and medium level processing, with a large focus on two very different markets (1) the global handicraft industry and (2) the production of [[Bamboo shoot|edible bamboo shoots]] for the food industry. In recent years there has been an increase in the production of [[bamboo floor]]ing.

EcoPlanet Bamboo is working in a different manner growing certified bamboo fiber for the [[pulp and paper industry]], textiles and [[Engineered wood|engineered timber]].

==Historical barriers to industrialization of bamboo==
EcoPlanet Bamboo claims to have overcome many barriers to industrialize bamboo as a commercial crop:
# A lack of planting material.  See “[[Bamboo#Mass flowering|bamboo mass flowering]]".
# Lack of knowledge on the growth, ecology and yields of bamboos other than Moso.
# High investment required to take bamboo through the 6–7 years required to reach maturity.
# Difficulty of operating in remote parts of the developing world.

==Bamboo sustainability==
EcoPlanet Bamboo is a triple bottom line company promoting the concept of conscious capitalism. The company has pioneered the concept of sustainability certification for commercially produced bamboo. Nicaraguan farms are certified under the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), the [[Verified Carbon Standard]] (VCS) and have gold level Climate Community Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA) stamp of approval. EcoPlanet Bamboo is the first entity to have received these certifications for application to bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121115006752/en/EcoPlanet-Bamboo-Acquires-FSC-Certification-Enabling-Supply|title=EcoPlanet Bamboo Acquires FSC Certification, Enabling Supply of a Sustainable Alternative Fiber to US &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Multinational&amp;nbsp;Manufacturing Industries|website=Bsinesswire.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Company has been insured by the [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency|World Bank's Multilateral Insurance Guarantee Agency (MIGA)]], holding a $48&amp;nbsp;million policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agriinvestor.com/miga-increases-ecoplanet-bamboo-guarantee/|title=MIGA increases EcoPlanet Bamboo guarantee - Agri Investor|date=June 25, 2015|website=Agriinvestor.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIGA has featured EcoPlanet Bamboo for strong social and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.miga.org/Lists/General/CustomDisp.aspx?ID=1488|title=General|website=Miga.org|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EcoPlanet Bamboo's farms are examples of private [[Forest restoration#Forest landscape restoration|sector forest landscape restoration]], with planted bamboo [[Habitat conservation|conserving]] and reconnecting remnant forest patches and scattered native vegetation, restoring soil functioning, water tables and carbon sinks.

      <comment>The previous entry giving credit to Juillett in 1984 is incorrect.  The first patent for using eddy currents to separate non-ferrous metals from insulators was in 1969 to Benson and Falconer and machines using this technology were manufactured well before 1984.  I updated the page to make this correction.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1379">An '''eddy current separator''' uses a powerful [[magnetic field]] to separate [[non-ferrous metal]]s from waste after all [[ferrous|ferrous metals]] have been removed previously by some arrangement of magnets. The device makes use of [[eddy current]]s to effect the separation. Eddy current separators are not designed to sort ferrous metals which become hot inside the eddy current field. This can lead to damage of the eddy current separator unit belt.

== Technique ==
The eddy current separator is applied to a [[conveyor belt]] carrying a thin layer of mixed waste. At the end of the conveyor belt is an eddy current rotor. Non-ferrous metals are thrown forward from the belt into a product bin, while non-metals simply fall off the belt due to gravity.

Eddy current separators may use a rotating drum with permanent magnets, or may use an electromagnet depending on the type of separator&lt;ref&gt;Myer Kutz ''Environmentally conscious mechanical design'', John Wiley and Sons, 2007 {{ISBN|0-471-72636-2}} page 261&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
A patent for a device using eddy currents to separate non-ferrous metals from non-metals was granted to William Benson and Thomas Falconer of Eriez Magnetics in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Benson et al., US Patent 3,448,857A Electrodynamics Separator (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1869 Frederic Leighton - Electra at the Tomb of Agamemnon.jpg|thumb|right |upright|''Electra at the Tomb of [[Agamemnon]]'', by [[Frederic Leighton]], c.1869]]
In [[Neo-Freudianism|Neo-Freudian]] [[Ego psychology|psychology]], the '''Electra complex''', as proposed by [[Carl Jung]], is a girl's [[psychosexual development|psychosexual]] competition with her mother for possession of her father. In the course of her psychosexual development, the [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] is the girl's [[phallic stage]]; a boy's analogous experience is the [[Oedipus complex]]. The Electra complex occurs in the third—phallic stage (ages 3–6)—of five [[psychosexual development]] stages: (i) the [[Oral stage|Oral]], (ii) the [[Anal stage|Anal]], (iii) the [[Phallic stage|Phallic]], (iv) the [[Latency stage|Latent]], and (v) the [[Genital stage|Genital]]—in which the source of [[libido]] pleasure is in a different [[erogenous zone]] of the infant’s body.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In classical [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory, the child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the Electra complex and of the [[Oedipus complex]]; his and her key psychological experience to developing a mature [[Gender role|sexual role]] and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. [[Sigmund Freud]] instead proposed that girls and boys resolved their [[Complex (psychology)|complexes]] differently—she via [[penis envy]], he via [[castration anxiety]]; and that unsuccessful resolutions might lead to [[neurosis]].
Hence, women and men who are [[Fixation (psychology)|fixated]] in the Electra and Oedipal stages of their [[psychosexual development]] might be considered "father-fixated" and "mother-fixated".

== Background ==
[[File:Electra and Orestes - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumb|right|Electra and Orestes, matricides]]

As a [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] term for daughter–mother psychosexual conflict, the Electra complex derives from the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythologic]] character [[Electra]], who plotted [[Matricide|matricidal]] revenge with [[Orestes]], her brother, against [[Clytemnestra]], their mother, and [[Aegisthus]], their stepfather, for their murder of [[Agamemnon]], their father (cf. ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', by Sophocles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Bruce |year=1996 |title=Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia |edition=4th |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York |page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=Robert E. |year=1991 |title=Women of Classical Mythology: A Biographical Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=California |pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hornblower S, Spawforth A |year=1998 |title=The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization |pages= 254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] developed the female aspects of the [[psychosexual development|sexual development]] theory—describing the [[Id, ego and super-ego|psychodynamics]] of a girl’s sexual competition with her mother for sexual possession of the father—as the '''feminine Oedipus attitude''' and the '''negative Oedipus complex''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freud|first=Sigmund |authorlink=Sigmund Freud|title=On Sexuality |year=1956 |publisher=Penguin Books Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet it was his collaborator [[Carl Jung]] who coined the term Electra complex in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl (1913). ''The Theory of Psychoanalysis.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Jill |year=2005 |title=Electra after Freud: Myth and Culture |publisher=Cornell University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83JE6sEFP9cC&amp;pg=PA8 |page=8 |isbn=978-0-8014-4261-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Jung|title=Psychoanalysis and Neurosis |year=1970 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud rejected Jung's term as [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytically]] inaccurate: "that what we have said about the Oedipus complex applies with complete strictness to the male child only, and that we are right in rejecting the term 'Electra complex', which seeks to emphasize the analogy between the attitude of the two sexes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freud|first1=Sigmund|title=On Sexuality|date=1991|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In forming a discrete sexual identity ([[Id, ego, and super-ego#Ego|ego]]), a girl's decisive psychosexual experience is the Electra complex—daughter–mother competition for possession of the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sigmund Freud 1856–1939 |year=2000 |work=Encyclopaedia of German Literature |publisher=Routledge |location=London |accessdate=2 September 2009 |url=http://www.credoreference.com.library.capella.edu/entry/routgermanlit/sigmund_freud_1856_1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the [[phallic stage]] (ages 3–6), when children become aware of their bodies, the bodies of other children, and the bodies of their parents that they gratify physical curiosity by undressing and exploring each other and their genitals—the [[Erogenous zone|erogenous center]]—of the phallic stage; thereby learning the [[Human anatomy|physical]] [[gender]] differences between male and female, "boy" and "girl". When a girl's initial sexual attachment to her mother ends upon discovering that she has no [[penis]], she then transfers her [[Libido|libidinal desire]] (sexual attachment) to her father and increases sexual competition with her mother.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Characteristics ==
The psychodynamic nature of the daughter–mother relationship in the Electra complex derives from [[penis envy]], caused by the mother, who also caused the girl's [[Castration anxiety|castration]]; however, upon re-aligning her sexual attraction to her father (heterosexuality), the girl [[Defense mechanism|represses]] the hostile female competition, for fear of losing the love of her mother. This [[internalization]] of "Mother" develops the [[super-ego]] as the girl establishes a discrete sexual identity ([[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]). Without a penis, the girl cannot sexually possess her mother, as the infantile [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]] demands. Consequently, the girl redirects her [[libido|desire]] for sexual union upon her father, and thus progresses to [[heterosexual]] femininity, which culminates in bearing a child who replaces the absent [[penis]]. Moreover, after the [[phallic stage]], the girl’s psychosexual development includes transferring her primary [[erogenous zone]] from the infantile [[clitoris]] to the adult [[vagina]]. Freud thus considered the feminine Oedipus attitude ("Electra complex") to be more emotionally intense than the Oedipal conflict of a boy, resulting, potentially, in a woman with a submissive, less confident personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bullock A, Trombley S |year=1999 |title=The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought |publisher=Harper Collins |location=London |pages=259, 705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both sexes, [[defense mechanism]]s provide transitory resolutions of the conflicts between the drives of the Id and the drives of the ego. The first defense mechanism is '''[[Psychological repression|repression]]''', the blocking of memories, emotional impulses, and ideas from the conscious mind; yet it does not resolve the Id–Ego conflict. The second defense mechanism is '''[[Identification (psychology)|identification]]''', by which the child incorporates, to his or her ego, the personality characteristics of the same-sex parent; in so adapting, the girl facilitates identifying with mother, because she understands that, in being females, neither of them possesses a penis, thus are not antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, A., Trombley, S. (1999) ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Harper Collins: London pp. 205, 107&lt;/ref&gt; If sexual competition for the opposite-sex parent is unresolved, a phallic-stage [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] might arise, leading a girl to become a woman who continually strives to dominate men (viz. [[penis envy]]), either as an unusually seductive woman (high self-esteem) or as an unusually submissive woman (low self-esteem). In a boy, a phallic-stage fixation might lead him to become a vain, over-ambitious man. Therefore, the satisfactory parental handling and resolution of the Electra complex are most important in developing the infantile [[super-ego]], because, by identifying with a parent, the girl internalizes [[morality]]; thereby, she chooses to comply with societal rules, rather than being reflexively compelled to comply, for fear of punishment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Case studies ==
[[File:Princecharming.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Prince Charming]] hero meets [[Cinderella]] heroine (1912)]]
A 1921 study of patients at a New York state mental hospital, ''On the Prognostic Significance of the Mental Content in Manic-Depressive Psychosis'', reported that of 31 [[Manic depression|manic-depressive]] patients studied, 22 (70%) had been diagnosed as afflicted with an Electra complex; and that 12 of the 22 patients had [[Regression (psychology)|regressed]] to early stages of [[psychosexual development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levin |first=Hyman L. |year=1921 |title=On the prognostic significance of the mental content in manic-depressive psychosis |journal=The State Hospital Quarterly |volume=VII |pages=594–95 |accessdate=2010-11-18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qpXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electra in fiction ==
Fiction affords people the opportunity to [[Identification (psychology)|identify]] with the protagonists of fantastic stories depicting what might be if they could act upon their [[Libido|desires]]. Often, in aid to promoting social conformity, the [[myth]], story, [[Dramaturgy|stage play]], or [[film]] presents a story meant to frighten people from acting upon their desires.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Arthur Asa. ''Media Analysis Techniques'', 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks:Sage Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of infantile [[socialization]], [[fairy tales]] fulfill said function; boys and girls identify with the [[hero]] and [[heroine]] in the course of their adventures. Often, the travails of hero and heroine are caused by an evil stepmother who is envious of him, her, or both, and will obstruct their fulfilling of desire. Girls, especially in the three-to-six year age range, can especially identify with a heroine for whom the love of a [[prince charming]] will sate her [[penis envy]]. Moreover, stories such as [[Cinderella]] have two maternal figures, the stepmother (society) and the [[fairy godmother]]; stepmother represents the girl's feelings towards mother; the fairy godmother teaches the girl that her (step) mother loves her, thus, to have mother’s love, the girl must emulate the good Cinderella, not the wicked stepsisters.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Arthur Asa ''Media Analysis Techniques'' 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks: Sage Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electra in poetry ==
The American poet [[Sylvia Plath]] (1932–1963) acknowledged that the poem ''Daddy'' (1962) is about a woman, afflicted with an unresolved Electra complex, who conflates her dead father and derelict husband in dealing with having been emotionally abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyne, Susan R. ''Sylvia Plath’s Ariel Poems'' Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Her biographers noted a psychologic irony about the life of the poet Plath: she knew her father for only eight years, before he died; she knew her husband for eight years, before she killed herself. Her husband was her substitute father, [[Psychosexual development|psychosexually]] apparent when she addresses him (the husband) as the "vampire father" haunting her since his death. In conflating father and husband as one man, Sylvia Plath indicates their emotional equality in her life; the unresolved Electra complex.&lt;ref&gt;Plath, Sylvia "Daddy" ''Ariel'' Harper &amp; Row:New York (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[engineering]], a '''free body diagram''' (force diagram,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|access-date= 2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or FBD) is a graphical illustration used to visualize the applied forces, movements, and resulting reactions on a body in a given condition. They depict a body or connected bodies with all of the applied forces and moments, as well as reactions, that act on that/those body(ies). The [[free body|body]] may consist of multiple internal members, for example, a [[truss]], or be a compact body such as a [[beam (structure)|beam]]. A series of free bodies and other diagrams may be necessary to solve complex problems.

== Purpose ==
Free body diagrams are used to visualize the forces and moments applied to a body and calculate the resulting reactions, in many types of mechanics problems. Most free body diagrams are used both to determine the loading of individual structural components as well as calculating internal forces within the structure in almost all engineering disciplines from Biomechanics to Structural.&lt;ref name = "ruina"&gt;{{cite book

In the [[physics education|educational environment]], learning to draw a free body diagram is an important step in understanding certain  topics in physics, such as [[statics]], [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and other forms of [[classical mechanics]].

==Features==

A free body diagram is not meant to be a scaled drawing. It is a diagram that is modified as the problem is solved. There is an art and flexibility to the process. The iconography of a free body diagram, not only how it is drawn but also how it is interpreted, depends upon how a body is modeled.&lt;ref name="Puri1996"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Avinash|last=Puri|title=The Art of Free-body Diagrams|journal=Physics Education|volume=31|issue=3|year=1996|page=155|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/31/3/015|bibcode = 1996PhyEd..31..155P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free body diagrams consist of:
* A simplified version of the body (often a dot or a box)
* Forces shown as straight arrows pointing in the direction they act on the body
* Moments shown as curved arrows pointing in the direction they act on the body
* A coordinate system
* Frequently reaction to applied forces are shown with hash marks through the stem of the arrow

The number of forces and moments shown in a free body diagram depends on the specific problem and the assumptions made; common assumptions are neglecting air resistance, friction and assuming rigid bodies. In statics all forces and moments must balance to zero; the physical interpretation of this is that if the forces and moments do not sum to zero the body is accelerating and the principles of statics do not apply. In dynamics the resultant forces and moments can be non-zero.

Free body diagrams may not represent an entire physical body. Using what is known as a "cut" only portions of a body are selected for modeling. This technique exposes internal forces, making them external, therefore allowing analysis. This technique is often used several times, iteratively to peel back forces acting on a physical body.  For example, a gymnast performing the iron cross: analyzing the ropes and the person lets you know the total force (body weight, neglecting rope weight, breezes, buoyancy, electrostatics, relativity, rotation of the earth, etc..). Then cut the person out and only show one rope. You get force direction. Then only look at the person, now you can get hand forces. Now only look at the arm to get the shoulder forces and moments, and on and on until the component you intend to analyze is exposed.

=== Modeling the body  ===

A body may be modeled 
in three ways:

* ''a particle''. This model may be used when any rotational effects are zero or have no interest even though the body itself may be extended. The body may be represented by a small symbolic blob and the diagram reduces to a set of concurrent arrows. A force on a particle is a ''bound'' vector.
* ''rigid extended''. Stresses and strains are of no interest but turning effects are. A force arrow should lie along the line of force, but where along the line is irrelevant. A force on an extended rigid body is a ''sliding'' vector.
* ''non-rigid extended''. The ''point of application'' of a force becomes crucial and has to be indicated on the diagram. A force on a non-rigid body is a ''bound'' vector. Some use the tail of the arrow to indicate the point of application. Others use the tip.

==== Example: A body in free fall ====
[[File:Empty rigid bucket.svg|thumb|200px|Figure 2: An empty rigid bucket in free fall in a uniform gravitational field with the force arrow at the center of gravity.]]

Consider a body in free fall in a uniform gravitational field. The body may be

* ''a particle''. It is enough to show a single vertically downward pointing arrow attached to a blob.
* ''rigid extended''. A single arrow suffices to represent the weight ''W'' even though gravitational attraction acts on every particle of the body.  
* ''non-rigid extended''. In non-rigid analysis, it would be an error to associate a single point of application with the gravitational force.

===What is included===

An FBD represents the body of interest and the external forces on it.

* The body: This is usually sketched in a schematic way depending on the body - particle/extended, rigid/non-rigid - and on what questions are to be answered. Thus if [[rotation]] of the body and [[torque]] is in consideration, an indication of size and shape of the body is needed. For example, the [[Suspension (motorcycle)#Brake dive|brake dive]] of a motorcycle cannot be found from a single point, and a sketch with finite dimensions is required. 
* The external forces: These are indicated by labelled arrows. In a fully solved problem, a  force arrow is capable of indicating
** the direction and the line of action&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The line of action is important where moment matters&lt;/ref&gt;
** the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]
** the point of application.
** a reaction as opposed to an applied load if a hash is present through the arrow

Typically, however, a provisional free body sketch is drawn before all these things are known. After all, the whole point of the diagram is to help to determine magnitude, direction, and point of application of the external loads! Thus when a force arrow is originally drawn its length may not be meant to indicate the unknown magnitude. Its line may not correspond to the exact line of action. Even its direction may turn out to be wrong. Very often the original direction of the arrow may be directly opposite to the true direction. External forces known to be small that are known to have negligible effect on the result of the analysis, are sometimes omitted, but only after careful consideration or after other analysis proving it (e.g. buoyancy forces of the air in the analysis of a chair, or atmospheric pressure on the analysis of a frying pan).

The external; forces acting on the object include [[friction]], [[gravitation|gravity]], [[normal force]], [[drag (physics)|drag]], [[tension (physics)|tension]], or a [[muscle|human force]] due to pushing or pulling. When in a [[non-inertial reference frame]] (see coordinate system, below), [[fictitious force]]s, such as [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal pseudoforce]] are appropriate.

A [[coordinate system]] is sometimes included, and is chosen according to convenience (or advantage). Savvy selection of coordinate frame may make defining the vectors simpler when writing the equations of motion. The ''x'' direction might be chosen to point down the ramp in an [[inclined plane]] problem, for example. In that case the friction force only has an ''x'' component, and the normal force only has a ''y'' component. The force of gravity will still have components in both the ''x'' and ''y'' direction: ''mg''sin(''θ'') in the ''x'' and ''mg''cos(''θ'') in the ''y'', where ''θ'' is the angle between the ramp and the horizontal.

===Exclusions===
There are some things that a free body diagram explicitly excludes. Although other sketches that include these things may be helpful in visualizing a problem, a proper free body diagram should ''not'' show:
 
* Bodies other than the free body.
* Constraints.
** (The body is not free from constraints; the constraints have just been replaced by the forces and moments that they exert on the body.)
* Forces exerted ''by'' the free body.
**(A diagram showing the forces exerted both on ''and'' by a body is likely to be confusing since all the forces will cancel out. By [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's 3rd law]] if body ''A'' exerts a force on body ''B'' then ''B'' exerts an equal and opposite force on ''A''. This should not be confused with the equal and opposite forces that are necessary to hold a body in equilibrium.)
* Internal forces. 
** (For example, if an entire [[truss]] is being analyzed, the forces between the individual truss members are not included.)
* Velocity or acceleration vectors.

==Analysis==
A free body diagram is analyzed by summing all of the forces, often accomplished by summing the forces in each of the axis directions. When the net force is zero, the body must be at rest or must be moving at a constant velocity (constant speed and direction), by [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|Newton's first law]]. If the net force is not zero, then the body is accelerating in that direction according to [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law]].

===Angled forces===
[[File:Vector components.JPG|thumb|right|Angled force (''F'') broken down into horizontal (''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'') and vertical (''F&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'') components]]
Determining the sum of the forces is straightforward if all they are aligned with the coordinate frame's axes, but it is somewhat more complex if some forces are not aligned. It is often convenient to analyze the components of the forces, in which case the symbols ΣF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and ΣF&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; are used instead of ΣF. Forces that point at an angle to the diagram's coordinate axis can be broken down into two parts (or three, for three dimensional problems)—each part being directed along one of the axes—horizontally (''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'') and vertically (''F&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'').

== Example: A block on an inclined plane ==
A simple free body diagram, shown above, of a block on a ramp illustrates this.
* All external supports and structures have been replaced by the forces they generate. These include:
** ''mg'': the product of the mass of the block and the constant of gravitation acceleration: its weight.
** ''N'': the '''normal''' force of the ramp.
** ''F&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'': the '''friction''' force of the ramp.
* The force vectors show direction and point of application and are labeled with their magnitude.
* It contains a coordinate system that can be used when describing the vectors.

Some care is needed in interpreting the diagram.
* The normal force has been shown to act at the midpoint of the base, but if the block is in static equilibrium its true location is directly below the center of mass, where the weight acts, because that is necessary to compensate for the moment of the friction. 
* Unlike the weight and normal force, which are expected to act at the tip of the arrow, the friction force is a sliding vector and thus the point of application is not relevant, and the friction acts all along the whole base.

The '''Global Implementation Plan to End Violence Against Women and Girls''' was a recommendation from the multi-agency [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on the prevention of violence against women and girls]]. The meeting was convened as part of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|United Nations Commission on the Status of Women's]] multi-year programme of work for 2010-2014.

The "Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls" formed a priority theme for its [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women#Session reports|fifty-seventh session in 2013 (CSW57).]]
{{TOClimit}}

==Background==
The [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] took place in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] 17 - 20 September 2012 and was organised by the [[United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] ([[UN Women]]), in collaboration with the following organisations:
*[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP);
*[[United Nations Development Programme]] ([[UNDP]]);
*[[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA);
*[[United Nations Children’s Fund]] ([[UNICEF]]) and;
*[[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/en/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM announced, [[UN Women]]'s website.]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report that the meeting produced reflected the shared discussion and analysis of the major issues, gaps and challenges identified at the [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] and presented key findings and recommendations. It was intended to build on the individual papers on specific issues provided by experts prior to the meeting, and the background paper prepared by the rapporteur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls.] Background papers. Retrieved 8 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It provided inputs for the reports of the Secretary-General to the CSW and was widely disseminated in preparation to the fifty-seventh session of CSW.

[[EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#A_global_implementation_plan_to_end_violence_against_women_and_girls|Recommendations 106 - 109]] of the [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] calls for a global plan to be launched by 2015, to end violence against women and girls organised along these lines:-

'''Recommendation 109'''&lt;br /&gt;''The Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls, endorsed and supported by Member States at its launch, would aim to:''
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Intensify and scale-up global awareness of violence against women and girls as a global emergency.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Combine the best thinking on how to proceed with concrete pledges for action.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Mobilise international, regional and national action by governments, multilaterals, the private sector and civil society.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Build the foundation for an evidence and practice-informed global prevention strategy.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Increase resources available to end violence against women and girls.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

'''Recommendation 111'''&lt;br /&gt;''Development of the plan would require, among other things:''
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Identification of a small set of key policy, legal and programme-delivery targets (institutions) at the national level towards which global violence prevention efforts can be directed.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Detailed review of existing action plans, indicators, recommendations, platforms for action, policy agendas, and recommendations outlined by the Security Council, UN Treaty bodies, the special rapporteurs, and various UN agencies, with a view to closing implementation gaps and building the next stage.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Creation of a cohesive global community of key stakeholders.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Designation of strong coordinating mechanisms.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Development of an accountability framework with indicators to measure State responsiveness to the policy, legal and programme-delivery goals identified and an independent monitoring mechanism.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==United Nations Commission on the Status of Women - fifty-seventh session==
The [[United_Nations_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women#Session_reports|fifty-seventh session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] took place at the UN building, New York between 4 and 15 March 2013. The agreed conclusions from the session agreed the following four actions:
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening implementation of legal and policy frameworks and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addressing structural and underlying causes and risk factors so as to prevent violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening multisectorial services, programmes and responses to violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the evidence-base.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw57/CSW57_agreed_conclusions_advance_unedited_version_18_March_2013.pdf Unedited draft.] Retrieved 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0252-0117}} [https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2013/27 Final draft, pp. 1-17.] Retrieved 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

[[UN Women|UN Women's]] Executive Director [[Michelle Bachelet]] urged speedy implementation of the Agreed Conclusions saying, "The best way to honour the commitments made by Member States at the Commission is to work for implementation and accountability."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/2013/03/un-women-urges-implementation-of-historic-global-agreement-to-end-violence-against-women-and-girls/ Press release from UN Women, "UN Women urges implementation of historic global agreement to end violence against women and girls", 20 March 2013.

'''Hylomorphism''' (or '''hylemorphism''') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory developed by [[Aristotle]], which conceives [[wiktionary:being|being]] ([[ousia]]) as a compound of [[matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]]. The word is a 19th-century term formed from the Greek words ὕλη ''hyle'', "wood, matter", and μορφή, ''morphē'', "form".

==Matter and form==
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Aristotle defines X's matter as "that out of which" X is made.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 194b23-24&lt;/ref&gt; For example, letters are the matter of syllables.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 195a16&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "matter" is a relative term:&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 194b9&lt;/ref&gt; an object counts as matter relative to something else. For example, clay is matter relative to a brick because a brick is made of clay, whereas bricks are matter relative to a brick house.

Change is analyzed as a material transformation: matter is what undergoes a change of form.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider a lump of bronze that's shaped into a statue. Bronze is the matter, and this matter loses one form (that of a lump) and gains a new form (that of a statue).&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 195a6-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' 1045a26-29&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle's theory of [[perception]], we perceive an object by receiving its form with our sense organs.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 424a19&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, forms include complex ''[[qualia]]'' such as colors, textures, and flavors, not just shapes.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 418a11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substantial form, accidental form, and prime matter==
{{See also|Substantial form}}
Medieval philosophers who used Aristotelian concepts frequently distinguished between [[substantial form]]s and accidental forms. A substance necessarily possesses at least one substantial form. It may also possess a variety of accidental forms. For Aristotle, a "substance" (''ousia'') is an individual thing—for example, an individual man or an individual horse.&lt;ref&gt;''Categories'' 2a12-14&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial form of substance S consists of S's essential properties,&lt;ref&gt;Cross 34&lt;/ref&gt; the properties that S's matter needs in order to be the kind of substance that S is.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 24&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, S's accidental forms are S's non-essential properties,&lt;ref&gt;Cross 94&lt;/ref&gt; properties that S can lose or gain without changing into a different kind of substance.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a substance's matter will itself be a substance. If substance A is made out of substance B, then substance B is the matter of substance A. However, what is the matter of a substance that is not made out of any other substance? According to Aristotelians, such a substance has only "prime matter" as its matter. Prime matter is matter with no substantial form of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Leftow 136-37&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it can change into various kinds of substances without remaining any kind of substance all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body–soul hylomorphism==
===Basic theory===
{{See also|On the Soul|Aristotle's biology}}

Aristotle applies his theory of hylomorphism [[Aristotle's biology|to living things]]. He defines a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as that which makes a living thing alive.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 413a20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Life is a property of living things, just as knowledge and health are.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 414a3-9&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a soul is a form—that is, a specifying principle or cause—of a living thing.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 412a20, 414a15-18&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form to matter.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 412b5-7, 413a1-3, 414a15-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, Aristotle argues, there is no problem in explaining the unity of body and soul, just as there is no problem in explaining the unity of wax and its shape.&lt;ref&gt;412b5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Just as a wax object consists of wax with a certain shape, so a living organism consists of  a body with the property of life, which is its soul. On the basis of his hylomorphic theory, Aristotle rejects the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine of [[reincarnation]], ridiculing the notion that just any soul could inhabit just any body.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 407b20-24, 414a22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Timothy Robinson, it is unclear whether Aristotle identifies the soul with the body's structure.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 45-47&lt;/ref&gt; According to one interpretation of Aristotle, a properly organized body is already alive simply by virtue of its structure.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 46&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to another interpretation, the property of life—that is, the soul—is something in addition to the body's structure. Robinson uses the analogy of a car to explain this second interpretation. A running car is running not only because of its structure but also because of the activity in its engine.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 46&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, according to this second interpretation, a living body is alive not only because of its structure but also because of an additional property: the soul, which a properly organized body needs in order to be alive.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 47&lt;/ref&gt; John Vella uses [[Frankenstein]]'s monster to illustrate the second interpretation:&lt;ref&gt;Vella 92&lt;/ref&gt; the corpse lying on Frankenstein's table is already a fully organized human body, but it is not yet alive; when Frankenstein activates his machine, the corpse gains a new property, the property of life, which Aristotle would call the soul.

===Living bodies===
Some scholars have pointed out a problem facing Aristotle's theory of soul-body hylomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, ''Aristotle'' 290-93&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, a living thing's matter is its body, which needs a soul in order to be alive. Similarly, a bronze sphere's matter is bronze, which needs roundness in order to be a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain the same body after death.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, ''Aristotle'' 291&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer the same body after death.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 412b19-24&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive.&lt;ref&gt;412b15&lt;/ref&gt; But if a living thing's matter is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.

One approach to resolving this problem&lt;ref&gt;Shields, ''Aristotle'' 293&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the fact that a living body is constantly replacing old matter with new. A five-year-old body consists of different matter than does the same person's seventy-year-old body. If the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body consist of different matter, then what makes them the same body? The answer is presumably the soul. Because the five-year-old and the seventy-year-old bodies share a soul—that is, the person's life—we can identify them both as the body. Apart from the soul, we cannot identify what collection of matter is the body. Therefore, a person's body is no longer that person's body after it dies.

Another approach to resolving the problem&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "A Fundamental Problem"&lt;/ref&gt; relies on a distinction between "proximate" and "non-proximate" matter. When Aristotle says that the body is matter for a living thing, he may be using the word "body" to refer to the matter that makes up the fully organized body, rather than the fully organized body itself. Unlike the fully organized body, this "body" remains the same thing even after death. In contrast, when he says that the body is no longer the same after its death, he is using the word "body" to refer to the fully organized body.

===Intellect===
{{See also|Nous|Active intellect|Passive intellect}}
Aristotle says that the intellect (''[[nous]]''), the ability to think, has no bodily organ (in contrast with other psychological abilities, such as sense-perception and imagination).&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 429a26-27&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he says that it is not mixed with the body&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 429a24-25&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that it can exist apart from the body.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 413b24-26, 429b6&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to contradict Aristotle's claim that the soul is a form or property of the body. To complicate matters further, Aristotle distinguishes between two kinds, or two parts, of intellect.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 15-25''&lt;/ref&gt; These two intellectual powers are traditionally called the "[[passive intellect]]" and the "[[active intellect|active (or agent) intellect]]".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 50&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, interpreters of Aristotle have faced the problem of explaining how the intellect fits into Aristotle's hylomorphic theory of the soul.

According to one interpretation, a person's ability to think (unlike his other psychological abilities) belongs to some incorporeal organ distinct from his body.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Psychology" 337&lt;/ref&gt; This would amount to a form of dualism.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Psychology" 337&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to some scholars, it would not be a full-fledged [[Mind-body dualism#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Some Recent Approaches" 165&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation creates what Robert Pasnau has called the "mind-soul problem": if the intellect belongs to an entity distinct from the body, and the soul is the form of the body, then how is the intellect part of the soul?&lt;ref&gt;Pasnau 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation rests on the distinction between the passive intellect and the agent intellect. According to this interpretation, the passive intellect is a property of the body, while the agent intellect is a substance distinct from the body.&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley 534&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vella 110&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents of this interpretation think that each person has his own agent intellect, which presumably separates from the body at death.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Two Intellects" 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vella 110&lt;/ref&gt; Others interpret the agent intellect as a single divine being, perhaps the [[unmoved mover]], Aristotle's God.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Psychology" 339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Two Intellects" 199&lt;/ref&gt;

A third interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Soul as Subject"&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Soul as Subject" 142&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation, the soul is a property of the body, but the ability to think is a property of the soul itself, not of the body. If that is the case, then the soul is the body's form and yet thinking need not involve any bodily organ.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Soul as Subject" 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal hylomorphism==
The [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Solomon Ibn Gabirol|Avicebron (''a.k.a.''Solomon Ibn Gabirol)]] proposed a Neoplatonic version of this Aristotelian concept, according to which all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==Medieval modifications==
[[Medieval]] [[theology|theologians]], newly exposed to Aristotle's philosophy, applied hylomorphism to Christian doctrines such as the [[transubstantiation]] of the Eucharist's bread and wine into the body and blood of [[Jesus]]. Theologians such as [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed Christian applications of hylomorphism.

===Plurality vs. unity of substantial form===
Many medieval theologians and philosophers followed Aristotle in seeing a living being's soul as that being's form—specifically, its substantial form. However, they disagreed about whether X's soul is X's ''only'' substantial form. Some medieval thinkers argued that X's soul is X's only substantial form, responsible for all of the features of X's body.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 26&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other medieval thinkers argued that a living being contains at least two substantial forms—(1) the shape and structure of its body, and (2) its soul, which makes its body alive.&lt;ref&gt;Cross 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomistic hylomorphism===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] claimed that X’s soul was X’s only [[substantial form]], although X also had numerous accidental forms that accounted for X’s nonessential features.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul" 161&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas defined a substantial form as that which makes X's matter constitute X, which in the case of a human being is [[reason|rational capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;Leftow, "Soul, Mind, and Brain" 397&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed all other features of a human being to accidental forms.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul" 165&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aquinas did not claim that the soul was identical to the person.&lt;ref&gt;Eberl 340&lt;/ref&gt; He held that a proper human being is a composite of form and matter, specifically prime matter. Form and matter taken separately may retain some of the attributes of a human being but are nonetheless not identical to that person.&lt;ref&gt;Eberl 341&lt;/ref&gt; So a dead body is not actually or potentially a human being.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul" 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eleonore Stump]] describes Aquinas' theory of the soul in terms of "configuration". The body is matter that is "configured", i.e. structured, while the soul is a "configured configurer". In other words, the soul is itself a configured thing, but it also configures the body.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 514&lt;/ref&gt;  A dead body is merely matter that was once configured by the soul. It does not possess the configuring capacity of a human being.

Aquinas believed that rational capacity was a property of the soul alone, not of any bodily organ.&lt;ref&gt;Stump,"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 512&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did believe that the brain had some basic cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 512&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas’ attribution of rational capacity to the soul allowed him to claim that disembodied souls could retain their rational capacity, although he was adamant that such a state was unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 519&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teleology and ethics==
{{See also|Nicomachean Ethics}}
Aristotle holds a [[teleology|teleological]] worldview: he sees the universe as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists for the sake of actuality.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 237&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form,&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' 1050a15&lt;/ref&gt; and an organism has sight for the sake of seeing.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 237&lt;/ref&gt; Now, each thing has certain potentialities as a result of its form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither; we can say that the snake ''ought to'' slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.

Aristotle bases his [[ethics|ethical]] theory on this teleological worldview. Because of his form, a human being has certain abilities. Hence, his purpose in life is to exercise those abilities as well and as fully as possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a16-18&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the most characteristic human ability, which is not included in the form of any other organism, is the ability to think.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a1-5&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the best human life is a life lived rationally.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern physics==
The idea of hylomorphism can be said to have been reintroduced to the world when [[Werner Heisenberg]] invented his duplex world of quantum mechanics. In his 1958 text ''Physics and Philosophy'', Heisenberg states:

{{quote|In the experiments about atomic events we have to do with things and facts, with phenomena that are just as real as any phenomena in daily life. But atoms and the elementary particles themselves are not as real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts ... The probability wave ... mean[s] tendency for something. It's a quantitative version of the old concept of potentia from Aristotle's philosophy. It introduces something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=W.|title=Physics and Philosophy|year=1958|publisher=Allen and Unwin|location=London|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Identity control theory''' is a [[theory]] in [[sociology]] concerned with the development&lt;!-- "development" in this context should probably have an appropriate wikilink --&gt; of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of social psychology|chapter=Self and Identity|editor=John D. DeLamater|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn= 978-0-306-47695-2|author=Timothy J. Owens|pages=214&amp;ndash;216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Peter Burke, it focuses on the nature of peoples' identities and the relationship between their identities and their behavior within the realm of their social structure. The identities of the individual are rooted in their social structure. Identity Control Theory was created based on traditional symbolic interaction views where people choose their own behaviors and how their behaviors correspond to the meanings of their identity. One of the main aspects ICT deals with is how individuals view their own identities and respond to the reactions to their identities of those around them. When an individual is acting according to the identity control theory they reflect on the identity they display and how others approve or disapprove of their identity. If the individual does not like the responses of others they will look at how they can change their views of their identity or their identity towards themselves to produce a positive outcome. One of the main benefits of this theory is how negative feelings can be prevented by individuals and by those around them. The people around someone who is displaying a certain identity have the ability to be more sensitive and prevent negative feelings if they understand identity control theory because they know what will bring out a negative response. On the other hand, the individual can prevent negative feelings that coincide with the teachings of identity control theory if they understand these teachings and can apply them to their own lives.

==Identity Control Theory Components==
There are four main components of the identity control theory being '''identity standard''', '''input''', '''comparator''', and '''output'''. Each identity is viewed as a control system with these four components (Burke, 2007).

'''Identity standard''' is the first of the four components of identity control theory. Identity standard defines what it means to be who one is in a situation. The identity standard stores the self-meanings tied to social roles and membership in groups. This is the set of meanings for a given identity. The meanings in identity standard represent the goals or the way the situation is supposed to be. People act to verify or confirm their identities and in doing so they bring about a situation in which relevant meanings are consistent with their identity standard.

The next of the four components is '''input''' or also known as perceptions. Input is the meanings of how one sees oneself in a situation. These self-meanings often are derived from the way in which others see the self. This results from the feedback others have about how we come across in a given situation.

The third component of the identity control theory is '''comparator'''. The comparator compares the meanings from the input with those from the standard and registers the difference between them. This compares the perceived meanings with the meanings in the identity standard.

The final component of the theory is '''output''' or sometimes called an error or discrepancy. Output is the differences that result from the perceptions and the identity standard. Then as a function of the output, there is meaningful behavior enacted in the situation that conveys meanings about our identity. If in a setting people perceive their identity relevant meanings to be congruent with the meanings in their identity standard, that is the discrepancy is zero, people continue to do what they have been doing. If the discrepancy is not zero, people change their behavior in such a way as to counteract the disturbance and reduce the discrepancy back toward zero (Burke, 2007). These altered meanings are perceived and again compared to the meanings in the identity standard. Thus, each identity is a control system that acts to control perceptions by bringing them into congruency with the meanings of their identity standards, thus reducing toward zero any discrepancy or error caused by a disturbance(Burke,2007).

People act to verify or confirm their identities and in doing so they bring about a situation in which perceived meanings are consistent with their identity standard. If the identity is a role identity, then the behavior that brings about the changes in the situational meanings to make them consistent with the identity standard is appropriate role behavior.  If the identity is a group or category based identity, the behavior which verifies the identity is the behavior that maintains group boundaries and divisions in the social structure. By verifying identities, people create and maintain the social structure in which the identities are embedded(Burke,2007).

==Identity Control and Emotions==

As one might guess, the identity control theory has a direct correlation to an individual's emotions. This mainly stems from whether or not the person's identity is fully recognized by those around them. If they are fully recognized or recognized greatly positive emotions will be produced. On the reverse side a small amount of recognition, or a lack of recognition will produce negative emotions like anger and depression.

===Positive Emotions===

When people surrounding an individual are able to correctly notice the personal identity that the individual is attempting to convey the self-esteem of the individual is increased. Their disposition also becomes filled with positive emotions. Another thing that will increase positive emotions is if the people closest to the individual reassure the individual of their identity. This reassurance allows the individual to feel secure in their actions and be able to further predict the responses of others. These feelings of security allow the individual to express themselves in the manner they wish. This is why the positive emotions become so prominent for the individuals who experience this. The only other part of identity control theory that increases positive emotions is if an individuals identity matches their perceptions of their identity. This creates harmony for the individual and allows them to be happier than if their perceptions did not match the actual outcome of their identities.

===Negative Emotions===
[[File:Self-Discrepancy Theory2.jpg|thumb|Self-Discrepancy model explaining the outcome of actual:ideal and actual:ought discrepancies experienced by restrained eaters]]

With the identity control theory, there is more opportunity for negative emotions than positive emotions. This is because there are many more opportunities for people to misunderstand what identity an individual is attempting to display. In fact, there are four main ways a person's identity can be misinterpreted that will produce emotions of anger and other negative aspects. These four are a discrepancy between the output and the input, a lack of attention to the identity trying to be displayed, too much control over the specific identity, and a lack of practice with the identity.

'''Input vs Output''': When an individual's identity is not received by others as the individual intended, then the possibility for negative emotions increases. Often those around the individual place a different meaning on the identity than the person intended there to be. This causes great frustration for the individual and can often lead to anger as well. Another part of this discrepancy is if those around the individual completely ignore the identity the individual is hoping to display. The complete unrecognition will produce even more frustration and anger than an incorrect view of the identity.

'''Lack of Attention''': If an individual does not focus enough attention on the identity they wish to portray it will not be received fully either. This usually happens because all of their attention is normally focused on another aspect of their identity and all other facets are neglected. These neglected aspects are not displayed well by the individual, so they are not received by others as the individual hoped. This is a sure way for the individual to become down upon themselves or even extremely angry with themselves for not developing that aspect of their identities and being misunderstood.

'''Too Much Control''': When someone tries to control a certain aspect of their identity too much, they will most likely find themselves experiencing very negative feelings. This is because all the aspects of their personality are closely related because they are controlled so much. Therefore, if one aspect of their personality is not received as they had hoped, all other aspects of their personality will not be unverified. This has the potential to cause a complete identity crisis because no part of the person's identity will be reassured. This can cause the individual to panic and become filled with nervousness.
 
'''Lack of Practice''': If an individual does not practice the identity they wish to convey enough, not only will they be unsure of it, those around them will be unsure of how to respond to the individual. In fact, those around the individual will most likely show great disapproval of the individual. If that does not happen, though, they will receive very irregular responses from those around them. Disapproval can severely drop the persons self-esteem or push the individual to be hostile with those around them due to their reactions. On the other hand, irregular responses can cause the individual to become frustrated with their outcome which can lead to a great deal of anger if it is repeated many times.

One final thing to remember about all emotions that can be created through the identity control theory is the degree of closeness those evaluating the identity are to the individual. If the people around the individual are very close to the individual and they assure their identity, the individual will most likely experience extreme positive emotions. However, if they criticize the identity, the individual will experience extreme negative emotions. The opposite of this, meaning that those evaluating the identity are not extremely close to the individual, the individual's emotions will not become very extreme at all. This is because the opinions of the people close to an individual hold more weight in the individual's mind than the opinions of the people they are not close to.

==Coping Responses==
Coping responses are the product of a person processing external or internal demands that can drain a person’s mental or physical resources (Foulton, 1982).  External demands could be need for warmth, chores around the house or job, and cleanliness. Internal demands could be hunger, happiness, and control over environment. There are two parts to coping responses: first is the process of coping responses and second is the relationship between the person and outside forces.

=== The Process ===
The process can be separated into two parts. The first is summarized by what is currently happening. This includes the person's thoughts, feelings, and actions to reduce different demands (Foulton, 1982). Demands can be jobs, chores, relationships with others, and even body functions such as eating and sleeping. With different demands, one person can act in many different ways. For instance, if two people are hungry and are having problems at work, the first person might eat first then try to fix their job situation. The second person could fix their job first and then eat later. Demands are not limited to two things at a time: there can be many demands at the same time. So each person's different actions can affect the future or how things turn out. This is the second part: how current events (what is happening) affect changes in daily life or even the person's environment over time. The environment is not just limited to the outdoors, it is also the relationships with others. Acting in a certain way will bring out a certain change in the person's life, whether in the environment or in their every day life.

=== The Relationship ===
The relationship between the person and outside forces is the second part of coping responses. This relationship can be summarized by how the person views the environment. Again, the environment is not just the outdoor life, it is also the relationships in a person's life with others. A person first evaluates what is at stake in the environment. Beliefs, values, goals, commitments, and physical safety are all at stake (Foulton, 1982). After the stakes have been figured out, the person then must figure out what they can do. This depends on the availability of resources to keep all that is at stake. When the stakes go up, and the resources go down, more coping responses must be used: there is more stress (Foulton, 1982). Coping responses hopefully change the relationship between the person and the environment by changing the situation or the person's feelings about it.

=== The Functions ===
The [[Function (biology)|functions]] of coping responses are to reduce [[Stress (medicine)|stress]]; they help restore an equilibrium (Foulton, 1982). Here are some examples: defense mechanisms help reduce tension; decision-making responses involves seeking and evaluating information; coping responses with illness involves the reduction of harmful environmental conditions and the maintenance of a positive self-image (Foulton, 1982). There are two groups that these responses can be broken down to. One group is problem-focused and the other is emotional-focused (Foulton, 1982). '''Problem-focused''' responses include cognitive strategies and behavioral strategies. A [[cognitive]] strategy would be analyzing the situation. [[Behavioral]] would be figuring out how to act or which actions to use. These responses are more likely to occur when there is more opportunity for personal control (Foulton, 1982). When there is less opportunity for personal control, then emotion focused responses are used. '''Emotion-focused''' responses also include cognitive strategies and behavioral strategies. A [[cognitive]] response is thinking positively or even looking at things from a different perspective. A [[behavioral]] response would be to seek emotional support (Foulton, 1982). Getting a pet or making new friends could also fit in this category. Both problem and emotional influence each other. For instance, if someone is consumed by an emotion, then they might have to get that under control before they can begin to analyze the situation. Or to control an emotion, someone would reason out what was causing the emotion, thus controlling it.

==New Research==

===Identity Control and Social Interaction===

One aspect of new research found with the identity control theory relates to [[social interaction]] and identities. According to social psychologist [[Richard L. Jenkins|Richard Jenkins]], they are vital to each other. The basic principle that Jenkins tries to present is that if social interactions do not exist it is impossible for the main principles of Burke's identity control theory to exist. An individual's identity cannot be approved or disapproved if they do not interact with others. In the reverse direction, if people do not develop their identities enough, it would be impossible for them to interact with those around them fully. Jenkins says that the two go hand in hand and allow the other to function as sociologists have predicted them to. To further understand the relation between social interaction and identity control theory, one must look at the relationships between identity control theory and other sociological ideas. Many other ideas in sociology concern how individuals act in social interactions, which can further the idea of identity control theory. Individuals derive meanings of the majority of the occurrences in their lives through interactions with others. Because of this, it is safe to look at identity control theory and say that as an individual repeats social interactions and receives the same reactions, they can become secure and feel positive emotions regarding their identity. However, if the reactions are inconsistent, the security needed for positive emotions related to their identity is not present. This is because the social interactions confuse the individual instead of allowing them to understand what is occurring around them. Without fully understanding what is going on around them, it would be impossible to fully form and be confident in their identity.

==Connections to Other Sociological Ideas==

===Looking Glass Self===

Looking Glass Self is a sociological term that was introduced by a man named Charles Horton Cooley. This term makes a connection between the reactions of a group and the reactions of an individual. Cooley is saying that a person's opinion of oneself is determined by the opinions of those around them. The group around the person acts as a mirror for them and shows a reflection of how they should view themselves. According to this, if the group thinks an individual is "odd" the individual will view themselves as "odd". This relates to identity control theory in many ways, in fact this idea allowed the identity control theory to be formed. In identity control theory, the individuals feelings arise from the reactions of the group around them. If these two ideas are looked at collectively, an individual would view themselves exactly how the group did and then their feelings would be brought out by whether their current view of self matched their previous view of self. For example, if an individual originally viewed themselves as more of a scholar than an athlete, but the group around them started to view them as an athlete more than an individual their view of themselves would turn to more of an athlete according to looking glass self. But, following identity control theory this individuals input would not match their output which would have the potential to induce negative feelings. This can also be seen in the reverse because if the principle of looking glass self caused the output of an individual to match their input, positive emotions would be brought out. With that being said, the idea of looking glass self has the ability to manipulate the emotional responses of individuals in regards to identity control theory.

===Mead's Mind and Self===

A man named George Herbert Mead furthered the ideas of self that were started by Cooley. Mead used two terms to further the understanding of social interaction. The first of these terms is '''mind'''. Mind, in this sense of the word, is being able to understand symbols that are used in everyday social interactions. Mead states that as an individual's interaction with others is repeated their mind becomes more developed. In other words, as people repeatedly interact with those around them, their ability to understand the symbols involved in the interactions more clearly. The more developed an individual's mind is, the easier social interaction will be for them. The second term brought about by Mead is '''self'''. In this context, self is the understanding a person creates of how others respond to them. Like the concept of mind, self is brought out by social interaction. By looking at how a group reacts to an individual, Mead says that the individual can not only come to understand their own identity but to also see things from the perspective of another individual. This means that one can imagine what things would be like if they were in another's situation. If this occurs over and over again the individual can begin to generalize what others will expect of the individual and how they will react to them. These relate to identity control theory because understanding the symbols involved in social interaction and being able to predict the outcomes of interaction can help and individual prevent the negative feelings that can be associated with identity control theory. If one can predict how people will react to their identity, they can make changes to their identity that will allow their personal view of their identity to match the view others have of their identity. This will draw positive emotions from the person rather than negative ones, which is what individuals strive for in regards to identity control theory.

'''''Il Verri''''' is an [[Italian language|Italian]] quarterly [[literary magazine]], which has been published since 1956. The magazine is based in [[Milan]], Italy.

==History and profile==
''Il Verri'' was started by [[Luciano Anceschi]] in Milan in 1956.&lt;ref name="gino"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gino Moliterno|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Italian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WvGGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-75876-0|page=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pet"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Bondanella|title=Umberto Eco and the Open Text: Semiotics, Fiction, Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2vAv7e9ZQMC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=3 April 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44200-8|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gae"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gaetana Marrone|author2=Paolo Puppa|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9NcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA985|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=26 December 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45530-9|page=985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is published on a quarterly basis.&lt;ref name="nla"/&gt; Its headquarters is in Milan.&lt;ref name=pet/&gt;&lt;ref name="nla"&gt;{{cite web|title=Il Verri|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18797464?selectedversion=NBD4585623|work=National Library of Australia|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1973 it temporarily moved to [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name="pet"/&gt;

In the early 1960s ''Il Verri'' began to cover the writings of [[Neoavanguardia|neo avant garde]] authors, including [[Umberto Eco]], [[Edoardo Sanguineti]], [[Antonio Porta (author)|Antonio Porta]] and [[Nanni Balestrini]].&lt;ref name=gino/&gt; They were part of a literary circle called Gruppo 63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka|title=Man within His Life-World: Contributions to Phenomenology by Scholars from East-Central Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hYyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT443|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=29 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-009-2587-8|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine played a significant role for Umberto Eco in shaping his theories.&lt;ref name="pet"/&gt; [[Luciano Erba]] and Alfredo Giuliani were also among the contributors.&lt;ref name="pet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gino Moliterno|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Italian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WvGGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-75876-0|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its start in 1956 ''Il Verri'' has been instrumental in making some approaches familiar in Italy such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[structuralism]] and [[semiology]].&lt;ref name="gae"/&gt; The magazine also covers poems and in 1961 Luciano Anceschi collected them in a book.&lt;ref name="gae"/&gt;

Group rights, also known as collective rights, are [[rights]] held by a group ''qua'' group rather than by its members severally;&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-group/ |title=Group Rights (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast, individual rights are rights held by [[Individuality|individual people]]; even if they are group-differentiated, which most rights are, they remain individual rights if the right-holders are the individuals themselves.&lt;ref name="Jones 2010"&gt;{{harvp|Jones|2010|p=39ss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group rights have historically been used both to infringe upon and to facilitate individual rights, and the concept remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Bisaz 2012"&gt;{{harvp|Bisaz|2012|pp=7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational group rights==
Besides the rights of groups based upon the immutable characteristics of their individual members, other group rights cater toward organizational persons, including nation-states, [[trade union]]s, [[corporation]]s, trade associations, chambers of commerce, [[political parties]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Such organizations are accorded rights which are particular to their specifically-stated functions and their capacities to speak on behalf of their members, i.e. the capacity of the corporation to speak to the government on behalf of all individual customers or employees or the capacity of the trade union to [[Collective bargaining|negotiate for benefits with employers on behalf of all workers in a company]].

==Philosophies==
In the political views of [[classical liberal]]s and some [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarians]], the role of the government is solely to identify, protect, and enforce the natural rights of the individual while attempting to assure just remedies for transgressions. Liberal governments that respect individual rights often provide for systemic controls that protect individual rights such as a system of [[due process]] in [[criminal justice]]. Proponents of this philosophy,  such as [[Jordan Peterson]], situate individual rights as in dialectical opposition to [[Collectivism|collective]] rights, suggesting that the two are mutually exclusive, and that philosophies and political theories that value collective rights do so at the expense of the individual and their rights. Peterson cites this sacrifice of the individual for the collective as reason to oppose left-wing ideologies, with particular reference to communism, alleging that "group rights are catastrophic"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Rational National|title=Jordan Peterson Claims ‘Group Rights’ Are Catastrophic|date=2018-05-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhhsl5iI1DI|accessdate=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Critics of Peterson's reasoning suggest that his argument is based on a fallacious false-dichotomy that implies individual and group rights are mutually exclusive, separate and opposed; instead proposing that the two are inherently connected and require one another to ensure both are secured. Without certain collective rights, for example, a cardinal principle in international law, enshrined in Chapter I Article I of the [[United Nations Charter]], secures the right of "[[Self-determination]] of ''peoples''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html|title=Charter of the United Nations, Chapter 1: Purposes &amp; Principles|last=|first=|date=|website=www.un.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without this group right, the ''people'' have no means or authority to assert the individual rights that self-determination enables the establishment of. If ''people'' are unable to determine their collective future, they are certainly unable to assert or ensure their individual rights, future and freedoms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/rights-group/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Jones|first=Peter|date=2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to individual-collective dichotomy proposed by Peterson and contemporaries, critics suggest that both are necessarily connected and intertwined, rejecting the assertion that they exist in a mutually exclusive relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Ayn Rand]], developer of the philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], asserted that a group, as such, has no rights. She maintained that only an individual can possess rights, and therefore the expression "individual rights" is a redundancy, while the expression "collective rights" is a contradiction in terms. In this view, a person can neither acquire new rights by joining a group nor lose the rights which he does possess. Man can be in a group without want or the group minority, without rights. According to this philosophy, individual rights are not subject to a public vote, a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority, the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from the will of majorities, and the smallest minority on earth is the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualrights.html |title=Individual Rights – Ayn Rand Lexicon |publisher=Aynrandlexicon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand offers several unique perspectives on rights, holding that 1. ontologically, rights are neither attributes nor conventions but principles of morality, having, therefore, the same epistemic status as any other moral principle; 2. rights "define and sanction man's freedom of action,";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1964|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3. as protectors of freedom of action, rights do not mean "entitlements" to be supplied with any goods or services;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1964|pp=110, 113–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4. "Man's rights can be violated only by the use of physical force. It is only by means of physical force that one man can deprive another of his life, or enslave him, or rob him, or prevent him from pursuing his own goals, or compel him to act against his own rational judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1964|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5. rights derive from the mind's needs: for an organism that survives by means of reason, freedom is a survival-requirement:initiated force negates or paralyzes the thinking mind. Rand's overall argument is that rights protect freedom in order to protect reason. "Force and mind are opposites."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1957|p=1023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Smith]], in 1776 in his book [[The Wealth of Nations|''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'']], describes the right of each successive generation, as a group, collectively, to the earth and all the earth possesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stewart|1811|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Declaration of Independence|''Declaration of Independence'']] states several group, or collective, rights of the people as well as the states, for example the Right of the People: "whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it" and the right of  the States: "... as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do."

'''Jonathan A. Rapping''' is an American criminal defense attorney, founder and president of [[Gideon's Promise]], and professor of law at [[Atlanta's John Marshall Law School]] and [[Harvard Law School]]. Rapping received the [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur "Genius" Award]] in 2014.

Rapping regularly writes about issues related to criminal defense and the criminal justice system. He is a contributor for The Nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/authors/jonathan-rapping|title=Jonathan Rapping|work=The Nation|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talk Poverty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkpoverty.org/person/jonathan-rapping/|title=Jonathan Rapping Archives - Talk Poverty|work=Talk Poverty|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Association For Public Defense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicdefenders.us/?q=user/12|title=jon.rapping - National Association for Public Defense|work=publicdefenders.us|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Huffington Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-rapping/|title=Jonathan Rapping|work=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also maintains a blog called Fulfilling the Promise: Insights to Forging a Path to Meaningful Justice Reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonrapping.com/|title=Jon Rapping|work=Jon Rapping|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, family and education==
Rapping grew up in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. At a young age, Rapping went to demonstrations and protests with his mother, [[Elayne Rapping]], a community organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women's movements.&lt;ref name=Trend&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Karen|title=Transforming Public Defense|url=http://atlantatrend.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=870&amp;catid=40|publisher=Atlanta Trend|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of working with his activist mother taught Rapping about [[social justice]], and trying to change things in the world that aren't fair or right.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Friends of Rapping's family were even arrested and he admired the lawyers who worked to keep them out of jail.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; After witnessing social justice activism as a young person, Rapping aspired to be a criminal defense attorney at a young age.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;

Rapping attended [[Allderdice High School]] in [[Squirrel Hill (Pittsburgh)|Squirrel Hill]], and graduated in 1984.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branddolph|first1=Adam|title=Professor, lawyer with Pittsburgh ties earn MacArthur 'genius grants' |url=http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/6811526-74/foundation-hayes-macarthur#axzz3bVIhvdvN|website=triblive.com|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Rapping attended the [[University of Chicago]] where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[economics]] ''[[cum laude]]''.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; People close to Rapping convinced him that he would incur tremendous debt if he went to law school, so he worked as a research assistant with the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. for two years,&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; following in the footsteps of his father, [[Leonard Rapping]], a well-known economist.  Rapping earned a scholarship to attend the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]] where he earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;  Rapping's sister, Alison Rapping has spent her career in the non-profit sector, and is widely considered a leader in that realm.  Both siblings attribute their commitment to social justice to the influence of their parents.

Right after graduating from Princeton and still unfulfilled, Rapping decided to attend [[George Washington University School of Law]] in Washington, D.C. After his first year of law school at GWU, Rapping interned with the [[Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia]], where he found his calling.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; He worked at PDS throughout law school.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;

While living in Washington, Rapping met and married his wife, Ilham Askia, who was teaching at an elementary school and then spent two years at a charter high school for court involved children.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Askia was born in [[Buffalo, New York]] and every man in her family has been a victim of the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Askia's father went to [[Attica Correctional Facility]] when she was five years old.  She helped raise her younger brother who ended up in prison.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Askia became a teacher to break the [[school-to-prison pipeline]], but soon questioned how much of a difference she could make on the front end.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;  This led to her joining Rapping to start Gideon's Promise and, ultimately, to become the organization's Executive Director, where she advocates for attacking the pipeline on the back end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0IGzOEHuaQ|title=Gideon's Promise receives 2015 MLK, Jr. Community Service Award|date=29 January 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

===Public defender===
After law school, Rapping worked as a staff attorney for The [[Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia]] (1995–2004), where he served his final three years as training director.&lt;ref name=Mac&gt;{{cite web|title=MacArthur Fellows / Meet the Class of 2014|url=http://www.macfound.org/fellows/925/|website=macfound.org|publisher=MacArthur Foundation|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004-2006, Rapping was the training director for the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt;

From 2006-2007, he served as training chief for the New Orleans Office of the Public Defender.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt; In recognition of his work in New Orleans to rebuild the public defender system post-[[Hurricane Katrina]], he was a co-recipient of the Lincoln Leadership Award, given by Kentucky's Department of Public Advocacy to honor leadership in national efforts to improve indigent defense.

===Gideon's Promise===
In 2007, Rapping created the Southern Public Defender Training Center, subsequently renamed [[Gideon's Promise]], along with his wife, Ilham Askia. Named after the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case Gideon v. Wainwright, Gideon's Promise teaches public defenders to work more effectively within the judicial system by providing coaching, training, and professional development as well as a supportive network of peers and mentors from around the country. Rapping received a grant to help start the center from [[George Soros]]' [[Open Society Foundations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over $1 Million Awarded to Visionary Leaders in Criminal Justice|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/press-releases/over-1-million-awarded-visionary-leaders-criminal-justice|publisher=Open Society Foundations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, the organization has grown from a single training program for sixteen attorneys in two offices in Georgia and Louisiana, to a multi-tiered enterprise with over 300 participants in more than 35 offices across 15 mostly Southern states. An initial three-year "Core" program for new public defenders has since expanded into a comprehensive model that includes programs for graduates of the initial Core program as they continue their development, public defender leaders, trainers and supervisors, and law students. Further, the organization is unique in that it intervenes at the trial stage, rather than after conviction, where challenges to criminal injustice often take place.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt;

In 2013, HBO Films produced a documentary called [[Gideon's Army]], based in part on the Gideon's Promise program and highlighting participants in the program.

Gideon's Promise has won numerous awards including [[Emory University]]'s 2014 Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Service Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.emory.edu/stories/2015/01/er_king_week_events/campus.html|title=Emory honors MLK legacy with service, awards, special events|work=emory.edu|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Southern Center for Human Rights]]' 2013 Gideon's Promise Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schr.org/action/resources/schr_to_honor_justice_harold_clarke_with_lifetime_achievement_award|title=SCHR to Honor Justice Harold Clarke with Lifetime Achievement Award|work=schr.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Association of Sentencing Advocates and Mitigation Specialists 2013 Sentencing Project Award, and the American College of Trail Lawyers' 2011 Emil Gumpert Award.

In 2014, Rapping became the Director of Strategic Planning and Organizational Development for the [[Maryland Office of the Public Defender]]. In 2014, Rapping earned a [[MacArthur Foundation]] "Genius Fellow."&lt;ref name=ATL&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Michelle|title=Atlanta lawyer Jonathan Rapping wins MacArthur 'genius grant'|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/atlanta-lawyer-jonathan-rapping-wins-macarthur-gen/nhN5M/|website=ajc.com|publisher=AJC|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law professor===
Since 2007, Rapping has also been an associate professor at Atlanta's John Marshall Law School.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt; In 2015 he was promoted to full Professor.  Rapping is also a visiting associate professor of law at Harvard Law School.&lt;ref name=harvard&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Bio for Rapping|url=http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11243/Rapping|website=harvard.edu|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Rapping was selected as one of Harvard Law School's Wasserstein Public Interest Fellows in recognition of his contribution to the public interest legal arena.&lt;ref name=harvard/&gt; In 2013, Rapping was the Public Interest Scholar in Residence at Touro Law School.&lt;ref name=touro&gt;{{cite web|last1=Touro Law Center|title=Distinguished Public Interest Lawyer in Residence Program|url=http://law.touro.edu/AboutTouroLaw/?pageid=379#.VBoXOvldV8E|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings &amp; views==
Rapping has been a leading voice in discussing how culture shapes our [[criminal justice system]].  He has written and talked extensively about the culture of criminal justice, has theorized how criminal justice reform can be accomplished through cultural transformation, and through his work with Gideon's Promise, has applied his ideas to build a movement of public defenders to drive criminal justice reform.  He is a thought leader in articulating the critical role public defenders must play in any comprehensive criminal justice reform strategy.  His work in this area earned him a 2014 MacArthur "Genius" grant.

Rapping first applied organizational culture theory to indigent defense reform in his 2007 article, Directing the Winds of Change.&lt;ref name=winds/&gt; In 2009, he laid out a vision for how to put this theory to practice in describing the work of the Southern Public Defender Training Center (the precursor to Gideon's Promise) in You Can't Build on Shaky Ground.&lt;ref name=shaky/&gt;  He made the case that supporting public defenders in their quest to drive cultural transformation should be a priority of the [[United States federal government]] in National Crisis, National Neglect.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt;  And in 2012—applying his work to prosecutors in Who's Guarding the Henhouse—he examined how prosecutors too have been shaped by the existing criminal justice culture and, as a result, help perpetuate injustice.&lt;ref name=henhouse/&gt;

Believing that well-intentioned professionals are shaped by a criminal justice system that has become unmoored from is foundational values, Rapping's vision involves supporting defenders as they struggle to resist the pressure to adapt to the status quo.  This vision is best articulated in his article "Redefining Success as a Public Defender"&lt;ref name=redefine/&gt; and in a speech he delivered at Touro Law School.&lt;ref name=Tourotalk&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IgR_jBnt_E|title=Jonathan Rapping - Touro Law - 2013 Public Interest Lawyer in Residence - Public Speech|date=16 October 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has examined how the American story of justice has evolved to a narrative that would be unrecognizable to our founding fathers in "Reviving the Hero Image of the Public Defender."&lt;ref name=reviving/&gt;  He has analyzed how defenders can combat the pernicious role of race in driving this culture in "Implicitly Unjust."&lt;ref name=implicit/&gt;  And in "Retuning Gideon's Trumpet," he answers skeptics who believe public defenders are only important to individuals and play no role in driving systemic reform.&lt;ref name=retuning/&gt;

Rapping frequently addresses criminal justice issues of the day by promoting a narrative in which a movement of public defenders, serving as the voice for the vast majority of people in the criminal justice system, serve as the catalyst for reform.  As the nation grappled with a seeming epidemic of police killings of young black men like Michael Brown, [[Eric Garner]], and Tamir Rice, Rapping urged that we not see that issue as disconnected from "routine injustice" destroying poor communities of color every day.  In "It's Not Just the Cops"&lt;ref name=cops/&gt; and "From Ferguson to Staten Island: In Case Anyone Doubted the Public Needs Defending,"&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; he argues that public defenders are a necessary component to a comprehensive strategy to realize equal justice that is illusive throughout the criminal justice system.  In "The Other Baltimore Story," he makes a similar argument as the nation focused its attention on the killing of [[Death of Freddie Gray|Freddy Gray]] by reminding us of the routine injustice in [[Baltimore]] through the story of Ronald Hammond, and the response of public defenders.&lt;ref name=bmore/&gt;

In articles like "Continuing the March of Civil Rights Warriors in Selma,"&lt;ref name=selma/&gt; "One of the Most Important Civil and Human Rights Battles of Our Time,"&lt;ref name=battle/&gt; and "Redefining Success as a Public Defender,"&lt;ref name=redefine/&gt; Rapping makes the case that criminal justice is the civil rights struggle of this generation and that public defenders are on the front lines of that battle.

He routinely tips his hat to the men and women who represent poor people accused of crimes, particularly in essays like "Reviving the Hero Image of the Public Defender By Changing the Story of Our Clients,"&lt;ref name=hero/&gt; "To All the Patriots Out There, and Especially Our Public Defenders,"&lt;ref name=patriots/&gt; and "Gideon's Orchestra: It's Time For the Encore."&lt;ref name=orchestra/&gt;  And in pieces like "The Special Few"&lt;ref name=special/&gt; and "Who Will Heal the Public Defenders,"&lt;ref name=heal/&gt; he explains the emotional toll that makes this work so difficult.

Rapping's 2015 TEDx Atlanta talk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-j20aGs6uU|title=Building a new generation of public defenders - Jonathan Rapping - TEDxAtlanta|date=8 May 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a powerful articulation of the critical role of culture in shaping our criminal justice system and the importance of a public defender movement to transforming it.

A '''loop''' in [[mathematics]], in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from the [[unit interval]] ''I'' = [0,1] to ''X'' such that ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(1). In other words, it is a [[path (topology)|path]] whose initial point is equal to the terminal point.&lt;ref name="ils"&gt;{{citation|title=Infinite Loop Spaces|volume=90|series=Annals of mathematics studies|first=John Frank|last=Adams|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1978|isbn=9780691082066|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2rYkg9lGnsC&amp;pg=PA3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A loop may also be seen as a continuous map ''f'' from the [[Pointed space|pointed]] [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; into ''X'', because ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; may be regarded as a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of ''I'' under the identification of 0 with 1.

The set of all loops in ''X'' forms a space called the [[loop space]] of ''X''.&lt;ref name="ils"/&gt;

In [[general relativity]], the '''magnetogravitic tensor''' is one of the three pieces appearing in the [[Bel decomposition]] of the [[Riemann tensor]].

The magnetogravitic [[tensor]] can be interpreted physically as a specifying possible [[spin-spin force]]s on spinning bits of matter, such as spinning [[test particle]]s.

'''Marco Materazzi''', &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Ufficiale OMRI]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPA-it|ˈmarko mateˈrattsi}}; born 19 August 1973) is an [[Italians|Italian]] former professional [[Association football|footballer]] and [[Association football manager|manager]].

Early in his career, Materazzi played with various Italian teams in [[Serie B]] and [[Serie C]], and with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[Premier League]]. He spent two periods with [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] (1995–98 and 1999–2001) and signed for [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] in 2001 for €10&amp;nbsp;million. At club level, he won a number of major honors with Inter, including five [[Serie A]] league titles in a row from 2006 to 2010, one [[UEFA Champions League]], one [[FIFA Club World Cup]], four [[Coppa Italia]] titles, and the [[Supercoppa Italiana]] four times.&lt;ref&gt;The Matrix – Marco Materazzi: {{cite web|url=http://lazymanscalcio.tumblr.com/post/18215957095/the-matrix |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203063129/http://lazymanscalcio.tumblr.com/post/18215957095/the-matrix |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materazzi earned 41 caps for Italy from his debut in 2001 until 2008, playing in two World Cups and two European Championships. He was one of the key players in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]] against France, as he scored Italy's goal and later, in extra time, he received a headbutt from [[Zinedine Zidane]], who was punished with a red card.&lt;ref name="World Cup"/&gt; Italy then went on to win the World Cup in a penalty shoot-out, during which Materazzi scored again.

A controversial and provocative figure in football, he was known for his very physical and aggressive style of play as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]], as well as his tight marking and strong, harsh tackling, which led him to receive more than 60 yellow cards and 25 red cards throughout his playing career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.serpentsofmadonnina.com/2011/7/18/3211758/marco-materazzi-a-bandieria-among-bandierie|title=Marco Materazzi: A Bandieria Among Bandierie|publisher=Serpents of Madonnina|date=18 July 2011|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his temper, and his commitment to rash, heavy challenges, he has been involved in several altercations with other players during matches,&lt;ref name="Materazzi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cazullo|first1=Aldo|title=Materazzi|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2006/luglio/11/Materazzi_co_9_060711008.shtml|website=www.corriere.it|publisher=Il Corriere della Sera|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing comparisons with retired defender [[Pasquale Bruno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Emanuele Gamba|title="O' animale resto sempre io una volta aspettai Lerda..."|trans-title="I'm still the animal once I waited for Lerda..."|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/b/sezioni/sport/calcio/serie_a/brunotunnel/brunotunnel/brunotunnel.html|publisher=La Repubblica|accessdate=4 May 2015|language=Italian|date=3 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' placed Materazzi at number 45 in their list of the 50 hardest football players in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 50 Hardest Footballers |url=http://www.empireonline.com/forum/printable.asp?m=1554851 |accessdate=14 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019002225/http://www.empireonline.com/forum/printable.asp?m=1554851 |archivedate=19 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Materazzi began his footballing career with the [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and then the [[F.C. Messina Peloro|Messina Peloro]] youth teams from 1990 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alpha59.it/news/50/la-carriera-di-marco-materazzi.html|title=LA CARRIERA DI MARCO MATERAZZI|date=3 March 2018|publisher=alpha59.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his early career in the lower divisions of Italian football, with amateur side Tor di Quinto (1991–92), [[Serie C]]2 team [[S.C. Marsala 1912|Marsala]] (1993–94), and Serie C1 [[A.S.D. Trapani Calcio|Trapani]] (1994–95), where he narrowly missed a historic promotion to [[Serie B]] after losing a promotion playoff to [[S.S. Gualdo|Gualdo]]. [[Serie B]] squad [[Perugia Calcio]] signed Materazzi for the first time in 1995,&lt;ref name="Early life"/&gt; but he spent a part of the 1996–97 season in Serie C with [[Carpi F.C. 1909|Carpi]].

He then spent 1998–99 with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.toffeeweb.com/players/profiles/Materazzi.php|title=Marco Materazzi central defender|publisher=ToffeeWeb.com|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was sent off three times in just 27 games, and scored twice, against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the league&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-barmby-sparks-everton-deluge-1071633.html|title=Barmby sparks Everton deluge|publisher=[[The Independent]]|author=Neil Bramwell|location=London|date=17 February 1999|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dacourt-drives-everton-through-1200301.html|title=Dacourt drives Everton through|publisher=The Independent|author=Phill Shaw|location=London|date=23 September 1998|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazzetta/&gt;

He then returned to Perugia in 1999 and scored 12 goals, including 7 from penalties in the [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01 season]], breaking [[Daniel Passarella]]'s Serie A record of most goals by a defender in one season.&lt;ref name=gazzetta/&gt;

====2001–2004: Debut and controversies====
[[File:Materazzi maglia.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Materazzi's number 23 shirt]]

Materazzi played 23 matches in league, including the final decisive match versus [[S.S.

In the [[2002–03 Inter Milan season|following season]], Materazzi made 33 appearances across all competitions, including 13 in [[UEFA Champions League]], where he played his first match on 14 August 2002 in a goalless draw against [[Sporting CP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2002/matches/round=1635/match=70011/index.html|title=Sporting CP 0-0 Internazionale|publisher=UEFA.com|date=14 August 2002|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Materazzi's [[2003–04 Inter Milan season|2003–04 season]] was highlighted by injuries, such as the one he suffered on 25 November during the 5–1 home loss to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group B|UEFA Champions League group stage]] which kept him out of action for two months.&lt;ref name="Suspension"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=129970.html#inter+miss+materazzi|title=Inter to miss Materazzi|publisher=UEFA.com|date=27 November 2003|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the center of a controversy again in the beginning of 2004 for aggression towards Siena player [[Bruno Cirillo]].

====2004–2008: Domestic success under Mancini====
In July 2004, at the start of [[2004–05 Inter Milan season|2004–05 season]], Inter bench was entrusted to manager [[Roberto Mancini]], with whom – in the first season – Materazzi lost his place in the starting lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/01/07/mancini-ok-materazzi-non-voleva-insultare-me.html|title=Mancini: Ok Materazzi, non voleva insultare me|trans-title=Mancini: Ok Materazzi, he did not want to insult me|publisher=Repubblica.it|language=Italian|location=Livorno|date=7 January 2005|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next season he played more,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://it.eurosport.com/calcio/amichevoli/2005/funziona-la-doppia-inter_sto747019/story.shtml|title=Funziona la doppia Inter|trans-title=Inter double works|publisher=Eurosport|language=Italian|date=27 July 2005|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the only Italian to score a goal for the club that season.

==Style of play==
An aggressive, physical, and hard-tackling [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]], who was also known for his tight marking of opponents,&lt;ref name="Materazzi"/&gt; Materazzi was considered to be one of the best defenders of his generation, and was highly regarded by two of the world's most respected coaches, [[Marcello Lippi]] and [[José Mourinho]], later becoming close friends with both managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.futaa.com/football/article/why-i-cried-when-jose-left--materazzi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904083401/http://www.futaa.com/football/article/why-i-cried-when-jose-left--materazzi |archivedate=4 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Materazzi was lauded by his managers in particular for being a goal threat as a defender, due to his outstanding aerial ability, which made him dangerous during set pieces.&lt;ref name="gazzetta"/&gt; His prolific goalscoring allowed him to capture the record for most goals in a Serie A season by a defender, which was broken during the [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01 season]].&lt;ref name=gazzetta&gt;{{cite web|title=I difensori e il vizio del gol Facchetti il top, poi Matrix|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/26-10-2009/i-difensori-vizio-gol--601754131334.shtml|accessdate=14 September 2014|language=Italian|work=[[Gazzetta dello Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an accurate set piece and penalty kick taker, with a powerful shot from distance.&lt;ref name="gazzetta"/&gt; In addition to these attributes, he had solid technical skills and reliable distribution, and was known for frequently playing long balls to the strikers.&lt;ref name="Materazzi"/&gt; During his time with Internazionale, he developed the nickname ''Matrix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?N=43308&amp;L=it|title=Foto: Marco Materazzi, Matrix|publisher=inter.it|date=26 December 2008|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calciogazzetta.it/altro/la-storia-di-un-campione-trattata-da-calcio-gazzetta/storie-di-calcio-marco-matrix-materazzi/|title=[Storie di Calcio] Marco “Matrix” Materazzi|trans-title=[Stories of Football] Marco “Matrix” Materazzi|publisher=calciogazzetta.it|language=Italian|date=21 June 2017|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], the '''marginal factor cost''' (MFC) is the increment to total costs paid for a [[factor of production]] resulting from a one-unit increase in the amount of the factor employed. It is expressed in [[currency]] units per incremental unit of a factor of production (input), such as [[labour economics|labor]], per unit of time. In the case of the labor input, for example, if the wage rate paid is unaffected by the  number of units of labor hired, the marginal factor cost is identical to the [[wage]] rate. However, if hiring another unit of labor drives up the wage rate that must be paid to all existing units of labor employed, then the marginal cost of the labor factor is higher than the wage rate paid to the last unit because it also includes the increment to the rates paid to the other units.

Thus for any factor the MFC is the change in total amount paid for all units of that factor divided by the change in the quantity of that factor employed.

A firm that wants to optimize its profits hires each factor up to the point at which its marginal factor cost equals its [[marginal revenue product]] (MFC=MRP).

The '''marginal propensity to import''' ('''MPI''') is the fractional change in [[imports|import]] expenditure that occurs with a change in [[disposable income]] (income after taxes and transfers).  For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to import is 0.2, then the household will spend 20 cents of that dollar on imported goods and services.

Mathematically, the marginal propensity to import (MPM) function is expressed as the [[derivative]] of the import (I) function with respect to disposable income (Y).&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MPM}=\frac{\text{d}I}{\text{d}Y}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, the marginal propensity to import is measured as the ratio of the change in imports to the change in income, thus giving us a figure between 0 and 1.  

Imports are also considered to be [[automatic stabiliser]]s that work to lessen fluctuations in [[real GDP]].

The UK government assumes that UK citizens have a high marginal propensity to import and thus will use a decrease in disposable income as a tool to control the current account on the balance of payments.

{{Hegelianism}}
[[File:Haitian Revolution.jpg|320px|thumb|Hegel was influenced by articles about the [[Haitian Revolution]] in [[Minerva (German journal)|''Minerva'']]]]
The '''master–slave dialectic''' is the common name for a famous passage of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', though the original German phrase, ''Herrschaft und Knechtschaft'', is more properly translated as '''Lordship and Bondage'''.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Duquette, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/hegelsoc/ "Hegel’s Social and Political Thought"],  ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Accessed 9 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered a key element in Hegel's [[philosophy|philosophical]] system, and has heavily influenced many subsequent philosophers.

The passage describes, in narrative form, the development of self-consciousness as such in an encounter between what are thereby (i.e., emerging only from this encounter) two distinct, [[Self-awareness|self-conscious]] beings. The essence of the [[dialectic]] is the movement or motion of recognizing, in which the two self-consciousnesses are constituted in being each recognized as self-conscious by the other. This movement, inexorably taken to its extreme, takes the form of a "struggle to the death" in which one masters the other, only to find that such lordship makes the very recognition he had sought impossible, since the bondsman, in this state, is not free to offer it.

== Context ==
"Independent and Dependent Self-Consciousness: Lordship and Bondage" is the first of two titled subsections in the "Self-Consciousness" chapter of ''Phenomenology''. It is preceded in the chapter by a discussion of "Life" and "Desire", among other things, and is followed by "Free Self-Consciousness: Stoicism, Skepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness".

Hegel wrote this story or myth in order to explain his idea of how self-consciousness dialectically [[Aufheben|sublates]] into what he variously refers to as Absolute Knowledge, Spirit, and Science. As a work, the ''Phenomenology'' may be considered both as an independent work, apparently considered by Hegel to be an ''[[A_priori_and_a_posteriori|a priori]]'' for understanding the ''[[Science of Logic]]'', and as a part of the ''Science of Logic'', where Hegel discusses [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute knowledge]].

== Recognition ==
Crucially, for Hegel, absolute knowledge, or Spirit, cannot come to be without first a self-consciousness recognizing another self-consciousness.  Such an issue in the history of philosophy had only ever been explored by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and its treatment marks a watershed in [[European philosophy]].

== Hegel's myth ==
In order to explain how this works, Hegel uses a story that is in essence an abstracted, idealized history about how two people meet.  However, Hegel's idea of the development of self-consciousness from consciousness, and its sublation into a higher unity in absolute knowledge, is not the contoured brain of natural science and evolutionary biology, but a [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|phenomenological]] construct with a history; one that must have passed through a struggle for freedom before realising itself.

The abstract language used by Hegel never allows one to interpret this story in a straightforward fashion.  It can be read as self-consciousness coming to itself through a child's or adult's development, or self-consciousness coming to be in the beginning of human history (see [[wikt:Hominization|hominization]]) or as that of a society or nation realising freedom.

That the master–slave dialectic can be interpreted as an internal process occurring in one person or as an external process between two or more people is a result, in part, of the fact that Hegel asserts an "end to the antithesis of [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]". What occurs in the human mind also occurs outside of it. The objective and subjective, according to Hegel, [[Aufheben|sublate]] one another until they are unified, and the "story" takes this process through its various "moments" when the lifting up of two contradictory moments results in a higher unity.

First, the two abstract consciousnesses meet and are astounded at the realisation of the self as a foreign object. Each can choose to ignore the other, in which case no self-consciousness forms and each views the other merely as an animated object rather than an equivalent subject. Or, they become mesmerized by the mirror-like other and attempt, as they previously had done in controlling their own body, to assert their will.

According to Hegel,
:"On approaching the other it has lost its own self, since it finds itself as another being; secondly, it has thereby sublated that other, for this primitive consciousness does not regard the other as essentially real but sees its own self in the other."&lt;ref&gt;G.W.F. Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, translated by A.V. Miller with analysis of the text and foreword by J. N. Findlay (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977); Paragraph 179, Pg. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction ===
When initially confronted with another person, the self cannot be immediately recognized :'Appearing thus immediately on the scene, they are for one another like ordinary objects, independent shapes, individuals submerged in the being [or immediacy] of Life'.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Death struggle ===
A struggle to the death ensues. However, if one of the two should die, the achievement of self-consciousness fails.  Hegel refers to this failure as "abstract negation" not the negation or sublation required. This death is avoided by the agreement, communication of, or subordination to, slavery. In this struggle the Master emerges as Master because he does not fear death since he does not see his identity dependent on life, while the slave out of this fear consents to the slavery.  This experience of fear on the part of the slave is crucial, however, in a later moment of the dialectic, where it becomes the prerequisite experience for the slave's further development.

=== Enslavement and mastery ===
Truth of oneself as self-conscious is achieved only if both live; the recognition of the other gives each of them the objective truth and self-certainty required for self-consciousness. Thus, the two enter into the relation of master/slave and preserve the recognition of each other.

=== Contradiction and Resolution ===
However, this state is not a happy one and does not achieve full self-consciousness. The recognition by the slave is merely on pain of death. The master's self-consciousness is dependent on the slave for recognition and also has a mediated relation with nature: the slave works with nature and begins to shape it into products for the master.  As the slave creates more and more products with greater and greater sophistication through his own [[creativity]], he begins to see himself reflected in the products he created, he realises that the world around him was created by his own hands, thus the slave is no longer alienated from his own labour and achieves self-consciousness, while
the master on the other hand has become wholly dependent on the products created by his slave; thus the master is enslaved by the [[labor economics|labour]] of his slave.

== Conclusions ==
One interpretation of this dialectic is that neither a slave nor a master can be considered as fully self-conscious. A person who has already achieved self-consciousness could be enslaved, so self-consciousness must be considered not as an individual achievement, or an achievement of natural and genetic evolution, but as a social phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Moran, ''Hegel and the Fundamental Problems of Philosophy'', Holland: Grüner, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

As philosopher [[Robert Brandom]] explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hegel's discussion of the dialectic of the Master and Slave is an attempt to show that asymmetric recognitive relations are metaphysically defective, that the norms they institute aren't the right kind to help us think and act with&amp;mdash;to make it possible for us to think and act. Asymmetric recognition in this way is authority without responsibility, on the side of the Master, and responsibility without authority, on the side of the Slave. And Hegel's argument is that unless authority and responsibility are commensurate and reciprocal, no actual normative statuses are instituted. This is one of his most important and certainly one of his deepest ideas, though it's not so easy to see just how the argument works."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Brandom, Interview, Summer 2008. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdIPuERVjk0 Transcript: http://www.filosofia.it/images/download/multimedia/08_Brandom%20Interview_transcription.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alexandre Kojève]]'s unique interpretation differs from this. For Kojève, people are born and history began with the first struggle, which ended with the first masters and slaves. A person is always either master or slave; and there are no real humans where there are no masters and slaves. History comes to an end when the difference between master and slave ends, when the master ceases to be master because there are no more slaves and the slave ceases to be a slave because there are no more masters. A synthesis takes place between master and slave: the integral [[citizen]] of the universal and homogenous [[State (polity)|state]] created by [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Kojève, ''Introduction à la lecture de Hegel'', France: Gallimard, 1947. Translated as ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'', New York: Basic Books, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The master and slave relationship influenced numerous discussions and ideas in the 20th century, especially because of its supposed connection to [[Karl Marx]]'s conception of [[class struggle]] as the motive force of social development.{{fact|date=February 2015}}.

Hegel's master–slave dialectic has been influential in the [[social sciences]], [[philosophy]], [[literary studies]], [[critical theory]], [[postcolonial studies]] and in [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Julia Borossa and Caroline Rooney, "Suffering, Transience and Immortal Longings: Salomé Between Nietzsche and Freud," ''Journal of European Studies'' 33(3/4): 287-304 London, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Hegel's master–slave trope, and particularly the emphasis on recognition, has been of crucial influence on [[Martin Buber]]'s relational schema in ''[[I and Thou]]'', [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s account of the history and dynamics of gender relations in ''[[The Second Sex]]''&lt;ref&gt; A "five-stage model" of the master-slave dialectic, inflected through de Beauvoir's classic work [http://www.rgwinther.com/CoursesTaught/HegelsMasterSlaveDialecticPhasesandFAQ.pdf can be found here]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frantz Fanon]]'s description of the colonial relation in ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz Fanon, ''Black Skin, White Masks,'' New York: Grove Press, 1967: 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Buck-Morss]]'s article ''Hegel and Haiti'' argues that the [[Haitian revolution]] influenced Hegel's writing of his slave-master dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buck-Morss |first=Susan |authorlink= Susan Buck-Morss |date= Summer 2000 |title=Hegel and Haiti  |journal=Critical Inquiry |publisher= The University of Chicago Press |volume=26  |issue=4 |pages=821–865 |jstor=1344332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peraldus Knight.jpg|thumb|An early example of the ''miles christianus'' allegory in a manuscript of the ''Summa Vitiorum'' by [[William Peraldus]], mid 13th century. The knight is equipped with a detailed [[Armour of God]], including an early depiction of the [[Shield of the Trinity]], and he is crowned by an angel holding the gloss ''non coronabuntur nisi qui legitime certaverint'' "none will be crowned but those who truly [[:wikt:certo#Latin|struggle]]" and in the other hand a list of the seven [[beatitudes]], matched with the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] and the [[seven heavenly virtues]] which in turn are set against the [[seven cardinal vices]].]]
[[File:Ghent Altarpiece E - Knights of Christ.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Christi milites''  to the left of the "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb" in the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] (c. 1430)]]

The '''''miles Christianus''''' ([[Christian]] soldier) or "'''''miles Christi'''''" (soldier of [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]]) is a Christian [[allegory]] based on [[New Testament military metaphors]], especially the [[Armor of God]] metaphor of military equipment standing for Christian virtues &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ephesians|6:14-17|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on certain passages of the Old Testament from the [[Latin Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Job|7:1|4}} ([[Vulgate]]): ''Militia est vita hominis super terram''...&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fifth century, the Church had started to develop doctrines that allowed for Christian participation in battle, though this was limited by a requirement that the fighting must be undertaken to convert [[infidel]]s or spread the [[Christ in Majesty|glory of Christ]]. Christians were not to fight for conquest or personal glory.&lt;ref name=ideal&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1449-9320| volume = 8| issue = Journal Article| pages = 77–| last = Iwanczak| first = Wojciech| title = Miles Christi: the medieval ideal of knighthood| journal = Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association| date = 2012| url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;u=wikipedia&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA454359740&amp;asid=b7bcab1e0aab147ff62b696318501ae7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of ''miles Christi'' and ''militia Christi'' can be traced back to the first century AD.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt; The phrase ''miles Christi'', derived from a letter from [[Paul the Apostle]] and much employed by [[Pope Gregory VII]], also appeared in the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' in reference to the young [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Prince Tancred]], [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon|Godfrey]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Count Raymond of Toulouse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQEM2MzGP58C&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Kostick |first=Conor |year=2008 |title=The Social Structure of the First Crusade |location=Leiden, Netherlands |publisher=Koninklijnke Brill NV |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of whom were Christian leaders in the [[First Crusade]].

The metaphor has its origins in early Christianity of the Roman Empire, and gave rise to the contrasting term ''[[pagan]]us'' (hitherto used in the sense of "civilian", "one lacking discipline") for its opposite, i.e. one who was not a soldier of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Weekley, ''Etymological Dictionary of English'', s.v. "pagan".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chivalry]] as the idealized image of [[knighthood]] was a common [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|moral allegory]] in early Christian literature.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt; Knighthood emerged as a concept during the time of [[Charlemagne]]. During the [[Saxon Wars]], Charlemagne's Christian knights attended mass, surrounded by relics, before battles.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt;

Fragments from 15th c. Polish chronicler [[Jan Długosz]] describe the [[sanctification]] of weapons and a concept of knighthood that was grounded in religion.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt; It became a theme in [[medieval art|art]] during the [[High Middle Ages]], with depictions of a [[knight]] with his various pieces of equipment identified with various [[virtue]]s. This parallels the development of the understanding in medieval [[Christendom]] of the armed nobility as defenders of the faith, first emphasized by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] in the context of the [[Investiture controversy]] and later made even more explicit with the actual military expeditions of the [[crusades]]. 
Depictions of the ''miles christianus'' with the emblematic Armour of God however remained very rare in the medieval period and only became prominent after the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;"depictions of the miles christianus in emblematic armour are extremely rare before the Reformation" (Evans p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early modern period, the understanding of the term again became more metaphorical, but it survives in various Christian orders or confessions; it is especially pronounced among the [[Jesuits]] and in the [[Salvation Army]], and it is the central theme of the 18th century hymn "[[Soldiers of Christ, Arise]]" and the 19th century hymn "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]."

'''Multistable perception''' (or '''Bistable perception''') are a form of [[perceptual]] phenomena in which there are unpredictable sequences of spontaneous subjective changes. While usually associated with [[visual perception]] (a form of [[optical illusion]]), such phenomena can also be found for [[Sound|auditory]] and [[olfactory]] precepts.

== Classification ==
Perceptual [[multistability]] can be evoked by visual patterns that are too [[ambiguous]] for the human [[visual system]] to recognize with one unique interpretation. Familiar examples include the [[Necker cube]], [[Schroeder staircase]], [[structure from motion]], [[monocular rivalry]], and [[binocular rivalry]], but many more visually [[ambiguous image|ambiguous patterns]] are known. Since most of these images lead to an alternation between two mutually exclusive perceptual states, they are sometimes also referred to as bistable perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eagleman | first = D. | title = Visual Illusions and Neurobiology | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | year = 2001 | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 920–926 | url = http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/papers/Eagleman.NatureRevNeuro.Illusions.pdf | format = pdf | doi = 10.1038/35104092 | pmid = 11733799 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212714/http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/papers/Eagleman.NatureRevNeuro.Illusions.pdf | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[multistable auditory perception|Auditory]] and [[olfactory]] examples can occur when there are conflicting, and so rivaling, inputs into the two [[ear]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |

== Characterization ==
Transitions from one precept to its alternative are called perceptual reversals. They are spontaneous and [[stochastic]] events which cannot be eliminated by intentional efforts, although some control over the alternation process is learnable. Reversal rates vary drastically between stimuli and observers, and have been found to be slower for people with [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pettigrew | first1 = J.

== Cultural history ==
Human interest in these phenomena can be traced back to [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. The fascination of multistable perception probably comes from the active nature of [[endogenous]] perceptual changes or from the dissociation of dynamic perception from constant sensory stimulation. 

Multistable perception was a common feature in the artwork of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[lithography|lithographer]] [[M. C. Escher]], who was strongly influenced by mathematical physicists such as [[Roger Penrose]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Real world examples ==
Photographs of craters, from either the moon or other planets including our own, can exhibit this phenomenon. Craters, in stereo imaging, such as our eyes, should appear to be pit-like structures. However, in mono-vision, such as that of photographs, the elimination of our depth perception causes multistable perception to take over, and this can cause the craters to invert their depth values and instead look like plateaus rather than pits.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Sometimes rotating the image so that the photographic direction of the source of light matches a light source in the room can cause the correct perception to suddenly switch.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In literature, the [[science fiction]] [[novel]], ''[[Dhalgren]]'', by [[Samuel R. Delany]], contains circular text, multistable perception, and multiple entry points.

Multistable perception arises with the theater segments of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', as due to the construction of the [[Crow T. Robot]] puppet, its head can appear to be facing towards the camera rather than towards the film being shown. This was addressed by the creators of the series, even likening Crow to a [[Necker cube]]&lt;ref name="necker"&gt;{{Cite journal | author-link = Best Brains | year = 1996 | title = The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide |page = 159 | publisher = Bantam | isbn = 0-553-37783-3 | author = Trace Beaulieu ... | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[The Spinning Dancer]].

[[File:Noether_theorem_1st_page.png|thumb| First page of [[Emmy Noether]]'s article "Invariante Variationsprobleme" (1918), where she proved her theorem.]]
'''Noether's''' ('''first''')&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Noether's second theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; '''theorem''' states that every [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of the [[action (physics)|action]] of a physical system has a corresponding [[conservation law]]. The theorem was proven by mathematician [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and published in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Noether E | year = 1918 | title = Invariante Variationsprobleme | journal = Nachr. D. König. Gesellsch. D. Wiss. Zu Göttingen, Math-phys. Klasse | volume = 1918 | pages = 235–257 |url= https://eudml.org/doc/59024}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a special case was proven by [[Eugène_Cosserat|E. Cosserat]] &amp; [[François_Cosserat|F. Cosserat]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Cosserat E., Cosserat F. |year = 1909 | title = Théorie des corps déformables | publisher = Hermann | place = Paris | url = http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=06420001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of a physical system is the [[time integral|integral over time]] of a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] function (which may or may not be an [[integral over space]] of a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density function]]), from which the system's behavior can be determined by the [[principle of least action]]. This theorem only applies to continuous symmetries over [[physical space]].

Noether's theorem is used in [[theoretical physics]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. A generalization of the formulations on [[constants of motion]] in Lagrangian and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (developed in 1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian alone (e.g. systems with a [[Lagrangian_mechanics#Extensions_to_include_non-conservative_forces|Rayleigh dissipation function]]). In particular, [[dissipative]] systems with [[Continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] need not have a corresponding conservation law.

==Basic illustrations and background==
{{unreferenced-section|date=June 2016}}
As an illustration, if a physical system behaves the same regardless of how it is oriented in space, its [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] is symmetric under continuous rotations: from this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates that the [[angular momentum]] of the system be conserved, as a consequence of its laws of motion. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. It is the laws of its motion that are symmetric.

As another example, if a physical process exhibits  the same outcomes regardless of place or time, then its Lagrangian is symmetric under continuous translations in space and time respectively: by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the [[conservation law]]s of [[momentum|linear momentum]] and [[energy]] within this system, respectively.

As a final example, if the behavior of a physical system does not change upon spatial or temporal reflection, then its Lagrangian has reflection symmetry and time reversal symmetry respectively: Noether's theorem says that these symmetries result in the conservation laws of [[Parity (physics)|parity]] and [[entropy]],{{cn|date=June 2018}} {{discuss|Need to resolve the case when we are discussing entropy of a closed system, which always increases.}} respectively.

Noether's theorem is important, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also as a practical calculational tool. It allows investigators to determine the conserved quantities (invariants) from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it allows researchers to consider whole classes of hypothetical Lagrangians with given invariants, to describe a physical system. As an illustration, suppose that a physical theory is proposed which conserves a quantity ''X''. A researcher can calculate the types of Lagrangians that conserve ''X'' through a continuous symmetry.  Due to Noether's theorem, the properties of these Lagrangians provide further criteria to understand the implications and judge the fitness of the new theory.

There are numerous versions of Noether's theorem, with varying degrees of generality. The original version applied only to [[ordinary differential equation]]s (used for describing distinct particles) and not [[partial differential equation]]s (used for describing fields). The original versions also assume that the Lagrangian depends only upon the first derivative, while later versions generalize the theorem to Lagrangians depending on the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative.{{Disputed inline|False_claim_on_limited_applicability_of_original_version|date=June 2014}}  There are natural quantum counterparts of this theorem, expressed in  the [[Ward–Takahashi identity|Ward–Takahashi identities]]. Generalizations of Noether's theorem to [[superspace]]s also exist.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Informal statement of the theorem ==
All fine technical points aside, Noether's theorem can be stated informally

{{quote|If a system has a continuous symmetry property, then there are corresponding quantities whose values are conserved in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thompson, W.J. |title=Angular Momentum: an illustrated guide to rotational symmetries for physical systems |publisher=Wiley |year=1994 |isbn=0-471-55264-X |volume=1 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O25fXV4z0B0C&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A more sophisticated version of the theorem involving fields states that:

{{quote|To every differentiable [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] generated by local actions, there corresponds a [[conserved current]].}}

The word "symmetry" in the above statement refers more precisely to the [[covariant transformation|covariance]] of the form that a physical law takes with respect to a one-dimensional [[Lie group]] of transformations satisfying certain technical criteria. The [[conservation law]] of a [[physical quantity]] is usually expressed as a [[continuity equation]].

The formal proof of the theorem utilizes the condition of invariance to derive an expression for a current associated with a conserved physical quantity. 
In modern (since ca. 1980&lt;ref&gt;The term "Noether charge" occurs in Seligman, ''Group theory and its applications in physics, 1980: Latin American School of Physics, Mexico City'', American Institute of Physics, 1981. It comes enters wider use during the 1980s, e.g. by G. Takeda in: Errol Gotsman, Gerald Tauber (eds.) ''From SU(3) to Gravity: Festschrift in Honor of Yuval Ne'eman'', 1985, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;) terminology, the  conserved quantity is called the ''Noether charge'', while the flow carrying that charge is called the ''Noether current''. The Noether current is defined [[up to]] a [[solenoidal]] (divergenceless) vector field.

In the context of gravitation, [[Felix Klein]]'s statement of Noether's theorem for action ''I'' stipulates for the invariants:&lt;ref&gt;Nina Byers (1998) [http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/articles/noether.asg/noether.html "E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws."] in Proceedings of a Symposium on the Heritage of Emmy Noether, held on 2–4 December 1996, at the Bar-Ilan University, Israel, Appendix B.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|If an integral I is invariant under a continuous group G&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; with ρ parameters, then ρ  linearly independent combinations of the Lagrangian expressions are divergences.}}

==Historical context==
{{main|Constant of motion|conservation law|conserved current}}

A [[conservation law]] states that some quantity ''X'' in the mathematical description of a system's evolution remains constant throughout its motion — it is an [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]].   Mathematically, the rate of change of ''X'' (its [[derivative]] with respect to [[time]]) is zero,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt} = 0 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Such quantities are said to be conserved; they are often called [[constant of motion|constants of motion]] (although motion ''per se'' need not be involved, just evolution in time). For example, if the energy of a system is conserved, its energy is invariant at all times, which imposes a constraint on the system's motion and may help in solving for it. Aside from insights that such constants of motion give into the nature of a system, they are a useful calculational tool; for example, an approximate solution can be corrected by finding the nearest state that satisfies the suitable conservation laws.

The earliest constants of motion discovered were [[momentum]] and [[energy]], which were proposed in the 17th century by [[René Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] on the basis of [[collision]] experiments, and refined by subsequent researchers. [[Isaac Newton]] was the first to enunciate the conservation of momentum in its modern form, and showed that it was a consequence of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law]]. According to [[general relativity]], the conservation laws of linear momentum, energy and angular momentum are only exactly true globally when expressed in terms of the  sum of the [[stress–energy tensor]] (non-gravitational stress–energy) and the [[Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor#Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor|Landau–Lifshitz stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]] (gravitational stress–energy). The local conservation of non-gravitational linear momentum and energy in a free-falling reference frame is expressed by the vanishing of the covariant [[divergence]] of the [[stress–energy tensor]]. Another important conserved quantity, discovered in studies of the [[celestial mechanics]] of astronomical bodies, is the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]].

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, physicists developed more systematic methods for discovering invariants. A major advance came in 1788 with the development of [[Lagrangian mechanics]], which is related to the [[principle of least action]]. In this approach, the state of the system can be described by any type of [[generalized coordinate]]s '''q'''; the laws of motion need not be expressed in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], as was customary in Newtonian mechanics. The [[action (physics)|action]] is defined as the time integral ''I'' of a function known as the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]&amp;nbsp;''L''

::&lt;math&gt;I = \int L(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, t) \, dt ~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the dot over '''q''' signifies the rate of change of the coordinates '''q''',

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{dt} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Hamilton's principle]] states that the physical path '''q'''(''t'')—the one actually taken by the system—is a path for which infinitesimal variations in that path cause no change in ''I'', at least up to first order. This principle results in the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}}   ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if one of the coordinates, say ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', does not appear in the Lagrangian, the right-hand side of the equation is zero, and the left-hand side requires that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k} \right) = \frac{dp_k}{dt} = 0~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the momentum

:&lt;math&gt; p_k = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k} &lt;/math&gt;

is conserved throughout the motion (on the physical path).

Thus, the absence of the '''ignorable''' coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the Lagrangian implies that the Lagrangian is unaffected by changes or transformations of ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''; the Lagrangian is invariant, and is said to exhibit a [[symmetry in physics|symmetry]] under such transformations. This is the seed idea generalized in Noether's theorem.

Several alternative methods for finding conserved quantities were developed in the 19th century, especially by [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. For example, he developed a theory of [[canonical transformation]]s which allowed changing coordinates so that some coordinates disappeared from the Lagrangian, as above, resulting in conserved canonical momenta. Another approach, and perhaps the most efficient for finding conserved quantities, is the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]].

==Mathematical expression==
{{see also|Perturbation theory}}

===Simple form using perturbations===

The essence of Noether's theorem is generalizing the ignorable coordinates outlined.

One can assume that the Lagrangian ''L'' defined above is invariant under small perturbations (warpings) of the time variable ''t'' and the [[generalized coordinate]]s '''q'''. One may write

:&lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t^{\prime} = t + \delta t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} \rightarrow \mathbf{q}^{\prime} = \mathbf{q} + \delta \mathbf{q} ~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the perturbations ''δt'' and ''δ'''''q''' are both small, but variable. For generality, assume there are (say) ''N'' such [[symmetry transformations]] of the action, i.e. transformations leaving the action unchanged; labelled by an index ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''N''.

Then the resultant perturbation can be written as a linear sum of the individual types of perturbations,
:&lt;math&gt;\delta t = \sum_r \varepsilon_r T_r &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{q} = \sum_r \varepsilon_r \mathbf{Q}_r ~, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[infinitesimal]] parameter coefficients corresponding to each: 
*[[Lie group#The exponential map|generator]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' of [[time evolution]], and
*[[Lie group#The exponential map|generator]] '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; of the generalized coordinates.
For translations, '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant with units of [[length]]; for rotations, it is an expression linear in the components of '''q''', and the parameters make up an  [[angle]].

Using these definitions, [[Emmy Noether|Noether]] showed that the ''N'' quantities

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L \right) T_r - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \mathbf{Q}_r&lt;/math&gt;

(which have the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of [energy]·[time] + [momentum]·[length] = [action]) are conserved ([[constants of motion]]).

==== Examples ====

;Time invariance

For illustration, consider a Lagrangian that does not depend on time, i.e., that is invariant (symmetric) under changes ''t'' → ''t'' + δ''t'', without any change in the coordinates '''q'''. In this case, ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and '''Q'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; the corresponding conserved quantity is the total [[energy]] ''H''&lt;ref name="energy" &gt;{{harvnb|Lanczos|1970|pp=401–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L. &lt;/math&gt;

;Translational invariance

Consider a Lagrangian which does not depend on an ("ignorable", as above)  coordinate ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;; so  it is invariant (symmetric) under changes ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''δq''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. In that case, ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1; the conserved quantity is the corresponding [[momentum]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="momentum" &gt;{{harvnb|Lanczos|1970|pp=403–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_k = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_k}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], these apparently separate conservation laws are aspects of a single conservation law, that of the [[stress–energy tensor]],&lt;ref name="stress–energy_tensor" &gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=592–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is derived in the next section.

;Rotational invariance

The conservation of the [[angular momentum]] '''L''' = '''r''' × '''p''' is  analogous to its linear momentum counterpart.&lt;ref name="angular_momentum" &gt;{{harvnb|Lanczos|1970|pp=404–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that the symmetry of the Lagrangian is rotational, i.e., that the Lagrangian does not depend on the absolute orientation of the physical system in space. For concreteness, assume that the Lagrangian does not change under small rotations of an angle ''δθ'' about an axis '''n'''; such a rotation transforms the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} \rightarrow \mathbf{r} + \delta\theta \, \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since time is not being transformed, ''T''=0. Taking ''δθ'' as the ''ε'' parameter and the Cartesian coordinates '''r''' as the generalized coordinates '''q''', the corresponding '''Q''' variables are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then Noether's theorem states that the following quantity is conserved,
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \mathbf{Q}_{r} = 
\mathbf{p} \cdot \left( \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r} \right) = 
\mathbf{n} \cdot \left( \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} \right) = 
\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{L}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the component of the angular momentum '''L''' along the '''n''' axis is conserved.

If '''n''' is arbitrary, i.e., if the system is insensitive to any rotation, then every component of '''L''' is conserved; in short, [[angular momentum]] is conserved.

===Field theory version===
Although useful in its own right, the version of Noether's theorem just given is a special case of the general version derived in 1915. To give the flavor of the general theorem, a version of the Noether theorem for continuous fields in four-dimensional [[space–time]] is now given. Since field theory problems are more common in modern physics than [[mechanics]] problems, this field theory version is the most commonly used (or most often implemented) version of Noether's theorem.

Let there be a set of differentiable [[Field (physics)|fields]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; defined over all space and time; for example, the temperature &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt; would be representative of such a field, being a number defined at every place and time. The [[principle of least action]] can be applied to such fields, but the action is now an integral over space and time

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} = \int \mathcal{L} \left(\varphi, \partial_\mu \varphi, x^\mu \right) \, d^4 x&lt;/math&gt;

(the theorem can actually be further generalized to the case where the Lagrangian depends on up to the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative using [[jet bundle]]s)

A continuous transformation of the fields &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can be written infinitesimally as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \mapsto \varphi + \varepsilon \Psi,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is in general a function that may depend on both &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. The condition for &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; to generate a physical symmetry is that the action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is left invariant. This will certainly be true if the Lagrangian density &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is left invariant, but it will also be true if the Lagrangian changes by a divergence,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \mapsto \mathcal{L} + \varepsilon \partial_\mu \Lambda^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

since the integral of a divergence becomes a boundary term according to the [[divergence theorem]]. A system described by a given action might have multiple independent symmetries of this type, indexed by &lt;math&gt;r = 1, 2, \ldots, N,&lt;/math&gt; so the most general symmetry transformation would be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \mapsto \varphi + \varepsilon_r \Psi_r,&lt;/math&gt;

with the consequence

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \mapsto \mathcal{L} + \varepsilon_r \partial_\mu \Lambda^\mu_r&lt;/math&gt;

For such systems, Noether's theorem states that there are &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; conserved [[conserved current|current densities]]

:&lt;math&gt;
j^\nu_r = \Lambda^\nu_r - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \varphi_{,\nu}} \cdot \Psi_r
&lt;/math&gt;

(where the dot product is understood to contract the ''field'' indices, not the &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; index or &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; index)

In such cases, the [[conservation law]] is expressed in a four-dimensional way

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\nu} j^\nu = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which expresses the idea that the amount of a conserved quantity within a sphere cannot change unless some of it flows out of the sphere. For example, [[electric charge]] is conserved; the amount of charge within a sphere cannot change unless some of the charge leaves the sphere.

For illustration, consider a physical system of fields that behaves the same under translations in time and space, as considered above; in other words, &lt;math&gt;L \left(\boldsymbol\varphi, \partial_\mu{\boldsymbol\varphi}, x^\mu \right)&lt;/math&gt; is constant in its third argument. In that case, ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, one for each dimension of space and time. An infinitesimal translation in space, &lt;math&gt;x^\mu \mapsto x^\mu + \varepsilon_r \delta^\mu_r&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; denoting the [[Kronecker delta]]), affects the fields as &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x^\mu) \mapsto \varphi(x^\mu - \varepsilon_r \delta^\mu_r)&lt;/math&gt;: that is, relabelling the coordinates is equivalent to leaving the coordinates in place while translating the field itself, which in turn is equivalent to transforming the field by replacing its value at each point &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; with the value at the point &lt;math&gt;x^\mu - \varepsilon X^\mu&lt;/math&gt; "behind" it which would be mapped onto &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; by the infinitesimal displacement under consideration. Since this is infinitesimal, we may write this transformation as

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_r = -\delta^\mu_r \partial_\mu \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian density transforms in the same way, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x^\mu) \mapsto \mathcal{L}(x^\mu - \varepsilon_r \delta^\mu_r)&lt;/math&gt;, so

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^\mu_r = -\delta^\mu_r \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;

and thus Noether's theorem corresponds to the conservation law for the [[stress–energy tensor]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name="stress–energy_tensor" /&gt; where we have used &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. To wit, by using the expression given earlier, and collecting the four conserved currents (one for each &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) into a tensor &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, Noether's theorem gives

:&lt;math&gt;
T_\mu{}^\nu = -\delta^\nu_\mu \mathcal{L} + \delta^\sigma_\mu \partial_\sigma \varphi \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \varphi_{,\nu}} = \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \varphi_{,\nu}}\right) \cdot \varphi_{,\mu} - \delta^\nu_\mu \mathcal{L}
&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;T_\mu{}^\nu{}_{,\nu} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

(note that we relabelled &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; at an intermediate step to avoid conflict). (However, note that the &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; obtained in this way may differ from the symmetric tensor used as the source term in general relativity; see [[Stress–energy tensor#Canonical stress.E2.80.93energy tensor|Canonical stress–energy tensor]].)

The conservation of [[electric charge]], by contrast, can be derived by considering ''Ψ'' linear in the fields ''φ'' rather than in the derivatives.&lt;ref name="charge"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=593–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[probability amplitude]] ''ψ''('''x''') of finding a particle at a point '''x''' is a complex field ''φ'', because it ascribes a [[complex number]] to every point in space and time. The probability amplitude itself is physically unmeasurable; only the probability ''p'' = |''ψ''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be inferred  from a set of  measurements. Therefore, the system is invariant under transformations of the ''ψ'' field and its [[complex conjugate]] field ''ψ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; that leave |''ψ''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; unchanged, such as

:&lt;math&gt;\psi \rightarrow e^{i\theta} \psi \ ,\ \psi^{*} \rightarrow e^{-i\theta} \psi^{*}~,&lt;/math&gt;

a complex rotation. In the limit when the phase ''θ'' becomes infinitesimally small, ''δθ'', it may be taken as the parameter ''ε'', while the ''Ψ'' are equal to ''iψ'' and −''iψ''*, respectively. A specific example is the [[Klein–Gordon equation]], the [[special relativity|relativistically correct]] version of the [[Schrödinger equation]] for [[spin (physics)|spinless]] particles, which has the Lagrangian density

:&lt;math&gt;L = \psi_{,\nu} \psi^{*}_{,\mu} \eta^{\nu \mu} + m^2 \psi \psi^{*}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, Noether's theorem states that the conserved (∂⋅''j'' = 0) current equals

:&lt;math&gt;j^{\nu} = i \left( \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x^{\mu}} \psi^{*} - \frac{\partial \psi^{*}}{\partial x^{\mu}} \psi \right) \eta^{\nu \mu}~,&lt;/math&gt;

which, when multiplied by the charge on that species of particle, equals the electric current density due to that type of particle. This "gauge invariance" was first noted by [[Hermann Weyl]], and is one of the prototype [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]] of physics.

== Derivations ==

===One independent variable===
Consider the simplest case, a system with one independent variable, time. Suppose the dependent variables '''q''' are such that the action integral

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L [\mathbf{q} [t], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t], t] \, dt &lt;/math&gt;

is invariant under brief infinitesimal variations in the dependent variables. In other words, they satisfy the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} [t] = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} [t].&lt;/math&gt;

And suppose that the integral is invariant under a continuous symmetry. Mathematically such a symmetry is represented as a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], '''φ''', which acts on the variables as follows

:&lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t' = t + \varepsilon T &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} [t] \rightarrow \mathbf{q}' [t'] = \varphi [\mathbf{q} [t], \varepsilon] = \varphi [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε'' is a real variable indicating the amount of flow, and ''T'' is a real constant (which could be zero) indicating how much the flow shifts time.

:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{\mathbf{q}} [t] \rightarrow \dot{\mathbf{q}}' [t'] = \frac{d}{dt} \varphi [\mathbf{q} [t], \varepsilon] = \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon] \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t' - \varepsilon T]
.&lt;/math&gt;

The action integral flows to

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I' [\varepsilon] &amp; = \int_{t_1 + \varepsilon T}^{t_2 + \varepsilon T} L [\mathbf{q}'[t'], \dot{\mathbf{q}}' [t'], t'] \, dt' \\[6pt]
&amp; = \int_{t_1 + \varepsilon T}^{t_2 + \varepsilon T} L [\varphi [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon], \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon] \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t' - \varepsilon T], t'] \, dt'
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which may be regarded as a function of ''ε''. Calculating the derivative at ''ε''' = 0 and using [[Leibniz's rule (derivatives and integrals)|Leibniz's rule]], we get

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 = {} &amp; \frac{d I'}{d \varepsilon} [0] = L [\mathbf{q} [t_2], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2], t_2] T - L [\mathbf{q} [t_1], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1], t_1] T \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \left( - \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} \right) + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \left( - \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{(\partial \mathbf{q})^2} {\dot{\mathbf{q}}}^2 T + \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} -
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \ddot{\mathbf{q}} T \right) \, dt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the Euler–Lagrange equations imply

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T \right) 
&amp; = \left( \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \left( \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \right) \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \ddot{\mathbf{q}} \, T \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \left( \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{(\partial \mathbf{q})^2} \dot{\mathbf{q}} \right) \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \ddot{\mathbf{q}} \, T.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the previous equation, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 = {} &amp; \frac{d I'}{d \varepsilon} [0] \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; L [\mathbf{q} [t_2], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2], t_2] T - L [\mathbf{q} [t_1], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1], t_1] T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2] T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1] T \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} \, dt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Again using the Euler–Lagrange equations we get

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d t} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} \right) 
= \left( \frac{d}{d t} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}}
= \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the previous equation, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 = {} &amp; L [\mathbf{q} [t_2], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2], t_2] T - L [\mathbf{q} [t_1], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1], t_1] T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2] T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1] T \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} [t_2] - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} [t_1].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From which one can see that

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L \right) T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

is a constant of the motion, i.e., it is a conserved quantity. Since φ['''q''', 0] = '''q''', we get &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and so the conserved quantity simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L \right) T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

To avoid excessive complication of the formulas, this derivation assumed that the flow does not change as time passes. The same result can be obtained in the more general case.

===Field-theoretic derivation===
Noether's theorem may also be derived for tensor fields ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; where the index ''A'' ranges over the various components of the various tensor fields. These field quantities are functions defined over a four-dimensional space whose points are labeled by coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt; where the index ''μ'' ranges over time (''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and three spatial dimensions (''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3). These four coordinates are the independent variables; and the values of the fields at each event are the dependent variables. Under an infinitesimal transformation, the variation in the coordinates is written

:&lt;math&gt;x^\mu \rightarrow \xi^\mu = x^\mu + \delta x^\mu &lt;/math&gt;

whereas the transformation of the field variables is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^A \rightarrow \alpha^A (\xi^\mu) = \varphi^A (x^\mu) + \delta \varphi^A (x^\mu)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

By this definition, the field variations ''δφ''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; result from two factors: intrinsic changes in the field themselves and changes in coordinates, since the transformed field ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; depends on the transformed coordinates ξ&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;. To isolate the intrinsic changes, the field variation at a single point ''x''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt; may be defined

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^A (x^\mu) = \varphi^A (x^\mu) + \bar{\delta} \varphi^A (x^\mu)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the coordinates are changed, the boundary of the region of space–time over which the Lagrangian is being integrated also changes; the original boundary and its transformed version are denoted as Ω and Ω’, respectively.

Noether's theorem begins with the assumption that a specific transformation of the coordinates and field variables does not change the [[action (physics)|action]], which is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density over the given region of spacetime. Expressed mathematically, this assumption may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Omega^{\prime}} L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, \xi^{\mu} \right) d^{4}\xi - \int_{\Omega} L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^{\mu} \right) d^{4}x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where the comma subscript indicates a partial derivative with respect to the coordinate(s) that follows the comma, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt;{\varphi^A}_{,\sigma} = \frac{\partial \varphi^A}{\partial x^{\sigma}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ξ is a dummy variable of integration, and since the change in the boundary Ω is infinitesimal by assumption, the two integrals may be combined using the four-dimensional version of the [[divergence theorem]] into the following form

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{\Omega} \left\{ 
\left[ L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) - 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \right]
+ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} \left[ L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \delta x^\sigma \right]
\right\} d^4 x = 0
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The difference in Lagrangians can be written to first-order in the infinitesimal variations as

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[ L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) - 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \right] = 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi^A} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

However, because the variations are defined at the same point as described above, the variation and the derivative can be done in reverse order; they [[commutativity|commute]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\delta} {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma} = 
\bar{\delta} \frac{\partial \varphi^A}{\partial x^\sigma} = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} ( \bar{\delta} \varphi^A)
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the Euler–Lagrange field equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \right) =
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi^A}
&lt;/math&gt;

the difference in Lagrangians can be written neatly as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left[ L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) - 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^{\mu} \right) \right] \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \right) \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}
= \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} 
\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A \right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the change in the action can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_\Omega \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} 
\left\{ \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \delta x^\sigma
\right\} d^{4}x = 0
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this holds for any region Ω, the integrand must be zero

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} 
\left\{ \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \delta x^\sigma
\right\} = 0
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For any combination of the various [[symmetry in physics|symmetry]] transformations, the perturbation can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\delta x^{\mu} = \varepsilon X^\mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta \varphi^A = \varepsilon \Psi^A = \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + \varepsilon \mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]] of φ&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; in the ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt; direction. When ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; is a scalar or &lt;math&gt;{X^\mu}_{,\nu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A = \frac{\partial \varphi^A}{\partial x^{\mu}} X^\mu\,.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations imply that the field variation taken at one point equals

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\delta} \varphi^A = \varepsilon \Psi^A - \varepsilon \mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the above divergence with respect to ''ε'' at ''ε''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and changing the sign yields the conservation law

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial x^\sigma} j^\sigma = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where the conserved current equals

:&lt;math&gt;
j^\sigma = 
\left[\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A - L \, X^\sigma\right]
- \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \right) \Psi^A\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Manifold/fiber bundle derivation===
Suppose we have an ''n''-dimensional oriented [[Riemannian manifold]], ''M'' and a target manifold ''T''. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of [[smooth function]]s from ''M'' to ''T''. (More generally, we can have smooth sections of a [[fiber bundle]] over ''M''.)

Examples of this ''M'' in physics include:
* In [[classical mechanics]], in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulation, ''M'' is the one-dimensional manifold '''R''', representing time and the target space is the [[cotangent bundle]] of [[space]] of generalized positions.
* In [[field (physics)|field theory]], ''M'' is the [[spacetime]] manifold and the target space is the set of values the fields can take at any given point. For example, if there are ''m'' [[real number|real]]-valued [[scalar field]]s, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1,\ldots,\varphi_m&lt;/math&gt;, then the target manifold is '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;. If the field is a real vector field, then the target manifold is [[isomorphic]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Now suppose there is a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathbf{R},&lt;/math&gt;

called the [[Action (physics)|action]]. (Note that it takes values into '''R''', rather than '''C'''; this is for physical reasons, and doesn't really matter for this proof.)

To get to the usual version of Noether's theorem, we need additional restrictions on the [[Action (physics)|action]]. We assume &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}[\varphi]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[integral]] over ''M'' of a function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\varphi,\partial_\mu\varphi,x)&lt;/math&gt;

called the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]], depending on φ, its [[derivative]] and the position. In other words, for φ in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}[\varphi]\,=\,\int_M \mathcal{L}[\varphi(x),\partial_\mu\varphi(x),x] \, \mathrm{d}^nx.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose we are given [[boundary condition]]s, i.e., a specification of the value of φ at the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] if ''M'' is [[Compact space|compact]], or some limit on φ as ''x'' approaches ∞. Then the [[subspace topology|subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of functions φ such that all [[functional derivative]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; at φ are zero, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}[\varphi]}{\delta \varphi(x)}\approx 0&lt;/math&gt;

and that φ satisfies the given boundary conditions, is the subspace of [[on shell]] solutions. (See [[principle of stationary action]])

Now, suppose we have an [[infinitesimal transformation]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, generated by a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], ''Q'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;Q \left[ \int_N \mathcal{L} \, \mathrm{d}^n x \right] \approx \int_{\partial N} f^\mu [\varphi(x),\partial\varphi,\partial\partial\varphi,\ldots] \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu &lt;/math&gt;

for all compact submanifolds ''N'' or in other words,

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}(x)]\approx\partial_\mu f^\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'', where we set

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x)=\mathcal{L}[\varphi(x), \partial_\mu \varphi(x),x].&lt;/math&gt;

If this holds [[on shell]] and [[off shell]], we say ''Q'' generates an off-shell symmetry. If this only holds [[on shell]], we say ''Q'' generates an on-shell symmetry. Then, we say ''Q'' is a generator of a [[one-parameter group|one parameter]] [[symmetry]] [[Lie group]].

Now, for any ''N'', because of the [[Euler–Lagrange]] theorem, [[on shell]] (and only on-shell), we have

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Q\left[\int_N \mathcal{L} \, \mathrm{d}^nx \right]
&amp; =\int_N \left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\varphi} - \partial_\mu \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)} \right]Q[\varphi] \, \mathrm{d}^nx + \int_{\partial N} \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)}Q[\varphi] \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu \\
&amp; \approx\int_{\partial N} f^\mu \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is true for any ''N'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)}Q[\varphi]-f^\mu\right]\approx 0.&lt;/math&gt;

But this is the [[continuity equation]] for the current &lt;math&gt;J^\mu&lt;/math&gt; defined by:&lt;ref name=Peskin&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i35LALN0GosC&amp;pg=PA689&amp;dq=weinberg+%22symmetry+%22 |page=18 |author1=Michael E. Peskin |author2=Daniel V. Schroeder |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-201-50397-2 |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J^\mu\,=\,\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)}Q[\varphi]-f^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

which is called the '''Noether current''' associated with the [[symmetry]]. The continuity equation tells us that if we [[Integral|integrate]] this current over a [[space-like]] slice, we get a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]] called the Noether charge (provided, of course, if ''M'' is noncompact, the currents fall off sufficiently fast at infinity).

=== Comments ===
Noether's theorem is an [[on shell]] theorem: it relies on use of the equations of motion—the classical path. It reflects the relation between the boundary conditions and the variational principle. Assuming no boundary terms in the action, Noether's theorem implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial N} J^\mu \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu \approx 0~.&lt;/math&gt;

The quantum analogs of Noether's theorem involving expectation values, e.g. ⟨∫''d''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' ∂·''J''⟩&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, probing [[off shell]] quantities as well are the [[Ward–Takahashi identity|Ward–Takahashi identities]].

=== Generalization to Lie algebras ===
Suppose we have two symmetry derivations ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, [''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is also a symmetry derivation. Let's see this explicitly. Let's say

:&lt;math&gt;Q_1[\mathcal{L}]\approx\partial_\mu f_1^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;Q_2[\mathcal{L}]\approx\partial_\mu f_2^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;[Q_1,Q_2][\mathcal{L}]=Q_1[Q_2[\mathcal{L}]]-Q_2[Q_1[\mathcal{L}]]\approx\partial_\mu f_{12}^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;]&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;]. So,

:&lt;math&gt;j_{12}^\mu=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu\varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right)(Q_1[Q_2[\varphi]]-Q_2[Q_1[\varphi]])-f_{12}^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows we can extend Noether's theorem to larger Lie algebras in a natural way.

=== Generalization of the proof ===
This applies to ''any'' local symmetry derivation ''Q'' satisfying ''QS''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0, and also to more general local functional differentiable actions, including ones where the Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives of the fields. Let ''ε'' be any arbitrary smooth function of the spacetime (or time) manifold such that the closure of its support is disjoint from the boundary. ''ε''&amp;nbsp;is a [[test function]]. Then, because of the variational principle (which does ''not'' apply to the boundary, by the way), the derivation distribution q generated by ''q''[''ε''][Φ(''x'')] = ''ε''(''x'')''Q''[Φ(''x'')] satisfies ''q''[''ε''][''S'']&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0 for every&amp;nbsp;''ε'', or more compactly, ''q''(''x'')[''S'']&amp;nbsp;≈ 0&amp;nbsp;for all ''x'' not on the boundary (but remember that ''q''(''x'') is a shorthand for a derivation ''distribution'', not a derivation parametrized by ''x'' in general). This is the generalization of Noether's theorem.

To see how the generalization is related to the version given above, assume that the action is the spacetime integral of a Lagrangian that only depends on φ and its first derivatives. Also, assume

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}]\approx\partial_\mu f^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
q[\varepsilon][\mathcal{S}] &amp; = \int q[\varepsilon][\mathcal{L}] \, \mathrm{d}^n x  \\
&amp; = \int \left\{ \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi}\mathcal{L}\right) \varepsilon Q[\varphi]+ \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]\partial_\mu(\varepsilon Q[\varphi]) \right\} \, \mathrm{d}^n x \\
&amp; = \int \left\{ \varepsilon Q[\mathcal{L}] + \partial_{\mu}\varepsilon \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial \left( \partial_\mu \varphi\right)} \mathcal{L} \right] Q[\varphi] \right\} \, \mathrm{d}^n x \\
&amp; \approx \int \varepsilon \partial_\mu \left\{f^\mu-\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu\varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]Q[\varphi]\right\} \, \mathrm{d}^n x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''ε''.

More generally, if the Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives, then

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\partial_\mu\left[f^\mu-\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu\varphi)} \mathcal{L} \right] \right. &amp; \left.\!\! Q[\varphi] - 2\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \partial_\nu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]\partial_\nu Q[\varphi] \right. \\[6pt]
&amp; \left. {} + \partial_\nu\left[\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \partial_\nu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right] Q[\varphi]\right]-\,\cdots\right]\approx 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Example 1: Conservation of energy ===
Looking at the specific case of a Newtonian particle of mass ''m'', coordinate ''x'', moving under the influence of a potential ''V'', coordinatized by time ''t''. The [[Action (physics)|action]], ''S'', is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}[x] &amp; = \int L[x(t),\dot{x}(t)] \, dt \\
&amp; = \int \left(\frac m 2 \sum_{i=1}^3\dot{x}_i^2-V(x(t))\right) \, dt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term in the brackets is the [[kinetic energy]] of the particle, whilst the second is its [[potential energy]]. Consider the generator of [[time translation]]s ''Q'' = ''d/dt''. In other words, &lt;math&gt;Q[x(t)]=\dot{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that ''x'' has an explicit dependence on time, whilst ''V'' does not; consequently:

:&lt;math&gt;Q[L]=m \sum_i\dot{x}_i\ddot{x}_i-\sum_i\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x_i}\dot{x}_i = \frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{m}{2}\sum_i\dot{x}_i^2-V(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

so we can set

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{m}{2} \sum_i\dot{x}_i^2-V(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
j &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^3\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}Q[x_i]-L \\
&amp; = m \sum_i\dot{x}_i^2 -\left[\frac{m}{2}\sum_i\dot{x}_i^2 -V(x)\right] \\
&amp; = \frac{m}{2}\sum_i\dot{x}_i^2+V(x).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The right hand side is the energy, and Noether's theorem states that &lt;math&gt;\dot{j}=0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the principle of conservation of energy is a consequence of invariance under time translations.

More generally, if the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on time, the quantity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}\dot{x_i}-L&lt;/math&gt;

(called the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]) is conserved.

=== Example 2: Conservation of center of momentum ===
Still considering 1-dimensional time, let

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}[\vec{x}] &amp; = \int \mathcal{L}[\vec{x}(t),\dot{\vec{x}}(t)] \, \mathrm{d}t \\
&amp; = \int \left [\sum^N_{\alpha=1} \frac{m_\alpha}{2}(\dot{\vec{x}}_\alpha)^2 -\sum_{\alpha&lt;\beta} V_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{x}_\beta-\vec{x}_\alpha)\right] \, \mathrm{d}t
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. ''N'' Newtonian particles where the potential only depends pairwise upon the relative displacement.

For &lt;math&gt;\vec{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, let's consider the generator of Galilean transformations (i.e. a change in the frame of reference). In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;Q_i[x^j_\alpha(t)]=t \delta^j_i. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Q_i[\mathcal{L}] &amp; = \sum_\alpha m_\alpha \dot{x}_\alpha^i-\sum_{\alpha&lt;\beta}\partial_i V_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{x}_\beta-\vec{x}_\alpha)(t-t) \\
&amp; = \sum_\alpha m_\alpha \dot{x}_\alpha^i.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This has the form of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\sum_\alpha m_\alpha x^i_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; so we can set

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}=\sum_\alpha m_\alpha \vec{x}_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{j}=\sum_\alpha \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{\vec{x}}_\alpha}\mathcal{L}\right)\cdot\vec{Q}[\vec{x}_\alpha]-\vec{f}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\sum_\alpha (m_\alpha \dot{\vec{x}}_\alpha t-m_\alpha \vec{x}_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\vec{P}t-M\vec{x}_{CM}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the total momentum, ''M'' is the total mass and &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}_{CM}&lt;/math&gt; is the center of mass. Noether's theorem states:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\vec{j}} = 0 \Rightarrow {\vec{P}}-M \dot{\vec{x}}_{CM} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 3: Conformal transformation ===

Both examples 1 and 2 are over a 1-dimensional manifold (time). An example involving spacetime is a [[conformal transformation]] of a massless real scalar field with a [[Quartic interaction|quartic potential]] in (3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-[[Minkowski spacetime]].

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}[\varphi] &amp; =\int \mathcal{L}[\varphi (x),\partial_\mu \varphi (x)] \, \mathrm{d}^4x \\
&amp; =\int \left( \frac{1}{2}\partial^\mu \varphi \partial_\mu \varphi -\lambda \varphi^4\right ) \, \mathrm{d}^4x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For ''Q'', consider the generator of a spacetime rescaling. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\varphi(x)]=x^\mu\partial_\mu \varphi(x)+\varphi(x). &lt;/math&gt;

The second term on the right hand side is due to the "conformal weight" of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. Note that

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}]=\partial^\mu\varphi\left(\partial_\mu\varphi+x^\nu\partial_\mu\partial_\nu\varphi+\partial_\mu\varphi\right)-4\lambda\varphi^3\left(x^\mu\partial_\mu\varphi+\varphi\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This has the form of

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\left[\frac{1}{2}x^\mu\partial^\nu\varphi\partial_\nu\varphi-\lambda x^\mu \varphi^4 \right] = \partial_\mu\left(x^\mu\mathcal{L}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(where we have performed a change of dummy indices) so set

:&lt;math&gt;f^\mu=x^\mu\mathcal{L}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
j^\mu &amp; =\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial
(\partial_\mu\varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]Q[\varphi]-f^\mu \\
&amp; =\partial^\mu\varphi\left(x^\nu\partial_\nu\varphi+\varphi\right)-x^\mu\left( \frac 1 2 \partial^\nu\varphi\partial_\nu\varphi-\lambda\varphi^4\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Noether's theorem states that &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu j^\mu = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (as one may explicitly check by substituting the Euler–Lagrange equations into the left hand side).

Note that if one tries to find the [[Ward–Takahashi identity|Ward–Takahashi]] analog of this equation, one runs into a problem because of [[anomaly (physics)|anomalies]].

== Applications ==
Application of Noether's theorem allows physicists to gain powerful insights into any general theory in physics, by just analyzing the various transformations that would make the form of the laws involved invariant. For example:

* the invariance of physical systems with respect to spatial [[translation (physics)|translation]] (in other words, that the laws of physics do not vary with locations in space) gives the law of conservation of [[linear momentum]];
* invariance with respect to [[rotation]] gives the law of conservation of [[angular momentum]];
* invariance with respect to [[time]] translation gives the well-known [[law of conservation of energy]]

In [[quantum field theory]], the analog to Noether's theorem, the [[Ward–Takahashi identity]], yields further conservation laws, such as the conservation of [[electric charge]] from the invariance with respect to a change in the [[phase factor]] of the [[Complex number|complex]] field of the charged particle and the associated [[gauge invariance|gauge]] of the [[electric potential]] and [[vector potential]].

The Noether charge is also used in calculating the [[entropy]] of [[stationary black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vivek Iyer |author2=Wald |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.52.4430 |journal=[[Physical Review D]]  |title=A comparison of Noether charge and Euclidean methods for Computing the Entropy of Stationary Black Holes |volume=52 |issue=8 |pages=4430–9 |year=1995 |arxiv=gr-qc/9503052|bibcode = 1995PhRvD..52.4430I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12773">The '''obsolete Finnish units of measurement''' consist mostly of a variety of units traditionally used in [[Finland]] that are similar to those that were traditionally used in other countries and are still used in the United Kingdom ([[imperial units]]) and the United States ([[United States customary units]]).

Very few of these units are sometimes still used in everyday speech and even when buying and measuring things as shorthand for similar amounts in the metric system. For example, ''kappa'' (sometimes called ''isokappa'') is still used at markets to measure exactly 5 liters of potatoes. When ordering firewood, some customers (and even dealers) use ''syli'' to refer to a cubic meter, but some old people use the term to refer to various much larger amounts of firewood.

Most Finnish obsolete units of measurement were identical to [[Swedish units of measurement]], including units of length being based on the Swedish "foot" (29.69&amp;nbsp;cm) that was defined in 1605, since Finland was part of Sweden from the Middle Ages to 1809, but later some [[Obsolete Russian weights and measures|Russian]] units were also used.

The measurements were first standardized by law in 1665 and were revised in 1735. Before this, measurements often varied between towns. The king's bailiff in the town of [[Porvoo]], for example, used two sets of measures: a big one for collecting tax in kind from the populace and a smaller set to remit the assets to the king, keeping the difference for himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} However, nowadays the proverb ''mitata Porvoon mitalla'' (to measure in Porvoo units) has a positive meaning of measuring in excess or generously.

Certain units were standardized to the [[metric system]] in 1861, and Finland fully converted to the metric system in 1880.

[[File:Tremblement oculaire.jpg|thumb|Ocular microtremor tracing with burst sections underlined]]
'''Ocular microtremor''' ('''OMT''') is a constant, physiological, high frequency (peak 80Hz), low amplitude (estimated circa 150-2500nm (1)) [[human eye|eye]] [[tremor]].  

It occurs in all normal people even when the eye is apparently still and is due to the constant activity of brainstem [[oculomotor]] units. In [[coma]] there is a loss of high frequency components of tremor and the extent of this reduction is related to the patient's prognosis (2). Ocular microtremor can potentially help in the difficult diagnosis of brainstem death, as well as monitoring patients while under anaesthesia (3). Abnormal OMT records are seen in neurological conditions such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[multiple sclerosis]](4). The frequency spectrum also changes with age. 

The first description of what is now known as ocular microtremor was made in 1934 (5). More recent studies are less common for ocular microtremor than for other [[Fixation (visual)|fixational eye movements]]. Some have suggested that the reason ocular microtremor studies are more rare may be because of the difficulty inherent in measuring microtremor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alexander |first1=Robert |last2=Macknik |first2=Stephen |last3=Martinez-Conde |first3=Susana |title=Microsaccade Characteristics in Neurological and Ophthalmic Disease |journal=Frontiers in Neurology |date=2018 |volume=9 |issue=144 |pages=144 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2018.00144|pmid=29593642 |pmc=5859063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is contentious whether ocular microtremor assists vision.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Visual processes deteriorate rapidly in the absence of retinal image motion, with [[Stabilized Images]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1167/3.11.18|pmid=14765967|title=Contributions of fixational eye movements to the discrimination of briefly presented stimuli|journal=Journal of Vision|volume=3|issue=11|pages=852–64|year=2003|last1=Rucci|first1=Michele|last2=Desbordes|first2=Gaëlle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that tremor may not be a distinct eye movement at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1145/1743666.1743714|chapter=Eye tracking with the adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope|title=Proceedings of the 2010 Symposium on Eye-Tracking Research &amp; Applications - ETRA '10|pages=195|year=2010|last1=Stevenson|first1=Scott B.|last2=Roorda|first2=Austin|last3=Kumar|first3=Girish|isbn=9781605589947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">An '''ordinary law''' is a normal [[law]], generally distinguished from a [[constitutional law]], [[organic law]], or other similar law. Typically, ordinary laws are subordinate to constitutional and organic laws, and are more easily changed than constitutional or organic laws, though that should not be assumed to be the case in all jurisdictions. (For example, the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] has ruled that Spain's [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Laws]] are not hierarchically superior to ordinary laws, but simply apply to different matters.&lt;ref&gt;Sentencia de 13 de febrero de 1981, Tribunal Constitucional de España&lt;/ref&gt;) Ordinary laws often govern areas beyond the scope of constitutional or organic laws.

Normally, in a democracy, an ordinary law must first obtain a [[majority|simple majority]] of a [[congress]], [[parliament]], or other legislature, and then be signed into law by the representative of [[executive power]]. The process leading to a legislative vote may vary vastly from one jurisdiction to another: the process may be initiated by either house of a [[bicameral legislature]] or from the sole house of a [[unicameral legislature]]; from the [[head of government]] or [[head of state]]; or by popular [[initiative]]. Different jurisdictions may allow ordinary laws to be proposed by one or all of these means, and may have restrictions on which body may take the initiative for certain types of laws (for example, in some bicameral systems, tax-related laws must begin in the lower chamber of the legislature). In some jurisdictions, the legislature has a means to override an executive [[veto]] by a [[supermajority]], or the voting populace have the means to override a law by a [[referendum]].

Under [[federalism|federal]] systems, ordinary laws may be created at the level of a [[sovereign state]] but also by its constituent components: for example, by [[states of the United States]] or [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Spain]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and guide to [[category theory]], the area of study in [[mathematics]] that examines in an [[abstraction|abstract]] way the properties of particular mathematical concepts, by formalising them as collections of ''objects'' and ''arrows'' (also called [[morphism]]s, although this term also has a specific, non category-theoretical sense), where these collections satisfy certain basic conditions.  Many significant areas of mathematics can be formalised as categories, and the use of category theory allows many intricate and subtle mathematical results in these fields to be stated, and proved, in a much simpler way than without the use of categories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7137">'''Oxygen''' '''evolution''' is the process of generating molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by a [[chemical reaction]], usually from water. Oxygen evolution from [[water]] is effected by oxygenic [[photosynthesis]], [[electrolysis]] of water, and thermal decomposition of various oxides.  The biological process supports aerobic life.  When relatively pure oxygen is required industrially, it is isolated by distillation of liquified air.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E/&gt;

==Oxygen evolution in nature==
{{main|Oxygen evolving complex}}
Photosynthetic oxygen evolution is the fundamental process by which oxygen is generated in earth's [[biosphere]]. The reaction is part of the [[light-dependent reaction]]s of photosynthesis in [[cyanobacteria]] and the [[chloroplast]]s of [[green algae]] and [[plant]]s. It utilizes the energy of [[light]] to split a water molecule into its [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s for photosynthesis. Free oxygen, generated as a by-product of this reaction, is released into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;

Water oxidation is catalyzed by a [[manganese]]-containing [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] contained in [[photosystem II]] known as the [[oxygen-evolving complex]] (OEC) or water-splitting complex. Manganese is an important [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], and [[calcium]] and [[chloride]] are also required for the reaction to occur.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;The stoichiometry this reaction follows:
: 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⟶ 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The protons are released into the [[thylakoid lumen]], thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient is the driving force for [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] synthesis via [[photophosphorylation]] and coupling the absorption of light energy and oxidation of water to the creation of chemical energy during photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Raval"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raval M, Biswal B, Biswal U |title=The mystery of oxygen evolution: analysis of structure and function of photosystem II, the water-plastoquinone oxido-reductase |journal=Photosynthesis Research |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=267–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16170631| doi=10.1007/s11120-005-8163-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of discovery===
It was not until the end of the 18th century that [[Joseph Priestley]] discovered by accident the ability of plants to "restore" air that had been "injured" by the burning of a candle. He followed up on the experiment by showing that air "restored" by [[vegetation]] was ''"not at all inconvenient to a [[mouse]]."'' He was later awarded a medal for his discoveries that: ''"...no vegetable grows in vain... but cleanses and purifies our atmosphere."'' Priestley's experiments were followed up by [[Jan Ingenhousz]], a Dutch physician, who showed that "restoration" of air only worked in the presence of light and green plant parts.&lt;ref name="Raven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Raven | first = Peter H. |author2=Ray F. Evert |author3=Susan E. Eichhorn  | title = Biology of Plants, 7th Edition | publisher = W.H. Freeman and Company Publishers | date = 2005 | location = New York | pages = 115–127  | isbn = 0-7167-1007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingenhousz suggested in 1796 that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[carbon dioxide]]) is split during photosynthesis to release oxygen, while the [[carbon]] combined with water to form [[carbohydrate]]s. While this hypothesis was attractive and reasonable and thus widely accepted for a long time, it was later proven incorrect. Graduate student [[C.B. Van Niel]] at [[Stanford University]] found that [[purple sulfur bacteria]] reduce carbon to carbohydrates, but accumulate [[sulfur]] instead of releasing oxygen. He boldly proposed that, in analogy to the sulfur bacteria's forming elemental sulfur from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S ([[hydrogen sulfide]]), plants would form oxygen from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water). In 1937, this hypothesis was corroborated by the discovery that plants are capable of producing oxygen in the absence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This discovery was made by [[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robin Hill]], and subsequently the light-driven release of oxygen in the absence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was called the ''Hill reaction''. Our current knowledge of the mechanism of oxygen evolution during photosynthesis was further established in experiments tracing [[isotopes of oxygen]] from water to oxygen gas.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;

==Water electrolysis==
Together with [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), oxygen is evolved by [[electrolysis of water]]. 
[[File:Electrolysis of Water.png|thumb|300px|Diagram showing the overall [[chemical equation]].]]

Electrons (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) are transferred from the cathode to protons to form hydrogen gas. The [[half reaction]], balanced with acid, is:
:2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;   →  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

At the positively charged anode, an [[redox|oxidation]] reaction occurs, generating oxygen gas and releasing electrons to the anode to complete the circuit:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →   O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Combining either half reaction pair yields the same overall decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen:

:Overall reaction: 
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Chemical oxygen generation==
[[Chemical oxygen generator]]s consist of chemical compounds that release O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon some stimulation, usually heat. They are used in submarines and commercial aircraft, providing emergency oxygen.  Oxygen is generated by high-temperature decomposition of sodium chlorate:&lt;ref name=G&amp;E&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 NaClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  →  2 NaCl  +  3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Potassium permanganate also releases oxygen upon heating, but the yield is modest.
:2 KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16700">The '''paternal rights and abortion''' issue is an extension of both the [[abortion debate]] and the [[fathers' rights]] movement.  “About 98.3% of abortions in the United States are elective, including socio-economic reasons or for birth control. The remaining 1.3% occurs due the following reasons: in cases of rape, 0.3%; in cases of incest, 0.03%; in cases of risk to maternal life, 0.1%; in cases of risk to maternal health, 0.8%; and in cases of fetal health issues, 0.5%” &lt;ref name="Sarchive"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sarchive |first1=Johnston |title=Reasons given for abortion in the United States |url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html |accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of majority of abortions are planned, abortion is becoming a factor for disagreement and lawsuit between partners.

==History==
[[Roman law]] allowed induced abortions but regulated it in consideration of the biological father. [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Septimius Severus]] ruled circa 211 AD that a woman who had an abortion without consent from her husband should face [[exile]] for having bereaved her husband of children.&lt;ref name="riddle1"&gt;[[John M. Riddle]] (1992). ''Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance.''

Retrieved June 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[orator|speech]] ''[[Pro Cluentio]]'', delivered in 66 BC, [[Cicero]] refers to a case he had heard of in which a woman from [[Miletus]] was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] for having aborted her pregnancy, upon receiving [[bribery|bribes]] from those who stood to [[inheritance|inherit]] her husband's [[Estate (law)|estate]] if he produced no heir. Cicero said that in doing so she had "destroyed the hope of the father, the memory of his name, the supply of his race, the heir of his family, a citizen intended for the use of the republic".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. (66 BC).

A 4th century BC [[Greeks|Greek]] writer from [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], Sopater, quoted the [[lawyer]] Lysias, who had referred to a trial in [[Athens]] in which a man named Antigene accused his wife of having deprived him of a son by having an abortion.&lt;ref name="riddle1" /&gt;

==Men and abortion in law==
Whether a male has a legal right to advance his personal interest, whether it be toward [[abortion]], [[father]]hood, or [[adoption]], over that of the female, differs by region.

In 2011, it was reported that [[Indonesia]], [[Malawi]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Kuwait]], [[Maldives]], [[Morocco]], [[South Korea]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Turkey]] all had laws which required that an abortion first be authorized by the woman's husband.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/AbortionMap_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some countries, this stipulation could be bypassed or overridden if there is genuine concern for maternal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rahman, Anika |author2=Katzive, Laura |author3=Henshaw, Stanley K. |title=A Global Review of Laws on Induced Abortion, 1985–1997 |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages= |year=1998 |doi= |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2405698.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', some [[U.S. state|states]] in the [[United States]] have attempted to enact laws requiring spousal consent. All of these laws have been ruled unconstitutional, spousal consent in the 1976 decision ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Danforth]]'' and spousal awareness in the 1992 decision ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/428/52 |website=Legal Information Institute |accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cases===
In China the husband of a woman who had an abortion filed a [[lawsuit]] against her in 2002 under a law intended to grant [[sexual equality]] in terms of [[Sexual reproduction|childbearing]] and [[birth control|contraceptive]] decisions. The law stated that a woman has no overriding priority over her spouse in deciding whether to have a child.&lt;ref&gt;Maximova, Vickie.

A number of [[legal case]]s have arisen in the Western world in which men have tried to prevent women with whom they had been sexually active from obtaining an abortion, all of which failed:

*'''1978''': William Paton of [[Liverpool]], [[United Kingdom]] attempted to stop his separated wife, Joan, from undergoing an abortion in the 1978 case ''Paton v. Trustees of British Pregnancy Advisory Service Trustees''. A judge ruled in his wife's favour and Mr. Paton's later request for a hearing before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] was also denied.&lt;ref name="nolan"&gt;Nolan, David.

*'''1987''':  Robert Carver of the United Kingdom tried to prevent an abortion in the 1987 case ''C v. S''. He claimed that the Infant Life (Preservation) Act applied to the fetus, as, at the time, his ex-girlfriend was 21 weeks along. When the [[High Court of Justice]] and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] dismissed the case, it was brought before the [[House of Lords]], where three [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Law Lord]]s sided with the earlier decisions. The entire legal process took 36 hours, as the Health Authority refused to allow an abortion before a decision was reached, making it one of the fastest cases in the history of [[law of the United Kingdom|British law]]. Nonetheless, the woman involved chose to carry the pregnancy to term and gave the [[infant|baby]] to Carver.&lt;ref name="nolan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bpas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cmq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brahams D |title=An action by putative father and unborn fetus to prevent termination |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8532 |pages=576–7 |date=March 1987 |pmid=2881128 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(87)90226-1 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(87)90226-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubay claimed in court documents that he informed his ex-girlfriend he had no interest in becoming a father. Dubay also claimed in court documents that in response, she said she was infertile and that, as an extra layer of protection, she was using contraception.&lt;ref&gt;MATTHEW DUBAY v.

Dubay's lawsuit was dismised by the judge.

==Controversy==
Those who support a man's right to intervene in a woman's reproductive decisions, argue that it is unreasonable that, after fertilisation has occurred, women are often given more options with regard to [[pregnancy]] and parenthood than men.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Young, Cathy.

Harris has written that, if a man impregnates a woman with the explicit goal of having a child, in a manner that is mutually consensual, then it would be morally unacceptable for that woman to later have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1086/292777 |author= Harris GW |title=  Fathers and fetuses |journal=Ethics |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=594–603 |date=April 1986 |pmid=11658724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who object to men having a right to direct involvement argue that because it is the woman's body carrying the unborn baby, her determination for or against abortion should be the only one.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Keith.

===Pregnancy vetoing===
Bioethicist Jacob Appel has asked, “if one grants a man veto power over a woman’s choice to have an abortion in cases where he is willing to pay for the child, why not grant him the right to demand an abortion where he is unwilling to provide for the child?"&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Jacob M.  “Women’s Rights, Men’s Bodies,” New York Times, December 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opting out===
{{main|Paper Abortion}}
In reference to cases in which men who do not desire to become fathers have been required to pay [[child support]], Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in her 1998 article, "The Male Abortion: The Putative Father's Right to Terminate His Interests in and Obligations to the Unborn Child," set forth the theory of the "male abortion," in which she argues that men should be able to terminate their legal obligations to unwanted children.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McCulley MG |title=The male abortion: the putative father's right to terminate his interests in and obligations to the unborn child |journal=J Law Policy |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–55 |year=1988 |pmid=12666677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opting in====
It is also possible, rather than taking the stance that males should have the freedom to opt out of inherent responsibilities and rights, to take the stance that one must opt-in and agree to undertake those responsibilities to be compelled to follow them, and only through doing so, earn parental rights. This is what occurs during [[adoption]].

'''Pavlok''' is a wearable device that uses [[operant conditioning]] through [[haptic feedback]] to modify behavior. Users are said to be able to break bad habits by pairing the behavior with up to 150 [[volts]] of "zaptic feedback", and can establish new routines by pairing the behavior with vibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://buy.pavlok.com/pages/frontpage|title=Pavlok: Frontpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Pavlok is a Behavioral Technology Group product, created by [[Maneesh Sethi]], an author and television personality. Sethi was previously known for his writing as [[Editor-in-chief]] of ''Hack The System'', a series of articles and guides on establishing a [[passive income]] and being productive.

In 2012, Sethi was featured on [[Daily News (New York)|NY Daily News]], [[CNET]], [[Huffington Post]], and other news outlets for hiring a woman off of [[Craigslist]] to slap him across the face whenever he was distracted from his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/blogger-hires-woman-slap-procrastinates-article-1.1186931|title=Blogger hires woman to slap him when he procrastinates|last=Roberts|first=Christine|date=October 18, 2012|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/man-hires-woman-to-slap-him-every-time-hes-on-facebook/|title=Man hires woman to slap him every time he's on Facebook|newspaper=[[CNET]]|author=Matyszczyk, Chris|date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/18/maneesh-sethi-blogger-hires-craigslist-slapper-to-hit-him-unproductive_n_1980274.html|title=Maneesh Sethi, San Francisco Blogger, Hires Craigslist Slapper To Hit Him For Productivity|author=Bennett-Smith, Meredith|date=October 18, 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with the observable effects of [[operant conditioning]], Sethi founded Behavioral Technology Group in July of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://hackthesystem.com/blog/pavlok-revealed-wednesday-beta-test-the-first-habit-training-devices/|author=Sethi, Maneesh|title=Pavlok Revealed: Beta-test the first habit-training device|date=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==

Pavlok has two main hardware components: the wristband and the removable module.

===Wristband===
Pavlok's wristband is one size fits all, and is made with [[silicone]]. As of July 2015, Pavlok offers colored wristbands for separate purchase in blue, red, pink, and gray.

===Module===

The module is made to fit inside the wristband, and is constructed to prevent accidental disassembling. Inside of the module is a [[Bluetooth_Low_Energy| Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)]] unit and a [[rechargeable battery]]. Pavlok synchronizes data with the user's cellphone via [[Bluetooth_Low_Energy|BLE]]. The battery is specified to typically last around 3-6 days on a single charge and is charged via a [[micro USB|micro USB port]]. The zapping voltage is adjustable from 150 to 450 [[Volt]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlok instructions https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810wmdhDgrS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

Pavlok currently offers a private beta app for [[iOS]], acting as a remote control for the device via [[Bluetooth]]. The full app (still in development) includes a five-day audio course in [[Aversion therapy|aversion conditioning]], with custom sessions tailored specifically for [[smoking]], [[nail-biting]], and [[Binge eating|overeating]].

Pavlok is built with an [[open API]] in order to encourage users to synchronize their data with third-party health and [[fitness app]]s. Interaction with original and third-party applications is incorporated with Pavlok's unique [[payment system]], referred to as "Volts".

==Volts==
In 2014, Pavlok established its own [[digital currency]]. Users can earn Volts for their activity on the Pavlok application, such as completing an audio course or reaching a [[goal]]. Volts are an internet-based [[medium of exchange]], and can be redeemed for additional in-app courses and modules. Pavlok uses this [[payment system]] to leverage [[behavioral economics]] and improve its capacity to modify behavior, as financial incentives have been shown to enhance success in [[smoking cessation]], grade performance, and other endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1503200"|title=Nudging Smokers|author=Cass Sunstein|newspaper=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://rady.ucsd.edu/docs/faculty/Levitt_et_al_Behavioralist_School_NBER_WP18165.pdf|title=The Behavioralist Goes to School|author=Levitt, Steven D.|newspaper=NBER Working Paper Series|date=June 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shark Tank ==
In May 2016, Pavlok was featured on ABC's Shark Tank Season 7 Finale. Sethi asked the sharks for $500,000 for 3.14% equity, valuing Pavlok at nearly $16 million. Kevin O'Leary offered Maneesh $500,000 for 3.14% of Pavlok by way of a 2 year balloon loan at 7.5%. Maneesh Sethi, founder of Pavlok, declined the offer. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/episode-guide/season-07/29-episode-29|title=Shark Tank: Episode 29 - Watch Season 7 Episode 29|website=ABC|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Behavioral Technology Group is included on [[Entrepreneur Magazine|Entrepreneur Magazine's]] 2015 list of ''100 Brilliant Companies to Watch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245890|newspaper=Entrepreneur|title=100 Brilliant Companies to Watch|date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Pavlok was named a finalist in the [[MassChallenge]] accelerator program.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://masschallenge.org/startups/2015/profile/pavlok-wear-your-willpower|title=2015 Startup Profile: Pavlok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavlok was a winner in the 2015 [[Shopify]] Build a Business Competition for having the most sales in a year within the [[Electronics]] &amp; [[Gadget|Gadgets]] category.

''Proportional reasoning ''is ...

==In mathematics and physics==
In mathematics and in physics, proportionality is a mathematical relation between two quantities; it can be expressed as an equality of two ratios:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

Functionally, proportionality can be a relationship between variables in a mathematical equation. For example, given the following equation for the force of [[gravity]] (according to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]):

:&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

the force of [[gravity]] between two masses is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two masses.

==Intellectual development==
In Piaget’s model of intellectual development, the fourth and final stage is the [[formal operational stage]].  In the classic book “The Growth of Logical Thinking from Childhood to Adolescence” by [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Barbel Inhelder]] formal operational reasoning takes many forms, including propositional reasoning, deductive logic, separation and control of variables, combinatorial reasoning, and proportional reasoning.  [[Robert Karplus]], a science educator in the 1960s and 1970s, investigated all these forms of reasoning in adolescents &amp; adults.  Mr. Tall-Mr.Short was one of his studies.

==Examples==
===Inverse Proportion===
Comparable reasoning patterns exist for inverse proportion.

====Water Triangle====

 Consider a container of colored liquid inside a right triangle where the triangle can be tilted and the water levels on the left and right side can be measured on a built-in scale.  This is called a “water triangle”:
 [[Image:Water-triangle.JPG|400px|The Water Triangle]]
 The water triangle is rotated until it shows a measurement of 4 units on the left side and 6 units on the right side.
 Suppose the triangle is tilted even more until the water level on the right side is at 8 units.  Predict what the water level in units will be on the left side.

;Typical Solutions
Someone with knowledge about the area of triangles might reason: “Initially the area of the water forming the triangle is 12 since ½ * 4 * 6 = 12.  The amount of water doesn’t change so the area won’t change.  So the answer is 3 because ½ * 3 * 8 = 12.”

A correct multiplicative answer is relatively rare.  By far the most common answer is something like: “2 units because the water level on the right side increased by two units so the water level on the left side must decrease by two units and 4 – 2 = 2.”  Less frequently the reason for two units is: “Before there is a total of 10 units because 4 + 6 = 10.  The total number of units must stay the same so the answer is 2 because 2 + 8 = 10.”

So again there are individuals who are not at the formal operational level apply an additive strategy rather than a multiplicative strategy to solve an inverse proportion.  And, like the direct proportion, this incorrect strategy appears to be logical to the individual and appears to give a reasonable answer.  Students are very surprised when they actually carry out the experiment and tilt the triangle to find the answer is 3 and not 2 as they so confidently predicted.

===Viewing These Strategies as Functional Relations===
Let T be the height of Mr. Tall and S be the height of Mr. Short, then the correct multiplicative strategy can be expressed as  T/S = 3/2; this is a constant ratio relation.  The incorrect additive strategy can be expressed as  T – S = 2; this is a constant difference relation.  Here is the graph for these two equations. For the numeric values involved in the problem statement, these graphs are “similar” and it is easy to see why individuals consider their incorrect answers perfectly reasonable.

[[Image:Tall-short-graph.JPG|400px|The Constant Ratio and Constant Difference Relations.]]

Now consider our inverse proportion using the “water triangle.”  Let L be the height of the water on the left side and R be the height of the water on the right side, then the correct multiplicative strategy can be expressed as  L * R = 24; this is a constant product relation.  The incorrect additive strategy can be expressed as  L + R = 10; this is a constant sum relation.  Here is the graph for these two equations. For the numeric values involved in the problem statement, these graphs are “similar” and it is easy to see why individuals consider their incorrect answers perfectly reasonable.

[[Image:Left-right-graph.JPG|400px|The Constant Product and Constant Sum Relations.]]

==Teaching for Proportional Reasoning==
{{Howto|date=September 2009}}
As any experienced teacher will attest{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, it is not sufficient to simply tell a student his/her answer is incorrect and then instruct the student to use the correct solution.  The incorrect strategy has not been “unwired in the brain” and would re-emerge after the current lesson has been completed.

Also the additive strategies noted above cannot simply be labeled as “incorrect” since they do correctly match other real world situations.  For example, consider the following problem:

''On Independence Day this year Mr. Tall was 6 years old and Mr. Short was 4 years old.  On a future Independence Day Mr. Short is 6 years old.  How old will Mr. Tall be on that Independence Day?''

Similarly the constant sum relation can be correct for some situations.  Consider the following problem.

''There are four beavers on the left side of a river and six beavers on the right side of the river.  At a later time with the same group of beavers there are eight beavers on the right side of the river.  How many beavers will there be on the left side?''

So there are situations where the additive relations (constant difference and constant sum) are correct and other situations where the multiplicative relations (constant ratio and constant product) are correct.

===Use of Hands-On Activities and Karplus’ Learning Cycle===
It is critically important that students on their own recognize that their current mode of reasoning, say that it is additive, is inappropriate for a multiplicative problem they are trying to solve.  Robert Karplus developed a model of learning he called the learning cycle that facilitates the acquisition of new reasoning skills.

# The first phase is one of exploration in which students learn through their own actions and reactions with minimal guidance.  The learning environment has to be carefully designed to focus student’s attention on the relevant issues.  Learners may experience some [[cognitive dissonance]] if they discover their pre-existing strategy does not match observed results.  This may lead to questions that they cannot answer with their present ideas or reasoning patterns.
# In the second phase the concept is introduced and explained. Here the teacher is more active, and learning is achieved by explanation.
# Finally, in the third phase, the concept is applied to new situations and its range of applicability is extended.  Learning is achieved by repetition and practice so that new ideas and ways of thinking have time to stabilize.

Hands-on activities are extremely useful in the learning cycle.  After making predictions about the height of Mr. Tall in paper clips, the measuring tools can be introduced and the students can test their strategies.  For the student using a constant difference relation, actual measurement will show that Mr. Tall is actually nine paper clips high and this will set up some cognitive dissonance.

The same is true for the inverse relations.  Here is a picture of two students working with the “water triangle.”  Given the problem noted above, most students predict the water level on the left side will drop to two units when the water triangle is tilted.  When they carry out the experiment and see that the answer is 3 units, this establishes some cognitive dissonance.  This is a prime time for the teacher to move the lesson into the second stage of the learning cycle.

[[Image:Constant-product.png|400px|Students using the Water Triangle.]]

It is important that the students not over apply the multiplicative strategies they learn.  Therefore, some of the hands-on activities might not be based on a multiplicative relation.  Here is a picture of two students working with an apparatus where the constant sum relation is correct.

[[Image:Constant-sum.png|400px|The constant sum relation works here.]]

It is not always possible or feasible to put carefully designed hands-on activities into the hands of students.  Also, older audiences do not always react well to using hands-on experimentation.  However, it is often possible to introduce cognitive dissonance through [[thought experiments]].

===Determining a Correct Relation Based on Thought Experiments===
In all the experiments noted above there are two variables whose values change based on a fixed relation.  Consider the following problem that is similar to the Mr. Tall and Mr. Short problem.

''Here is a photograph of a father and a daughter.  In this picture the daughter is 4&amp;nbsp;cm high and the father is 6&amp;nbsp;cm high.  They decided to enlarge the picture and in the bigger picture the daughter is 6&amp;nbsp;cm high.  How high is the father in the larger picture?''

A very common answer for an individual using an additive relation is 8&amp;nbsp;cm because the father is always 2&amp;nbsp;cm higher than his daughter.  So now ask this student the following question:
''
Suppose they made a very small version of the original picture and in this small picture the father is 2&amp;nbsp;cm high.  How high will the daughter be in this small picture?''

The student quickly realizes that the strategy “the father is always 2 cm higher than his daughter” is not correct.  This can also be achieved by exploring the other extreme where the original picture is blown up to poster size and the daughter is 100&amp;nbsp;cm high. How high will the father be in this poster?  A student answering 102&amp;nbsp;cm realizes that the father and daughter are almost the same height which cannot be right.  Once cognitive dissonance is present, the teacher can introduce the correct relation, constant ratio.

The student can also be encouraged to conduct their own thought experiments, such as “what if the height of the daughter doubles in an enlargement, what will happen to the height of the father?”  Most students, including those still at the concrete operational stage, will quickly answer that the father’s height must also double.  The abstract thought experiment is: “Suppose that one of the variables is doubled in value, how will the other variable change?” If the answer is “double”, then this may be a constant ratio problem.  But if the answer is not double, such as for the age problem with Mr. Tall and Mr. Short given above, then it is not a constant ratio problem.

For inverse relations, such as the “water triangle”, limiting cases can also introduce cognitive dissonance.  For example:

''Given the initial conditions with the water level on the left at 4 units and the water level on the right at 6 units, predict what is the water level on the left if the triangle is tilted until the water level on the right is 10 units.''

Students will abandon the additive strategy at this point realizing that 0 cannot be the correct answer.  A thought experiment can be performed for inverse relations.  If one variable doubles in value, what happens to the other variable?  If the answer is ½ then this might be a constant product relation (that is, an inverse proportion).

Plotting the values of variables can also be a valuable tool for identifying whether two variables are directly proportional or not.  If they are directly proportional, then the values should be on a straight line and that line should intersect the origin.

==Expanding Functional Reasoning==
The four functional relations noted above, constant sum, constant difference, constant product, and constant ratio, are based on the four arithmetic operations students are most familiar with, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  Most relations in the real world do not fall into one of these categories.  However, if students learn simple techniques such as thought experiments and plotting graphs, they will be able to apply these techniques to more complex situations.

Again, consider Newton’s equation for the force of gravity:
:&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
If a student understands the functional relation between the variables, then he/she should be able to answer the following thought experiments.

What would happen to the force of gravitational attraction if:
*one of the masses is doubled?
*one mass doubled and the other mass halved?
*both masses doubled?
*both masses halved?
*the distance between the masses doubled?
*the distance between the masses halved?

Generally, thought experiments must be confirmed by experimental results. Many children and adults when asked to perform a thought experiment on the mass of an object and the velocity with which it falls to the earth might say that when the mass is doubled then the object will fall twice as fast. However, experimental results do not back up this “logical” thought experiment so it is always essential that theoretical results agree with experimental data.

'''Relative hour''' ([[Hebrew]] singular: {{transl|he|shaʿah zǝmanit}} / {{lang|he|שעה זמנית}}; plural: {{transl|he|shaʿot - zǝmaniyot}} / {{lang|he|שעות זמניות}}), sometimes called '''halachic hour''', '''seasonal hour''' and '''variable hour''', is a term used in [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic Jewish]] law that assigns 12 hours to each day and 12 hours to each night, all throughout the year. A relative hour has no fixed radical, but changes with the length of each day - depending on summer (when the days are long and the nights are short), and on winter (when the days are short and the nights are long). Even so, in all seasons a day is always divided into 12 hours, and a night is always divided into 12 hours, which inevitably makes for a longer hour or a shorter hour.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33); ''Questions and Responsa of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Joshua Blau), vol. 1, Rubin Mass publishers: Jerusalem 1989, ''responsum'' # 134 (pp. 251–255);  [[Yaakov de Castro]], ''`Erekh Leḥem'' (''Orach Chaim'' §233:2)&lt;/ref&gt; All of the hours mentioned by the [[Sages of Israel|Sages]] in either the [[Mishnah]] or [[Talmud]], or in other rabbinic writings, refer strictly to relative hours.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33), who wrote: "Be apprised that all of the hours that are mentioned throughout all the Mishnah are none other than relative hours, and the word ''relative'' has the connotation of those hours wherein there are twelve in the daytime, as also at night."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Questions and Responsa of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Joshua Blau), vol. 1, Rubin Mass publishers: Jerusalem 1989, ''responsum'' # 134 (p. 252)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of this ancient practice is that, unlike the standard modern [[12-hour clock]] that assigns 12 o'clock pm for [[noon]] time, in the ancient Jewish tradition noon time was always the ''sixth hour'' of the day, whereas the ''first hour'' began with the break of [[dawn]], by most exponents of Jewish law,&lt;ref&gt;''Magen Avraham'' §58:1, §433:3 of R. [[Avraham Gombiner]]; [[Maimonides]]' commentary on Mishnah ''Megillah'' 2:4; the Responsa ''Terumat HaDeshen'', ''responsum'' # 1 of R. [[Israel Isserlein]]; the ''Levush'' §267 of R. [[Mordecai Yoffe]]; ''Minchat Kohen'' (Mevoh Shemesh 2:6) of R. [[Abraham Cohen Pimentel]], in the name of Tosefot Ha-Ramban ([[Nachmanides]]) and R.

Rabbi Yechiel Michel Tukachinsky in ''Sefer Eretz Yisrael'' (p. 18:3) has written that the custom of the Land of Israel is to follow the ''Magen Avraham'' and only under extenuating circumstances may one rely on the Vilna Gaon.&lt;/ref&gt; and with sunrise by the [[Vilna Gaon]]&lt;ref&gt;''Bi'urei ha-Gra'' ("Elucidations of the Gra") §459:2&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]]. 12:o'clock am (midnight) was also the ''sixth hour'' of the night, whereas the ''first hour'' of the night began when the first three stars appeared in the night sky.

==Jewish tradition==
In old times, the hour was detected by observation of the position of the sun,&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Ravid ha-Zahav of Rabbi David Mishreqi (Mizrachi)'', ed. Shimon Giat, Betar-Ilit 2002, Responsa ''Ravid Ha-Zahav'', ''responsum'' # 13, s.v. ונהירנא (p. 182)&lt;/ref&gt; or when the first three stars appeared in the night sky. During the first six hours of the day, the sun is seen in the eastern sky. At the ''sixth hour'', the sun is always at its [[zenith]] in the sky, meaning, it is either directly overhead, or parallel (depending on the [[Hemispheres of the Earth|hemisphere]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Pesahim'' 12b; 11b&lt;/ref&gt; Those persons living in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the sun at noon time will appear overhead slightly towards the south, whereas for those living in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the sun at noon time will appear overhead slightly towards the north. From the 6th and a half hour to the 12th hour, the sun inclines towards the west, until it sets. The conclusion of a day at the end of twilight may slightly vary in minutes from place to place, depending on the elevation and the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Meir Kagan]], ''[[Mishnah Berura]]'' on ''Shulhan Arukh'' (''Orah Hayyim'' 261:2:23), otherwise known as the time it takes to walk "three quarters of a biblical mile."&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, nightfall ushers in more quickly in the low-lying valleys, than it does on a high mountaintop.&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Shabbat'' 118b) we read: Rabbi Jose has said: “Let my portion be with those who usher in the Sabbath day [at its outset] in [[Tiberias]], and with those who dismiss the Sabbath day [at its recess] in [[Sepphoris]].” This has been explained by Aaron Mordechai Freedman (editor of the 1987 Soncino edition of ''Tractate Shabbath''): "In Tiberias, which was situated in a valley, the Sabbath commenced rather earlier, whilst in Sepphoris, which was on a mountain, it terminated rather later than elsewhere." (v. ''Hebrew-English Edition of the Babylonian Talmud'', Tractate Shabbath, Soncino edition, London 1987, s.v. ''Shabbath'' 118b, note (b)3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Freedman's description of twilight being, literally, an oscillating physical reality dependent upon one's location is supported by Rabbi [[Joseph ibn Migash]] (1077–1141) [''Responsa of R. Joseph ibn Migash'', ''responsum'' # 45] and by Rabbi [[David ben Zimra]] (c. 1479–1573) [''Responsa of Rabbi David ben Zimra'', book I, ''responsum'' # 76], as also by Rabbi Hayyim Eliezer, the son of [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna]] (13th century), who also compiled a book called "Or Zarua" (''responsum'' # 186). Apparently, there is a local phenomenon relating to light emanating from fixed stars in the sky, and their becoming visible once a certain level of darkness has enveloped the land. [[Rashi]], however, differs in view, whose opinion is supported also by Rabbi [[Menachem Meiri]] (1249–1306) Langa's Edition, p. 460, and Rabbi [[Nissim ben Jacob]] (990–1062), and who all thought that twilight was a fixed time for all, but that the people of Tiberias and Sepphoris were merely stringent in their religious practices, the one group welcoming the Sabbath early, while the other departing from it as late as possible.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The conventional Jewish way of calibrating the time of day is to reckon the "first hour" of the day with the rise of [[dawn]] ({{Lang-he-n|עמוד השחר}}), that is to say, approximately 72 minutes before sunrise,&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33); ''Megillah'' 2:4 (p. 232)&lt;/ref&gt; and the end of the day commencing shortly after sunset when the first three medium-size stars have appeared in the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;''Responsa of Rabbi [[David ben Zimra]]'', Book 4, Warsaw 1882 (reprinted), s.v. ''responsum'' # 1353 (282)&lt;/ref&gt; From the moment of sunset when the sun is no longer visible until the appearance of the first three medium-size stars is a unit of time called evening [[twilight]] ({{Lang-he-n|בין השמשות}}). In the Talmud, twilight is estimated at being the time that it takes a person to walk three quarters of a [[biblical mile]] (i.e. 1,500 cubits, insofar that a biblical mile is equal to 2,000 cubits).&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Shabbat'' 34b&amp;ndash;35a; [[Chaim Yosef David Azulai]], ''Birkei Yosef'' (Orah Hayyim, § 261:1), Levorno 1774, citing the author of ''Ginat Weradim'', who wrote: "The world has it as a practice in all the Diaspora communities of Israel [to follow the opinion of] the ''[[Geonim]]''" (i.e. with respect to the time of ''bayn ha-shemashot'' (twilight; nightfall), so that immediately following sunset begins the time known as ''bayn ha-shemashot'', which is the time it takes to walk three quarters of a biblical mile). The opinion of Rabbi Chaim Azulai comes to counter a variant opinion that is also found in the Talmud (''Pesahim'' 94a), where it states that a man is able to walk four ''mil'' between sunset and nightfall, an opinion rejected by most exponents of Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Yosef Karo|Maran]]'s ''Shulhan Arukh'', a man traverses a biblical mile in 18 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Karo, ''Shulhan Arukh'' (''[[Orah Hayyim]]'' § 459:2)&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, one is able to walk three quarters of a mile in 13½ minutes. According to [[Maimonides]], a man walks a biblical mile in 24 minutes, meaning, three quarters of a mile is done in 18 minutes. In Jewish law, the short period of dusk or twilight (from the moment the sun has disappeared over the horizon until the appearance of the first three stars) is a space of time whose designation is doubtful, partly considered day and partly considered night. When the first medium-size star appears in the night sky, it is still considered day; when the second star appears, it is an ambiguous case. When the third star appears, it is the beginning of the ''first hour'' of the night. Between the break of dawn and the first three medium-size stars that appear in the night sky there are always 12 hours.

In the [[Modern Age]] of astral science and of precise astronomical calculations, it is now possible to determine the length of the ever-changing hour by simple mathematics. To determine the length of each relative hour, one needs but simply know two variables: (a) the precise time of sunrise, and (b) the precise time of sunset. Since the actual day begins approximately 72 minutes before sunrise, and ends 13½ minutes after the sun has already set and can no longer be seen over the horizon (according to Maran),&lt;ref&gt;Shulhan Arukh (''Orah Hayyim'' § 261:2)&lt;/ref&gt; or 18 minutes (according to Maimonides), by collecting the total number of minutes in any given day and dividing the total number of minutes by 12, the dividend that one is left with is the number of minutes to each hour. In summer months, when the days are long, the length of each hour during daytime can be as much as 77 minutes or more, whereas the length of each hour during nighttime can be less than 42 minutes.

==Practical bearing==
In Jewish [[Halacha]], the practical bearing of this teaching is reflected in many ''[[halachic]]'' practices. For example, whenever observant Jews refer to the appointed time for reciting the verses of ''[[Kriyat Shema]]'', ideally, this recital must be made from the time of sunrise until the end of the ''third hour'' of the day, a time that actually fluctuates on the standard 12-hour clock, depending on summer and winter.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33)&lt;/ref&gt; Its application is also used in determining the time of the [[Shacharit|Morning Prayer]], traditionally said, as a first resort, from sunrise until the end of the ''fourth hour'',&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Karo, ''Shulhan Arukh'' (''[[Orah Hayyim]]''  § 89:1)&lt;/ref&gt; but as a last resort can be said until noon time,&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Berakhot'' 4:1 (Maimonides, [[Mishne Torah]], ''Hil. Tefillah'' 3:1) &lt;/ref&gt; and which times will vary if one were to rely solely on the dials of the standard [[12-hour clock]], depending on the Summer months and Winter months.

On the [[eve of Passover]], Jews are only permitted to eat leavened bread-stuffs until the ''fourth-hour'' of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah ([https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Pesachim.1.4?lang=bi ''Pesahim'' 1:4)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish tradition, prayers were usually offered at the time of the [[Whole-burnt offering|daily whole-burnt offerings]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rabbeinu Hananel's Commentary on Tractate Berakhot'' (ed. David Metzger),Jerusalem 1990, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 26a (p. 51)&lt;/ref&gt; The historian, [[Josephus]], writing about the daily whole-burnt offering, says that it was offered twice each day, in the morning and about the ''ninth hour''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (xiv.iv.§ 3)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishnah]], a compendium of Jewish oral laws compiled in the late 2nd-century CE, says of the morning daily offering that it was offered in the ''fourth hour'',&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Eduyot'' 6:1&lt;/ref&gt; but says of the late afternoon offering: "The daily whole-burnt offering was slaughtered at a half after the ''eighth hour'', and offered up at a half after the ''ninth hour''."&lt;ref name=MishnahPesahim&gt;''The Mishnah'' (ed. [[Herbert Danby]]), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, s.v. ''Pesahim'' 5:1, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, when describing the slaughter of the [[Passover offering]]s on the eve of Passover (the 14th day of the lunar month [[Nisan]]), Josephus writes: "...their feast which is called the Passover, when they slay their sacrifices, from the ''ninth hour'' to the ''eleventh'', etc." (roughly corresponding to 3 o'clock pm to 5 o'clock pm).&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Wars of the Jews|Wars]]'' (vi.ix.§ 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Mishnah states that on the eve of Passover the daily whole-burnt offering was slaughtered at a half past the ''seventh hour'', and offered up at a half past the ''eighth hour''.&lt;ref name=MishnahPesahim/&gt;

'''Reverse chronology''' is a method of story-telling whereby the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is revealed in reverse order.

In a story employing this technique, the first [[Scene (fiction)|scene]] shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.

Many stories employ [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], showing prior events, but whereas the scene order of most conventional films is A-B-C-etc., a film in reverse chronology goes Z-Y-X-etc.

As a hypothetical example, if the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' was told using reverse chronology, the opening scene would depict Jack chopping the beanstalk down and killing the giant. The next scene would feature Jack being discovered by the giant and climbing down the beanstalk in fear of his life. Later, we would see Jack running into the man with the infamous magic beans, then, at the end of the film, being sent off by his mother to sell the cow.

== Purpose ==
The unusual nature of this method means it is only used in stories of a specific nature. For example, ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' features a man with [[anterograde amnesia]], meaning he is unable to form new memories. The film parallels the protagonist's perspective by unfolding in reverse chronological order, leaving the audience as ignorant of the events that occurred prior to each scene (which, played in reverse chronological order, will not be revealed until later) as the protagonist is.

In the film ''[[Irréversible]],'' an act of [[homicide|homicidal]] violence takes place at the start of the movie (i. e., it is the final event to take place). During the remainder of the film we learn not only that the violence is an act of vengeance, but what exactly is being avenged. The film was highly controversial for its graphic nature; had the scenes been shown in chronological order, this violent content would make it a simple, and pointlessly brutal, revenge movie. However, as it is, told in reverse, the audience is made to consider the exact consequences of each action, and there is often "more than meets the eye."

== Examples of use ==

=== Literature ===
The epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', written by [[Virgil]] in the 1st century BC, uses reverse chronology within scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Michael von; &amp; Schmeling, Gareth L. (1997). '' History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius, Vol. 1''. Brill. p. 681. {{ISBN|90-04-09630-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', the middle part of the story shows a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of a dead body at the beginning of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of [[W.

[[University of California Press]]. p. 91. {{ISBN|0-520-24622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Long View'' (1956) by [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]] describes a marriage in reverse chronology from 1950s London back to its beginning in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/30/hilary-mantel-elizabeth-jane-howard-novelist Hilary Mantel in The Guardian, 30 January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lewis Wallant]] uses flashbacks in reverse chronology in ''The Human Season'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Serafin, Steven; &amp; Bendixen, Alfred (2003). ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature''. [[Continuum International Publishing Group]].  p. 1189. {{ISBN|0-8264-1517-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel ''Christopher Homm'' (1965), by [[C. H. Sisson]], is also told in reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Dominic (2006). ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 1036. {{ISBN|0-521-83179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip K. Dick]], in his 1967 novel ''[[Counter-Clock World]]'', describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse, resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves ("old-birth"), living their lives in reverse, eventually ending in returning to the womb, and splitting into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man. The novel was expanded from Dick's short story "Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday", first published in the August 1966 edition of [[Amazing Stories]].

[[Martin Amis]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]'' tells the story of a man who, it seems, brings dead people to life. Eventually it is revealed that the story is being seen backwards, and he was a doctor at [[Auschwitz]] who brought death to live people. He escaped to the United States, and the novel starts with his death and ends with his birth. Amis writes in the Afterword that he had a "certain paragraph" from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'' (1969) in mind.  As he waits to be taken by aliens to the planet Tralfamadore, the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, watches a war movie backwards. American planes full of holes fly backwards as German planes suck bullets from them; bombers take their bombs back to base where they are returned to the States, reduced to ore and buried. The American fliers became high school kids again, and, Billy guesses, Hitler ultimately returns to babyhood.

[[Iain M. Banks|Iain Banks]]'s novel ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' interweaves two parallel stories, one told in standard chronology and one in reverse, both concluding at a critical moment in the main character's life.

[[Julia Alvarez]]'s novel ''[[How the García Girls Lost Their Accents]]'' opens in 1989 with one of the characters returning to her native Dominican Republic. The story of why the family left and their attempts to succeed in New York are told in reverse chronological order, with the last events happening in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arls.org/2011/11/arls-teen-book-review-how-the-garcia-girls-lost-their-accents/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre ===
A number of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] have employed this technique. [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart|Moss Hart's]] 1934 play, ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', is told in reverse order, as is the [[Harold Pinter]] play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' (1978). Kaufman and Hart's play was adapted as [[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|a musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim]] in 1981, and Pinter's play was made into [[Betrayal (1983 film)|a film]] in 1983.

=== Film ===
In 1927, [[Jean Epstein]]'s ''La glace à trois faces'' (''The Three Sided Mirror'') features a sequence where the events happen in reverse, beginning with the protagonist's exit from a room until the viewer sees the entrance. The Czech comedy ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' (1966) is a farce which starts with a guillotined man finding his head popped back on his shoulders and ends with him as a new-born being pushed back into his mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,841358,00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: Happy End | date=1968-06-28 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atom Egoyan]], influenced by Pinter's plays, tells the story of ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' (1997) in reverse chronology, with the first scene of the film set in 1977 and the last in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;MacDermott, Felim; &amp; McGrath, Declan (2003). ''Screenwriting''. [[Focal Press]]. p. 172. {{ISBN|0-240-80512-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique was later employed in ''[[Peppermint Candy]]'' (2000), by [[South Korea]]n director [[Lee Chang-dong]]; in ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000), a mystery directed by [[Christopher Nolan]] about short term memory loss; and in [[Jean-Luc Godard|Jean-Luc Godard's]] short film ''De l'origine du XXIe siècle pour moi'' (2000).&lt;ref name="Gateward"&gt;Gateward, Frances K. (2007). ''Seoul Searching: Culture and Identity in Contemporary Korean Cinema''. [[SUNY Press]]. p. 136. {{ISBN|0-7914-7225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Irréversible]]'' (2002), the technique is used so thoroughly that the [[Closing credits|end credits]] are not only shown at the beginning of the movie, but they roll ''down'' the screen, rather than upwards as is familiar.

The first several scenes in 2003's film ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]'', starring [[John Cusack]], occur in reverse order.

The 2004 film ''[[5x2]]'', directed by [[François Ozon]], tells the story of a relationship between two people in five episodes using reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=313595 | work=The New York Times | first=A. O. | last=Scott | accessdate=2010-05-22 | title=We're Sorry | date=2005-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), a main substory is told in reverse.

''Coup de Sang'', a French film by Jean Marboeuf (2006), uses limited reverse chronology. The film begins with the revelation that the main character will commit a murder one week from the next scene, although it is not revealed who will be killed or why.

In the 2007 movie ''[[P.S. I Love You (film)|P.S. I Love You]]'', the scenes in which Gerry Kennedy ([[Gerard Butler]]) meets and courts Holly ([[Hilary Swank]]) are shown in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/P-S-I-Love-You-2797.html |author= Calamari, Alexandra |date= 2007 |title= ''P.S. I Love You'' |publisher= Cinema Blend |accessdate= July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 Tamil movie, ''[[Manmadan Ambu (film)|Manmadan Ambu]]'', the song "Neela Vaanam" (visuals inspired by [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]") is shown in a reverse sequence.

=== Television ===
{{See also|The Backwards Episode}}

The made-for-television drama ''[[Two Friends (1986 film)|''Two Friends'']]'' (1986), by [[Jane Campion]], and the 1997 episode, "[[The Betrayal]]", of the hit sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', employs the technique. The ''Seinfeld'' episode is a take-off of the Harold Pinter play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' and has a character named "Pinter."&lt;ref name="Gateward"/&gt;  [[Redrum (The X-Files)|"Redrum"]], a 2000 episode of ''[[The X-Files]],'' uses the technique in focusing on a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The 2002 ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' episode "Hindsight" uses reverse chronology to illustrate the events leading to traumatic car accident. A 1997 [[Star Trek: Voyager|''Star Trek: Voyager'']] episode, "[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]", which writer Kenneth Biller claimed was based on a [[Martin Amis]] novel [[Time's Arrow (novel)|''Time's Arrow'']], also features a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The [[Sealab 2021|''Sealab 2021'']] episode "Shrabster" is also in reverse order. For a few seasons, the revived [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] had an extensive storyline focusing on a relationship between the Doctor and his companions' daughter (River Song) from the future based on "opposite timelines" (i.e., as the Doctor was travelling through time on one path, River was travelling on an opposite path) causing them to interact in opposite chronological order. In 2017, the British tv mini-series ''Rellik'' (Killer backwards) tells a story about a serial killer in backwards order. In 2018, the episode "[[Once Removed]]", from the series [[Inside No. 9|''Inside No. 9'']] uses reverse chronology to tell a dark story about a family who is moving house, and the murder that subsequently begins. Also from 2018, the second installment of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] anthology series ''[[American Crime Story]]'' focuses on [[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story|the assassination of designer Gianni Versace]], employing reverse chronology through the course of several episodes to explore the background of Versace's killer Andrew Cunanan.

=== Comics ===
The story "The Time Eater" from issue 40 of the comic "[[Vampirella]]", scripted by Jack Butterworth and published in 1975, included the concept of human lives running backwards. People were shown to be exhumed, reunited with families, separated from their spouses in order to attend school, and finally returned to the womb. Dialogue was reversed also. [[Alan Moore]]'s 1983 short story "The Reversible Man" from issue 308 of the comic "[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]" told an ordinary man's life backwards, using the same concept as Butterworth but recasting it as a first-person narrative. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] wrote an issue of the ongoing [[Midnighter]] series told in reverse chronology.  The issue explored the fact that the character Midnighter has the ability to calculate millions of possible scenarios for any given situation.  The issue does not have the scenes in reverse order, but rather the individual pages run backwards.

Issue 43 of Bongo's "[[Simpsons Comics]]" is told in reverse order: the story opens with a depiction of a crane lifting a crashed car out of a lake; each subsequent scene (which lasts for one page) carries a caption informing the reader that it took place, for instance, "20 minutes earlier". The penultimate page jumps back thirty years and shows [[Homer Simpson]] as a child

=== Anime ===
The 2007 anime television series ''[[Touka Gettan]]'' employed entirely this narrative method. All 26 episodes were aired in chronologically reverse order, with the first episode being the ending of the story while the last episode being the beginning.

=== Music ===
The lyrics to "[[All Along the Watchtower#Background|All Along the Watchtower]]", written by [[Bob Dylan]], are, he says, "in a rather reverse order"; indeed, the final verse begins with the words "All along the watchtower", and if reversed, the [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s would tell the story in the correct order.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The lyrics to "Apparition. Apparitions." by [[Trophy Scars]] describe the events leading up to a woman's suicide in reverse order, beginning with her death and ending with her initial romance with her boyfriend.

The song "One Thing Leads to Another" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] (on a limited release of their 1993 album ''[[Very (Pet Shop Boys album)|Very]]'') describes the events leading up to a man's death in reverse order.

Multiple music videos, including [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]" use reverse chronology in which a scene plays backwards while someone sings normally. This is done by filming the video chronologically but getting the actor to sing the lyrics backwards. The music video for Enigma's "Return to Innocence" uses reverse chronology showing a man's life, beginning with his death as an old man and ending with his baptism as an infant. The music video for [[Linkin Park]]'s "Bleed It Out" also uses the same method, whereas the band performs normally, but everything else is reversed. In 2016, Malaysian Singer-Songwriter Yuna uses reverse chronology in her music video "Lanes".

The events of the song "Reverse" by [[SomeKindaWonderful]], as said in the title itself, are told in reverse chronology.

The lyrics in "Rewind" by NaS also tell a story in reverse chronology, with some of the dialogue even being in reverse order.

"Good Mistake" Album by [[Bahram Nouraei]] is the first Iranian concept album ever made inspired by reverse chronology as the storytelling method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahramnouraei.com/about#/|title=Bahram Nouraei&amp;nbsp;— Official Website|website=bahramnouraei.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been several discussions as to how the picturisation of Neela Vaanam "Manmadan Ambu" (sung by Kamal Haasan himself) has been slightly inspired from official video of Coldplay's The Scientist. The whole song has been depicted in such a way so as to highlight the events that led to the death of Mannar's (Kamal's character) French wife Juliet, in reverse.

=== Video game ===
The [[Dead Island announcement trailer|announcement trailer]] of 2011 video game, ''[[Dead Island]]'', also present in reverse chronological order with flash of chronological action edited into the whole video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|website=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6419">The '''right to petition government for redress of grievances''' is the [[human rights|right]] to make a complaint to, or seek the assistance of, one's [[government]], without fear of punishment or reprisals, ensured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1791). Article 44 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] ensures the right to petition to the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights  of the European Union (2000)]], Article 44&lt;/ref&gt;  
The right can be traced back to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], Article 17&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the [[Petition of Right|Petition of Right  (1628)]], and [[Magna Carta|Magna Carta (1215)]].

==Jurisdictions==
===United States===
{{Main|Right to petition in the United States}}
The prohibition of abridgment of the "right to [[petition]]" originally referred only to the [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[US federal courts]].

The right to petition includes, under its umbrella, the petition. For example, in January 2006, the US Senate considered S. 2180,&lt;ref name="s.2180"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s2180|publisher=govtrack.us|title=Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; an omnibus "ethics reform" bill. This bill contained a provision (Section 204)&lt;ref name="section204"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s2180/text/is#link=II_204_a_2_~Q1_18_~T1&amp;nearest=idDA833CD0144B4F8A95945AEBE61D69F8:|title=Section 204|publisher=govtrack.us}}{{citation broken|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish federal regulation, for the first time, of certain efforts to encourage "grassroots [[lobbying]]". The bill said that "'grassroots lobbying' means the voluntary efforts of members of the general public to communicate their own views on an issue to Federal officials or to encourage other members of the general public to do the same".

This provision was opposed by a broad array of organizations, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[National Right to Life Committee]], and the [[National Rifle Association]].{{Citation needed|reason=source?|date=December 2011}} On January 18, 2007, the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] voted 55-43 to strike Section 221 from the bill.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

There are ongoing conflicts between organizations that wish to impose greater restrictions on citizen's attempts to influence or "lobby" policymakers.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/petition/topic.aspx?topic=sue |publisher=First Amendment Center |first=Adam |last=Newton |title=Petition - Right to sue |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324191941/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/petition/topic.aspx?topic=sue |archivedate=March 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the right of individuals, groups, and corporations (via [[corporate personhood]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}), to [[lobbying|lobby]]&lt;ref name="ifac1"/&gt; the government.

Another controversial bill, the [[Executive Branch Reform Act (2007)|Executive Branch Reform Act]], H.R. 984, would require over 8,000 Executive Branch officials to report into a public database nearly any "significant contact" from any "private party", a term that the bill defines to include almost all persons other than government officials. The bill defines "significant contact" to be any "oral or written communication (including electronic communication) . . . in which the private party seeks to influence official action by any officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States." This covers all forms of [[communication]], one way or two ways, including [[Letter (message)|letters]], [[fax]]es, [[e-mail]]s, phone messages, and petitions. The bill is supported by some organizations as an expansion of "government in the sunshine", but other groups oppose it as an infringing on the right to petition by making it impossible for citizens to communicate their views on controversial issues to government officials without those communications becoming a matter of [[public record]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/FreeSpeech/WaxmanDavisHR984.pdf Memorandum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401080352/http://www.nrlc.org/FreeSpeech/WaxmanDavisHR984.pdf |date=2007-04-01 }}: "Congressman Waxman advances grave new threat to citizens’ ‘right to petition’ government officials," by Douglas Johnson and Susan Muskett, J.D., National Right to Life Committee, February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/FreeSpeech/DoJletteronHR984.pdf Letter from Richard D.

'''''Walden Two''''' is a [[utopian novel]] written by [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral]] psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]], first published in 1948.  In its time, it could have been considered [[science fiction]], since science-based methods for altering people's behavior did not yet exist.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1986). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1348231/pdf/jeabehav00047-0109.pdf "Some Thoughts About the Future"]. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', '''45'''(2), p. 229. "What the protagonist in ''Walden Two'' called a behavioral technology was at the time still science fiction, but it soon moved into the real world."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1948). ''Walden Two.'' Indianapolis: [[Hackett Publishing Company]]. Revised 1976 edition, page vi. {{ISBN|0-87220-779-X}}. "The 'behavioral engineering' I had so frequently mentioned in the book was, at the time, little more than science fiction".&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods  are now known as [[applied behavior analysis]].

''Walden Two'' is controversial because its characters speak of a rejection of [[free will]],&lt;ref&gt;Aschner, Mary Jane McCue (1965). "The Planned Man: Skinner". ''The Educated Man: Studies in the History of Educational Thought.'' Paul Nash, Andreas M. Kazamias, and Henry J. Perkinson (Editors). [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], pp. 389–421. "Public reaction to ''Walden Two'', with its proposal for planned man, was initially slow. But eventually Skinner found himself at the storm center of a controversy that has scarcely abated to this day.  Philosophers and psychologists charged into the latest jousting match in the perennial tourney between proponents of determinism and defenders of free will". p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; including a rejection of the proposition that human behavior is controlled by a non-corporeal entity, such as a [[spirit]] or a [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivie, Stanley D.

==Synopsis==
The [[first-person narrator]] and [[protagonist]], Professor Burris, is a university instructor of psychology, who is approached by two young men (one a former student) sometime in the late 1940s. The young men are recent veterans of [[World War II]] and, intrigued by [[utopian]]ism, express interest in an old acquaintance of Burris, named T. E. Frazier, who in the 1930s started an [[intentional community]] that still thrives. Burris contacts Frazier, who invites them all to stay for several days to experience life in the supposedly utopian community. Venturing to the community, named Walden Two, the young men bring their girlfriends and Burris brings along a colleague named Professor Castle, who teaches philosophy and ethics.

The rest of the book proceeds largely as a [[novel of ideas]], mostly involving Frazier, a smug, talkative, and colorful character, guiding his new visitors around Walden Two and proudly explaining its socio-politico-economic structures and collectivist achievements. A wide range of intellectual topics such as [[behavioral modification]], [[political ethics]], [[educational philosophy]], [[sexual equality]] (specifically, advocacy for [[women in the workforce]]), the [[common good]], [[historiography]], [[political freedom|freedom]] and [[free will]], the [[problem of free will|dilemma of determinism]], [[fascism]], [[American democracy]], and [[Soviet communism]] are discussed and often debated among the self-satisfied Frazier, the skeptical and doubting Castle, and the quietly intrigued Burris.

In effect, Walden Two operates using a flexible design, by continually testing the most successful, evidence-based strategies in order to organize the community. Frazier argues that Walden Two thus avoids the way that most societies collapse or grow dysfunctional: by remaining dogmatically rigid in their politics and social structure. He verifies Walden Two's success by pointing to its members' overall sense of happiness and freedom&amp;mdash;thanks in part to a program of "[[behavioral engineering]]" begun at birth. Despite these behavior-guiding procedures during childhood, the adults of Walden Two indeed appear to be legitimately peaceful, productive, and happy people; they also appear to govern the course of their own lives.

Frazier delightedly explains that Walden Two's decision-making system is not authoritarian, anarchic, or even democratic. Except for a small fluctuating group of community organizers, called Planners (temporarily including Frazier), Walden Two has no real governing body; certainly, the Planners have no power to exercise violent force on the community, a feature that Frazier often praises. Each member of the community is apparently self-motivated, with an amazingly relaxed work schedule of only four average hours of work a day, directly supporting the common good and accompanied by the freedom to select a fresh new place to work each day. The members then use the large remainder of their  time to engage in creative or recreational activities of their own choosing. The only money is a simple system of points that buys greater leisure periods in exchange for less desirable labor. Members automatically receive ample food and sleep, with higher needs met by nurturing one's artistic, intellectual, and athletic interests, ranging from music to literature and from chess to tennis. 

As Burris and the other visitors tour the grounds, they discover that certain radically unusual customs have been established in Walden Two, quite bizarre to the American mainstream, but showing apparent success in the long run. Some of these customs include that children are raised communally, families are non-nuclear, free affection is the norm, and personal expressions of thanks are taboo. Such behavior is mandated by the community's individually self-enforced "Walden Code", a guideline for self-control techniques, which encourages members to credit all individual and other achievements to the larger community, while requiring minimal strain. [[Community counselors]] are also available to supervise behavior and assist members with better understanding and following the Code.

Excitedly, two of the young visitors sign up and are soon admitted as permanent members. Castle, though, has fostered a growing hunch that Frazier is somehow presenting a sham society or is in fact, secretly, a dictator. Defending the virtues of democracy, Castle finally confronts Frazier directly, accusing him of [[despotism]], though he has no definitive proof. Frazier rebuts, on the contrary, that the vision for Walden Two is as a place safe from all forms of despotism, even the "despotism of democracy". 

At some points, Frazier and Burris have pleasant talks in private, with Frazier revealing that other communities loosely associated with Walden Two have now cropped up, the most recent being Walden Six. Although enticed by Walden Two's obvious success as a peaceful community, Burris finds it difficult to look past Frazier's irritating pride and boastfulness about the community. During one conversation, Frazier admits to being boastful, but argues that his personality should not influence Burris's opinion of Walden Two and his own observations. By the end of their stay, the remaining visitors leave the community in a mostly impressed state of wonder, except for Castle, who has stubbornly settled on the idea that, somehow, Frazier is a scoundrel and the community is fraudulent. 

During the visitors' trip back to the university, Burris ultimately decides in an inspired moment that he wishes to fully embrace the Walden Two lifestyle. Quickly abandoning his professorial post, Burris travels back in a long and spiritually satisfying journey on foot; he is welcomed once again to Walden Two with open arms.

==The community==
The novel describes "an experimental community called Walden Two".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1985). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741768/pdf/behavan00064-0007.pdf "News From Nowhere, 1984"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''8'''(1), pp. 5–14. "My name is Burris. I live in an experimental community called Walden Two". p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altus"&gt;Altus, Deborah E., and Morris, Edward K. (2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2778813/pdf/bhan-32-02-319.pdf "B. F. Skinner's Utopian Vision: Behind and Beyond ''Walden Two''"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''32'''(2), pp. 319–335. B. F. Skinner regarded ''Walden Two'' as his "book about an experimental community". p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The community is located in a rural area and "has nearly a thousand members".&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The community encourages its members "to view every habit and custom with an eye to possible improvement" and to have "a constantly experimental attitude toward everything".&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The culture of Walden Two can be changed if experimental evidence favors proposed changes. The community emulates (on a communal scale) the [[simple living]] and [[self-sufficiency]] that [[Henry David Thoreau]] practiced (on an individual scale) at [[Walden Pond]], as described in his 1854 book ''[[Walden]]''. Walden Two engages in behavioral engineering of young children that aims toward cooperative relationships and the erasure of competitive sentiments. The community has also dissolved the [[nuclear family]] through placing the responsibility of child-rearing in the hands of the larger community and not just the child's parents or immediate family.

==Community governance==
Walden Two consists of four loose classes or groupings of people by occupation (though they are not akin to strict [[economic class]]es): ''Planners'', ''Managers'', ''Workers'', and ''Scientists''. Walden&amp;nbsp;Two has a constitution that provides for a “''Board of Planners''”, which is Walden&amp;nbsp;Two’s “only government”,&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"&gt;''Walden Two,'' p.&amp;nbsp;48.&lt;/ref&gt; though the power they wield only amounts to that, approximately, of community organizers. The “Board of Planners” was conceived of while Walden&amp;nbsp;Two was still in its earliest theoretical stages, and there are “six Planners, usually three men and three women”,&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; who are “charged with the success of the community. They make policies, review the work of the Managers (heads of each area of labor), keep an eye on the state of the nation in general. They also have certain judicial functions.”&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A Planner “may serve for ten years, but no longer.”&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A vacancy on the Board of Planners is filled by the Board "from a pair of names supplied by the Managers".&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; Furthermore, the Walden&amp;nbsp;Two constitution “can be changed by a unanimous vote of the Planners and a two-thirds vote of the Managers”.&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p.&amp;nbsp;254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazier and five other people constitute the current Board of Planners during Burris’s visit to Walden&amp;nbsp;Two. Planners hold office in staggered, limited terms. They do not rule with any kind of force and are so extremely opposed to creating a [[cult of personality]], system of favoritism, or other possibilities for corruption going against the common good that they do not even publicly announce their office, and, likewise, most of the community members do not bother to know the Planners' identities. Due to this and also as a result of this, the Planners live as modestly as the other members of the community; ostentatious displays of wealth and status simply have no opportunity to arise from Walden&amp;nbsp;Two’s [[egalitarian]] cultural structure.

Managers, meanwhile, are “specialists in charge of the divisions and services of Walden&amp;nbsp;Two”.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A member of the community can “work up to be a Manager – through intermediate positions which carry a good deal of responsibility and provide the necessary apprenticeship”.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 49"&gt;''Walden Two'', p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt; The Managers are not elected by the members of Walden Two in any kind of democratic process.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 49"/&gt; The method of selecting Managers is not specified, though they are likely appointed by the Board of Planners.

The regular community members are known (though only for official reasons) as Workers, and they have the flexible option of changing their field and location of employment every single day, so as not to grow bored or stagnant during the week with their four-on-average daily hours of work. Available work often includes the necessary physical labor that goes into maintaining a community, such as basic building or repairing projects, cleaning duties, or agricultural work. Labor in Walden&amp;nbsp;Two operates using a simple point system of units called “credits”, in which more menial or unpleasant jobs (such as waste management) earn a Worker a higher number of credits than more relaxing or interesting jobs, ultimately allowing more free time for that Worker.

The final grouping within Walden&amp;nbsp;Two is the Scientists, who conduct experiments “in plant and animal breeding, the control of infant behavior, educational processes of several sorts, and the use of some of [Walden Two’s] raw materials”.&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two'', pp.&amp;nbsp;49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are the least discussed group in the novel; little is said about the selection, total number, specific duties, or methods of the Scientists, though they presumably carry out the ongoing social experiments that help determine the most beneficial social strategies for the community.

==Thoreau's ''Walden''==
''Walden&amp;nbsp;Two'''s title is a direct reference to [[Henry David Thoreau]]’s book ''[[Walden]]''. In the novel, the Walden&amp;nbsp;Two Community is mentioned as having the benefits of living in a place like Thoreau’s Walden, but “with company”. It is, as the book says, ‘Walden for two’ – meaning a place for achieving personal self-actualization, but within a vibrant community, rather than in a place of solitude. Originally, Skinner indicated that he wanted to title it ''The Sun is but a Morning Star'', a quote of the last sentence of Thoreau’s ''Walden'',&lt;ref name=morningstar&gt;{{cite book |author=Thoreau, Henry David |year=1854 |url=https://archive.org/details/waldenorlifeinwo1854thor |title=Walden; or, Life in the woods |location=Boston, Massachusetts |publisher=[[Ticknor and Fields]] |quote=The sun is but a morning star. |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the publishers suggested the current title as an alternative.

In theory and in practice, Thoreau’s Walden Pond experiment and the fictive Walden&amp;nbsp;Two experiment were far different from one another: For instance, Thoreau’s book ''Walden'' espouses the virtues of self-reliance at the individual level, while ''Walden&amp;nbsp;Two'' espouses
# the virtues of self-reliance at the community level, and
# Skinner’s underlying premise that free will of the individual is weak&lt;br/&gt;compared to how environmental conditions [[Shaping (psychology)|shape]] behavior.

The cover of ''Walden Two'', shown above, includes an ‘O’ filled with yellow ink, with yellow lines radiating from the center of the ‘O’. That Sun-like ‘O’ is an allusion to the proposition that ''The sun is but a morning star''.&lt;ref name=morningstar/&gt;

Skinner published a follow-up to ''Walden Two'' in an essay titled ''News From Nowhere, 1984''. It details the discovery of Eric Blair in the community who seeks out and meets Burris, confessing his true identity as [[George Orwell]]. Blair seeks out Frazier as the 'leader' and the two have discussions which comprise the essay. Blair was impressed by Walden Two's "lack of any institutionalized government, religion, or economic system", a state of affairs that embodied "the dream of nineteenth-century [[anarchism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1985). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741768/pdf/behavan00064-0007.pdf "News From Nowhere, 1984"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''8'''(1), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-world efforts==
Many efforts to create a Walden Two in real life are detailed in Hilke Kuhlmann's ''Living Walden Two''&lt;ref&gt;Kuhlmann, Hilke (2005). ''Living Walden Two.'' [[University of Illinois Press]]. {{ISBN|0-252-02962-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Daniel W. Bjork's ''B.F. Skinner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=B.F.

Twin Oaks is detailed in [[Kat Kinkade]]'s book, ''A Walden Two experiment: The first five years of Twin Oaks Community''.&lt;ref&gt;Kinkade, Kathleen (1973). ''A Walden Two experiment: The first five years of Twin Oaks Community''. [[William Morrow and Company]]. {{ISBN|0-688-00020-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally started as a Walden Two community, it has since rejected its Walden Two position, however it still uses its modified Planner-Manager system as well as a system of labor credits based on the book.

Los Horcones does not use the Planner-Manager governance system described in ''Walden Two.''  They refer to their governance system as a "personocracy".&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Los Horcones (February 25, 2012). [http://directory.ic.org/715/Comunidad_Los_Horcones "Communities Directory"]. [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]], Retrieved August 23, 2012. "We value the participation of all members in decision making.

==Cultural engineering==
Skinner wrote about cultural engineering in at least two books, devoting a chapter to it in both ''Science and Human Behavior'' and ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]''. In ''Science and Human Behavior''&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1953). [http://www.bfskinner.org/BFSkinner/PDFBooksSHB_files/Science_and_Human_Behavior_1.pdf ''Science and Human Behavior''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108010009/http://www.bfskinner.org/bfskinner/PDFBooksSHB_files/Science_and_Human_Behavior_1.pdf |date=2013-01-08 }}, Chapter XXVIII: "Designing a Culture". Cambridge, Massachusetts: B.F. Skinner Foundation. Paperback edition: [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] (March 1, 1965). {{ISBN|0029290406}}, {{ISBN|978-0029290408}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a chapter is titled "Designing a Culture" and expands on this position as well as in other documents. In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' there are many indirect references to ''Walden Two'' when describing other cultural designs.

==Criticisms==
Hilke Kuhlmann's ''Living Walden Two'' possesses many subtle and not-so-subtle criticisms of the original ''Walden Two'' which are related to the actual efforts that arose from the novel. One criticism is that many of the founders of real-life Walden Twos identified with, or wanted to emulate, Frazier, the uncharismatic and implicitly despotic founder of the community.

In a critique of ''Walden Two,'' Harvey L. Gamble, Jr. asserted that Skinner's "fundamental thesis is that individual traits are shaped from above, by social forces that create the environment", and that Skinner's goal "is to create a frictionless society where individuals are properly socialized to function with others as a unit", and to thus "make the community [Walden Two] into a perfectly efficient [[anthill]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Harvey L., Jr., (1999). [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-54552225/walden-two-postmodern-utopia.html "''Walden Two,'' Postmodern Utopia, and the Problems of Power, Choice, and the Rule of Law".] ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language,'' 41(1), p. 3. Retrieved September 19, 2009 from accessmylibrary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Gamble writes, "We find at the end of ''Walden Two'' that Frazier [a founding member of Walden Two]... has sole control over the political system and its policies. It is he who regulates food, work, education, and sleep, and who sets the moral and economic agenda." However, contrary to Gamble's critique, it should be noted that neither Frazier nor any other person has the ''sole'' power to amend the constitution of Walden Two.  See the "Community governance" section, above.

There are several varieties of behaviorism but only Skinner’s radical behaviorism, has proposed to redesign society. The relevant principles were expounded at length two decades later in a best-seller ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' (1971).

''Walden Two'' was criticized in John Staddon's ''The New Behaviorism''.&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, John (2014)  ''The New Behaviorism'' (2nd edition)  Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner thought ''Walden Two'' an accomplishment comparable to two science-fiction classics: [[Aldous Huxley]]’s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1931) and [[George Orwell]]’s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949).  He assigned all three in his Nat Sci 114 introductory psychology course at Harvard.  There is some irony in Skinner’s choice, because Orwell’s and Huxley’s novels are both dystopias.  They portray not the supposed benefits of a technological approach to human society, but the evil consequences of either coercive (''Nineteen Eighty-Four'') or stealthy (''Brave New World'') efforts to control or gentle human beings.  On the contrary, ''Walden Two'' is supposed to light the technological path to utopia.

Skinner’s Walden proposal is in a tradition that goes back to Plato’s philosopher king: a ‘legislator’ (monarch) and a set of guardians who are wiser than the common people.  The guardians “are to be a class apart, like the Jesuits in old Paraguay, the ecclesiastics in the States of the Church until 1870 and the Communist Party in the U.S.S.R. at the present day,” wrote [[Bertrand Russell]], one of Skinner’s heroes, in 1946.   Not too different from Walden Two’s Managers and Planners, and Frazier, Skinner’s avatar and leader of the community.  Skinner was quite explicit about the need for technocratic rule: “We must delegate control of the population as a whole to specialists – to police, priests, teachers, therapies, and so on, with their specialized reinforcers and their codified contingencies.”&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond freedom and dignity'', 1971, August Psychology Today 37-81&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Śūnyatā''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:शून्यता#Sanskrit|शून्यता]]|śūnyatā}}; {{lang-pi|suññatā}}) – pronounced ‘shoonyataa’, translated into English most often as ''emptiness''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dale Mathers|author2=Melvin E. Miller|author3=Osamu Ando|title=Self and No-Self: Continuing the Dialogue Between Buddhism and Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVpcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-72386-8|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes ''voidness''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140228062714/http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sunna.htm Suñña] - Palikanon.com,&lt;/ref&gt; – is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept which has multiple meanings depending on its doctrinal context. It is either an ontological feature of reality, a meditation state, or a phenomenological analysis of experience.

In [[Theravada Buddhism]], suññatā often refers to the [[anatta|non-self]] (Pāli: ''anattā'', Sanskrit: ''anātman''){{refn|group=note|A common translation is "no-self", without a self, but the Pali canon uses ''anattā'' as a singular substantive, meaning "not-self".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2009|p=124}}}} nature of the [[five aggregates]] of experience and the [[ayatana|six sense spheres]]. Suññatā is also often used to refer to a meditative state or experience.

In [[Mahayana]], ''Sunyata'' refers to the tenet that "all things are empty of intrinsic existence and nature (''[[svabhava]]''),"  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher W.

==Etymology==
"''Śūnyatā''" ([[Sanskrit]]) is usually translated as "devoidness," "emptiness," "hollow, hollowness," "voidness." It is the noun form of the adjective ''śūnya'' or ''śhūnya'', plus ''-tā'': 
* ''śūnya'' means "zero," "nothing," "empty" or "void"&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams, Sir Monier (2nd edn, 1899) [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1085-zuSkavraNa.jpg ''A Sanskrit-English Dictionary'']. Reprinted Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi 1986: p.1085.&lt;/ref&gt; and derives from the root ''śvi'', meaning "hollow"
* ''-tā'' means "-ness"

==Development of the concept==
The concept of Sunyata as "emptiness", states Sue Hamilton, is related to the concept of ''[[anatta]]'' in early Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sue Hamilton|title=Early Buddhism: A New Approach : the I of the Beholder |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ji9EvkprnPsC |year=2000|publisher = Routledge|isbn=978-0-7007-1357-8|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, many different philosophical schools or tenet-systems (Sanskrit: ''siddhānta'')&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Anne C. (1991). ''Knowing Naming &amp; Negation a sourcebook on Tibetan, Sautrantika''. Snowlion publications, {{ISBN|0-937938-21-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed within Buddhism in an effort to explain the exact philosophical meaning of emptiness.

After the Buddha, emptiness was further developed by the [[Abhidharma]] schools, [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] and the [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]] school, an early Mahāyāna school. Emptiness ("positively" interpreted) is also an important element of the [[Tathagatagarbha|Buddha nature]] literature, which played a formative role in the evolution of subsequent Mahāyāna doctrine and practice.

==Early Buddhism==

[[Image:Foam - big.jpg|thumb|right|A simile from the Pali scriptures (SN 22.95) compares [[Rūpa#Buddhism|form]] and [[Vedanā|feelings]] with foam and bubbles.]]
{{See also|Sati (Buddhism)}}

The Pali canon uses the term emptiness in three ways: "(1) as a meditative dwelling, (2) as an attribute of objects, and (3) as a type of awareness-release."&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.122.than.html MN 122. See, e.g., Maha-suññata Sutta: The Greater Discourse on Emptiness translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu," Retrieved on 30 July 2013 from "Access to Insight" at www.accesstoinsight.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Suñña Sutta'',&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu_1997d_3585"&gt;{{harvnb|Bhikkhu|1997d}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  part of the [[Pali Canon|Pāli canon]], relates that the monk [[Ananda|Ānanda]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha's]] attendant asked, 
{{quote|It is said that the world is empty, the world is empty, lord. In what respect is it said that the world is empty?" The Buddha replied, "Insofar as it is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self: Thus it is said, Ānanda, that the world is empty.}}

According to [[Thanissaro Bhikku]]:
{{quote|Emptiness as a quality of [[Dharmas#Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]], in the early canons, means simply that one cannot identify them as one's own self or having anything pertaining to one's own self ... Emptiness as a mental state, in the early canons, means a mode of perception in which one neither adds anything to nor takes anything away from what is present, noting simply, "There is this." This mode is achieved through a process of intense concentration, coupled with the insight that notes more and more subtle levels of the presence and absence of disturbance (see MN 121).&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikku, The Buddhist Religions: An Historical Introduction, P 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], the Pāli discourses use the adjective suñña with a much higher frequency than the corresponding noun suññatā. This reflects an emphasis on qualifying phenomena as 'being empty' rather than on an abstract state of empty-'ness' in early Buddhism, states Analayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Analayo|first=Bhikkhu|authorlink=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Excursions into the Thought-World of the Pali Discourses|year=2012|publisher=[[Pariyatti]]|page=272|ISBN=9781928706984}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Meditative state====
Emptiness as a meditative state is said to be reached when "not attending to any themes, he [the bhikku] enters &amp; remains in internal emptiness" (MN 122). This meditative dwelling is developed through the "four formless states" of meditation or [[Arūpajhāna]]s and then through "themeless concentration of awareness."&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;

The Cūlasuññata-sutta (MN III 104) and the Mahāsuññata-sutta (MN III 109) outline how a monk can "dwell in emptiness" through a gradual step by step mental cultivation process, they both stress the importance of the impermanence of mental states and the absence of a self.

In the Kāmabhu Sutta S IV.293, it is explained that a [[bhikkhu]] can experience a [[Jhana in Theravada#Cessation of feelings and perceptions|trancelike contemplation]] in which perception and feeling cease. When he emerges from this state, he recounts three types of "contact" (''[[Sparśa|phasso]]''):
# "emptiness" (''suññato''),
# "signless" (''animitto''),
# "undirected" (''appa{{IAST|ṇ}}ihito'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn41/sn41.006.than.html SN 41.6. See, e.g., Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.) (2004), "SN 41.6 Kamabhu Sutta: With Kamabhu (On the Cessation of Perception &amp; Feeling)," retrieved Feb 4 2009 from "Access to Insight" at www.accesstoinsight.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
The meaning of emptiness as contemplated here is explained at M I.297 and S IV.296-97 as the "emancipation of the mind by emptiness" (''suññatā cetovimutti'') being consequent upon the realization that "this world is empty of self or anything pertaining to self" (''suññam ida{{IAST|ṃ}} attena vā attaniyena vā'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.043.than.html MN 43 and SN 41.7.

(2004), "SN 41.7 Godatta Sutta: To Godatta (On Awareness-release)," retrieved February 4, 2009 from "Access to Insight"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "emptiness" (''suññatā'') is also used in two suttas in the ''Majjhima Nikāya'', in the context of a progression of mental states. The texts refer to each state's emptiness of the one below.&lt;ref&gt;MN 121 and MN 122. See, e.g., respectively, Thanissaro (1997a) and Thanissaro (1997b).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese Āgamas===
Some of the Sarvāstivādin Agama sutras (extant in Chinese) which have emptiness as a theme include Samyukta Agama 335 - ''Paramārtha-śunyatā-sūtra'' (Sutra on ultimate emptiness) and Samyukta Agama 297 - ''Mahā-śunyatā-dharma-paryāya'' (Greater discourse on emptiness). These sutras have no parallel Pali suttas.&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; These sutras associate emptiness with [[dependent origination]], which shows that this relation of the two terms was already established in pre-[[Nagarjuna]] sources. The sutra on great emptiness states:
{{quote|"What is the Dharma Discourse on Great Emptiness? It is this— ‘When this exists, that exists; when this arises, that arises.’"&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase "when this exists..." is a common gloss on [[dependent origination]]. Sarvāstivādin Agamas also speak of a certain emptiness [[samadhi]] (''śūnyatāsamādhi'') as well as stating that all dharmas are "classified as conventional".&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 22, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mun-Keat Choong and [[Yin Shun]] have both published studies on the various uses of emptiness in the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] (Pali Canon and Chinese [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]]).&lt;ref&gt;Choong, Mun-Keat; The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism, Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yìn Shùn; An Investigation into Emptiness (Kōng zhī Tànjìu 空之探究) (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Choong has also published a collection of translations of Agama sutras from the Chinese on the topic of emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/76164/2ed-2010-Annotated-Trans-SA-sutras-Emptiness-and-the-Middle-Way2.pdf Choong; Annotated Translation of Sutras from the Chinese Samyuktagama relevant to the Early Buddhist Teachings on Emptiness and the Middle Way (2004; second edition, International Buddhist College, Thailand, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Buddhist schools and Abhidharma==
Many of the [[early Buddhist schools]] featured sunyata as an important part of their teachings.

The [[Sarvastivadin]] school's Abhidharma texts like the Dharmaskandhapāda Śāstra, and the later Mahāvibhāṣa also take up the theme of emptiness vis a vis dependent origination as found in the Agamas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools such as the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] Prajñaptivādins as well as many of the Sthavira schools (except the [[Pudgalavada]]) held that all dharmas were empty (dharma śūnyatā).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This can be seen in the early [[Theravada]] [[Abhidhamma]] texts such as the [[Patisambhidamagga]] which also speak of the emptiness of the five aggregates and of [[svabhava]] as being "empty of essential nature".&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Karl H; Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D., page 98&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravada [[Kathavatthu]] also argues against the idea that emptiness is unconditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main themes of Harivarman's [[Tattvasiddhi]]-Śāstra (3rd-4th century) is ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]]-śūnyatā'', the emptiness of phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theravada==
[[Theravada]] Buddhists generally take the view espoused in the [[Pali canon]], that emptiness is merely the [[Anatta|not-self]] nature of the [[five aggregates]] as well as a mode of perception which is "empty of the presuppositions we usually add to experience to make sense of it"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/emptiness.html Thanissaro Bhikku, "Emptiness", Access to Insight, 8 March 2011, Retrieved July 30, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; - especially that of unchanging selfhood. Therefore, some Theravadan teachers like [[Thanissaro Bhikku]] hold that emptiness is not so much a metaphysical view, as it is a strategic mode of acting and of seeing the world which leads to liberation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea of emptiness as lack of [[Svabhava|inherent existence]] has very little to do with what the Buddha himself said about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — as reported in the earliest Buddhist texts, the [[Pali Canon]] — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu 2010"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/integrityofemptiness.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu. "The Integrity of Emptiness" Access to Insight, 5 June 2010, Retrieved on 30 July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Theravadins such as [[David Kalupahana]], see [[Nagarjuna]]'s view of emptiness as compatible with the [[Pali Canon]]. In his analysis of the [[Mulamadhyamikakarika]], Kalupahana sees Nagarjuna's argument as rooted in the [[Kaccānagotta Sutta]] (which Nagarjuna cites by name). Kalupahana states that Nagarjuna's major goal was to discredit heterodox views of [[Svabhava]] (own-nature) held by the [[Sarvastivadins]] and establish the non-substantiality of all dharmas.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, D. Mulamadhyamakakarika of nagarjuna, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Harvey, the Abhidhamma theory of the Theravadins is not based on the kind of [[Svabhava]] that Nagarjuna was critiquing: "They are dhammas because they are upheld by conditions or they are upheld according to their own nature' (Asl.39). Here 'own-nature' would mean characteristic nature, which is not something inherent in a dhamma as a separate ultimate reality, but arise due to the supporting conditions both of other dhammas and previous occurrences of that dhamma. This is of significance as it makes the Mahayana critique of the Sarvastivadin's notion of own-nature largely irrelevant to the Theravada."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHISM, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emptiness as an approach to meditation is seen as a state in which one is "empty of disturbance." This form of meditation is one in which the meditator becomes concentrated and focuses on the absence or presence of disturbances in their mind, if they find a disturbance they notice it and allow it drop away, this leads to deeper states of calmness.&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu 2010"/&gt; Emptiness is also seen as a way to look at sense experience that does not identify with the "I-making" and "my-making" process of the mind. As a form of meditation, this is developed by perceiving the [[ayatana|six sense spheres]] and their objects as empty of any self, this leads to a [[Arupajhana|formless jhana]] of nothingness and a state of equanimity.&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu 2010"/&gt;

According to [[Gil Fronsdal]]: "Emptiness is as important in the Theravada tradition as it is in the Mahayana.  From the earliest times, Theravada Buddhism has viewed emptiness as one of the important doors to liberation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/articles/emptiness-in-theravada-buddhism/ Emptiness in Theravada Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt; Mathew Kosuta sees the Abhidhamma teachings of the modern Thai teacher Ajaan Sujin Boriharnwanaket as being very similar to the Mahayana emptiness view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Articles/Theravada%20Emptiness_The%20Abhidhammic%20theory%20of%20Ajaan%20Sujin%20Boriharnwanaket_Kosuta_2007.pdf Kosuta, Theravada emptiness, The abhidhammic theory of Ajaan Sujin Boriharnwanaket]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahayana Buddhism==
{{MahayanaBuddhism}}
===Prajna-paramita Sutras===
{{Main|Perfection of Wisdom}}
The Prajna-paramita (Perfection of Wisdom) Sutras taught that all entities, including ''dharmas'', are only conceptual existents or constructs.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge, 2000, pages 68, 134-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd edition.'' Routledge, 2009, pages 52-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though we perceive a world of concrete and discrete objects, these objects are "empty" of the identity imputed by their designated labels.{{sfn|Kalupahan|1994|p=160-169}} The [[Heart sutra]], a text from the [[Prajnaparamita|prajnaparamita-sutras]], articulates this in the following saying in which the [[Skandha|five skandhas]] are said to be "empty":
{{quote|Form is emptiness, emptiness is form&lt;br&gt;Emptiness is not separate from form, form is not separate from emptiness&lt;br&gt;Whatever is form is emptiness, whatever is emptiness is form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/heartstr.htm |title=The Heart Sutra Prajna Paramita Hrydaya Sutra |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Original: "Rupan śūnyatā śūnyatāiva rupan.

===Mādhyamaka===
{{Main|Madhyamaka}}
[[File:Dew on grass Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|The emptiness of phenomena is often compared to drops of [[dew]]]]
Mādhyamaka is a [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist school of philosophy]] established by the Indian Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Thought"&gt;[[Paul Williams (British professor)|Williams, Paul]] (2000). ''Buddhist Thought'' Routledge, p140.&lt;/ref&gt; In Madhyamaka, to say that an object is "empty" is synonymous with saying that it is [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]], which means, it's affected by the [[three marks of existence]]: it is fated to be [[Impermanence|transient]], [[Dukkha|unsatisfactory]], and [[Anatta|without inherent existence]].

Madhyamaka states that impermanent collections of causes and conditions are designated by mere conceptual labels. This also applies to the principle of causality itself, since ''everything'' is dependently originated.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; If unaware of this, things may seem to arise as existents, remain for a time and then subsequently perish. In reality, dependently originated phenomena do not arise as having inherent existence in the first place.&lt;ref name="Tsondru, Mabja 2011, pages 56-58"&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 56-58, 405-417.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Chapter 21 of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā goes into the reasoning behind this.&lt;ref name="Tsondru, Mabja 2011, pages 56-58"/&gt;}} Thus both existence and nihilism are ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 56-58, 405-417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;unclear&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nagarjuna====
Madhyamaka is retroactively seen as being founded by the monk [[Nāgārjuna]]. Nāgārjuna's goal was to refute the essentialism of certain [[Abhidharma]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;Wasler, Joseph. ''Nagarjuna in Context.'' New York: Columibia University Press. 2005, pgs. 225-263.&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known work is the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], in which he used the ''[[Prasaṅgika|reductio ad absurdum]]'' to show the non-substantiality of the perceived world.

[[Nāgārjuna]] equates emptiness with [[dependent origination]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 66-71, 447-477.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] 24:18}}
{{quote|On the basis of the Buddha's view that all experienced phenomena (''dharma'') are "dependently arisen" (''pratitya-samutpanna''), Nagarjuna insisted that such phenomena are empty (''sunya''). This did not mean that they are not experienced and, therefore, non-existent; only that they are devoid of a permanent and eternal substance (''[[Svabhāva|svabhava]]''). Since they are experienced elements of existence, they are not mere names (''prjnapti'').{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=120}}}}

In his analysis, any enduring [[Svabhāva|essential nature]] would prevent the process of dependent origination, or any kind of origination at all. For things would simply always have been, and will always continue to be, without any change.&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 40-41, 322-333.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Nāgārjuna equates svabhāva (essence) with bhāva (existence) in Chapter 15 of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā}}

In doing so, he restores the [[Middle way]] of the Buddha, which had become influenced by absolute tendencies:{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}
{{quote|Utilizing the Buddha's theory of "dependent arising" (''pratitya-samutpanna'') Nagarjuna demonstrated the futility of these metaphysical speculations. His method of dealing with such metaphysics is referred to as a "middle way" (''madhyama pratipad''). It is the middle way that avoided the substantialism of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] as well as the [[nominalism]] of the [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantikas]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=120}}}}

==== Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction====
{{Main|Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction}}

In Tibetan Buddhism, especially in the Gelugpa, a distinction is being made between Svatantrika and Prasaṅgika approaches to reasoning.

''Svātantrika'' is attributed primarily to the 6th century Indian scholar [[Bhavaviveka]], who argued for the use of syllogistical statements in the propagation of Madhyamaka, in line with the developing Buddhist logic. It is used in contrast with [[Prasangika|Prāsangika]] Madhyamaka. According to Tsonghkhapa, for the Svatantrika conventional phenomena are understood to have a conventional essential existence, but without an ultimately existing essence.

The name ''Prasangika'' is derived from ''[[Prasaṅgika|prasanga]]'', or ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' arguments, rather than ''[[Svatantrika|svatantra-anumana]]'', or ''[[Syllogism|independent syllogisms]]''. [[Buddhapalita]] (470–550) are regarded as the main proponents of the Prasaṅgika, which argues that only arguments should be used which lay bare the logical inconstencies of their opponents.

====Nihilism and eternalism====
{{see also|Middle way}}

Some non-Buddhist and Buddhist writers state that the Sunyata concept in Madhyamaka philosophy is nihilistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Junjirō Takakusu|title=The Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyJjCx_tEiMC&amp;pg=PA4 |year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1592-6|pages=4, 105–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hajime Nakamura |title=Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples: India, China, Tibet, Japan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9gm9CzNd5EC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0764-8 |pages=590–591 footnote 20 }}, Quote: "Already in India, 'sunyata' was liable to be misunderstood as nothingness or nihil'. (...) The [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] of Hinayana Buddhism viewed the Madhyamika school as 'one that argues that everything is nothing. (...) It is only natural that most of the Western scholars call the ''prajnaparamita sutra'' or the doctrine of the Madhyamika school nihilism since criticisms were already expressed in India. Against such criticisms, however, Nagarjuna, founder of the Madhyamika school says, 'you are ignorant of the function of sunyata, the meaning of the sunyata and sunyata itself'."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jackson writes:
{{quote|A nihilistic interpretation of the concept of voidness (or of mind-only) is not, by any means, a merely hypothetical possibility; it consistently was adopted by Buddhism's opponents, wherever the religion spread, nor have Buddhists themselves been immune to it...&lt;ref name="Jackson_1993_57"&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1993|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view has been challenged by other writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. C. Nayak |title=Mādhyamika Śūnyatā, a Reappraisal: A Reappraisal of Mādhyamika Philosophical Enterprise with Special Reference to Nāgārjuna and Chandrakīrti |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjkRAQAAIAAJ |date=2001 |publisher=Indian Council of Philosophical Research |isbn=978-81-85636-47-4 |pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars interpret emptiness as described by Nāgārjuna as a Buddhist transcendental [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] such as ''Tathagata'', while other scholars consider it a mistake.&lt;ref name=ferrer102&gt;Jorge Noguera Ferrer, ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality.'' SUNY Press, 2002, page 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jorge Ferrer, Nāgārjuna presents the middle way, one between nihilism and absolute eternalism, and sunyata as emptiness is the soteriological middle way.&lt;ref name=ferrer102/&gt;

Randall Collins states that for Nagarjuna, ultimate reality was "shunyata, emptiness".&lt;ref name=collins221&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; In Nagarjuna's thesis, adds Collins, this emptiness is not a negation, but the premise that "no concepts are intelligible".&lt;ref name=collins221/&gt; David Kalupahana states that this topic has been debated by ancient and medieval Buddhist metaphysicians, with a divergence of views; emptiness is a view, adds Kalupahana, but "holding up emptiness as an absolute or ultimate truth without reference to that which is empty is the last thing either the Buddha or Nāgārjuna would advocate".&lt;ref&gt;[[David J. Kalupahana]], ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way.'' SUNY Press, 1986, pages 48-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ferrer, Nāgārjuna criticized those whose mind held any "positions and beliefs", suggesting liberation is "avoidance of all views", and explaining emptiness as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Noguera Ferrer, ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality.'' SUNY Press, 2002, pages 102. The quote is from the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yogacara===
{{Main|Yogacara}}
[[Yogacara]] explains "emptiness" in an analysis of the way we perceive "things".

====''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras''====
The Tathāgatagarbha is the topic of the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]'', where the title itself means a ''garbha'' (womb, matrix, seed) containing ''Tathagata'' (Buddha). In the ''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras'' sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self. The ultimate goal of the path is characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by [[Essentialism|essentialist]] philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;Sallie B. King (1997),[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist''].

The ''[[Srimala Sutra|Śrīmālā Sūtra]]'' is one of the earliest texts on tathagata-garbha thought, composed in 3rd century in south India, according to Brian Brown.

The ''Śrīmālā Sūtra'' posits that the Buddha-nature is ultimately identifiable as the [[dharmakaya|supramundane nature of the Buddha]], the ''garbha'' is the ground for Buddha-nature, this nature is unborn and undying, has ultimate existence, has no beginning nor end, is nondual, and permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Edward Brown |title=The Buddha Nature: A Study of the Tathāgatagarbha and Ālayavijñāna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXnF2dolnNgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0631-3 |pages=4–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The text also adds that the ''garbha'' has "no self, soul or personality" and "incomprehensible to anyone distracted by sunyata (voidness)"; rather it is the support for phenomenal existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Edward Brown |title=The Buddha Nature: A Study of the Tathāgatagarbha and Ālayavijñāna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXnF2dolnNgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0631-3 |pages=5–7, 32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another seminal text, which was and is influential in Tibetan Buddhism, is the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] sutra. It forms the basis of [[shentong]], a further developed form of Madhyamaka, in which the realization of emptiness is a preliminary stage to realize the [[Nature of mind (Buddhism)|nature of mind]], the self-reflexive nature of consciousness which shines through when it is freed from the defilements. Moderate shentong-views are still being taught in the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages, despite the fierce resistance and persecution by Gelugpas in previous centuries.

====Scholarly opinions====
While highly influential in Indian and east Asian Buddhism, for western scholars the ''Tathagatagarbha '' doctrine of an 'essential nature' in every living being appears to be confusing, since it seems to be equivalent to a 'Self',{{refn|group=note|Paul Williams: "Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term. This would be in direct opposition to the general teachings of Buddhism on ''anatta''. Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of ''atman'' and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=104–105, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to contradict the doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts. Some scholars, however, view such teachings as metaphorical, not to be taken literally.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006}} Wayman and Wayman have also disagreed with this literalist view, and they state that the ''Tathagatagarbha'' is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, the [[Buddha nature]] which these sutras discuss, does not represent a substantial self (''ātman''). Rather, it is a positive expression of emptiness, and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this view, the intention of the teaching of Buddha nature is [[soteriology|soteriological]] rather than theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Heng-Ching Shih |title=The Significance Of 'Tathagatagarbha' —- A Positive Expression Of Sunyata |url=http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807082256/http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm |archivedate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sallie B. |last=King |title=The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist.

''Mahayanism'', Tokyo: Karin Bunko, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matsumoto Shiro and Hakamaya Noriaki, the idea of an ontological reality of the Buddha-nature is an un-Buddhist idea:&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp"/&gt; Their "Critical Buddhism" approach rejects what it calls "''dhatu-vada''" (substantialist Buddha nature doctrines)
{{quote|Buddhism is based on the principles of no-self and causation, which deny any substance underlying the phenomenal world. The idea of ''tathagata-garbha'', on the contrary, posits a substance (namely, ''tathagata''-''garbha'') as the basis of the phenomenal world. [Matsumoto Shiro] asserts that ''dhatu-vada'' is the object that the Buddha criticized in founding Buddhism, and that Buddhism is nothing but unceasing critical activity against any form of ''dhatu-vada''.&lt;ref&gt;''Pruning the Bodhi Tree: the Storm over Critical Buddhism'' by Jamie Hubbard and Paul Loren Swanson, University of Hawai'i Press, 1997, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The critical Buddhism approach has, in turn, recently been characterised as operating with a restricted definition of Buddhism.  Paul Williams comments:
{{quote|At least some ways of understanding the ''tathagatagarbha'' contravene the teachings of not-Self, or the Madhyamika idea of emptiness. And these ways of understanding the ''tathagatagarbha'' were and are widespread in Mahāyāna Buddhism. Yet by their own self-definition they are Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'', Second Edition, Routledge, London, 2009, pp. 124, 125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
[[File:Appearance of sky for weather forecast, Dhaka, Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|In Tibetan Buddhism, emptiness is often symbolized by and compared to the open sky&lt;ref&gt;Vessantara; Meeting the Buddhas: A Guide to Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Tantric Deities. "They [conditioned things] are sky-like, and un-graspable, like clouds."&lt;/ref&gt; which is associated with [[openness]] and [[freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa: Volume Four, Dawn of tantra, page 366&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Tibetan Buddhism]] developed five main schools. The Madhyamika philosophy obtained a central position in all the schools, but with two distinct variations:{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145, 150}}
* Rangtong, c.q. Prasangika-Madhyamaka, which is taught by the Gelugpa, but also by the Nyingma and Sakya:
:* Tsongkhapa, and the subsequent Gelugpa tradition, lay emphasis on a strict [[Prasangika]] interpretation of emptiness. It sees its own interpretation as the final truth on ''sunyata''.
:* The [[Nyingma]] and the Sakya-school teach that emptiness goes further than a mere denial of inherently existing, with the Dzogchen (Nyingma) tradition pointing to the ''[[nature of mind]]''. 
* Shentong, which is a further developed Yogacara-Madhyamaka and influenced by Buddha-nature teachings, and taught in Jonang and Kagyu.

====Strict emptiness – Gelugpa====
The [[Gelug|Gelugpa school]] of Tibetan Buddhism is the most influential of the four Tibetan Buddhist schools. It was founded in the beginning of the 15th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419), who was "strongly scholastic in orientation and encouraged the study of the great Indian masters of philosophy".{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=207}}

The [[14th Dalai Lama]], who generally speaks from the Gelugpa version of the ''Mādhyamaka-[[Prasangika|Prasaṅgika]]'', states:
{{quote|According to the theory of emptiness, any belief in an objective reality grounded in the assumption of intrinsic, independent existence is simply untenable.&lt;br&gt;All things and events, whether 'material', mental or even abstract concepts like time, are devoid of objective, independent existence ... [T]hings and events are 'empty' in that they can never possess any immutable essence, intrinsic reality or absolute 'being' that affords independence.&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (2005). ''The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence of Science and Spirituality'' (Hardcover). Broadway. {{ISBN|0-7679-2066-X}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-7679-2066-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Nature of mind====

=====Nyingma/Dzogchen=====
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}

In Dzogchen, emptiness does not refer to the mere negation of inherent existence, but to profound emptiness, the Ground and nature of mind which is free from temporary characteristics.

=====Bon=====
The Tibetan [[Bon#Yungdrung Bon|Yungdrung Bon-tradition]] regards the Ma Gyu, or [[Anuttarayoga Tantra#Mother Tantras|Mother Tantra]], as the highest tantra. Its views are close to [[Dzogchen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ligmincha.org/store/vmchk/by-practice/sadhanas-of-the-ma-gyu-mother-tantra/view-all-products.html Ligmincha Institute: Sadhanas of the Ma Gyu (Mother Tantra)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bon-encyclopedia.wikispaces.com/ma+gyud |title=Ma Gyud - The Mother Tantras |publisher=Bon-encyclopedia.wikispaces.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sees waking life as an illusion, from which we have to wake up, just as we recognize dreams to be illusions.{{sfn|Wangyal Rinpoche|2004|p=53}} Sunyata is the lack of inherent existence.{{sfn|Wangyal Rinpoche|2004|p=55}} The Mother Tantra uses ...
{{quote|...examples, similes and metaphors that we can ponder in order to better understand this illusory nature of both dream and waking life".{{sfn|Wangyal Rinpoche|2004|p=54}}}}

These "examples, similes and metaphors" ...
{{quote|...stress the lack of inherent existence and the unity of experience and experiencer. In the sutra teachings we call this "emptiness," in tantra "illusion," and in Dzogchen "the single sphere."{{sfn|Wangyal Rinpoche|2004|p=55}}}}

=====Sakya=====
The [[Sakya|Sakya school]] originated in the 11th century. It rose to power in the 13th century.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=202}} [[Gorampa|Gorampa Sonam Senge]] (1429-1489), an important philosopher in the [[Sakya]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], established an understandings of [[Prasangika]] which differs from Tsongkhapa. According to Gorampa, emptiness is not just mere emptiness, the absence of inherent existence, but profound emptiness, the absence of the four extremes in phenomena. In Gorampa's approach, ultimate truth is a liberating insight, that is free from even grasping the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cabezón, José Ignacio. ''Freedom from extremes: Gorampa's "Distinguishing the views" and the Polemics of Emptiness.'' Wisdom Publications, 2007, pages 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shentong (Buddha-nature)====

=====Jonang=====
{{Main|Jonang}}
The Jonang school originated in the 12th century. Tsongkhapa strongly opposed the Jonang school, whose views he "deemed to be ... dharmically incorrect".{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=207}}

In the Tibetan [[Jonang]] school, only the Buddha and the Buddha Nature are viewed as ''not'' intrinsically empty, but as truly real, unconditioned, and replete with eternal, changeless virtues.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=8-16}} The Buddha Nature ([[tathagatagarbha]]) is only empty of what is impermanent and conditioned, not of its own self. The Buddha Nature is truly real, and primordially present in all beings.

An important Tibetan treatise on Emptiness and the Buddha Nature is found in the scholar-monk [[Dolpopa|Dolpopa's]] voluminous study, ''Mountain Doctrine''.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006}} It... 
{{quote| ... follows the format, inherited from India, of a presentation by way of both reasoning and scripture - the scriptural citations being so rich that the book can also be considered an inspiring anthology, a veritable treasure-trove of literature about the [[Buddha-nature|matrix-of-one-gone-thus]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=5}}}}

In this vast ''Mountain Doctrine'', [[Dolpopa]] describes the Buddha Nature as ...
{{quote|[N]on-material emptiness, emptiness that is far from an annihilatory emptiness, great emptiness that is the ultimate pristine wisdom of superiors ...buddha earlier than all buddhas, ... causeless original buddha.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=14}}}}

The Buddha-nature is filled with eternal powers and virtues:
{{quote|[P]ermanent, stable, eternal, everlasting. Not compounded by causes and conditions, the matrix-of-one-gone-thus is intrinsically endowed with ultimate buddha qualities of body, speech, and mind such as the ten powers; it is not something that did not exist before and is newly produced; it is self-arisen.'{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=8}}}}

Dolpopa also cites the ''[[Angulimaliya Sutra|Angulimaliya Sutra&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s]]'' contrast between empty phenomena such as the moral and emotional afflictions (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]]''), which are like ephemeral hailstones, and the enduring, eternal Buddha, which is like a precious gem:
{{quote|Empty phenomena are other [different]; non-empty phenomena are other [different]. The tens of millions of afflictive emotions like hail-stones are empty. The phenomena in the class of non-virtues, like hail-stones, quickly disintegrate. Buddha, like a vaidurya jewel, is permanent ... The liberation of a buddha also is form ... do not make a discrimination of non-division, saying, "The character of liberation is empty".'{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=210}}}}

=====Kagyu=====
The Kagyu teacher [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche|Khenpo Tsultrim]], in ''Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness'', presents five strages of meditation, which he relates to five different schools or approaches:{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=19-26}}{{sfn|Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso|1994}}
* "Sravaka meditation on non-self" – meditation on the emptiness of the skandhas and the non-existence of a personal self;
* "Cittamatra-approach" – meditation on the mind-stream, the ever-continuing process of perception, and the non-duality of perceived and perceiver;
* "Svatantrika-Madhyamaka approach" – meditation on all dhammas, which are empty of self-nature, and the negation of any "substance";
* "Prasangika-Mdhyamaka approach" – meditation on "the non-conceptual (nisprapanca) nature of both the appearance of phenomena and their self-emptiness." In this approach, all concepts are to be abandoned;
*  Shentong Madhyamaka – meditation on ''Paramarthasatya'' ("Absolute Reality"),{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|name="Absolute"|According to Hookham, non-dual experience is Ultimate Reality.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}}} ''Buddhajnana'',{{refn|group=note|name="Buddhajnana"|According to Hookham, "The Chinese Tathagarba schools describe Buddhajnana as the totality of all that is, which pervades every part of all that is in its totality."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}} According to Hookham, for Shentong Buddhajnana is "the non-dual nature of Mind completely unobscured and endowed with its countless Buddha Qualities (''Buddhagunas'').{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}}} which is beyond concepts, and described by terms as "truly existing."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} This approach helps "to overcome certain residual subtle concepts,"{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} and "the habit – fosterd on the earlier stages of the path – of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}} It destroys false concepts, as does prasangika, but it also alerts the practitioner "to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}}

===Chinese Buddhism===
When Buddhism was introduced in China it was understood in terms of its own culture. Various sects struggled to attain an understanding of the Indian texts. The [[Tathāgatagarbha Sutras]] and the idea of the [[Buddha-nature]] were endorsed, because of the perceived similarities with the [[Tao]], which was understood as a transcendental reality underlying the world of appearances. [[Sunyata]] at first was also understood as pointing to transcendental reality.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}} It took [[Chinese Buddhism]] several centuries to realize that [[sunyata]] does not refer to an essential transcendental reality underneath or behind the world of appearances.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}

====Chán====
{{Main|Zen|Chinese Chán}}
The influence of those various doctrinal and textual backgrounds is still discernable in Zen. Zen teachers still mention the Buddha-nature, but the Zen tradition also emphasizes that Buddha-nature is Sunyata, the absence of an independent and substantial "self".{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}

===Western Buddhism===
Various western Buddhists note that ''sunyata'' refers to the emptiness of inherent existence, as in Madhyamaka; but also to the emptiness of mind or awareness, as open space and the "ground of being," as in meditation-orientated traditions and approaches such as Dzogchen and [[Shentong]].{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=101-102}}{{sfn|Knibbe|2014|p=46}}&lt;ref group=web name="Wellings"&gt;Nigel Wellings (2009), ''[http://www.contemplativeforum.co.uk/wordpress/?p=204 Is there anything there? – the Tibetan Rangtong Shentong debate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518063508/http://www.contemplativeforum.co.uk/wordpress/?p=204 |date=2015-05-18 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Quotes:&lt;br&gt;* John Snelling: "At the core of Mahayana philosophy lies the notion of Emptiness: ''Shunyata''. This is very much in the spirit of ''anatta'' (Skt. ''anatman'') as first taught by the Buddha. It is often used to imply, not mere or sheer nothingness (that would be the nihilistic view), but 'emptiness of ''inherent existence'''; that is, the absence of any kind of enduring or self-sustaining essence. There is also a sense in which it has connotations of 'conceptual emptiness': absence of thoughts. It could be regarded too as a non-term signifying the ineffable understanding arising within the practice of meditation. Although seemingly negative, it also has its positive uses - and of course ultimately points beyond the positive negative dichotomy."{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=101-102}}&lt;br&gt;* Hans Knibbe: "There are at least to important meanings of this concept of emptiness, namely:&lt;br&gt; - empty of independent existence;&lt;br&gt; - openness and space as grounf of being.{{sfn|Knibbe|2014|p=46}}&lt;br&gt;* Nigel Wellings:&lt;ref group=web name ="Wellings"/&gt; "Thus we have two types of emptiness, the emptiness of self in the skandhas that reveals the absence of an empirical and metaphysical self. And the emptiness of the self in Nirvâ.na that reveals nothing of the empirical self existing within the Nirvâ.na consciousness.&lt;br&gt;Harvey seems to confirm this view when he tells us that all conditioned dharmas are empty of self because they are impermanent and a source of suffering, while the unconditioned dharma, Nirvâ.na, is empty because it does not “support the feeling of ‘I-ness’”, that is, the impermanent skandhas. (1990:52). This is very similar to the teaching of the modern Kagyu Nyingma Lama, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, a Shentong exponent:
{{quote|All appearances are empty, in that they can be destroyed or extinguished in some way [...] The whole universe vanishes at some point, destroyed by the seven fires and one immense deluge. In this way, all appearances are empty.&lt;br&gt;Mind is also ultimately empty, but its way of being empty is not the same as appearances. [My italics] Mind can experience anything but it cannot be destroyed. Its original nature is the dharmakaya of all Buddhas. You cannot actually do anything to mind – you can’t change it, wash it away, bury it or burn it. What is truly empty, though, is all the appearances that appear in the mind. (Tulku Urgyen (1999), ''As It Is vol.1'' Rangjang Yeshe, Boudhanath, Hong Kong &amp; Nasby. p.53)}}}}

==Hinduism==

===Influence on Advaita Vedanta===
Gaudapada is considered by some scholars to have been strongly influenced by Buddhism, as he developed his concept of [[Ajativada|"ajāta"]] from Nagajurna's Madhyamaka philosophy,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} which uses the term "anutpāda":{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}}
* "An" means "not", or "non"
* "Utpāda" means "genesis", "coming forth", "birth"&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=utpAda&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Utpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together "anutpāda" means "having no origin", "not coming into existence", "not taking effect", "non-production".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=anutpAda+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Anutpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to [[Saṃsāra|birth, change and death]]. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The [[Empiricism|empirical world]] of [[phenomenon|appearances]] is considered [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (unreal as it is transitory), and not [[Philosophical realism|absolutely existent]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} Thus, Gaudapada's concept of ''ajativada'' is similar to Buddhist term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or śūnyatā.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}}{{refn|group=note|The term is also used in the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.{{sfn|Suzuki|1999}} According to D.T Suzuki, "anutpada" is not the opposite of "utpada", but transcends opposites. It is [[kenshō]], seeing into the true nature of existence,{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=123-124}} the seeing that "all objects are without self-substance [Sunyata]".{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=168}}}}

But Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} Gaudapada's perspective found in ''Mandukya Karika'' is based on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]''.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} According to Gaudapada, the metaphysical absolute called [[Brahman]] never changes, while the phenomenal world changes continuously, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the perceived world has to be a transitory (unreal) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (''paramārthatā'') the phenomenal world is ''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'', "illusion",{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} apparently existing but ultimately not metaphysically real.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|2000|p=25, 160-161}}

In ''Gaudapada-Karika'', chapter III, verses 46-48, he states that [[Brahman]] never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:
{{quote|
When the mind does not lie low, and is not again tossed about, then that being without movement, and not presenting any appearance, culminates into [[Brahman]]. Resting in itself, calm, with Nirvana, indescribable, highest happiness, unborn and one with the unborn knowable, omniscient they say. No creature whatever is born, no origination of it exists or takes place. This is that highest truth where nothing whatever is born.
|Gaudapada Karika|3.46-48, Translated by RD Karmarkar&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n83/mode/2up Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast to Renard's view,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}} Karmarkar states the Ajativada of Gaudapada has nothing in common with the ''Śūnyatā'' concept in Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n45/mode/2up/search/ajativada Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages xxxix-xl&lt;/ref&gt; While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, states Comans, their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of "Brahman, [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Turiya" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}

===In Shaivism===
''Sunya'' and ''Sunyatisunya'' are concepts which appear in some [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] texts, such as the [[Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra]], which contains several verses mentioning voidness as a feature of ultimate reality - [[Shiva]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Absolute void is Bhairava who is beyond the senses and the mind, beyond all the categories of these instruments. From the point of view of the human mins, He is most void. from the point of view of Reality, He is most full, for He is the source of all manifestation."&lt;ref&gt;Jaideva Singh, Vijnanabhairava or Divine Consciousness: A Treasury of 112 Types of Yoga, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The yogi should concentrate intensely on the idea (and also feel) that this universe is totally void. In that void, his mind would become absorbed. Then he becomes highly qualified for absorption i.e. his mind is absorbed in the absolute void (sunyatisunya)."&lt;ref&gt;Jaideva Singh, Vijnanabhairava or Divine Consciousness: A Treasury of 112 Types of Yoga, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a series of Kannada language texts of [[Lingayatism]], a Shaivism tradition, ''shunya'' is equated to the concept of the Supreme. In particular, the ''Shunya Sampadane'' texts present the ideas of [[Allama Prabhu]] in a form of dialogue, where ''shunya'' is that void and distinctions which a spiritual journey seeks to fill and eliminate. It is the described as a state of union of one's soul with the infinite Shiva, the state of blissful moksha.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Schuhmacher|title=The Encyclopedia of Eastern Philosophy and Religion: Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Zen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpP8770qVakC |year=1994|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-0-87773-980-7|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vaishnavism===
''Shunya Brahma'' is a concept found in certain texts of [[Vaishnavism]], particularly in [[Odia language|Odiya]], such as the poetic ''Panchasakhas''. It explains the ''Nirguna Brahman'' idea of Vedanta, that is the eternal unchanging metaphysical reality as "personified void". Alternate names for this concept of Hinduism, include ''shunya purusha'' and ''Jagannatha'' (Vishnu) in certain text.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chittaranjan Das|title=Bhakta Charana Das (Medieval Oriya Writer)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QowAAAAMAAJ |year=1994|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-7201-716-3|pages=9, 101–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both in Lingayatism and various flavors of Vaishnavism such as ''Mahima Dharma'', the idea of ''Shunya'' is closer to the Hindu concept of metaphysical ''[[Brahman]]'', rather than to the ''Śūnyatā'' concept of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"/&gt; However, there is some overlap, such as in the works of Bhima Bhoi.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA388 |year=2010|publisher=Penguin  |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=388–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhoi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bettina Bäumer (Translator)|title=Bhima Bhoi, Verses from the Void: Mystic Poetry of an Oriya Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNnhSAAACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Manohar Publishers |isbn=978-81-7304-813-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vaishnavism]] of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], the idea of Shunya [[Brahman]] or Shunya [[Purusha]] is found in the poetry of the Orissan [[Oriya literature#Age of the Panchasakhas|Panchasakhas]] (Five Friends), such as in the compositions of 16th-century [[Acyutananda]]. Acyutananda's ''Shunya Samhita'' extols the nature of Shunya Brahman: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''nāhi tāhāra rūpa varṇa, adṛsha avarṇa tā cinha.''&lt;br /&gt;
''tāhāku brahmā boli kahi, śūnya brahmhati se bolāi.''

It has no shape, no colour, &lt;br /&gt;
It is invisible and without a name&lt;br /&gt;
This Brahman is called Shunya Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;Acyutānanda, ''Brahma Saṃhitā'', translated by Patnaik, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Oriya literature#Age of the Panchasakhas|Panchasakhas]] practiced a form of [[Bhakti]] called Jnana-mishrita Bhakti-marga, which saw the necessity of knowledge ([[Jnana]]) and devotion - [[Bhakti]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
